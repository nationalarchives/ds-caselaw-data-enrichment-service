C is a teenager. C has made sexual abuse allegations against three of the parties in this case.  She, in fact, is already the subject of a full care order made in July 2013, but has more recently been rejoined as a party for the purposes of these proceedings. She is represented by her guardian, Ms King.</p>

He is the 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> respondent.  Finally we have a 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> respondent:  V.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.80in;text-indent:0.5in">The local authority seeks findings of very serious sexual abuse by father of his daughter, C, and his stepdaughter, T, and by B and V of C alone.  There are also other findings sought to which I shall refer later.  All allegations are robustly denied by the father, mother, B and V.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.80in;text-indent:0.5in">Normally the task of the court in considering whether serious child abuse allegations are proved is one which is sadly but routinely undertaken across the jurisdiction each week of the year.  The fact that the evidence alone in this case has lasted 19 days, and that nine of the ten parties are represented by both leading and junior counsel, indicates that the instant task is not straightforward.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.80in;text-indent:0.5in">From a conventional beginning in front of HHJ Davies at the Luton County Court, the case has taken unprecedented twists and turns with the intervention of the Court of Appeal, a re-hearing in front of myself, and the collapse of that re-hearing after three days in the most dramatic manner.  This occurred when a key social worker in the case contacted me directly by email through the court office to allege ‘corruption and malpractice’ within the local authority in relation to this particular case    as well as other cases.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.80in;text-indent:0.5in">Following what was effectively a whistle-blower email sent to myself, the local authority sought to abandon the fact finding hearing and withdraw all allegations, saying that it could no longer rely on the key social worker as a witness of truth.  The local authority’s counsel, Mr. Bain, withdrew from the case for professional reasons.  Fresh counsel were then instructed; they withdrew the application by the local authority to abandon the proceedings, and thus these have continued ever since. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.80in;text-indent:0.5in">The proceedings have been surrounded by suspicion and mistrust, for reasons which have become obvious.  These emotions have been shared, it must be said, at times by the court, and have been exacerbated by serious problems about disclosure.  Despite strict orders made by the court for full disclosure by the local authority, these have not been complied with in full.  Indeed, more than 1,300 pages of important material were disclosed to the court during the current hearing, and 1,000 pages of these were disclosed only in the second week of this hearing, after Mr Geekie for the local authority organised a search of its premises following a social work assistant’s evidence.  This failure to disclose added some three days to the case. Disclosure continued even into the fourth week of this hearing.  Furthermore, many important documents have been shredded or are still missing. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.80in;text-indent:0.5in">According to the lead social worker there were six, not four, ABE interviews of the child, C, as contended by the police and the local authority. Indeed, there is even the suggestion that an alleged meeting on the 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2013, reported by social workers to have happened, may not have taken place at all.  The court therefore has the unenviable task – unparalleled in the history of this particular tribunal – of deciding how many ABE interviews there were, and whether one meeting ever occurred.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.80in;text-indent:0.5in">So much has gone wrong in this case. In fact, almost everything that could have gone wrong has, almost to the point of defying credulity. In consequence the court has no choice but to undertake the arduous task of scrutinising all aspects of the case very carefully.  This judgment will therefore be longer than would normally be the case. This is for several reasons:</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.80in;text-indent:0.5in">Normally at this stage of the judgment the court would give a definitive chronology of the case but this is impossible; so much is disputed.  As there is so much conflicting evidence to assess, the history of the case which I shall now outline will be skeletal in parts where events are disputed, particularly where they relate to purported allegations.  Matters not in dispute will be outlined in more detail.  Later, as part of its findings, the court will have perforce to assemble the full and accurate chronology.  </p>

Unfortunately he now suffers from poor health which has undoubtedly been exacerbated by these proceedings.  Over the years the mother has preferred traditional maternal duties caring for her children and one stepchild. The mother and father, neither of whom have any previous convictions, nor the advantages of education or riches, have brought up their children with little, and certainly no relevant, local authority intervention, at least until the end of 2012.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.80in;text-indent:0.5in">In May 2012 C self-harmed at school.  Then from September 2012, according to her teachers, she continued from time to time to self-harm at school. In addition she made increasingly frequent allegations that the father was being violent and threatening towards her at home, and that her older brother, S, was also threatening her.  She said that she was beating up her brother and wanted to kill herself. Eventually C was alleging that she had been beaten up at home virtually every day. She was also making alarmingly macabre drawings, and writing notes in which extreme unhappiness was expressed.  All this took place at school.</p>

She also wrote that she had hurt her siblings. She would also show, from time to time, signs of extreme reluctance to go home at the end of the school day.  Most regrettably, with one or two exceptions, the various teachers did not keep records of dates when C made allegations or when she self-harmed.  The school was satisfied that, despite allegations by C of repeated violence at home, they never saw any marks on her that could be attributable to any incidents in her home.</p>

The following day the school made a child protection referral to the local authority. This was an entirely appropriate course of action. A social worker spoke to C.

As the determination of these allegations would add little or no extra time to the proceedings, because they were so serious, and because the court believed they might assist in the assessment of the credibility of the witnesses, the court insisted the allegations should be articulated in the correct form and added formally to the schedule of allegations to be proved.</p>

Secondly, comparisons between the children’s presentation, when they would have been at their lowest ebb, following their removal from their home and months of anguish about their prospective removal, and the present, would not help the court in making the findings sought. Thirdly, it is undeniably the case that the children have been placed in households with more one-to-one attention and greater material benefits than those of their parents.

She said, “I know he smacked her bottom, but this did not cause her emotional harm”.   She said that she still kept an open mind about the truth of the allegations, and she was prepared to end her marriage of many years if she was satisfied that the father had abused C. She went on, however, to make it quite clear that she did not have an open mind, and in fact disbelieved the allegations.  She also insisted that, although she accepted the finding of the court in this respect, she did not take D to the grandparents’ home, as HHJ Davis found, an allegation which remains unappealed. In this respect the court is satisfied that she was being untruthful.

There would be disagreements with her brothers and sister about tidying up her room or doing the washing up, normal family issues.  She was always talking; they just could not keep her quiet, he said, save at family gatherings.  He described her as a “happy kid”, playing football and going out.  She was helpful, she was cheery, she liked to help me with the grass cutting and repairing the car.  She drew bright, happy pictures at home. When further questioned, however, he freely volunteered behaviours which were very worrying. He described how she could become angry and could have a go at the other children and punch walls at home.

They talked to her many times about the self-harming, but C always became angry, accusing the school of lying. Towards the end of 2012 A told him C was self-harming once more, and he believed this.

The children wanted things, but the family could not afford them. Despite this, even by the end of 2012 C was still bubbly and fine at home. There were, however, problems at school. The Mother had first been made aware of the self-harm in May 2012. There was no inkling of such behaviour before that. She received a call from the school and talked to C when she returned home. C denied self-harming and when she examined her she could find no marks on her body:  “She showed me her arms and there was not a single mark on them” she said. In the autumn of 2012 the school reported that C was self-harming.  </span>

	      <span style="text-decoration:none">. She is a teaching assistant at C’s school.  She is clearly a sensitive and somewhat fragile personality.  The court was told that when originally asked to make a statement she had broken down in tears and said she was afraid of giving evidence.  Before the incident hearing she asked if she could give evidence behind screens so that she would not have to see the mother, the father, B and V.  This was not because any of them had ever threatened or intimidated her.  Indeed, she had met only the father out of the four, and in entirely amicable circumstances.  It was made clear by Mr Geekie for the local authority that she needed the screens because she herself had a troubled history including self-harm, and would find it very difficult to give evidence unless screened from these four people.  As the court wished to obtain the best evidence, it eventually acceded to this unusual request by the local authority. (In fairness to Miss G and other witnesses, the court can understand that giving evidence in a large court in the Royal Courts of Justice in front of a large number of persons must be a considerable ordeal.)</span>

Having left court she apparently stated that she did not wish to return, but was persuaded eventually to do so by a solicitor assisting the local authority.  All in all she came over to the court as a kind, well-meaning, gentle person, not resilient, somewhat easily shocked, easily upset, rather naïve and extremely needy.  I mention this because of the relevance of these traits to how she coped with C’s allegations and to the nature of the relationship between teacher and pupil.</span>

He would also threaten her with knives.  Her older brother would also threaten her if she did not ‘sell fags’ for him.  Friends would also ring her and threaten to kill her.

Thus she did not keep notes of conversations when sexual abuse was discussed. Of the hundreds of conversations she had with C perhaps fewer than dozens were actually about being hit.  Curiously, in her oral evidence, she said C did not very often say that she had been hit at home which seems to contradict what Miss G is recorded as alleging elsewhere.

Despite the child’s allegations she had never seen any bruises or marks of any sort attributable to any sort of violence in the family home.  Once she had seen C limping and holding her side but had not seen any marks.  Once C said she had a bruise on her knee from an injury caused at home, but Miss G had not seen such a bruise. Like many other pupils, C played sport and changed into her sportswear on occasions, giving opportunities for injuries to be noticed.

The reality is that these parents, battered and bewildered by all that has happened during the past two years, are desperately clinging to the happy memories they have of C.  The court is satisfied that in that part of their evidence they were not deliberately lying in voicing their sepia-tinted memories of what C was like.  The court is satisfied that there were indeed happy times at home as well in 2012. Certainly, there is no evidence that her behaviour there was anything like as alarming as her behaviour at school; that is demonstrated by the fact that she does not seem to have been self-harming at home. </span>

C was told by Miss G that she herself had self-harmed and this was because of her father.  The court cannot be certain whether this conversation preceded C's self-harm or not but, on the balance of probabilities, the court is satisfied it came after the May self-harming and in response to that.  This conversation had a huge impact on the impressionable C. C found that, in contrast with life at home, at school she was now the centre of attention, particularly with Miss G and Miss Z.  By self-harming she was doing the same as the one she idolised.  By making allegations against her father, she was becoming even closer to her through what she considered to be shared experiences. The more she made allegations about life at home, the more attention and fuss the other teachers made of her.  She seems to have been speaking to her teachers up to three times a day and more.  She had, perhaps, for the first time in her life become, in her own eyes, someone of importance. In short, there was every incentive for her to make up allegations.</span>

	      <span style="text-decoration:none">Miss G took C’s allegations very seriously, was upset by them and, most unfortunately, revealed that she was upset by them.  This allowed C to comfort Miss G, to write poems to her to manipulate her teacher's emotions.  It was a very damaging relationship in the sense that there was a role reversal.  The pupil became the comforter of the teacher, not the other way round as it should have been.  This, too, gave C an enhanced status.  Miss G and the school should never have allowed this situation to occur.   </span>

	      <span style="text-decoration:none">C began to make allegations of physical abuse with increasing frequency by the end of the year.  It seems they became almost daily and increasingly dramatic. (It is regrettable that the teachers in the school do not seem to have kept precise records of all the dates, nor of precisely what was said on all occasions.  This was most lax of the school.)  I am also satisfied that C, with her intellectual limitations, did not foresee where her allegations of physical abuse were leading, namely, the formal involvement of the Local Authority.</span>

Marks made at home would surely have been there had her allegations of abuse at home been true.  Their absence shows that they were not. (In any event, the allegations of physical abuse have already been determined by the court by HHJ Davies in June of last year.  Those findings, looking at the Judgment, are limited to the father’s smacking C on her bottom when she was 13.  In the circumstances the court must, and does, proceed on that basis in relation to physical abuse, save of course in respect of fresh allegations.)  </span>

Only on the second day of this hearing were the court and the parties provided with copies of these.  The entries run to 122 pages in all and contain drawings as well as written entries.

They were never kept secret. If it is correct that the Local Authority knew nothing of them at a time when, as is undisputed, its social workers were seeing the teachers on an almost daily basis, then it should have done. Its failure to do so is inexcusable. It is incomprehensible that lines of communication between professionals were so poor that no social worker knew of their existence.</span>

The newly disclosed materials reveal a far more complex situation, however, including expressions of dislike for her school. The first entries are 14 pages from the exercise book. These start with apologies for misbehaviour and anger at school, and requests for help with her anger.  Miss G and Miss Z responded kindly, more than once saying they will always be around to help her.  In the case of Miss G she would be around for a chat at lunchtime.  Later Miss G wrote of ‘sessions’ with C   to help her with her anger.</span>

There are further messages to her teachers saying she ‘hated her family so much’ and she ‘hated everyone so much’.  She thanked her teachers and then said this, “Please would you go away now too” and that she wished she was dead.  The next messages are similar, but now C stated that she hated school too and no one cared about her.  It seems this message was meant for Miss G.  C said she was hurting herself because no one cared about her and everyone hated her.  She asked if Miss G could please help her.  Twice she said Miss G was like a big sister to her.

She was dismissive and disdainful of correct social work practice and the way the court operated.  She was liberal in blaming others for things that had gone wrong.  Apart from blaming the court (by inference both HHJ Davies and the Court of Appeal), she blamed the police, other members of the local authority, teachers at C’s school, the school itself for obstructing her,  (this was wholly unfounded), counsel for the parents and counsel for the guardian.</span>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.80in;text-indent:0.5in">As for SW’s contention that C alleged sexual abuse to a total stranger on this occasion, this is plainly mistaken. The police note of the same date specifically records that no sexual abuse was alleged. The application for an Emergency Protection Order dated the 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December and signed by the Local Authority’s Head of Legal services does not say that sexual abuse was actually alleged, only that C’s remarks ‘were suggestive of sexual abuse’. The notes made by SW after the conversation make no mention of sexual abuse. Her contention that a page of notes is missing, and that this page was before HHJ Davies in the earlier hearing, is simply ludicrous, for this would have meant that all counsel and solicitors, not to mention HHJ Davies, must have, unless through quite startling collective amnesia, willfully colluded in ignoring vital evidence during the hearing, and that the learned judge deliberately omitted mention of it in her judgment. It is also ludicrous to suppose that, when writing her notes in her car, SW wrote down relatively trivial allegations, but omitted to record the infinitely more serious accusation of sexual abuse. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.80in;text-indent:0.5in">The reality is that when one stands back and looks at what happened, one can see just how serious this situation was and is.  Based in part on, the Local Authority now sought and obtained the peremptory removal of C from her family on the 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th </span>December 2012, and the following day sought and obtained an Interim Care Order. In each case the tribunal notes show that the decision was made, in part, on the basis that C had alleged sexual abuse. The removal of children from their parents, especially without notice, is one of the most draconian actions any court can take. It strikes right at the heart of basic human rights, on family life; it is frightening and traumatic for the children involved, and profoundly distressing for parents and other family. Sadly, the courts are required from time to time to sanction such removal, but only when safety and urgency requires it. In making such urgent orders, the courts must rely on the accuracy of Local Authority evidence. Whilst they cannot know whether any allegation is true or false, the courts are entitled to be told the truth by Local Authorities as to whether such an allegation has been made at all. The Family Court and the child-care justice system cannot function if Local Authorities do not tell the truth about this, for justice will inevitably be perverted. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.80in;text-indent:0.5in">Responsibility for this cannot be laid wholly at the feet of one social worker. Others in the Local Authority must share responsibility, although, as I have said, on the evidence before it, the Court cannot and will not apportion this to particular individuals. The court freely acknowledges that all Local Authorities’ resources are over-stretched, and that social-work professionals are often alarmingly over-worked and under time pressures. Nonetheless, there should have been proper, efficient supervision of SW. Furthermore, the application for an EPO did not record an actual allegation of sexual abuse, whilst an application of the same date for an ICO did. With proper supervision and scrutiny this discrepancy should surely have been picked up by senior professionals at Luton Borough Council.  </p>

	      <span style="text-decoration:none;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">SWA ‘Y’ was a fairly punctilious note-maker, if sometimes after the event. It must be remembered that early in 2014 the court gave precise and copious directions for the local authority to disclose all the documents, records and notes concerning this family in its possession.  The local authority gave all assurances that this direction had been complied with in full.  It was on that basis that this hearing commenced.  To the astonishment of all in court, however, well into her evidence SWA ‘Y’ freely volunteered that all the handwritten notes she had taken were in a drawer at the local authority’s office.  She had kept copious handwritten notes and diaries, indeed, there were 15 books in all.  Everyone knew where they were. “It was obvious that the original notes were very important and should be kept”.  As a result of this counsel for the local authority immediately arranged for a representative to attend its offices to collect, if they were still there, the documents that had been mentioned by SWA ‘Y’.  </span>

Some other papers were found nearby. The court must emphasise that these documents should have been disclosed well in advance of this hearing.  It is truly reprehensible that they were not. In view of the speed with which they were recovered they could easily have been found had anyone either looked or asked the appropriate questions of SWA ‘Y’. For many months now the Local Authority has been fully aware of the serious issues in the case, and how full disclosure has been ordered, and re-ordered. Yet, self-evidently, it took woefully inadequate measures to comply with the order. In doing so it treated the court with what cannot be far short of contempt.</span>

From December 2012 until June or July, 2013 she said that she hated school.  At first she said this weekly or so, but less frequently as time went on.  In these early days she self-harmed ‘a lot’, as much as weekly, mainly after a bad day at school when she had quarreled with a fellow pupil.  She would harm herself by scratching with a paper clip or a blade from a pencil sharpener. This happened less and less now - since the beginning of this year only every few months. It occurred in June, 2014.  It had last happened only a fortnight before she came to give evidence, in early September, 2014. In January or February 2013 the foster-carer started finding excrement wrapped up in paper in C’s litter bin.  She did not mention this directly to C but she reported it to her fostering agency. In February or March 2013 C started attending CAMHS, the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services every three or four weeks, and was much happier now.  </span>

Nor that she, like the rest of her siblings, was terrified that they too would be suddenly taken away from their much-loved parents.

This was reported to the court as merely "happy".    As a young child s/he was entitled to have her/his wishes and feelings correctly reported to the court.   For a helpless young child's wishes and feelings to not be reported accurately is unacceptable. In the instant case K's wishes and feelings were part of the care plan submitted by the Local Authority when applying for care orders.  Courts are required to consider the wishes and feelings of children as part of the so-called welfare checklist.  S1 (1) (a) of the Children Act 1989 says this: ‘When a court determines a question with regard to the upbringing of a child, the child’s welfare shall be of paramount consideration.’ S 1 (3) continues: ‘in the circumstances the court shall have regard in particular to (a) ‘the ascertainable wishes and feelings of the child considered in the light of his age and understanding’ and (c) ‘the likely effect on him of any change in his circumstances’.</span>

To have wishes and feelings misrepresented in any way is not only a betrayal of the child concerned, but a body blow at the ability of the court to do justice to children and to carry out its judicial function.  The misreporting of the child’s wishes and feelings should certainly have been picked up by SWA ‘Y’ or, at the very least, if not by others at the Local Authority. </span>

He duly met her there. She was accompanied by S. She told him that she had something to say to him. Prudently, the father declined to speak to her without his solicitor, so said that any conversation should take place at court. They duly went over to the court, where his solicitor was not yet present. Nonetheless, SW put him and S together on the small landing outside the court foyer. SW stood close by, either just inside or just outside the glass-panelled door of the stairwell. S then alleged to him that he had been abused by an uncle.

According to SW, A was angry saying that C would pay for this and she would, “Smash her face in”.  P was nodding at that.

At first all the children were upset but it only took a short time for them to turn around.  Within ten minutes of leaving the mother’s home they were asking lots of questions and were in a very normal, stable mood asking whether they would be attending the same school and would be going out or whether they would have a television in their room.  She then went on to say that P was vocal and upset however when they got to the foster carer’s P said, “I think we’re going to like it here”. I should note at this point that in view of the general unreliability of the social work evidence, the court cannot know whether this description of the children’s behaviour is accurate or truthful, or whether the younger children even knew that they were leaving their parents, at the very least, for a long time.</span>

She immediately criticised the foster carer for what she said. If she had read this note, she would have told the foster carer to stop.  Any other social worker would have said the same if he or she had seen that note, for they were all keen to be positive in front of the children about the mother and father. The court rejects this assertion, being in no doubt that the foster carer’s views were drawn directly from SW’s views and those of SWA ‘Y’, and neither of these was ever positive about the parents to the child, or indeed to anyone else.</span>

I am satisfied that the transcript provided an accurate record of what she said. Despite the reason given for holding the interview, namely that C wanted to talk, and despite the fact that C talked about her father ‘touching her early on in the interview, the court’s strong impression is that C was, in fact, very reluctant to speak about abuse at all.  She was palpably distressed. (There are no records of the pre-interview discussions.) There were very long pauses before answers.</span>

After leading by the Detective Constable, she said she was touched at the front. Later, she said that her father touched her under her clothing everywhere. She was asked by the Officer, ‘Everywhere? So… was it…whereabouts…at the front was it? Or whereabouts in the front?’ C then said that it was “on the part for having babies”. She was then praised by the Officer, “Ok, that’s really good”. The leading questions about ‘the front’ were also followed later by “breast” being mentioned by C. (Until then there had been no allegation of touching the breast.) </span>

Just 72 hours later, on the 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October, according to the foster-carer, SW and CAMHS decided that C should be placed as an inpatient in a psychiatric unit at a hospital.  </p>

C was very reluctant to go; it took 45 minutes just to get her out of the car when they arrived.  They arrived about 5:30 in the late afternoon.  They were put in a room and they did not get to see a doctor until midnight.  According to the hospital notes, “She is reported to be the victim of severe emotional, physical and sexual abuse with a family member”.  The foster carer said the information in that note did not come from herself; it could have come from CAMHS. C did not want to stay at the hospital.  The foster carer had known she would not as she was not comfortable with new places and with strangers.  Even before they set out to the hospital, she had thought it was not a good idea. In view of the strength of C’s opposition, the admissions doctor refused to admit her, and in the small hours of the 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October, the foster care took C home.</p>

For a fragile child to be taken to a strange place to be seen by Doctors at midnight, to be told that she would have to stay there is in itself abusive and for what reason? The Court still has little idea as to why it was really thought necessary for C to be taken to the Hospital, to be left there as an inpatient if indeed she was, as the Court had been told by the Local Authority, thriving in foster care. True, she may have said she wanted to die, but she had been saying that or writing that sporadically for more than a year. What was the role of CAMHS? </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.80in;text-indent:0.5in">On the 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2013 the Court of Appeal set aside the findings of sexual abuse, giving full reasons on 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November. At the commencement of this hearing in September so far as the Court and all the parties were concerned there was no dispute that C had never been told of this. At directions hearings in 2014 C’s Guardian told the Court that she was unaware. Indeed, as I have noted, one of the reasons why the local authority decided not to call C to give evidence was that she was unaware of the appellate court’s decision and thus that the current proceedings concerned her in any way.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.80in;text-indent:0.5in">It therefore came as a considerable surprise to all in court when in oral evidence SW asserted that there had been a conversation when C was told of the Court of Appeal’s decision. Present was SWA ‘Y’, the foster carer and herself. When it was pointed out that there was no record in any note or narrative of this, she insisted she was sure that this had happened. The conversation had taken place shortly after the 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October, 2013. It was done lightly so as not to distress the child but even so C was exceptionally distressed when she was told. The meeting was at the foster carer’s home, “I strongly suggest it was there in the kitchen”. It was probably she, SW who told the child.  She then changed her evidence and said, “I don’t remember C’s reactions”. After telling C she did not set up any extra watch on her at the foster carer’s home, she said, nor did she tell the foster carer to be especially alert because there was an on-going watch by them on her in any event. However she said, “Of course, the school was told”. She did not recall whether she informed the school by telephone, email or letter but   said, “I definitely did inform them”.  She said she told CAMHS as well although CAMHS tends not to take notes.  She did not think she had told the general practitioner.  As she gave this part of her evidence her demeanour was distinctly truculent and indeed hostile.</p>

SW and SWA ‘Y’ had started discussing with her C’s need to find words for body parts. Both Social Workers knew that she was having these discussions, and believed that PO also knew that she was. None of those present saw anything wrong with these discussions, for each had convinced herself that C was not being pressured to do something for which she was not ready. She was unconvincingly vague, the court finds, in her assertion that these conversations took place only every 6 to 8 weeks. The court is satisfied that they happened much more frequently.</p>

The local authority through Mr. Geekie was profuse in its apologies that the card, although perfectly appropriate, had not been passed on by the local authority to C. Two matters flow from this. First, C embarked on her January interviews in the mistaken belief that, either her father had forgotten her birthday, or else he had not bothered to send her a card. Secondly, the local authority’s omission typifies the way it treated the father throughout.</p>

She and Miss Z were comforting her on that day, saying that no one was judging her.  C said she was very scared about telling things and had been told that she could talk to them if she wished to say anything. They took her to the library and asked what she wanted to say.  She then froze again and did not say anything for 15 minutes and then wrote down the word, “sex”.  The picture painted is as an extraordinary one: C sitting in the school library, the two doubtless expectant teachers in utter silence for 15 minutes.  15 minutes, the court notes is, a very long time, especially for a child and especially so in silence.  Astonishingly, Miss G then asked C, “Was it your dad who did this to you?” pointing, as she did so, to the word ‘sex’.  C then wrote down a second word, ‘Yes’. (The piece of paper with these two words is in the court papers.) Miss G asked this of the child because the father’s name had been mentioned before by others in relation to sexual abuse.  Also, ‘she had previously messaged me that her dad had touched her’. Miss G saw nothing wrong with the question nor considered it to be leading.  She had never been told not to ask questions, nor, if she did, what sort of questions should or should not be asked of a child alleging abuse.  She had received no training whatsoever about how to interview children.  </p>

This came rather abruptly after C had been talking of a world trip and wishing to see New York.  In Miss G’s words she, “Jumped the gun”.  She had never heard the child complain of V before or even mention him despite the close relationship between her and the child.  </p>

First, SW, together with SWA ‘Y’ and Miss G, met C at the school.  C apparently said she wished to do her ABE interview that day.    When asked whether it was appropriate for her, SWA ‘Y’ and Miss G to speak to C the day before an ABE interview, SW seemed reluctant to answer saying that she could not remember the context of the meeting. She generally made a number of excuses for its taking place. According to Miss G, when questioned by SW or herself, C gave slang names for various body parts including,  “The place where babies come from”. Although Miss G, at one stage, asserted that at this interview C was not questioned about the allegations, she later said that the group had indeed talked to her about her father and the allegations of hitting and touching.  Despite this, no one at this interview took any notes of what happened or what was said during the meeting. Miss G seemed utterly oblivious to any possible concerns about a vulnerable child with learning difficulties meeting with four people, three of whom with powerful personalities, and another of whom was a teaching assistant with whom she had a fixation.</p>

Miss G said that she had never been made aware that the child had also been shown dolls and pictures on a previous occasion.  The court also notes that at this point, namely January 2014, one of the foster carer’s notes records that C knew the slang for the body parts.  </p>

She said that all the Defence Counsel and Counsel for the Guardian were saying at Court that the Local Authority and the Police should get ABE interviews, “they heaped pressure on us about this. SWA ‘Y’ and I were fending off the pressure from the Barristers”. She said the Local Authority felt it was not right to do more ABE interviews but the Court itself pressurised for an ABE interview. She then retracted this last assertion. (I make it clear that never at any stage has this tribunal, which only became seized of the case after January ABE interviews, ever advised the Local Authority to arrange an ABE interview.

The purpose of the CAMHS, she said, was for a counsellor to speak to C to give her a non-pressured opportunity to talk freely about things. Interestingly, a note from CAMHS reads “Our views on the allegations of abuse? Cannot comment.  C has never spoken of it, aware of something bad in her head”. SW claimed to be aware by the time the January interviews took place that C had in fact been using her own words for body parts. Instantly she blamed the Court.  The first she knew about that was in Court today. If the Court was holding this information back she would want to know why.</p>

According to the notes, C was on the floor doing maths homework. She was wearing pyjamas.  The father penetrated her ‘where babies came from’.  It lasted two hours.  She knew it lasted two hours because she did maths homework at about 4 p.m. and she had a watch.  She looked at it when the rape finished and saw that it was two hours later.  The rape occupied the whole of the two hours. The officer asked, “Did sperm come out on that day?”  There was no answer.

From now on the court has had the benefit of a video recording and a transcript. The value however of the recording was, at times, reduced by the child’s face being obscured by a screen within the screen.  It is hoped that officers conducting ABE interviews do ensure that the child’s face is not obscured for all or part of any interview.

She was also upset on another occasion when she was 7 years old.  She was in B’s room playing on the X-Box or PlayStation.  Her father came in and sat on the bottom bunk bed for an hour.  He started beating her up.  The father then hit her with flip-flops which were like hard slippers.  This left marks on her arm and chest.  He always left marks on her. </p>

The social worker had visited the home in connection with allegations that she had been hit or beaten up.  An allegation which had something to do with her knee.  She said the father had hit her on the chest, side and arms leaving bruises on all these parts of the body. She also said the mother and father had arguments and would throw things at each other, and then take it out on the children, especially her.  The mother had also hit her before.</p>

It had happened with three different people.  C said that her father had come in and, “Did kind of the same things as when I was 6 and then beat me up”.  When asked what he had done C replied, “I don’t want to say”.  She then said, “He raped me.  He took my jogging bottoms and t-shirt off”.  </p>

C was then led to agree that B had raped her and beaten her and threatened her with a knife.  “You said “B’s done to you a couple of times what Dad’s done.  He’s beaten you and raped you, so which one of those?” asked the interviewer.  C then became very unhappy.  She was restless.  She tried to divert the conversation again and appeared very unhappy.  Eventually she went on to say that when she was 7 or 8 she had been playing on B’s PlayStation and he had been annoyed.  She then made it clear that she did not want to say any more.</p>

The child was restless, squirming at times.  She yawned.  She was clearly unhappy about the process.

In response to this she was told by the interviewer, “You’ve done well so far” and told that she was special.  In relation to B the social worker said this, “It’s important we know what he’s done as it isn’t right”.

The interviewer then began to ask the child what she understood rape to mean.  This got off to a somewhat shaky start when, bizarrely, the interviewer asked the child if she understood the meaning of the word “generic”.  Unsurprisingly this went over the child’s head.

As for the questions about V, this started when the interviewer asked bluntly, “Did V rape you?”  The child then said it was in the house of her brother’s friends, in the bedroom there.  She had been staying overnight.  She was on a blow up bed.  She had been to the lavatory and met V outside and he took her back to the bedroom and raped her.  She did not remember whether it was on the floor or the bed because it was dark.  (The court notes the lack of logic in her answer to that particular question.)  After it was all over she went next door and woke up her brother. </p>

They were accompanied at times, as I shall record in a moment, by long lectures.  PO was the interviewer.  The interview started with the child’s showing reluctance to talk about any abuse saying, “Basically what I said last time”.  PO then reminded the child about their previous talk when they had talked about what happened when she was 6.  She was unhappy, she was reluctant to talk.  She was silent on many occasions and there were long pauses.  She was squirming around on the sofa, occasionally leaning right back or to one side.  Very frequently she huddled forward with her head on her knees and her hood pulled over her head and a hand in a protective position over her head.     </p>

She also displayed a vivid imagination when she questioned the detective constable about whether she had had a child which had died.  She asked if that was why the officer did not want to have children so far.</p>

This was a two-week course at headquarters in 2012 and then two or three updating interview training sessions since then.  Although in terms of seniority and hierarchy, she clearly comes below PO, she came over to the court as possessing a strong personality, a tough personality an impression strongly reinforced by what the court has seen of her conduct during the ABE interviews with which she was involved.</p>

She said there were <marker name="tab"/>no strict guidelines about taking notes of what happened outside the actual formal recorded interview, this purely depended on the officer in the case.  There would usually be an unrecorded section of the formal ABE interview at the beginning when introductions were carried out and when the child was asked about his or her understanding of the difference between truth and lies.  Her instructions from her police force were not to record this part of the formal interview.  Later, she said there would be unrecorded “generic” conversations before interviews.  She had never seen any notes of discussions with C at the police station outside the formal recorded interviews being taken.</p>

She was told never to lead children but she said, “You can use questions in a funnelling process”.  She gave an explanation of what this meant but the court was, and still remains, wholly unclear as to what her definition of funnelling actually is.  According to her, C was the most difficult interviewee she had ever come across.  She knew that C was having therapy at CAMHS and that if a child is having therapy the police had to be very, very careful about their interviewing.  She was also aware that C had learning difficulties and it was the duty of the police to consider using an intermediary in the interview process.  She said that PO had made enquiries about using an intermediary.  She did not know what the child’s verbal IQ was nor that it was as low as 59 which, she agreed, was very low.  </p>

She was not aware that at the time of the interviews C already knew, and had done for some time, normal playground slang for body parts.  She agreed it would be quite wrong for adults to suggest words for body parts in any case.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">It is submitted by Mr. Storey that C underwent literally hundreds of interviews.  This is partly based on Miss G’s agreement that she had hundreds of interviews/discussions herself with C.  The court is satisfied that this is, in fact, an exaggeration.  The court must be cautious not to confuse spontaneous remarks made by a child or short informal chats with formal questioning.  Nonetheless, doing its best, the court is satisfied that the child has had no fewer than 33 interviews about abuse with one or other social worker between 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2012 and 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> January 2014.   By "interviews" I mean either formal interviews or detailed question and answer discussions which went beyond the odd throwaway mark, or the odd question and reply.  In addition, there appear to have been five similar discussions of a detailed nature with school teachers, seven with a foster carer and, of course, with Dr. van Rooyen and one with PO.   On top of this, there were four ABE interviews.  This makes, if the court's mathematics is correct, an alarming total of 51.  12 of them were conducted wholly by untrained interlocutors in the form of the foster carer and the school teachers, and the rest were professionals whose ability to follow guidelines seems to have been non-existent.  In addition, there can be no doubt that there were many, many other informal unreported conversations at school, in the foster home and when social workers brought C to and from school, which happened ‘99 per cent of the time’.</p>

As professionals working in the field of childcare, they should have intervened to stop the 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> and 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> January interviews.

At the bottom of this appear three lines, “Jack – missed one period.  Rose – missed two periods.  Given morning after pill not by mum or dad, wouldn’t say by whom.”  SWA ‘Y’s handwritten notes were, of course, only brought to court during the hearing. This note, which contains a summary of other matters said in the formal interview, has written across the top, the words, “Not typed, advised by police”.  It was then noticed that identical words appear at the top of her handwritten notes of the 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January.</p>

The first drawing has the name Rose next to it and then next to the drawing the words, “a baby.  I love you a lot.  I miss you xxx”.  The second drawing of a baby has the name Jack beside it as well as the other words I have just mentioned and the kisses too.  Accompanying these two drawings is a third sheet of writing paper with the words, “I miss you babies a lot.  I love you babies so much”.   Nine kisses then follow.  </p>

She said nothing when asked who the baby was in the second drawing.  PO than asked whether C wanted to tell her anything about the babies, and she said they were Rose and Jack, but would not say who they were.  She then started talking about ‘two days’ and ‘three days’, PO did not know what she was talking about. She asked C to give her the drawings, but C refused at first.  C then obliterated one word or phrase.  (The court has examined the drawing.  The word or phrase is still indecipherable.)  PO felt she was ‘invading C’s personal space’. </p>

This seems unbelievable, not least in view of the fact that as SWA ‘Y’ told the court, pregnancies and related topics had clearly been discussed with C and among professionals on several occasions after the 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span>. January interview. SWA ‘Y’ herself said that C made lots of references to babies she had lost after the interview. C told her the names ‘Rose’ and ‘Jack’.  She took it that C had, “miscarried two babies” and said, “This was from the information relayed to me”. Importantly, she then added, “but I knew this didn’t tie up with the timescales.  We had her medical records, we knew there was no reference to that”.  She said she was never shown a further note at the school dated 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> February 2014, “I have two baby but they have die”.</p>

This evidence is incomplete as C was unable to give further information at this point”.  She said she did not fill in this form herself; it had to be signed off by her manager, Dawn Smith.  The same document records later, “The issue of the pregnancies will require further understanding”. (Court’s italics.)

(The court notes, with growing exasperation by this stage, this is just another of many important documents in the case which are undated. This suggests carelessness if not negligence on the part of the local authority.)  SWA ‘Y’ agreed that she had typed this entry. She could not recall whether she was told about the ages of 10 and 11 on 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> January. She did have a couple of conversations with PO after 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> January, but in neither did they discuss pregnancies.  Nor did she discuss the pregnancies with C again, although the school note on 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February C was writing about losing babies.  She then changed her evidence, “I talked to C about the pregnancies after 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> January”.  She said she could not find the notes about this. They were neither in her cardboard box nor in the local authority’s system.  “I don’t know why there were no notes of this” she said. In this talk C had spoken of Jack and Rose.  She knew that these two were the names of the lost babies.  C had also said she had an on-off boyfriend who wanted to have a baby.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">A curious aspect of the pregnancy allegations is why the police kept no records of it whatsoever. IO ‘W’ agreed that records of pregnancies (at the age of 10 and 11) of concealed births or the morning-after pill constituted a very important set of allegations.  It was put to her that the allegations were either very serious or very ludicrous to which she replied, “I agree.  It needs investigating”. She accepted that it would have been reasonable to keep a note of such important allegations but then qualified this by saying, “But this wasn’t said in an ABE interview”.  Then she contradicted what she said at the start of her evidence, namely, that ABE interviews lasted between the arrival of the child at the police station and the child’s departure from the police station, by saying she would not have made a note of this allegation about babies as it was a private discussion. She was not sure whether that was a conscious decision by the police or the local authority to take the matter of the pregnancies no further.  She had no knowledge of such discussions.  She agreed that the issues of the pregnancies seemed to have disappeared into the ether.</p>

Nonetheless, the court is satisfied that either during a break or at the end of the 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> January ABE interview, C made drawings and said things which led the police and the social workers to believe that she was alleging that she had been pregnant twice when she was much younger, and had either born two babies or lost them for one reason or another. Their names were Jack and Rose. She had also been given the morning-after pill. We do not know precisely what C said because the note-taking was hopelessly inadequate. The allegations were and have been taken seriously, for allegations that C conceived twice were added to the schedule of findings to be sought during the currency of the present hearing. Yet these allegations seemed, as was put to IO ‘W’, to have disappeared into the ether until they were unearthed late in the day.</p>

So why was it that the first the court and the parties knew of this issue was during the hearing? Why did no social worker or police officer ever mention it? Why does it appear in no statements? The answer, regrettably, must be, not because the allegations were made outside a formal ABE interview, but because the local authority and the police realised only too well that they were ludicrous. They simply could not be true. They did not fit in with C’s medical records or the age when she attained puberty. </p>

She told the court that just a week after C went into care in December 2012 she visited the father and mother’s house.  An argument with raised voices was in full flow, involving the mother, S and J.  There were no children there. She was not sure if the father was there. They were talking about someone called V, of whom she had never heard before.  From what she recalled, C was said to have reported, the day after the incident, that V had touched her and hurt her between the legs.  This is the only description she heard ever used about the incident.  There was no mention of rape or sexual abuse. C had also apparently said that she had woken up S and J during the night, crying and saying that she wanted to go home. They had told her not to be so silly, and to go to sleep.

This was some ten months or so after the argument.  At first the name V meant nothing to her, until SW explained who he was and what C had alleged on the 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September.  She was adamant that in the call she never mentioned sexual abuse to SW - “just touching”… I never mentioned the words sexually abused or sexually assaulted”.  Nor did she recall telling SW that V had come back into the room, merely that C had reported she had been touched, and had given no other details.  Nor had she told SW that the mother had threatened to kill V.</p>

The mother’s sister explained this is because she did not, at the time, know which brother was alleged to have done the touching.

She defended the father when she spoke to SW on 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2013.  But SW had subsequently convinced her they must be true. She had told her that the father had definitely had sex with C.  Her enthusiasm convinced her.   “SW carried the day.’  The mother and she had fallen out because of this.  They had had no contact since July 2013, save that the mother had sent her a text at Christmas wishing her a happy Christmas.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">As to her relations with the father, she said she had not got on well with him during the time that she had known him.  They had never really been talkative with each other.  A few years ago after a Christmas and after a few drinks, she said the father tried to kiss her when they went to the shops.  She did not tell the mother, but S saw texts sent by the father saying how much he had always liked her and things like that.  The father was saying that she had been flirting with him and had tried to kiss him.  The mother was confused and did not know which of the two family members to believe.  The court makes it clear at this stage that it is insufficient evidence to determine who flirted with whom, if at all, at the time of this incident.  It took place many years ago, it is not one of the allegations I am being asked to determine and its relevance, if it has any relevance to these proceedings, must surely be limited.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">The court has considered very carefully the evidence of the mother’s sister. She impressed the court as a reluctant, but honest witness, doing the best she could to remember events which took place a long time before. The court is satisfied that she did overhear a conversation of sorts about a night spent by C at the parental home of V. There was indeed talk that C had been unhappy when she was away. This conversation took place in December 2012.  The court is satisfied the mother was lying when she denied that such a conversation had ever taken place. But the court is not satisfied, having heard the mother’s sister's evidence, that touching between the legs was actually mentioned during this conversation.  It may well have been heard later by her, and then interpolated innocently into her recollections.  It may have been that the mother’s sister was recalling a different conversation many months after the event, and eliding the two.</p>

The mother denies the conversations ever took place.  The evidence before the court is thus what the mother’s sister says mother said about what C had told her - double hearsay.   Even if the social worker's records of C's allegations about V are accurate - there seem to be inconsistencies in the story recorded at various times; different places are identified. In one, the rape took place in the bedroom occupied by S, and J In another version, it took place in a spare bedroom.  If the rape did indeed take place in the bedroom occupied by other persons, the court must consider the inherent unlikelihood of that.</p>

She appears to have been given alcohol for the first time so is very likely to have felt extremely unwell the following day.  But, on the balance of probabilities and bearing in mind the extraordinary pressure on C to make allegations of sexual abuse, the court cannot be satisfied on the evidence before it that V sexually abused C. </p>

In particular, she answered questions involving precise detail about the abuse without even pausing to think.  She said she recalled how when she was 11 or 12 her father had commented that she was now becoming a woman and that he wanted to measure her breasts.  She even recalled what the father was wearing at the time and what films she had just seen.  On one occasion when he abused her it was, “The Parent Trap” at the ABC cinema in Luton.</span>

	      <span style="text-decoration:none">On this date, the unfortunate C was languishing in hospital in a mental health unit. This did not deter her from interviewing the child at length in an interview which must have been quite appallingly distressing to her.  SW noted that:</span>

	      <span style="text-decoration:none">“I spent almost three hours with C [yet another three hour long interview, the court notes].  She was in a grim place.  She would/could not explain what made her so sad.  She said she wanted to go home and we talked this through.” At one stage C had asked for a rope and a room to hang herself. </span>

	      <span style="text-decoration:none">It was pointed out to her in cross-examination that three hours was a very, very long time for a child especially one with C’s learning difficulties and in fragile mental health. Furthermore, the notes of the interview were very, very short.  SW said that a lot of the interview was silence.  When it was suggested that C clearly did not want to talk at this interview, she said that she could not remember.  As for C’s request to go home, SW was dismissive about this.  C fairly frequently said she wanted to go home.  (The court notes that this flatly contradicted other assertions by her that she had only asked once or twice to go home.) There were also silences at CAMHS.  Once at CAMHS, C had also said that she wanted to go home but “They talked it through”.  (What is meant by that much repeated phrase the court is unaware.) As for the length of the interview, some three hours, far from being criticised for it SW said she should be praised for taking up so much of her time to deal with C.  She was working in her own time, even working at nights. </span>

SW was asked, “Did you tell her what T had said?”  Her answer is very significant, “I can’t recall what was said then”.  She then went on to say, “This was not a pre-ABE interview or an ABE interview”.

	      <span style="text-decoration:none">The court must be cautious when weighing the force of retractions. It is not uncommon for genuine victims to retract. There may be many, understandable, motives for this. Fear of reprisals and pressure by others are common examples. And in the case of T, the court is amply satisfied that some family members were putting pressure on T to retract, though not the parents.  Some of the pressure may indeed have contained threats. But just as the court must be wary of relying too heavily on retractions, so it must be cautious not to reject them out of hand merely because of pressure to retract. Retractions can be genuine even when they co-exist with pressure. Here we have so many retractions, all made at different times to different people - doctors, social workers, the police, a solicitor, friends and relations. Furthermore the court cannot forget that while T was being pressured to retract, she was undoubtedly being subjected to counter-pressures by SW to make allegations.</span>

	      <span style="text-decoration:none">For the avoidance of doubt, the court is satisfied that the two retraction letters reflected T’s true sentiments. Nothing sinister can be read into the fact that the letters were each written by another. T has learning difficulties. As for the other reasons given by T   in her oral evidence namely, that she was reluctant to speak openly to males, that her phone was hacked into, possibly by her husband, that she was reluctant to speak in his presence, these are wholly unconvincing. I am afraid that T was being very untruthful in this respect. The reality is that there were just too many retractions made by T to ignore. The court also takes into account the fact that T   has continued to see her parents since the accusations were made, and sought their help from time to time.</span>

	      <span style="text-decoration:none">These allegations cannot be viewed in isolation from the evidence relating to C. The court cannot compartmentalise, but must look at the evidence as a whole the court cannot be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the father sexually abused T. In coming to this finding the court does not ignore T’s   ABE, statement and oral evidence that abuse did occur. The court considers this most carefully, but it is out-weighed by the other factors. In addition to those recorded, the note takes into account two matters which seems inherently improbable. If the allegations were true, then the father must have abused T in a room where others slept – an act of considerable recklessness. Furthermore, C would have been only four or five years old at the oldest when the abuse occurred.  There must at the very least be some cogent doubt as to whether with her learning difficulties, she would have had a real memory, and in such detail, of what happened when she was so very young. </span>

	      <span style="text-decoration:none">Nor should it be forgotten that, sadly, T is herself very vulnerable. She bombarded T with texts and telephone calls, and put her under enormous pressure to make and in due course maintain the allegations. Just one example of this is text from SW telling her to stop being in denial. This did come from her, and was a shockingly unprofessional message to send. T undoubtedly believed that by making the allegations, she would retain the support of a powerful social worker who would support her. She must have been desperate, torn between pressure from her family to tell the truth and from SW to lie.  And so she hovered uncertainly between the two, retracting and reiterating allegations repeatedly. </span>

In view of the need for complete transparency in this case, I permitted the Guardian’s counsel at first to pursue this line of questioning being uncertain as to where it was leading.  I am now wholly satisfied, however, that this was leading to no destination which is relevant to the findings of fact which I am asked to determine during the incident proceedings.  HHJ Davies has made findings about abuse involving violence and they are limited findings.  They were not set aside by the Court of Appeal. No party has asked for them to be revisited.</span>

	      <span style="text-decoration:none">The court is concerned with the allegations on the composite Scott Schedule before me and they do not include any allegations of violence, save for one fresh allegation that the mother hit C with a rolling pin.  Exceptionally, I permitted this to be added to the matters remitted by the Court of Appeal for fresh determination because the allegation was a new one and had not been before HHJ Davies in June 2013.  That is the only allegation of violence I shall consider during the present hearing.  The only answer of relevance from T which resulted from questioning by the Guardian was that the mother would hit A and C on the back of the leg with a wooden spoon. Taking that into account, together with all the other evidence, I am wholly satisfied that the mother did not hit C with a rolling–pin.</span>

This was an extremely serious allegation to make.  It was based solely on three comments made by A during contact visits. As for grooming A , the contact notes record three occasions in which the following comments were made:</p>

That allegation has been determined.  In any event, the current allegation seems to the court worryingly vague.   It is not alleged, for example, that the parents have put the children in potential danger by leaving them unattended with either uncle or grandfather.  They do not seem to be criticised for doing any particular act at all, but rather for their state of mind.  They are criticised because they do not, in reality, have open minds about these two individuals, because they point out that the allegations against them have yet to be proved, because they believe that one is innocent until proved guilty.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.54in;text-indent:0.5in">The problem is that the allegations are, and I repeat, so hopelessly imprecise.  The court has no idea whether the allegations against the two other family members are true or entirely fanciful, whether they indeed pose a threat to children, or whether they do not.  The court does not know whether the parents are justified in their doubts about the allegations against grandfather and uncle - no idea whatsoever. Certainly the parents will be entitled to have doubts about any allegations in whose making SW had a role.  Equally, a wise, careful and prudent parent would not expose their children to any relation against whom allegations of sexual abuse were made.   Had the parents done anything to expose their children to risk, then the court would have little difficulty in finding this particular allegation is proved.  As it is, in the absence of any suggestion that the parents have failed to protect their children by any action or inaction, the court cannot make this finding.</p>

Valuable court time is taken up weighing such breaches against the evidence and of course, there is the risk that not only may false information be garnered in interview, but that genuine allegations may be so contaminated that they cannot be relied upon. Those who permit their employees to question children and vulnerable witness must therefore be certain that not only have they received the standard training but they understand what it means in practice.</p>

Yet the cost to the public purse in one form or another will be immense. There has been a significant disruption of court lists, with other cases being delayed. Family justice cannot perform the vital task it does in protecting children without honesty, objectivity, transparency and fairness. I thus hope that no court ever again has to see and hear what this court has seen and heard during the past weeks.</p>
