	      <span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:11pt"> July 2014, I have been dealing with the final hearing of a wife’s claim for financial remedy orders.  During the course of that hearing, I delivered an extempore judgment in relation to a discrete issue which arose in relation to the ability of the press to report the proceedings.   It is reported as </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond;font-size:11pt">Cooper-Hohn v Hohn </span>
	      <span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:11pt">at [2014] EWHC 2314 (Fam).  This is my judgment in respect of the main application.  The issues canvassed in the hearing were complex, involving both disputed issues of facts and law.  I heard submissions from leading counsel instructed on both sides to deal with aspects of publicity and tax, as well as the financial teams who were assembled to represent the parties.  Mr Martin Pointer QC with Mr Geoffrey Kingscote and Mr Stephen Brandon QC with Mr Oliver Marre appeared for the wife. Mr Lewis Marks QC and Miss Elizabeth Clarke represented the husband with Mrs Emma Chamberlain.   To both those teams I owe thanks for the meticulous and detailed preparation of their respective cases and the quality of the advocacy, all of which was of enormous assistance to me in reaching my decision on the issues with which I shall need to deal in this judgment. </span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:11pt">Given the complexities of the case, the written material before the court was helpfully contained within three core bundles.  Both sides produced detailed written skeleton arguments in opening and closing.  I had two full bundles of authorities before me in relation to the matrimonial and tax issues and a very helpful organogram showing how the husband’s business structure operated as between the various entities (both onshore and offshore) through which the wealth in this case has been created.  The only witnesses from whom I heard oral evidence were the husband and the wife.</span>

There are various aspects relating to computation with which I shall deal in due course.  However, those figures do not represent the full extent of the assets which have been generated by the husband’s commercial activities during the subsistence of this 17 year marriage.  In addition to the wealth which the parties hold personally, a further sum of US$4.5 billion has been channelled into a charitable Foundation which, through donations made to grantees in both the UK and the US (where there is a separate charitable Foundation), has achieved international recognition as one of the leading world charities in the fields (amongst others) of child poverty, HIV/AIDS and climate change.  It is known as The Children’s Investment Fund Foundation (or CIFF UK and CIFF US).  In this judgment, I propose to refer to these two limbs of the charity as respectively ‘the UK Foundation’ or ‘the US Foundation’.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:11pt">His case is that the wife should receive no more than one-third of the assets as they stood in April 2012 when the marriage effectively came to an end and one half of one third of the post-separation accrual which has been achieved since then.  In round terms, this would see her leaving the marriage with assets of c.US$350 million (c. £200 million on prevailing exchange rates at the date of trial), or some 25% of the currently available assets.  The wife seeks what she contends to be her entitlement to a full and equal share in what has been built up to date.  She brings her claims from the foot of substantial and valuable contributions which she claims match those made by the husband, even if they are different in kind and quality to his wealth creating function.  To seek to discount her 50% entitlement would, she claims, amount to clear discrimination in terms of the evaluation of those contributions.</span>

It has a bearing on the case and the issues which I have to decide because it provides some insight into their aspirations even in those early years.  The wife told me that when they first met, and before their relationship began, they had a conversation during which the husband had told her that he intended to make a great deal of money in his future career.  She told him that, if that was his sole objective in life, they had little in common and she was not interested in starting a personal relationship with him.  It appears that it took the husband some time to persuade her that there was a future for them together, but she was eventually convinced by what he told her of his own philanthropical leanings.  These had developed, as he told me, during his early twenties.  He had originally considered a career as a doctor.  During a visit to the Philippines, long before he met the wife, he had seen the abject poverty in which many of the children in that country were living their lives, often existing in ‘garbage dumps’.  It affected him deeply and he resolved to do whatever he could to alleviate that suffering if ever he should find himself in a position to do so.  He told me that he had persuaded the wife that, if he succeeded in creating sufficient wealth in the future, it was his intention to apply it towards philanthropical causes.

It was during this period that he developed and began to hone his ‘activist’ investment strategies.

Their eldest child was just 2 years old when the family expanded from three to six with the addition of two new daughters and a son.  Whilst she had some help from nannies who became ‘the extra pairs of hands’, it is difficult to conceive of a greater contribution to their domestic life during that period than the one which the wife was making.  Whilst the husband was no doubt a loving and devoted father to all four children, I have little doubt that the heavy demands of his own working days resulted in the wife having to shoulder the majority of the responsibility for their domestic and home life.  Whilst they were financially very comfortable by this stage as a result of the husband’s increasing remuneration from Perry Capital, I am entirely persuaded that this wife was a ‘hands on’ mother to each of their four children in the fullest sense of the word.  Whilst their children are now 15 and 13 years old respectively, it has to be remembered that for three years during this period, she was looking after four children under the age of 5 years.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:11pt">By the beginning of 2002, the husband’s accumulated wealth as a result of his work for Perry Capital over some seven years was such that these parties could have retired without either needing to work again.  On the husband’s evidence, he had by then accumulated wealth of about US$100 million.  The wife told me that she did not know the full extent of their personal wealth at that time and it was not a matter of concern to her.  They were still then in their thirties and parents to a very young family.  That independent wealth enabled this couple to take stock of life and decide where their future would take them.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:11pt">The husband’s evidence, which I accept, was that he then saw two options open to him.  The first was retirement; the second was to raise money for charitable purposes through an independent fund.  Neither of the parties appeared to have had any interest in increasing the extent of their personal wealth. As the husband told me, his life has never been motivated by money.  Whilst that remark has to be seen in the context of the security of the wealth which he had by then created for his family (the scale of which is not available to most), I accept that the fundamental driver behind this husband’s continuing success has never been the accretion of vast personal wealth.  Whilst it is clear that this couple lived a life which was free from financial constraint in beautiful homes of their choosing, I am entirely persuaded that neither has pursued a materialistic lifestyle involving discretionary spending at a level which would certainly have been available to them.  On the contrary, they are quintessentially an intensely private couple and family life has always been lived modestly and away from the public gaze.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:11pt">Whilst the husband was working at Perry Capital, he decided to start a Foundation which was originally called ‘the C H Foundation’.  This is what has since evolved into the main UK Foundation and its US counterpart.  The C H Foundation was incorporated on 8 February 2002. It was registered as a charity the following month.  In January 2004, its name was changed to The Children’s Investment Fund Foundation (UK).  The three original members were the husband, the wife and one of their friends and business associates, Marko Lehtimaki.  (Including the husband and wife, there are now on the board seven trustees comprised of ‘serious industry heavy weights’ from the world of commerce and finance.) Part of the original investment in the US Foundation appears to have flowed from a significant donation which had been made by Perry Capital in 2002.  That donation was made at a time when the husband was still formally under a contract of employment, albeit that his sole contractual entitlement at that time was the payment of a salary.  The wealth he had by then created had been built up from years of receiving very substantial discretionary and performance-based bonuses.  Whilst I do not know the precise detail of the route by which that money was diverted to the Foundation as opposed to the husband, it is probable, as he himself accepted, that there was a good chance or likelihood (as he put it) that, absent such diversion, the monies would have been paid to him despite the absence of any strict contractual entitlement.  It appears from the husband’s evidence that the owner of Perry Capital was enthusiastic about the idea of benefitting the US Foundation and was happy to channel funds in this way </span>

The Settlor was Sarah Mudho, the New York attorney instructed by the husband.  The wife was named as one of the original three trustees (there are now four).  Its name was officially changed to ‘The Children’s Investment Fund Foundation’ on 28 May 2003 (‘the US Foundation’).  The husband does not appear to have been a trustee either at this point in time or subsequently.  The wife maintains (and the husband appears to accept) that this was a deliberate decision taken in the interests of tax efficiency to avoid any adverse fiscal implications for the UK Foundation. There is an issue between the parties as to whether, in subsequent years, the wife (who is Chairman of the board of trustees) has been actively opposed to the husband’s appointment as a trustee of the US Foundation, but these are matters to which I shall return later.</span>

The US Foundation is now what the wife describes as the ‘little sister’ to the UK Foundation.  It is the UK entity which reviews all proposals for grants and selects which grants to make.</span>

The new venture which TCI represented was what the husband describes as a ‘clean break’ from Perry Capital.  It was not in any sense a lateral move with a core supporting team.

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:11pt">It is important to distinguish between the TCI Fund (or Master Fund as it is sometimes referred to in the papers) and the charitable Foundations.  Whilst their names are similar, they are entirely separate entities.  The TCI Fund investments and the TCI Group of corporate entities are matrimonial assets.  The charitable Foundations are entirely non-matrimonial.  Whilst the funds held by each have been generated in the main by donations made over past years from the TCI Fund, neither of the parties has any beneficial interest whatsoever in those funds.  The assets of both the US and UK Foundations are exclusively charitable and entirely external to the resources over which I can exercise any statutory jurisdiction under the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973.   That said, one of the key features of this new investment fund was its direct link to the UK Foundation and the philanthropic causes it was to support.  The investors who were invited to join TCI were identified because of their willingness to invest on the basis of a clear contractual agreement that the Foundation would receive a percentage of the performance and management fees generated by TCI (the private investment fund).  In this way, the success of the fund was directly linked to the sums which would flow into the Foundation.  The investors were persuaded to agree to significantly longer lock-up terms than were then ‘industry standard’ on the basis that an element of the returns they would see from the husband’s management of those funds would go directly to philanthropic causes.</span>

In 2008, at a time when he was drawing c. US$3 million from TCI, a further US$500 million was allocated to the Foundation.  Aside from the funding which it has received from TCI over the ten years to 2012, there has never been any external funding injected into either Foundation.  The phenomenal growth over the years in the underlying investment capital is the result of the successful performance of TCI and the funds under management.  In April 2009, management of the Foundation’s investments was transferred to a separate corporate management entity (‘Talos’) which has since that date administered the charitable portfolio.  Talos is an Irish company which has a UK sister entity.  Following the global financial crisis in 2008, the Talos entities were created as subsidiaries to the Foundation and they now hold the charitable investment portfolio which is designed to give the Foundation a regular return in the form of an income stream.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:11pt">Because the husband’s rates of return are achieved in part as a result of his decision to invest in high risk / high return opportunities, he needed a platform of financial stability from which to operate.  When he launched TCI, he was the first hedge fund manager in Europe to persuade investors to lock in their funds for up to five years without the ability to withdraw their investments before the end of that period.  Initially, it appears that some two-thirds of the value of the Fund was made up of the five year share class, with the remainder locked in for three years.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:11pt">After the global financial crisis in 2008, the husband found it much more difficult to persuade investors to lock up their funds for such extended periods.  He therefore created new share classes to entice back the funding.  The result is that the Fund now has far greater liquidity than in its first five years of operation with almost 50% of the underlying investments in a share class which permits investors to exercise quarterly redemption rights.  That he was able to bring the funds back in is clear from the results achieved in subsequent years.  Each agreement with the Fund’s individual investors contains a ‘key man’ clause whereby, in the event that the husband should cease his involvement in the management of the Fund, each and every investor is entitled to withdraw its funds after four months with the potential thereafter for the Fund to be liquidated and wound up.</span>

You identify dramatic change within a company, and that can be both public and private, and the most extreme and public examples of activist investments that I made were ABN Amro Bank listed in the Netherlands, where I bought 1% of the shares and put a motion on the Annual General Meeting for the bank to put itself up for sale and be sold.  The management said, “You should go to hell”.  I said, “Well, it is my legal right.  You have been underperforming.”  70% of the shareholders voted for my motion and the Bank was sold for US$100 billion, virtually all cash, in a hostile break-up by three financial institutions, and the [TCI] Fund made US$1 billion on that investment.</span>

This is the other aspect of it.  It is incredibly concentrated investing.  Most funds would invest 1% in 100 ideas and say we are very diversified.  We take the opposite approach.  Our core investments might be seven to ten ideas.  So, at the start of 2013, post-separation, I identified Airbus, one of the world’s largest makers of commercial airlines, as an activist investment idea.  Because it was being privatised and I thought we could push change harder, we made a public proposal (which was front page of the Financial Times in 2013) for the company to sell off a division which was accepted as a sale by the board publicly.   They accepted our advice and they accepted our recommendations to buy back shares, and huge change occurred in the company.  But I put 18% of the [TCI] Fund in it – 18%.

I would say that at any time you get in the range of US$5 to US$10 billion of assets, it starts to become problematic which is why we put a policy for the last few years of no subscriptions greater than redemptions overall.  So there might be small variations month by month within a particular year, but we capped …. the new capital we would take with a formal rule and we are now actively discussing return of capital to people, return of profits.

Over 80% of the TCI Fund is held by third party investors. The husband personally owns about 16%, either directly or through other entities, although he owns 100% of the shares in the Group.  The husband’s investment in the TCI Fund is worth in excess of US$1.2 billion in round terms.  This is held either in his own name as a personal investment, through UK companies or through various Jersey entities. A UK company, TCI Fund Management Ltd, is also the corporate partner in the UK LLP (The Children’s Investment Fund Management (UK) LLP), which has a total of 17 partners including the husband and the trading subsidiary of the UK Foundation.  It is this entity which (through Talos) manages the US$4.5 billion of assets for the Foundation, alongside the investments of the husband and the other partners. </span>

The structure has been set up to enable global investors to elect the most tax efficient route for the investment of their particular funds.  As referred to earlier in this judgment, the Fund has a number of different share classes and partnership interests which determine both the fee structure and the lock in period.  The Master Fund, which is based in the Cayman Islands, is not controlled by the husband or any entity controlled by him.  Rather, it is under the independent control of its three directors (of whom the husband is one).  The board operates as an independent board, notwithstanding the significant stake which the husband has in the Fund.  In theory, at least, it could dispense with the services of the UK LLP which acts as the Investment Manager, albeit that this is as unlikely a scenario as one could imagine in present circumstances, given the returns which the husband is producing for the investors.  It is also relevant, in my view, that the husband is required contractually to retain significant amounts of his own capital within the Fund so as to ensure his alignment with and commitment to the other investors.</span>

Up to one billion people in the poorest parts of the world live with ongoing infection caused by water-borne and ground-transmitted parasites.   The Foundation is now halfway into the second year of a five year national school-based de-worming programme for Kenya, undertaken in conjunction with the national government, to treat and prevent re-infection in over 5 million school-aged Kenyan children.  As the wife told me, that initiative has led to a 25% increase in school attendance.  She attended a conference at Davos and was asked to work closely with the Kenyan Prime Minister with whom she sat on a panel which committed to a national programme.  Through the Foundation, she has worked with the Gates Foundation and others and it has now committed US$50 million to a systematic de-worming programme.   To implement this strategy, she has had to work at government level and has built relationships with the Kenyan government which have resulted in a new programme of neonatal nutrition in that country.</span>

We were shocked when they said Zimbabwe, it was an incredibly difficult political time.  It was at the height of the Mugabe issues but that is where they felt they had their best team.

I give these particular examples as solid evidence, which I accept, of both the degree of commitment and the level at which the wife was working for the Foundation.  Whilst she does not claim to have had any involvement in the generation of wealth which made these various projects both feasible and capable of delivery, she was, as I find, wholly committed to the principles and ideals of the Foundation.  That commitment translated into many hours of (unpaid) work both in terms of overseeing strategy and building relationships with stakeholders and partners in the various projects which were undertaken by the Foundation.</span>

As the husband was to tell me during his oral evidence, the Foundation was not achieving its full potential and the board of trustees (which included both the husband and the wife) was becoming increasingly frustrated by the limited amount of money which was going out compared to the vast scale of its underlying resources.  By 2012, the Foundation had grown out of all recognition from its relatively modest beginnings and both parties agreed that neither had ever contemplated the exponential growth in its potential financial reach and influence. (The wife described it to me as ‘a fairy tale’ compared with their earlier ambitions for the Foundation.)</span>

It is a widely respected body which is closely affiliated to the well-known management consultants, Bain &amp; Co.  The point at which Bridgespan was consulted in 2012 coincided with the period during which the parties’ marriage was breaking down.  By the time Bridgespan presented its report to the Board of Trustees in April 2012, the situation between the husband and wife in their respective roles of co-trustees appears to have become untenable.  A meeting was scheduled for 5 April 2012 to discuss the results of the diagnostic phase of Bridgespan’s work.  By that stage, the wife had issued her Petition seeking dissolution of the marriage, although it had not then been formally served on the husband.</span>

I am told that there is likely to be some resolution of the issue in November 2014.  There have clearly been tensions generated in no small part as a result of these ongoing divorce and financial proceedings.  I am aware from the evidence which was put before me that there have been discussions about the possibility of diverting funds from the UK Foundation into the US Foundation (or another charitable entity) which might be designated as a separate charity which the wife might represent.  I am similarly aware that such a ‘split’ is not supported by the husband because of the potential conflict which he sees with the best interests of the UK Foundation.  As things stand, she retains effective and sole control over the US Foundation and its underlying assets of US$140 million, although she acts in concert with the US Board of Trustees.  The husband is not (and appears never to have been) a trustee of this ‘sister’ Foundation, despite his requests to become one.  It is his case that the wife has been deliberately obfuscating and blocking his appointment to the US Board.  In this context, he has had to enlist the support of the other US Trustees who do not appear to have raised any material objection to his appointment.  The wife’s case is that the husband was never interested in a formal appointment to the Board because of tax sensitivities (not for himself but for the UK Foundation).   I need say nothing further about these matters.  As I have already said, neither party is suggesting that the assets held for the benefit of the two Foundations are ‘matrimonial’ resources which fall for division in these proceedings, despite their provenance.  </span>

Far from a strict delineation of their respective roles as ‘wealth creator’ and ‘Foundation front woman’, the husband’s case is that he has been intimately involved from the outset with the work of the Foundation.  He told me that he worked full-time for the Foundation in three different roles.  First, in the context of his overall contribution, he has been the benefactor of US$1.6 billion of funding which has been transposed into US$4.6 billion of assets through his investment work.  Secondly, he sits as one of three board members in which capacity he selects and oversees the work of the trustees.  In this context, I have already referred to the financial ‘heavy weights’ who now act as trustees.  He is one of those trustees and, in that capacity, has a central role (with the wife) in reviewing and evaluating all the investment grant proposals received by the Foundation.

When he was asked about the split of funding between climate change projects and its work alleviating child poverty, he was able to explain immediately that, of the US$25 million a year in grant commitments made by the Foundation, some 75% has been diverted towards work with children and the balance to climate change and related projects.  He was also able to tell me about the specific ‘segments’ which are funded under the umbrella of the Foundation’s work with children, such as nutrition, HIV/AIDS and the like.  To this extent, I accept that he was, and is, fully invested in the operation of the Foundation in all senses of the word.  That he had a specific, and separate role, as the wealth creator via the TCI Fund does not, in my view, detract from his personal investment in the Foundation.  Inevitably, there has been a degree of elision between those two roles.  It is an inescapable fact that the husband’s (and, thus, the wife’s) personal wealth has grown and compounded as a result of his direct and indirect investment in the TCI Fund.  But I accept that his (and her) primary motivation has never been the creation of further personal wealth of the magnitude which this couple might have enjoyed had fees not been diverted to the Foundation.  If this was the case, I would now be dealing with a division of personal wealth of some US$6 billion.</span>

However, it emerged during its course that at some stage the wife had engaged the services of an expert to advise on the value of the TCI management entities.  (No allowance for anything other than the underlying value of the investment assets had been made in any of the earlier presentations of the husband’s financial net worth.) Although the report was disclosed on a without prejudice basis, its contents have never been laid before the court.  What has emerged, however, is its likely conclusion that the potential value of the goodwill in the TCI Group entities might be substantial and possibly in the bracket of £513 million to £872 million.  Whilst acknowledging that the court might wish to apply a significant discount in terms of the husband’s status as a ‘key man’ within the structure, the wife’s expert was apparently suggesting the application of significantly less than a 100% discount, and more likely less than one half of that. </span>

I, having read the submissions of the parties and many of the documents, am completely persuaded that this exercise would be so theoretical as to do nothing more than generate an argument which would not assist the court at all.  At the end of the day, the court in a case of this kind wants to be able to proceed so far as possible on ground which is, if not solid, then at least supportive of some weight.  It seems to me the more I have thought about this proposed valuation exercise, the more I have become convinced that it is shot through with so much theoretical speculation that the court would find itself quite unable to ascribe any sort of reliable value to it.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:11pt">At the end of the day, the key factor in any valuation would be the extent to which the husband Mr Hohn’s own contribution to the business was relevant.  On the one hand, it will be said on his behalf, (because, judging by the documents that have been produced thus far, this is the position that has been taken) that any discount should be in effect 100%.  In other words, without him, there is nothing.  And I am as confident as I can be at this stage that this is the most likely result.  The fact that there are others in the organisation in which he works who assist him by the production of raw material, the production of analyses, does not in any way meet the point that in a business which is wholly dependent upon the investment eye of the individual concerned, it is quite impossible for the court to carry out a valuation exercise of the organisation in those circumstances.’</span>

It is a fallacy that every asset must be valued in every case or even in every sharing case.  Of course, the court will need to draw a balance sheet or asset schedule, but that does not lead to the conclusion that every asset must be valued in order for the court’s statutory duty to be complied with.  The valuations sought in this case would likely be theoretical.  It would not be a valuation of assets available for distribution between the parties.</span>

The husband is not a director of that company.  There is nevertheless a management agreement in place between TCI (UK) LLP (the investment manager)  (owned 100% by the husband) and Talos Capital under the terms of which the entirety of the US$4.5 billion held within the UK Foundation is placed under the active management of the husband.  It is a 90 day notice agreement and the husband charges no management fees to Talos, although an incentive fee of between 7% and 10% is payable if the investments pass a hurdle rate of 3% to 6%.  He receives no further or additional remuneration from the Foundation notwithstanding the value of the funds under his active management.</span>

In the event I were to conclude they were worth a figure which was more than US$111 million but less than US$200 million, that value should be aggregated with the other assets and divided so as to increase the lump sum to be paid to her by the husband to bring her up to a full 50% share of the matrimonial assets.</span>

He pointed to the fact that five or more of his previous partners over the years had left to become investment managers in their own right.  He pointed to the very significant sums which the analysts had earned as bonus or incentive payments over the years.  All these factors, said Mr Pointer, contribute to a clear impression that this ‘team’ adds significant potential value to the TCI business, with or without the husband at the helm.</span>

Although at various points during the course of his evidence, the husband referred to ‘we’ and ‘our’ when he was describing his </span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:11pt">and the manner in which decisions were taken, I am entirely satisfied that no decisions of substance are taken in that business without his ‘say so’ and express approval.  It seems fairly obvious from the evidence which he gave that the husband has controlled the decision-making process from bottom to top.  It is he who selects, hires and (in some cases) fires the individual members of the team of analysts and partners which support the commercial operation of the Fund.  They have their roles to play, and I have no doubt that they are important roles.  The husband told me, for example, about a dedicated team responsible for liaising and maintaining relations with the individual investors.  In much the same way,  I have no doubt that the analysts whom the husband employs are all extremely clever and able individuals who provide him with the best background due diligence available.  He does not strike me as a man who suffers fools gladly.  With TCI UK LLP (the investment manager entity) generating an annual turnover on its own of almost £100 million in the last year, it would be wildly naïve to believe that any one individual could maintain a ‘hands on’ role in relation to every aspect of its day to day operation.  The husband has surrounded himself with a handful of key personnel and, further down the chain, backroom support staff all of whom have a role to play.  He no doubt employs the best and they are handsomely rewarded for what they do.  Nevertheless, without him at the centre of operations as the ‘ideas man’, making the investment decisions, driving aggressively forward the activist management strategy which has brought such significant rewards for the Fund and its investors, I accept that very few of his investors would be prepared to stay on board.  </span>

To this end, I find it difficult, if not impossible, to conceive of circumstances in which this husband would surrender the autonomy he presently enjoys in order to make money for someone else, whatever financial inducements might be put on the table.  For the reasons expressed above, I am equally persuaded that it is unlikely that investors would wish to stay in a fund in which the husband no longer exercised that autonomy of control over investment decisions.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:11pt">In each accounting year, the Group (principally TCI UK LLP, as the investment manager) receives both management fees and crystallised incentive fees.  The management fees are relatively straightforward.  Depending upon the share class in which an investor places its funds, a standard (or set) percentage fee is charged, usually between 1% and 1.5%.  In addition, each investor becomes liable to pay an incentive fee which is performance based and depends upon the achievement of an identified hurdle rate of growth in the underlying investment over a specified period of time. From a schedule which the husband has disclosed, it is apparent that the shares are divided into eight classes (A – H) which require from investors a commitment period of between one, two, three and five years.  There is also a quarterly class share (D) which enables investors to withdraw their funds quarterly.  The various classes attract an incentive fee of between 13.5% and 16.5%.  These incentive fees crystallise and become immediately payable at the end of an investor’s lock in period.  That period will depend upon the class of share to which the original investment subscription is made.  When the lock in period ends, the investor redeems his investment at which point, if the hurdle has been achieved, the incentive fee crystallises and becomes immediately payable.  In the event that the hurdle is not reached, no fee or a reduced fee is payable. In the case of the quarterly share class, the incentive fee calculation period is the end of a three year cycle following issue.  The hurdle rate varies according to the class of share but is typically LIBOR plus 2% or 300bps.  </span>

However, in terms of running accounting records for management purposes, and in order to provide information to both its investors and its partners on an ongoing basis, the accountants responsible for the preparation of the TCI Group accounts adopt the practice of making a hypothetical allowance in the balance sheets for the contingent incentive fees which may become payable at a future date.  These are calculated by reference, in the main, to actual performance as compared to the specified hurdle return and are based upon the current net asset value of the TCI Fund.  The hypothesis is based upon an assumption that hurdle rates will be met but, unless and until they are, the sums allocated are no more than accounting figures.  There is no ‘crystallisation’ or contractual entitlement to receive those sums allowed for, or any other.  Neither the husband nor his partners in the Fund have any call on the funds until the point of crystallisation. In this sense, they do not represent ‘real’ money or ‘earned cash’.  The reason why the numbers exist at all is to enable investors to know what the value of their fund units may be at any given point in time if they were to withdraw them net of fees payable.</span>

From time to time, in addition to that fixed entitlement, the husband has paid out from his own share of the incentive fees further sums to individual analysts, either to incentivise or to retain them as part of his working team.  These additional ‘bonus’ or ‘incentive’ payments are made entirely at the husband’s discretion in terms of both their size and destination.  I heard some evidence about quite significant sums being paid out to individual analysts over the course of the years.  These payments fall within the overarching discretionary management strategies which the husband controls as part of his operation of the TCI Group as a whole.  He selects the individuals with whom he wishes to work; he agrees their remuneration structures; he ‘lets go’ the individuals who do not perform; and he decides who benefits financially at the Group’s year end over and above their contractual financial entitlement.</span>

That schedule showed a provisional allocation to him from all TCI Group entities excluding one of the UK entities (which provided a nil return) of £25 million (which he told me was in fact rounded up from £24.7 million).  In terms of unallocated profits for the 2013/2014 year, his revised schedule confirmed the figure of £40 million gross, which figure is now reflected in the latest set of (2014) accounts which were produced during the course of the hearing.  In relation to this sum, the husband’s evidence was that he was entitled to take this money but that he might decide to allocate from it payments to third parties (such as his team of analysts) in order to retain or incentivise them over and above their contractual entitlement to the minimum percentage of the profits.  He did not tell me about any decisions which he had made in relation to distributing funds out of the £40 million gross and he accepted that I could treat this fund (£21.25 million net) as money which was notionally earmarked for him.  I take on board his point that this profit (or income in his hands) was generated during the second year after which the parties separated (ie. in the year March 2013 to February 2014), and I shall come back to this point in deciding how to deal with it insofar as the sharing of post-separation accrual is concerned.  However, this unallocated profit represents an asset which I consider should be included (less tax and the share allocated to the analysts) at a figure of £21,247,360 (US$35,850,672) in the global balance sheet of assets available for division between these parties.</span>

That hurdle is linked to LIBOR plus a margin.  Whilst the highest hurdle rate is currently 5%, that rate is predicated on the basis of historically low interest rates following the global collapse in 2008.  With emerging improvements in economic markets, that hurdle rate may well rise, linked as most of them are to LIBOR.  Under the terms of their investment contracts, the hurdle compounds for investors either on an annual basis or on a month by month basis.  In the event that a particular share class is below its high water mark, the hurdle continues to compound, thus raising the bar further before eventual crystallisation.  If the Fund performance is lower than the compounding hurdle rate, the amount of contingent incentive fees will be reduced or never collected.</span>

Then and only then, so a year after separation, I think at February 2013 – sorry, January 2013 – there was only after tax about $1 million of crystallised incentive fees.

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:11pt">Looking at the table of crystallisation referred to in the husband’s solicitors’ letter of 30 April 2014 (paragraph 139 (ii) above), it is clear that about one quarter of the fees which might be received (some US$25 million net in the husband’s hands) will fall in during 2015 and 2016 (respectively three and four years after the date of the wife’s divorce petition).  The major block of contingent fees is likely to crystallise in 2017.  That would represent c. US$45 million net in the husband’s hands and would come to him (if it does) some five years after the effective demise of the marriage.  According to the husband’s evidence, as at that date (ie. the end of the marriage), he was still in the process of clawing back all the losses made after the financial crash in 2008.  The recovery which began in 2013 was a financial regeneration, on his case, achieved during a period which post-dates their decision to end the marriage.  Of course, that – in itself - is not an answer to the wife’s case to an entitlement to share in these assets because a continuum of trading in volatile market conditions is part and parcel of what this husband has done from the outset.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:11pt">In an attempt to separate out those investors who were ‘in’ and those who were ‘out’ of the fund at the point of separation, I heard much during the husband’s cross-examination about the composition of the various classes of investor.  The husband produced for me various tables as his evidence unfolded over the days he was in the witness box.  It appears to be agreed that only 1.3% of the Fund’s investors are contracted to a five year ‘lock in’.  That represents a very small percentage of the US$290 million which may, or may not, crystallise in 2018.  If the ‘rump’ of the five year lock in funds can be expected to be withdrawn by investors in 2018 (at which point they will pay whatever crystallised funds are due), it follows that there must be some of this class of investor contributing to the payments hypothetically due in the years 2015 to 2017.  However, these investors represent only 1.3% of the total fund value.</span>

All the rest, apart from Class H (3 year lock in and 18.7% of the Fund) and the management shares (ie. the husband, whose holding is 15.8%) represent significantly less than 10% of the global investment in the TCI Fund.  Class D, the majority, represents predominantly ‘old’ investors who have ‘rolled over’ from their previous ‘lock ups’ into quarterly money after the financial crisis because of their unwillingness to commit to a position of comparative illiquidity in new ‘lock ups’.</span>

They point to the fact that the husband said during the course of his evidence that the information which would answer this question was available and had been analysed and that it would be produced.  It was not, at least not in the form in which it had been requested as at two specific dates in March and December 2012.  They say that, absent the provision of proper analysis from the husband as to the structure of the investors who are liable for the contingent incentive fees, the totality of the sums due should be regarded as part of the assets generated up to the date of trial and available for distribution.  Thus, they invite me to include in an adjusted asset schedule a ‘hard’ figure of just over US$113.6 million.</span>

What matters is when the work was done to generate the profit which gives rise to the potential entitlement to the contingent incentive fees.  That line can be clearly drawn because the evidence establishes unequivocally that the Fund only went into profit in the latter part of 2013.  They say that it would be quite impossible on the state of the evidence before me to draw a ‘bright line’ in order to determine how much of the, as yet, uncrystallised fees fall pre-separation and post-separation.  On the basis of the evidence I do have, I can safely assume that these fees were predominantly generated after the breakdown of the marriage and consequently the asset schedule needs no further adjustment to reflect what is an uncertain, future and contingent receipt.</span>

I shall need in due course to consider in greater detail the issue of contribution insofar as it relates to the welfare of the family for the purposes of section 25(2)(f) of the 1973 Act.  The particular resonance of the date of separation in this case is its impact upon the wife’s entitlement to an equal share in an asset pool which has seen exponential growth in value since that date.</span>

I have to say that I am not persuaded by that argument as a principle, but in any event the law is clear.  Furthermore, there is no evidence in this case that the wife delayed the litigation or that she was unwilling to engage in settlement discussions following the unsuccessful conclusion of the FDR hearing.

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:11pt">As to the facts, the wife first sought legal advice in the summer of 2011 from a US attorney called Mr Dontzin.  Her Petition seeking dissolution of the marriage was served on the husband by her English solicitors on 6 April 2012.  The date of separation in the agreed chronology is put at ‘March 2012’.  The point of physical separation occurred in late April or early May of that year when the wife and children moved out of the former matrimonial home into nearby rented accommodation. On behalf of the wife, Mr Pointer and Mr Kingscote submit that the service of the Petition did not signal the end of this marriage.  As I have said, from that point until a date in November or December 2012, the parties were exploring the possibility of saving the marriage in the context of marriage counselling.  I heard about some four or five sessions, at the conclusion of which both parties appear to have accepted that divorce had become inevitable.  As I pointed out during the course of argument, it is often difficult to define the precise point at which a marriage has irretrievably broken down.  In many cases, if not the majority, parties will engage in some form of formal or informal counselling in an attempt to salvage a relationship, particularly where there are children involved in the family breakdown.  They may often reconcile for a period of time before reaching a final conclusion that neither wishes to continue to share a life with the other.  I have no doubt that each of these parties was genuine in his and her attempts to explore the possibility of a reconciliation.  In terms of considering the wife’s entitlement to a fair share of the matrimonial assets, I do not propose to draw any clear line under the asset base as it stood on 6 April 2012.  That is not what the law obliges me to do and it is not in any event what Mr Marks, on behalf of the husband, contends I should do.  He and Miss Clarke do not seek to quarantine the post-separation growth, nor the husband’s post-separation income (other than unallocated profit and the second stage IREO investment, both of which fall very far into the separation).  His case is that assets accrued or earned since the date of separation have to be considered in a different way in terms of any entitlement which the wife may have to a share because the nature and extent of their respective contributions during that period of time is different from what it was during the marriage.  In other words, the husband does not seek to argue that the wife has no share in these post-separation assets; rather that she has a lesser share than that which she can expect to receive from the marital assets.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:11pt">Mr Pointer reminds me that each of the parties has continued to discharge their respective roles throughout the period since March 2012 or December 2012 to the present time.  The husband has continued to engage in his wealth creating activities at TCI.  The wife has continued her active involvement in the Foundation and her role as mother to their four children.  Until the implementation of the recommendations of the Board following the Bridgespan report, she performed her role as Chair and CEO of the Foundation until September 2013.  Her replacement as CEO does not mean a reduced workload, a fact which I accept.  Thus, says Mr Pointer, quite apart from the fact that she has not been paid out her share of the assets for her to deploy separately, there has been no actual cessation of the work during the marriage it was their respective roles to perform.  He says that the only thing which has in fact changed is that there is no longer any spousal support between the two.</span>

Further, Mrs Miller had here no right to, and could not have been given, any part of Mr Miller’s New Star shareholding in relation to which Mr Miller carried the risk.  Mrs Miller has at all times been living in the house, which has now been formally transferred to her.  Her only further claim is to a sum of money, assessed by the judge at £2.7 million (which Mr Miller paid in two instalments in May and June 2005).  Mr Miller cannot easily be said in this case to have been holding on to any asset which should have been Mrs Miller’s, or to owe anything other than money.  Assuming that the focus is on assets acquired during the marriage, rather than on the husband’s overall means, it seems to me, therefore, natural in this case to look at the period until separation.’</span>

As at 31 December 2011 (some months after the wife first sought legal advice in relation to the marital difficulties but just over three months before the service of her divorce petition), the total assets stood at just under US$700 million (the equivalent of c. £446 million on the prevailing </span>

By 30 April 2014 (the date of the mainframe asset schedule from which we were working during the final hearing), the gross assets had increased to US$1.436 billion (US$1.354 billion net of tax on the husband’s case or US$1.4 billion net if the unallocated profits and IREO investment is included).  That represents an increase over 17 months of some 62%.  On Mr Pointer’s and Mr Kingscote’s final computation schedule, the global available assets are now in excess of US$1.6 billion. </span>

That, of course, is not a sufficient evidential platform for proceeding from that base line figure.  It seems to me that the fairer approach to measuring the extent of the post-separation accrual, in the absence of a specific snapshot for March 2012, is to look either to the equivalent value of the December 2011 figure applying the exchange rates as at the end of March 2012 (US$700 million), or to take the 30 November 2012 figure of US$889 million.

On that basis, he invites me to consider the scale of the post-separation accrual here as being equivalent to three times the total wealth which was available to Mr and Mrs Charman.  That extraordinary level of wealth creation in the aftermath of marriage breakdown should not be treated, as Mr Marks and Miss Clarke submit, as part of the marital acquest.</span>

Exceptions to that rule are rare and probably confined to cases where one party has deliberately or recklessly wasted assets in anticipation of trial.

Indeed Miss Baron conceded the proposition, whilst contending that this husband was not in the category, since she submitted that he was no more than a hard-working businessman.  That submission does not seem to me to do justice to the husband’s achievements, which clearly for their scale depended upon his innovative visions as well as upon his ability to develop those visions.  It is a factor that in the present case deserves some recognition.  I do not regard it as discrimination by the back door.  Whilst no doubt the husband’s capacity to devote himself to the expansion of the companies depended in part upon the stability and security of the home and family life which the wife created and sustained, his creativity was not so dependant to the same or perhaps to any degree.’</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:11pt">principle.  The husband was, in effect, trading with the wife’s undivided share of the assets and she is entitled to share in the results of his investment activities.  To Mr Marks’ riposte that the husband had no choice in the absence of agreement as to the size of her settlement award, Mr Pointer argues that there was nothing to prevent him from making a substantial voluntary payment at the outset.  He points to the husband’s unwillingness to relinquish control over the money, as borne out by his earlier refusal to pay to the wife a sum of £5 million on account of her claims.  I heard evidence from the husband on this point.  He was keen to point out that substantial funds had been made available to the wife in respect of her legal costs (some US$2 million) as soon as she had requested them.  Furthermore, after some initial debate about the extent of her annual budget, there was early consensus between their respective legal teams as to the interim financial provision which should be put in place.   It seems to me that a more substantial point is the tax issue.  Had the husband liquidated a significant part of the TCI Fund in order to make an accelerated payment to the wife, because of their non-domiciled status it would have given rise to a significant tax liability in the event she remitted all or part of those funds for which he would have been responsible.  In that event, it may well be that the wife would have elected to stay in the Fund not only to avoid an overall reduction in the asset pool in which she was to share but also to take advantage of the very significant returns which the husband was generating.  Because his personal wealth was increasing on the back of his management shares (which attracted no fees), the wife was potentially sharing in a level of return on their ‘joint’ investment in the Fund which was not even open to the other Fund investors, regardless of their share class.  </span>

He points to the fact that, because of the circles in which this couple moved, she has many contacts in the investment fund world.  Whilst there was no hard evidence before me to substantiate this argument, I am sceptical about placing much reliance on it.  I accept that the husband is one of only a handful of investors in the world who can demonstrate the track record of performance which is borne out by the undisputed figures in this case.  Whatever connections the wife might have been able to exploit, I am not persuaded that there was any guarantee she would have matched the returns which have been achieved by remaining in the TCI Fund.  In no small part, these returns have been achieved, as I find, by the activist investment strategies deployed by the husband in relation to the underlying Fund assets.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:11pt">Mr Marks and Miss Clarke produced as part of their final submissions a table and a graph in order to demonstrate the returns which the wife might have achieved in alternative investment vehicles.  In addition to the MSCI Global Equity Index, I was provided with figures for both the FTSE and the Dow indices over similar periods of time.  The FTSE produced an average return of 4.14% and the Dow an average return of 4.42%.  In contrast a fee paying TCI investor saw an average return of 18.9%, whereas holders of management shares achieved an average return of just over 24%.  As Mr Marks puts it, ‘[The husband’s] point about compounding is that 24% (TCI) for 10 years is 15x more profitable than 4.14% (FTSE) for 10 years, and almost twice as profitable as 18.9% (TCI investors) for 10 years’.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:11pt">When these figures are transposed into the table demonstrating investment return over a ten year period from March 2004 to March 2014, it is possible to see that, for TCI investors (within and without the management share class which pays no fees), the clear majority of the present value in the fund has been generated by active growth over and above the typical investment return achievable from any of the FTSE, Dow or MSCI indices.  Whilst I accept that the table in itself is no more than a forensic tool designed to give some graphic depth and colour to the figures on which Mr Marks relies, it is nevertheless useful as a context in which to set the point he seeks to make.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:11pt">Mr Pointer ably meets this point by reminding me that, without an accurate breakdown as to which of the current investors were in the Fund in 2012, it is impossible to analyse out the different constituents of the success which TCI has enjoyed so as to show (i) what proportion of the fees that have been earned may be regarded as a product of a pre-existing business; and (ii) what proportion are properly to be considered as a result of the husband’s extra-marital endeavour.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:11pt">As Mr Marks himself accepts, there has been a massive amount of ‘churn’ within the Fund as a result of the money being actively worked but, overwhelmingly, as he submits, the money is being generated through new ventures.  Whilst the overall structure of the TCI entities represents a continuum, it is not the structures in themselves which are generating the wealth.  Wealth creation on the scale achieved by the husband comes about by his ability to identify a new investment opportunity and make it work, either by driving internal change to increase value or by creating change in the commercial environment in which the company works.   </span>

They are doubtless skills which he has been honing ever since.  Mr Marks accepts that there is some ‘tailback’ into the marriage but his case is that there is now a new element, and a significant new element, which is the extent to which he deploys his skills in activist investing.  As he put it, ‘an activist investor cannot stand still.  [He has] to be constantly looking for the next challenge’.</span>

Even if the payment relates to a period immediately following separation I would myself say it is too close to the marriage to justify categorisation as non-matrimonial.  Moreover, I entirely agree with Coleridge J when he points out that during the period of separation the domestic party carries on making her non-financial contribution but cannot attribute a value thereto which justifies adjustment in her favour.  Although there is an element of arbitrariness here, I myself would not allow a post-separation bonus to be classed as non-matrimonial unless it related to a period which commenced at least 12 months after separation.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:11pt">The husband’s evidence in relation to the underlying composition of the investment turnover during the last two or three years was that more than 100% of the entire TCI portfolio had been ‘churned’ (or reinvested) into new investments.  I have already given several examples of these in my extraction of the husband’s evidence at paragraph 51.</span>
	      <span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:Garamond;font-size:11pt"> </span>
	      <span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:11pt"> Thus, regardless of any lack of forensic clarity over precisely where lines can be drawn in relation to the different investor pools or share classes at any one point in time, the evidence demonstrates, as I find, that the present composition of the TCI portfolio is very substantially different in terms of its makeup from its composition as at 2012.  Does that make any difference?  On the one hand, it might be said that ‘investment churn’ is part and parcel of what an activist investor aims to achieve.  Having listened carefully to all that the husband told me about his business model, it seems to me that very little of the TCI investment business could be labelled ‘static’ or ‘long term’.   His particular talent (some might call it financial genius) lies in his ability to identify particular ideas or commercial opportunities, to take significant and often very high risk positions within a limited number of entities, to ‘work’ them (often from the ‘inside out’) and to ‘exit’ on behalf of his investors at the optimum moment for maximum return.  It is precisely the opposite stratagem to conservative, long term investment.  His investment eye, coupled with his appetite for massive risk and sheer intuitive ‘nous’ as to how to push through a change-for-profit agenda, has given rise to very significant levels of investment return and created, in its wake, the lengthy ‘wait list’ of investors all eager to jump upon his very  lucrative coat tails. In answer to the question I posed above, the relevance of the high turnover of different investments in the Fund matters, in my view, because it shows the extent to which the Fund is constantly being ‘worked’.  It represents active and ongoing contributions by the husband to the continuing generation of wealth at a time when the marital partnership has long since ceased to exist.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:11pt">I accept that, in making these contributions, the husband is using as his commercial vehicle the TCI Fund which might be said to be a creature of the marriage.  However, in this case, the Fund and the wealth invested within it is only one component part of the wealth generating vehicle.  Its engine and driving force is the husband’s investment eye coupled with his ability to drive change and so achieve levels of profit which are demonstrably in excess of any conventional rates of investment return.  Whilst it was not part of the wife’s case that the husband’s earning capacity should be treated as an asset in itself and brought into account for the purposes of the sharing principle (other than in respect of arguments as to his ability to recapitalise his position in fairly short order whatever the extent of her award in these proceedings), it seems to me that to take account of assets created in the Fund long after the point of separation risks an invasion of that territory.

In other words, whilst I propose to look at the totality of the value of assets available to these parties as at the date of trial, I do not consider that it would be fair to treat the wealth creation after the breakdown of the marriage as simply part and parcel of the marital acquest in which the wife should be entitled to an equal share.</span>

Without doubt, their respective roles as parents to their four children continued uninterrupted as did the routine of their daily working lives within TCI and the Foundation.  However, to the extent that the husband went on outside the marital partnership to claw back the very significant losses made after 2008 and thereafter, predominantly from 2013 onwards, to generate wealth on an exceptional scale, in my judgment fairness requires me to take account of that contribution as one which created wealth which falls outside of the marital acquest.  I do not regard the parties’ subsequent attempts to explore the prospects of repairing the marriage as part of the continuum of its course.  The separation in March 2012 was not a temporary separation but a permanent one.  In the eight months between March and November 2012, I heard about nothing which might persuade me that the marriage was continuing to operate in its essential character as a partnership between spouses.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:11pt">[2011] 1 FLR 1471.  In that case the judge was dividing a matrimonial estate, including business assets, worth about £16.25 million.  The wife sought an equal division of the assets, notwithstanding the significant post-separation accrual represented by the sale of a business some three and a half years into the separation at the end of a 19 year marriage.  The husband contended that she should receive no more than about 28% of the total wealth, justifying this substantial departure primarily by reference to post-separation accrual but also on the basis that, whilst the company he had sold had been in existence prior to the breakdown of the marriage, it was wholly external to the marriage and its eventual sale price had been achieved due to his endeavours alone.  In awarding the wife some 40% of the total assets (including some </span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:11pt">, the position was somewhat different in that the judge was being asked to conduct the segregation exercise in the context of business valuations produced by accountants instructed on either side which were based upon a series of artificial and hypothetical assumptions so as to create the sharp line in the figures as at the date of separation.  That approach was criticised by Moylan J as of doubtful utility in guiding him to a fair award.  His lordship reached his own conclusion of what that award should be by settling on a figure of just over 40%. That was, in his view, a departure which was a fair reflection of the degree of weight to be attached to the husband’s post-separation endeavours (to which he found the wife had given insufficient weight) and all the other s25 factors, including the length of the marriage and the fact that the husband had, since separation, been trading with the wife’s notional share of the family wealth.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:11pt">In this case, and in relation to the argument that the husband was throughout ‘trading with the wife’s undivided share of the assets’, I have reached a clear conclusion.  I accept that the wife was on risk in relation to further losses in the Fund.  The fact that I am not drawing any valuation line other than as at the date of the hearing means that her entitlement to benefit from the subsequent uplift and share in the Fund’s recovery (reflected in the husband’s personal holding of units) will be reflected in the share she will receive from those funds which represent both marital acquest and post-separation accrual.  Whilst I shall come on to the precise figures once I have considered the issue of overall computation and special contribution, it is not my intention that this wife should receive no share of the assets which fall outside the marital acquest in this case.  She will receive a share and that share will form part and parcel of the overall award which I will make on the basis of fairness to both parties.  There is no question of her entitlement to any element of post-separation accrual being triggered by a ‘needs’ argument but I take the view that, notwithstanding the exponential increase in the growth of the Fund post-separation, its genesis as a matrimonial asset is a factor of considerable significance.  That factor must, in my view, find its reflection in the overall quantum of the financial award she will receive at the conclusion of these proceedings.  It goes to the heart of what I consider to be fair in the overall context of the case.</span>

We are dealing in hypotheses to an extent because (a) he did not, and (b) I know not whether in these circumstances she would have been entitled to leave ‘her’ funds invested under his management.  However, she knew far better than most the extraordinary success which the husband had achieved over the life of the Fund and there was no evidence put before me that she would have been likely to replicate his investment returns on her separated funds elsewhere and to the same extent.  Indeed, the evidence which I do have suggests the contrary.  The fact that she moved in circles where she had social connections with other wealthy investors and money-makers does not to my mind lead to such a conclusion.  Further, for so long as she remained within the TCI Fund, she had the unique opportunity to earn returns without paying any management fees at all.  That opportunity represented a very significant saving (running into tens of millions of dollars) which she would not have achieved as an external investor in another fund.  Significantly, it also meant that for so long as she remained invested with her undivided ‘share’, the husband was effectively making significant returns for her for no consideration at all at a time when, on any view, their marital partnership with its mutual obligations had long since come to an end.  </span>

Theoretically, she could have left the funds offshore and thereby avoided a tax charge but I have no doubt that, in the event of a significant payment on account, the husband’s financial support of the wife in her home in London would have been very significantly reduced from its current level, and properly so.  It is difficult to see how, in these circumstances, she would have been able to avoid bringing funds onshore.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:11pt">Before dealing with the substance of these issues, it is important to bear in mind that they fall into two separate and distinct categories.  The first concerns what are essentially hypothetical tax charges in respect of which the husband is seeking specific indemnities from the wife.  The second relates to (as yet) unascertained and unquantified risks for which he seeks a general indemnity.  The wife has agreed to give a specific indemnity for those tax charges which are perceived to present an actual risk, notwithstanding that her evaluation of that risk (and those who advise her) is small.  The sums involved are significant and she accepts that, if she is to receive a percentage of the available assets, it is only fair that she should bear an equivalent percentage of any actual tax which might have to be borne by the husband.  She offers no such indemnity in respect of the majority of the potential tax charges which the husband has identified because (i) these are not perceived as solid risks, or, as Mr Brandon put it, they vary from ‘the highly unlikely to the fanciful’; and (ii) they relate to future events within the husband’s control and should not in any event be taken into account in the assessment of what is now available.</span>

She accepts that, if and insofar as there is some tax to be paid, she should share that risk with the husband to the extent of her entitlement.  Thus, on the basis that she succeeds in securing 50% of the available assets, she bears 50% of the tax.  However, matters are not quite that simple because, as it transpired, there is no agreement on the ambit of the risk in which she will be sharing.</span>

In contrast, the funds which the wife will be receiving post- Decree absolute will be entirely clean.

The wife’s agreement to provide the husband with an indemnity backed by the escrow to secure her share of the potential tax is limited to the period from 6 April 2012 to 5 April 2014. In respect of the general indemnity which the husband seeks over and above those specific risks, the wife’s position is that the evidence put before the court does not justify any further security from her; in other words, those risks are negligible if, indeed, they exist at all.  She will not give any indemnity which involves her exposure to a personal liability in excess of the monies held in the escrow account.

In relation to the pension, she contends that no allowance for tax should be made.  The pension scheme which holds the bulk of the value, some US$93 million, is not an approved scheme and therefore falls to be taxed under the employer financed retirement benefits rules (EFRBS).  Since the husband is employed in the UK, any income flowing from the pension is prima facie taxable under ITEPA 2003</span>

This is because the fund is held by Jersey trustees and is thus classed as a ‘foreign pension’.  In these circumstances, and as a non-UK domiciled taxpayer, the husband will be taxed on a remittance basis :  s 573 ITEPA 2003.  Thus, if the income is paid to him over a ten year period after the age of 50 whilst he is resident in the United Kingdom, the receipt will be tax free unless he chooses to remit the funds onshore.  </span>

If the husband were to defer taking his pension until he is resident in Jamaica, he might then be subject to tax deduction at source, as a non-UK resident, although in this instance there may well be provision under a Jamaican tax treaty for double taxation relief.  His alternative may be to take up residence in another country with such a tax treaty.  If, however, he takes his pension from the scheme before he leaves the UK, he can leave the money abroad without incurring any tax penalty.  On this basis, argue Mr Brandon and Mr Pointer, there is no valid reason for deducting any tax in respect of his rights under the pension scheme.</span>

That is not quite the position.  If the asset is eventually realised, it appears to be accepted that tax will be payable.  The issue for the wife is that this is a future contingent tax risk which the husband can take appropriate steps to avoid.  She should not be responsible for those future tax risks when, perhaps many years from now, he will be in a position to make decisions regarding tax mitigation.</span>

In that case, the judge had to determine how to treat latent capital gains tax (CGT) arising on the disposal of shares held by the wife offshore.  Those shares were worth slightly less than £60 million as at the date of trial.  It was accepted by the wife in that case that she could readily meet her outgoings out of dividends (which were regularly remitted to this jurisdiction and taxed here) without touching the capital.  Her evidence was that she intended to leave the shares in specie to her children.  Mr Pointer appeared for the claimant husband in that case and argued that, in the light of this evidence from the wife, no deduction should be made for tax.  The wife’s counsel argued that CGT should be deducted as is entirely conventional in these cases.  The wife should be entitled to access her resources as and in such manner as she might choose.  In the event of a future remittance, CGT would inevitably become payable and thus fairness dictated a comparison of like with like after deduction of CGT.</span>

Given the wife’s clear evidence about her wishes and intentions regarding the shares, coupled with the modest way in which she had lived her entire life, he found that the likelihood of her ever having to pay out significant amounts of CGT was extremely modest.  Nevertheless, he accepted that in the fullness of time she might wish to bring some of her wealth onshore, thus attracting CGT.  Having held that there was no way of approaching the issue in an informed way, his lordship took a broad brush approach and deducted  latent CGT on what he accepted was an arbitrary £10 million worth of her shareholding.  He justified that decision in the following way at page 1482, para 60 :</span>

There is no way of anticipating this in any informed way.  So taking a broad brush, I would deduct latent CGT on an arbitrary £10m worth of her shareholding, but would not deduct it from the balance of the share holding.  I consider that this discretionary although speculative approach is open to me, as there is ‘no hard and fast rule’ and because I think it is the best way to produce a fair and realistic determination on the issue, given the unusual facts of this particular case.

It was also an agreed fact that the family had spent very little during the course of their marriage given the extent of the resources which were available to the wife.

He was not dealing with the computation of top and bottom line figures or the selection of some particular percentage around or discounted from the yardstick of equality.  In that event, his decision as to the deduction or not of the CGT in the context of the available assets in that case might well have been expressed in more specific terms.  As it was, he settled on his figure of £5.3 million as one which fairly met the husband’s reasonable requirements fully and generously assessed : see para 56 on page 1481.  The exercise on which I am embarking in this case is very different.  All of the wealth has been built up over the course of a long marriage.  Each of the parties relies upon significant contributions to the accretion of that wealth and, in the husband’s case, on a special and unmatched contribution.   In these circumstances, I take the view that, if and insofar as the wife receives anything less than a full 50% share (and I shall have to calculate what that 50% share might otherwise be), she is entitled to know why there has been a departure from a position of equality.  That said, I respectfully agree entirely with Bodey J that each case simply has to be looked at on its own particular facts and fairness achieved by the exercise of judicial discretion based on those facts, informed by the s 25 exercise with all the guidance which the higher courts have provided.</span>

In respect of the former, I shall need to consider the probability of the liability arising from the foot of the evidence before me.  It is Mr Pointer’s case on behalf of the wife that it is only the pension which falls into this category and that any tax which might be payable is entirely avoidable because the husband has complete control over timing and thus the liability.

Her exposure, on his case, should not be limited to tax arising between 6 April 2012 and 5 April 2015 but should cover all tax years from 6 April 2008.  He was seeking to extend the protection of the escrow account until April 2021 which is a year after the last date by which any relevant enquiry must have been commenced.

Given that the purpose of the escrow account was both to provide security for the husband and to save the wife having to ‘gross up’ any funds which she might otherwise be required to contribute to the discharge of any future liability, the husband would agree to releasing funds in that account by January 2017 rather than April 2021. The down side from the wife’s point of view is that thereafter she would have to accept the risk of ‘grossing up’ if she required the husband to release the funds from the escrow account in January 2017 or on completion of the enquiry if later.  In other words, he was still seeking a general indemnity in relation to all and any tax risks and, insofar as the wife was required to use personal funds to meet her share of the husband’s tax bill and she had not chosen to allow the escrow fund to be retained until April 2021, she should bear any additional tax liability arising on the husband as a result of grossing up that might thereby arise.  If, however, the original escrow had been fully deployed in paying tax then any grossing up issue arising out of the wife paying an additional share of the husband’s tax should be borne pro rata to the award.</span>

The issue of tax therefore falls away in terms of a pre-division deduction of some £29 million odd.  I take the view that this is the fair way to deal with the pension because (i) it reflects a fair division of the non-liquid resources in circumstances where the balance of the wife’s award will be made up more or less entirely of ‘clean’ cash (save for the Connecticut property); and (ii) it acknowledges the principle of personal financial autonomy which each of the parties will have going forward to choose the manner in which they live their lives and regulate their finances.  Whilst Mr Marks would no doubt add to those reasons a submission in relation to the ‘clog’ on the husband’s remaining assets, and whilst acknowledging that as a feature to be borne in mind, it must be counter-balanced by the fact that the TCI entities will continue to drive the income engine in this case.  I accept that a significant part of the husband’s wealth is offshore and he has only limited ‘clean’ capital in this jurisdiction but he has the ability, which the wife does not, to re-establish a capital base in relatively short order, a factor that I shall be returning to later in this judgment.  </span>

My provisional view is that the husband is likely to arrange his affairs in such a way as to minimise, if not extinguish altogether, any tax consequences of drawing his pension.  But there remains the argument as to whether or not there should be some discount in the cash sum paid in lieu to the wife to take account of the fact that £1 (or US$1) of pension value is not the same as £1 (or US$1) of cash.

To put the position as simply as I can, the value in the UK company which is a partner in and board member of the Investment Manager (TCI FM (UK) LLP) is represented by its Fund holding in a Jersey partnership.  Since it is a UK company, the likely ‘exit’ route on a liquidation or winding up would be extraction of value by way of payment of a dividend. Because this is UK sourced income, UK tax would be payable.  Because the dividend rate is 30.56% and the company is based within the UK, the remittance basis would have no application for the husband in terms of his tax position in this event.  Further, the husband has has accumulated no clean capital which he can bring onshore and spend in the UK without incurring tax because the vast bulk of his overseas wealth has been generated whilst resident in the UK.  To the extent that he remits funds to spend in this jurisdiction (including any funds he may need to bring onshore to discharge tax liabilities), those remittances are taxable.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:11pt">On behalf of the wife, Mr Brandon’s primary position is that such tax as may arise is a future event, possibly many years, if not decades, off.  It does not represent a present tax liability and thus no deduction should be made in terms of net asset values.  To say that the TCI Group is presently worth US$111.5 million less US$33 odd million is, says Mr Brandon, a misconceived valuation.  He also argues that, as and when a decision may be taken at some point down the line to wind up the TCI Group (if, indeed, this decision was ever to be taken by the husband), provided he was non-UK resident, he could avoid tax altogether.  Mrs Chamberlain agrees with that proposition.  However, whilst this is probably more the territory of Mr Marks, she says that if one is looking at net values now in terms of division, the tax which would be payable if the Group was wound up now is something which I should take into account.  She makes the point that the court does not normally follow the route of saying, in effect, ‘you can save tax on the disposal of a company by emigrating and therefore the tax that is inherent in the UK structure should not be taken into account’.  That is as maybe, but here it seems to me that we are back in the territory identified in </span>

But, here, I suspect that the approach conventionally taken by the Family Court may be slightly different from a ‘black letter’ approach to valuation in commercial cases.  In striving to achieve a fair result as between these parties, I have to anticipate insofar as I can the underlying realities of the situation both as it is now and as it is likely to be.  That is why s 25(2)(a) and (b) of the 1973 statute refers to both ‘present’ and ‘future’ resources and obligations.  The present resources will usually be capable of more or less precise forensic analysis.  Future obligations and needs are confined to those which are foreseeable.  That inevitably requires a consideration of what is likely to happen at some point in the future.  That there will probably come a time when the husband will wish to extract value from the TCI Group seems to me highly likely.  The issue which then arises is whether or not he can structure his arrangements in such a way as to mitigate any potential tax consequences.</span>

I propose to substitute for the figure of £19,966,088 a figure of £10 million.  I accept that, on one view, it may seem arbitrary simply to make an allowance for one half of a potential liability but it reflects my view of the likely risk of (a) the tax being incurred, and (b) the allowance I should properly make for the risk (albeit unlikely) that other tax risks may crystallise which are not covered by the indemnity/escrow offered by the wife in respect of which the husband may need to liquidate funds within the TCI Group.

I have taken the exchange rate as at 30 April 2014 which was the basis for the calculations on the working mainframe schedule.  Whilst some of the sterling figures which appeared on Mr Pointer’s and Mr Kingscote’s final corrected schedule (in abbreviated format) appear to have been calculated by reference to the prevailing </span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:11pt">rates at the end of the trial, it seems to me that to undertake a wholesale recalculation would only add confusion at this stage.  For the most part we were working in US dollars throughout the final hearing and, importantly, for the purposes of the closing submissions which I heard in relation to the quantum of the wife’s final award. In order to compare values as at 30 April 2014 and within a few days of the date when this judgment will be handed down, I have referenced the sterling equivalent (just under £919 million) at the foot of the adjusted schedule.  It is axiomatic that exchange rates will fluctuate either up or down between now and the point at which the wife is able to extract the full value of her award.  With figures as great as these, it is equally obvious that even small fluctuations in the underlying rates have the potential to create significant changes to the base line figures.  That said, it seems to me that I need to keep in mind the earlier figures since these were the basis of the open offers which the parties made and these were the figures from the foot of which the parties made their closing submissions.  Whilst the approach adopted by Mr Pointer and Mr Kingscote has the clear advantage of being simple in its presentation (ie. 50% of whatever I find the total assets to be), the route to their conclusion as to outcome adopted by Mr Marks and Miss Clarke followed a much more detailed and formulaic approach.  I shall deal with the final figures in terms of the global US$ award when I set out my conclusions in relation to the wife’s entitlement.  For present purposes, I am working with a final figure of just under US$1.5 billion.  It will be apparent from this figure that I have declined to include within the total a ‘hard’ figure representing an allowance for the uncrystallised contingent incentive fees.  For the reasons set out in paragraphs 139 and 188(iii) of my judgment, I have concluded that it would be wrong to introduce those future and uncertain sums into a baseline total when they can more appropriately be factored into my overall approach to fairness and percentage division.</span>

There is no doubt in my mind that each of these parties has made a full contribution in terms of their respective roles.  The husband has generated what, on any view, must be regarded as an extraordinary amount of wealth during his working life.  In all, a total of some US$6 billion has been generated, much of which has by common consent been donated to the Foundation for deployment in philanthropic enterprise.  Notwithstanding, the scale of the personal wealth available to this family is still considerable and significantly in excess of that available in any reported case to date.  Some eight years have elapsed since Coleridge J recognised the principle of special contribution (conceded by the wife to the extent of a 5% departure from equality) as justifying an award of 36.5% to Mrs Charman.  Ten months later, his award was upheld in the Court of Appeal.  The assets in that case were just over £130 million, including some £68 million held in an offshore discretionary trust which the husband had created.</span>

Then it reached for the criterion by which the court determines whether a party’s conduct is relevant to the inquiry and suggested that it should be applied to identification of the linked and in effect obverse feature, namely the special contribution.  When, by s 3 of the Matrimonial and Family Proceedings Act 1984, Parliament had recast the reference to conduct in s 25 of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973, it had provided in s 25(2)(g) that conduct should be taken into account if it was ‘such that it would in the opinion of the court be inequitable to disregard it’.

Nevertheless in practice, and for a self-evident reason, the claim to have made a special contribution seems so far to have arisen only in cases of substantial wealth generated by a party’s success in business during the marriage.  The self-evident reason is that in such cases there is substantial property over the distribution of which it is worthwhile to argue.

It is obvious that any such guideline would have to be laden with qualification so as to avoid any impermissible gloss on the court’s duty under s 25 to assess each case on its merits.  Subject to that caveat, we invited counsel to make submissions upon the threshold.  Both Mr Singleton and Mr Pointer were rightly tentative.  Mr Singleton suggested a threshold no higher than £40m or £50m.  Five years ago, in </span>

It would, we consider, be dangerous for us to do so.  However laden with qualification, the guideline might discourage a court from discerning special contribution in the generation of wealth below the threshold in circumstances, however rare, in which it should properly do so.  The greater concern, however, is the obverse risk that it might encourage a court to discern special contribution in the generation of wealth above the threshold in circumstances in which it should not properly do so.

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:11pt">There has been an interesting collateral discussion as to whether, if a party makes a special contribution by the generation of wealth, as a result of which the proportions of its division with the other party under the sharing principle will be unequal, the extent to which the proportions are unequal should depend upon the size of the wealth.   The greater the wealth generated by one party, submits Mr Singleton, the lower should be the proportion awarded to the other.  Mr Pointer disagrees.  He submits that in any event the principle will yield to the maker of the special contribution more than half of the wealth; that the greater the wealth, the greater will be the amount thus yielded; and that fairness requires no further adjustment in favour of its generator.  In principle we agree with Mr Singleton.  If such a contribution is special, it follows that it is unmatched; and the greater the wealth, the greater is the extent to which it is unmatched and to which it calls for an unmatched, or unequal, division under the sharing principle.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:11pt">Although we decline to identify a threshold for the application of the principle of special contribution, we are nonetheless prepared to respond to the judge’s postscript to the extent of offering guidance on the appropriate range of percentage adjustment to be made in cases in which the court is satisfied that the principle requires departure from equality; it is necessary however to bear in mind that fair despatch of some cases may require departure even from the range which we propose.  As it happens, our views on this subject are by way of endorsement and development of what in this case Coleridge J has himself said.  As we have recorded at the end of para [60](d), above, the judge suggested that any adjustment for special contribution of this character should be significant as opposed to token.  We agree.  We find it hard to conceive that, where such a special contribution is established, the percentages of division of matrimonial property should be nearer to equality then 55%-45%.  Equally, in the course of Mr Singleton’s application to him for permission to appeal, the judge, in referring to percentages in cases of special contribution, observed ‘I think you need to be careful, after a long marriage, to give a wife half of what you give the husband’.  Arbitrary though it is, our instinct is the same, namely that, even in an extreme case and in the absence of some further dramatic feature unrelated to it, fair allowance for special contribution within the sharing principle would be most unlikely to give rise to percentages of division of matrimonial property further from equality than 66.6%-33.3%.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:11pt"> he would, as it happens, have been entitled to move at an earlier stage to consider percentages.  In any event this was a rare case of special contribution by the husband’s generation of wealth; and the size of the wealth which he generated and contributed to the welfare of the family compelled quite a substantial departure from equality.  The judge’s endorsement of a departure to 63.5%-36.5% in part reflected his view that the award to the husband was of assets laden with greater risk.   Mr Singleton’s surmise is that the judge justified a discount against the wife of 3% in this respect; but the risk is not obviously demonstrated by the near seamless accretion of wealth by the husband as a result of his activities in the sphere of insurance throughout the marriage and we regard 3% as a maximum of what the judge must have had in mind.  It is clear that the extent of the departure from equality very largely reflected the value placed by the judge upon the husband’s special contribution.  Such departure lies very near the middle of the range which we have suggested in para [90], above, and, in the light of the scale of his special contribution, appropriately so.  Neither in its method nor in its result do we regard the judge’s treatment of the husband’s special contribution as vulnerable to appeal.’</span>

The fact that, with the wife’s agreement (and she would say at her suggestion), most of the US$6 billion earned has been diverted for charitable purposes does not, in my view, detract from the relevance of the enormity of the total fortune.

Whilst he is to be applauded for that, it is quite impossible to say that his contribution in this regard gets close to justifying a greater share of the wealth than that of the wife who contributed herself in an equally valuable way to the best of her ability.’</span>

Sometimes, having carried out the statutory exercise, the judge’s conclusion involves a more or less equal division of the available assets.  More often, this is not so.  More often, having looked at all the circumstances, the judge’s decision means that one party will receive a bigger share than the other.  Before reaching a firm conclusion and making an order along these lines, a judge would always be well-advised to check his tentative views against the yardstick of equality of division.  As a general guide, equality should be departed from only if, and to the extent that, there is good reason for doing so.

Generally accepted standards of fairness in a field such as this change and develop, sometimes quite radically, over comparatively short periods of time.  The discretionary powers conferred by Parliament 30 years ago enable the courts to recognise and respond to developments of this sort.  These wide powers enable the courts to make financial provision orders in tune with current perceptions of fairness.  Today there is a greater awareness of the value of non-financial contributions to the welfare of the family.  There is greater awareness of the extent to which one spouse’s business success, achieved by much sustained hard work over many years, may have been made possible or enhanced by the family contribution of the other spouse, a contribution which also required much sustained hard work over many years.  There is increased recognition that, by being at home and having and looking after young children, a wife may lose for ever the opportunity to acquire and develop her own money-making qualifications and skills.

In this regard s 25 differs from the applicable law in Scotland.  Section 10 of the Family Law (Scotland) Act 1985 provides that the net value of matrimonial property shall be taken to be shared fairly between the parties to a marriage when it is shared equally or in such other proportions as are justified by special circumstances.  Unlike section 10 of the Family Law (Scotland) Act 1985, s 25 of the 1973 Act makes no mention of an equal sharing of the parties’ assets, even their marriage-related assets.  A presumption of equal division would be an impermissible gloss on the statutory division.  That would be so, even though the presumption would be rebuttable.

That submission does not seem to me to do justice to the husband’s achievements, which clearly for their scale depended upon his innovative visions as well as on his ability to develop those visions.  It is a factor in the present case which deserves some recognition.  I do not regard it as discrimination by the back door.  Whilst no doubt the husband’s capacity to devote himself to the expansion of the companies depended in part upon the stability and security of the home and family life which the wife created and sustained, his creativity was not so dependent to the same or perhaps to any degree.’</span>

In the circumstances, I do not consider the absence of such an agreement to have any bearing on the impact of the law as it applies to special contributions in this case.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:11pt">It is really the third point which goes to the heart of the case which is being advanced on behalf of the wife.  Given the extent of her involvement with the Foundation (which I have already described earlier in this judgment); her obvious devotion to and prioritisation of the family’s needs – a family of four children which included triplets; her role as homemaker and co-ordinator of all the children’s social and other needs; what more, asks Mr Pointer, could she have done?  What more should she be expected to have done in order to qualify for equal treatment with the husband in terms of financial outcome?  As he rightly reminds me, she was not simply a ‘working’ wife; she was a wife who was fully engaged in fulfilling her role in the joint objective which had underpinned the marriage from its very inception.  Her role in the Foundation demanded of her the skills and qualities which would have been needed in any CEO at the top of an organisation.  Until the time came when the ‘job’ grew too big for any one individual, she performed that role without remuneration and entirely for the benefit of the beneficiaries of its grants and programmes.  I thought it slightly churlish on the husband’s part to say, as he did, that he did not seek to control the amount of time which she spent at work and she more or less devised her own working programme around the needs of the home and the children.  I am quite satisfied that there was not a spare moment of this wife’s waking day when she was not actively engaged either in discharging her role in the home or working for the Foundation.  I heard, and accept, her evidence that her day would often start in the early hours to coincide with calls which needed to be made in different time zones.  She was frequently still working in her study at home after midnight when the children no longer needed her attention.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:11pt">I am alive to the fact, as are the wife’s advisers, that I am required under the statute to have regards to the contributions which the wife made ‘to the welfare of the family’.  How do these words square with her work in the Foundation?  It seems to me that, had she secured remunerative employment in an equivalent organisation, no one could possibly have contended that her contribution as a working mother fell outside the parameters of s 25(2)(f).  Why then should the fact that she volunteered her services for philanthropic causes without remuneration take her contributions outside that sub-section?  The CH Foundation started its life as a creature of this family.  Both parties accept in their evidence that neither could possibly have foreseen the manner in which it would grow over the intervening years.  The wife described it to me on more than one occasion in her oral evidence as ‘a fairy tale’.  Together they conceived of this objective at a time when their own personal needs for financial security were already met.  Together they discharged their respective responsibilities towards it.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:11pt">However, in this context, and on the basis of the evidence which I heard, I do not think it is either fair or accurate to describe the husband’s role within the Foundation as simply that of money-maker or finance generator.  I accept entirely that this was a central and vitally important function.  As he said, without the means to fund the good causes, they are no more than laudable aspirations.  But, having listened carefully to him, I was left with the clear impression that he was much more involved in the work of the Foundation than the wife’s presentation might appear to suggest.  I have set out in paragraphs 78 to 82 of this judgment the account he gave me of the work he has done for the Foundation.   As I said then, I am not able to accept that there was some clear line of demarcation between the respective contributions which the husband and the wife were making vis à vis their roles in the Foundation.  The wife may have had a very much more ‘hands on’ role in terms of the day to day administration of the Foundation.  She may have spent more time meeting and liaising with various dignitaries and government ministers than the husband, but I am satisfied that he was not excluded from this operational role within the Foundation.  Like the wife, he has made a significant personal investment in the choice of causes which the Foundation supports.  He was a regular attender at Board meetings and has quite clearly involved himself in the identification and selection of high profile candidates for appointment as trustees.  I was struck by the contents of one of the emails to which I was taken.  It was exhibited to the wife’s narrative statement at </span>

If special contribution in this case is to be reflected in a departure from equality of outcome in the husband’s favour, is it not inevitable that the wife will feel that she has in some way been judged to be an inferior partner in the marriage partnership?  Can it ever be a legitimate answer to such a case for a wife to highlight the more difficult aspects of married life with a ‘stellar’ or ‘alpha’ achiever?  Can she point to the pressures placed on her role as wife and supporter occasioned by the quality traits often observed in individuals who achieve this level of success?  Is it feasible for her to point to an increased burden in terms of family and domestic life whilst such a husband traverses the globe several times a month and works through special family anniversaries, birthdays or holidays?</span>

Is it necessary for the purposes of ‘special contribution’ for me to find that the husband possessed the quality of ‘genius’?  Mr Pointer relied to an extent upon the fact that Mr Marks’ case on his client’s behalf relied simply on the extent of the wealth created to establish the special nature of the contribution he made.  There are various definitions of the word ‘genius’ but all seem to suggest that, in order to qualify for this sobriquet, a person must have some exceptional natural capacity or intellectual or creative power or other natural ability which finds reflection in the exercise of an exceptional skill in a particular area of activity.  Applying that definition to this husband, I take the view that he qualifies as a financial genius in his particular field of financial investment. If he does not, who could?  In these circumstances, I find that, on any view, there has been a special contribution made by the husband in this case and that such contribution should and will be reflected in a departure from equality in terms of the overall award which I propose to make.</span>

The fact of the matter remains that I have found that she could not have done more in terms of her role as wife, mother and homemaker.  She applied herself to her work within the Foundation with assiduous enthusiasm, determination and commitment.  By the time the marriage had come to an end, she was effectively CEO and Chair of one of the largest charitable foundations in the world.  I think there is much in the submission made by Mr Pointer and Mr Kingscote that their joint endeavour flowing from the ‘pact’ or agreement which these parties made to devote their time and energies to philanthropic causes makes this union, of itself, a special partnership.  From that partnership flowed obligations and responsibilities and each performed his and her part in discharging those responsibilities to the fullest extent possible.  Just as the wife’s effort was not rewarded by any financial benefit, so, too, the husband’s work in managing the significant investment maintained by the Foundation in the TCI Fund was given freely and without any charge for management fees.</span>

If that is the correct approach, how does one value each element of that equation?  Do I adopt the precise and formulaic approach embraced by Mr Marks and Miss Clarke in their closing submissions and award the wife a certain percentage of the marital acquest as my baseline and only one half of that percentage of the separation accrual in addition?  If that is the right approach, how then do I go on to reflect in my overall award a value or discount for the fact that for over two years in the post-separation period the wife and husband have not been providing the mutual love, comfort and support which was a feature of their married lives together?</span>

I have not made an allowance for these in the adjusted Net Asset Register for reasons which I have explained (see paragraphs 137 to 139 and 188 (iii)).  Whilst it is true that they reflect a significant amount of post-separation endeavour and new investments represented by the husband’s unmatched contribution, they are nevertheless likely to fall in (in whatever sums eventually become payable) as a significant accretion to the substantial income he generates through receipt of his share of the management fees.  In that sense they are, in my view, more properly categorised as a quasi-income receipt rather than a capital receipt.  Because of the impossibility of drawing an accurate ‘bright line’ in determining what value should properly be attributed to the ‘marital’ element of this category of receipts, I have decided that the fairer way of dealing with this aspect of the case is to reflect the husband’s far greater future income as one aspect of my determination in respect of the overall fairness of the percentage division which the wife will receive.</span>

In my view, it can properly be described as being stratospheric in comparison with the sums this court is used to seeing, even at the upper end of the scale in ‘big’ money cases.  From the husband’s disclosure, Mr Pointer was able to extract his income figures for the last three years; there was no challenge from Mr Marks to the accuracy of his calculations.

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:11pt">This has a direct bearing on the ability of the husband to re-trench in capital terms.  On the basis of the husband’s evidence that he can make a 24% return for himself, Mr Pointer’s maths demonstrate that, on the basis of his current offer to the wife, he will be back where he is now in capital terms within a 12 month period.  If he were to retain less than US$1 billion for himself (the figure which represents the net effect of his current proposal), it might take him slightly longer.  But the point remains a valid one, in my view.  His potential to earn back (and thus restore) within a relatively short period any sums he has to pay to the wife at the conclusion of these proceedings is self-evident on the basis of his track record to date.  In my view there is no likelihood of his ‘ceasing operations’ in the foreseeable future. In order to achieve a fair outcome at the end of this marriage, I therefore find that I can properly reflect in my award to the wife an element of the likely disparity in their wealth going forward, both as a result of the capital appreciation and income generation which will be achieved by the husband on his share of the assets but not by the wife on her share.</span>

I should say only this in terms of the wife’s obligations.  Her future within the UK Foundation will be the subject of a future determination by the board of trustees.  During the course of the hearing, I asked Mr Pointer whether it was any part of his client’s case that, in the event of her ceasing to be involved, she ‘needed’ provision as an element of her award to enable her to continue with her philanthropic work.  There is already over US$140 million in the US Foundation of which she is a trustee with three others.  Mr Pointer made it clear that he was not seeking to elevate this aspect of the wife’s case to a separate head of ‘need’, although he asked me to bear well in mind that she clearly feels a moral obligation to those in respect of whom she has already made commitments.  I take the view that the award she will receive will be sufficient to enable the wife to continue with her philanthropic causes if that is what she wishes to do. It is no part of my function to seek to influence the UK board of trustees one way or the other, and I do not do so.  The Foundation’s assets form no part of the resources which I am being asked to divide in these matrimonial proceedings.  I merely record at this juncture that the evidence which was before this court suggests that the wife has been one of the Foundation’s most valuable assets in the past ten or twelve years.  Her complementary role to the husband’s work in the Foundation and his generation of the substantial wealth which has funded its operations has been significant.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:11pt">I have thought long and hard about this case.  For the reasons which I have given, this is a case where a significant departure from equality in the husband’s favour is entirely justified by the compounding factors of post-separation accrual and special contribution.  The husband’s proposal is too low and does not properly acknowledge the extent of the contributions which the wife has made in her own right to this marriage.  The conclusion which I have reached having taken everything into account is that the wife should receive an award of US$530 million from the available assets of just under US$1.5 billion.  That sum represents approximately 36% of the global resources (36.12%).  On the basis of current </span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:11pt">rates, it converts to a sterling sum of c. £330 million.  From that sum, the wife will bear her share of any of the contingent tax risks which materialise and she must also make provision for the escrow which will be established in respect of the tax indemnity.  In my judgment, an award at that level properly reflects her contributions and her entitlement to a fair share of both the marital acquest and the post-separation accrual in this case.  It is a result which I consider, with the orders I shall make in relation to the tax indemnity and escrow, is fair to both parties.  It reflects my considered view of the weight and relevance which I should attach to each and every aspect of the case, the totality of the evidence put before me, and the submissions (both oral and written) which were made by leading and junior counsel on both the tax and matrimonial issues.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:11pt">I test my conclusion about the fairness of this award against the framework of the distribution schedule which Mr Marks and Miss Clarke produced for the purposes of their final submissions.  We have used different computational bases.  Nevertheless, my percentage figure as a share of the global assets is not very different from the 33% and 16.6% applied in relation to the computation of the husband’s final position in relation to his primary case.  It seems to me reasonable to proceed on the basis that I can properly assume that a sum of approximately US$700 million is a fair representation of the value of the marital acquest as at March 2012, being the date of separation.  (It will be recalled that this figure emanates from an application of the March 2012 </span>

It was only in 2013 that the TCI Fund went back into profit and it has achieved exponential growth of just under US$550 million since then.  No one has attempted to quantify the extent of the value of the matrimonial ‘tailpiece’ which can properly be traced into that growth and I take the view that formulae or the application of random percentages do not assist me.  To the extent that Mr Marks and Miss Clarke accept that there is inevitably a degree of arbitrariness in their approach of applying a 50% discount to the headline percentage award in terms of calculating the wife’s entitlement to the post-separation accrual, I do not seek to criticise their approach.  Nonetheless, in striving for the fair result, it seems to me that it does not provide the definitive answer when one considers the breadth of the discretion which section 25 of the 1973 Act bestows upon courts faced with the difficult task of achieving overall fairness in cases where needs do not predominate but a departure from a position of overall equality is justified by factors specific to the individual case.  </span>

At present we are engaged, in my view, in an incremental search for a consistent pattern in the application of the principles identified by the House of Lords.  This is unlikely to happen quickly.  It needs to be incremental because of the risk that broad statements about the application of these principles can overlook their effect in different factual situations not then before the court.  Consequences can also become evident in the long as well as the short-term.

In my considered view, that sum does not do sufficient justice to the extent of her very considerable contributions to this marriage.

Given that all parties and their advisers accept (and I have found) that the risk of liability crystallising in respect of the identified risks is very low if not negligible, I do not regard any potential liability on the part of the wife to contribute to represent an unfair or unrealistic burden in terms of sharing what could conceivably, in due course, represent a diminution of the assets currently available to these parties as I have found them to be.  Her liability (or potential liability) will be limited to 36.12% of the tax, interest and any penalties charged for the period 2008/2009 to 2014/2015.  I have extended the period back to the tax year 2008/2009 because (a) it relates to a period when the marriage was subsisting and the parties operating as a partnership in all senses of the word, </span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:11pt">In terms of the scope or reach of the indemnity, I do not accede to the husband’s request that there should be a general tax indemnity which covers all and any risks outside those which have been identified and addressed by tax counsel in the schedule at Appendix 1.  I consider that it is reasonable for the wife to share in any liability arising under those risks  but not for the term sought on behalf of the husband.  My objective is to achieve a clean break between these parties at the earliest date in accordance with the statutory objective set out in s 25A(1) of the 1973 Act.  To this end, in my judgment, the indemnity should come to an end on 6 April 2019.  I do not consider it is either fair or necessary to keep the wife ‘locked in’ to potential exposure for an extended period of uncertainty until 2021.  I have well in mind Mr Marks’ arguments (and those of Mrs Chamberlain) that her exposure should last for a period of </span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:11pt">four years (ie. to 6 April 2019).  The husband’s case that it should endure for a further two years to 2021 is based on the further window which the Revenue has to take account of any carelessness on the husband’s part in submitting his returns.  Nonetheless, it is in my view too long a period even on the basis of the facts of this particular case and the complexities of the husband’s tax position.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:11pt">The drafting of the order which I make will necessarily take time and consideration. In terms of the timescale for payment of the lump sum to the wife, the parties had agreed that it should be paid within six months of the date of the order.  Because the husband had already put in place various (tentative) steps to liquidate some of his units in the TCI Master Fund by the conclusion of the hearing, and in view of the fact that my judgment was reserved, it may be that there will be agreement between the parties that she should receive her entitlement sooner.  At the conclusion of the case, Mr Pointer sought on behalf of the wife an advance payment of US$10 million which he said could and should be paid within 14 days.  If this interim payment can be the subject of agreement, it will obviously need to be paid to the wife offshore where it must remain until after Decree nisi has been made absolute by order of the court.  Such an interim payment is likely to have consequences in terms of the wife’s current interim funding regime.  If there is to be a lengthy delay of some months between the date of any interim payment and the receipt by her of the balance of the award, she may well be put in a position where she needs to bring funds onshore to meet her living expenses (including the rent on the home she is currently occupying with the children).  In these circumstances it seems to me that the preferable course is to ensure that she receives the totality of her award as soon as it can be made available to her.  I would hope that the parties and their advisers will now be in a position to agree these matters.  If they are not, I shall make such order as may be necessary in relation to timing and/or an interim payment on account but, for these purposes, I shall need brief written submissions as to time lines and the up to date position in relation to the husband’s proposed liquidation of some of his units in the TCI Master Fund.</span>
