	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10.5pt">I have been hearing a claim for financial relief under Part III of the Matrimonial and Family Proceedings Act (“MFPA”) 1984 brought by Intilaq Ali Abdul Hussein (“the Wife”) against her ex-husband, Fouid Hamadameen Ahmad (“the Husband”).  The Wife has been represented by Mr Howard Shaw QC and the Husband by Miss Sarah Dines.  They are not the only parties to the litigation.  The Second and Third Respondents are companies by the name of Kubik Investments Limited and Kubik Developments Limited.  They have not been represented, nor has any such representation been necessary.  The Fourth and Fifth Respondents are two of the Husband’s brothers, Mawlan Hamadameen Hamad (“Mawlan”) and Rokan Hamadameen Hamad (“Rokan”), who, formally, were joined as parties to the proceedings by Order of District Judge Berry dated 1</span>
	      <span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:10.5pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'">st</span>
	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10.5pt"> August 2013, with consequential directions as to service and the filing by them of pleadings and witness statements. I say “formally” because the decision to direct joinder had in fact been made by District Judge Hess on 26 June 2013; but there was a procedural muddle and the drawing up of that order was delayed.  Neither Mawlan nor Rokan has filed any pleading or evidence; nor have they been represented or given oral evidence.  Both have produced very short statements which are exhibited to a principal Statement filed by the Husband one week before trial. Later in this judgment I shall put the slender participation of Mawlan and Rokan in the proceedings in its appropriate context and also refer to applications (which I rejected) by the Husband for an adjournment on miscellaneous grounds, one of which was Mawlan’s and Rokan’s absence.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10.5pt">The above notwithstanding, it should be noted that when, for abbreviation, I use the term “the parties” in this judgment, I mean (only) the Wife and the Husband.  There are four further preliminary points.  First, for the most part and for ease of reference I shall place direct quotations (placed within inverted commas) in italic type.  Secondly, it is of the nature of translation into English of either Kurdish or Arabic text that proper names become differently spelt by different persons in different contexts. Thus, for example, the name Sairawa (which relates to some relevant agricultural land) is also spelt Sayrawa and in other ways in the documentation.  I have adopted “Sairawa”.  There are countless other such instances (such as “Fouid” and “Fouad”; and “Mawlan” and “Molan”).  Thirdly, the “$” sign (or the word “dollars”) refers in all instances to United States dollars. Finally, anyone coming to the facts of this case for the first time is invited to cast an eye at paragraph 232 below before continuing with the reading of this judgment.</span>

Sometimes (and at intervals) Mazin has in his early adulthood played professional football, albeit at a relatively low level and periodically struggling against injury; and, which is important for reasons which will emerge, he has spent substantial periods assisting the Husband in his business. </span>

My assessment of their evidence will be of high significance, because, if fundamentally it is true, it directly impugns the essence of the Husband’s case.  They insist that they are telling the truth, and that their only motivation in testifying is their determination to ensure that the Court is not misled into accepting the Husband’s version of certain events and forming conclusions which would lead to a financial relief order unfair to their mother. The Husband, in stark contrast, does not stop short of accusing Mazin in particular, but also Lara, of gross deception and of conspiring with the Wife to deceive the Court. </span>

Together with Mazin, who had been born in Romania, they moved to Gothenburg, and lived there until 1996.

To that end I shall have to determine a myriad of factual issues, of which the principal is without question the nature, extent and location of the financial resources, in circumstances where the Wife alleges grave non-disclosure by the Husband.   The single most prominent question for my decision is whether the Husband has any (and, to the extent possible, what) reckonable capital assets and income in Iraq. Reduced to a few words the issue is almost as stark as could be imagined: the Wife alleges capital assets in Iraq worth several million dollars and income which annualised is at a level of several hundred thousand dollars per annum, whereas the Husband says that, to all intents and purposes, there are no Iraqi financial resources, whether by way of capital or income. His attention is thus trained upon the UK assets, which according to him should be shared equally between the parties because, he says, there is nothing else to be apportioned between them. As to capital assets, the Husband concedes equality of apportionment in principle.</span>

As to timing, the broad position, at any rate, is reasonably clear.  Saddam Hussein having fallen from power in 2003, the Husband himself describes how he perceived the future prospect of commercial profit in Iraq, given, amongst many other things, the massive rebuilding programme which resulted from the devastation of war.  The time came when property prices and business generally in Iraq, including Kurdistan, were booming.  The evidence suggests that that is still so.  According to the Wife, the Husband (quite apart from visits simply to see his family) started travelling to and from Iraq in a year variously stated but not later than 2006 and, as per her petition for divorce, from 2008/9 was only returning to England once every 2 - 3 months for short periods of time.  In her narrative Statement she says that he was spending virtually all his time in Iraq for 4½ years before their separation.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10.5pt">Certainly, as the decade progressed the time spent by the Husband in Iraq greatly increased.  He himself has conceded that in terms of business Iraq has indeed been booming in the latter part of, and from the turn of the 2001-2010 decade, not least because of the discovery of a bountiful supply of oil; and that is what he told the various members of the family.  Great opportunity has presented: the core dispute is the extent to which the Husband has succeeded (or, as he maintains, failed) in exploiting it.</span>

Previously, Mazin said but the Husband denies, he had been acting as a sole trader, often as a middle-man, sometimes having a share in given ventures, sometimes not. By now he was casting not only his eye but an ever-increasing proportion of his professional attention and effort in the direction of business prospects in Iraq rather than in England.  That much is not in issue: what are strongly in dispute are (i) as already indicated, the extent to which such prospects became crystallised into actual business transacted with a real clientele and (ii) the real property interests which the Husband holds in Iraq and/or has held during, approximately, the last ten years.  One is talking of numerous properties in Iraq which in the proceedings have come under detailed, or in some cases lesser, scrutiny, but in none of which, with negligible exception, does the Husband admit to holding, now or ever, any beneficial interest. He has had eventually to admit that some properties were held in his name, but says that they have now been transferred into the name of Mawlan, such transfers merely reflecting what has always been their true beneficial ownership.  As to current tenure and/or ownership, he denies any whatsoever.</span>

The Wife meanwhile, as I have said, wanted to remain in England. As to the children, so did they; and it was totally unrealistic of the Husband to expect or seriously to contemplate that they might migrate (one might almost say “emigrate”, even if they are ethnically Iraqi) to Iraq. The only conceivable exception might have been Mazin, had he found business opportunity in Iraq irresistible; but, spiritually, the home of the children, is in Northern Europe.  </span>

Her strong preference, and for the most part insistence, has been that the Husband should abandon his sojourn in Iraq and rejoin the family in England.  It is to be emphasised that in happier days, lasting up to 2011, this was a close-knit family.  It is a particular tragedy that the Husband and the children have, as will become only too apparent, become starkly alienated in circumstances where as recently as only two years ago the tone and content of the dialogue between them was markedly affectionate. </span>

The Wife, putting her case at its highest, would have it that money was never an issue in the course of the marriage.  However. I think that that is an over-simplification, certainly when one comes to examine the events of 2011, as the Wife knows very well.  It is incontrovertible that there was a shortfall of several thousand pounds per month as between the EFG mortgage repayments and the rental income available from Knightsbridge Court and St Mary’s.  I accept from the Husband the broad picture that he was worried about the financial situation in England and about the fact that the terms of the EFG mortgage were distinctly unfavourable. Lara and Mazin gave evidence conceding, willingly, the Husband’s concern and, in the case of Mazin, acknowledging that business in England was slow.  He referred to a conversation which the Husband apparently had with Alan in c. August 2011 when the Husband had expressed concern and announced that vacation of Coombe End was required, so as to enable its letting and thus produce surplus income with which to finance borrowing.  It is clear that in the Autumn of 2011 the Husband did place the house for sale; but to what extent that was simply to test the market (I am sure that it would have been against the Wife’s wishes) is unclear.</span>

When the Husband initiated the hotel project in Iraq referred to later in this judgment, she realised, she says, that he did not want to return to England. She worried about the potential destination of any free cash balance from the funds generated by re-mortgage and specifically foresaw danger that those monies, or part of them, might be exported by the Husband to Iraq.</span>

Looking at the bigger picture and in the context of the central issue in the case, I regarded much of this evidence as peripheral, particularly given the relative insignificance of the figures under scrutiny.  </span>

More specifically, he says that, although he claimed to have substantial assets in Iraq, in reality he had (and has) none. Thus, he claims, whereas he, for example, asserted beneficial and freehold interests in an Italian Village property, in a Gulan Street property and in a substantial hotel project, and also a cash holding of $250,000, this presentation was a tissue of deliberate lies. He further says that, although he asserted with the support of the letter of Ms Touza an income of $400,000 -$500,000 (increasing) per annum, in truth he has never made any business or commercial profit in Iraq, and the only income he has ever received by way of salary or remuneration has been from Pristine Consultancy at the rate of $3,000 per month (and that for a limited period: see paragraph 194 below).  Thus, the Husband purports to admit to the perpetration of a fraud upon SCB and the obtaining from the Bank of property (or perhaps a pecuniary advantage) by deception:  indeed, he positively avers it.  Yet, when I asked him whether he approves of the practice of creating false documents and then making a false presentation so as to achieve an objective, he blandly stated that he does not approve.</span>

I heard a vivid description of how Lara telephoned her mother in America to enquire about marital progress, only to be told that things were not proceeding at all as she, Lara, would very much have wanted. On returning to England the Husband retreated immediately to Iraq. He and the Wife saw little of each other thereafter in England.  They clashed in Iraq later in the summer of 2012, as I shall relate.  They also encountered one another in Syria in June 2012.  The Wife went to Damascus via Lebanon with Mazin and Lara, where they visited the home of Sarah, to whom Mazin was betrothed, specifically to discuss and negotiate the matter of dowry.  The Husband paid a shorter visit to Syria a few days after they had arrived for the same specific purpose: I refer to it further at paragraph 179(ii) below.</span>

The Wife was utterly incensed both by what she had learnt of the Husband’s remarriage (whether actual or intended) and by the Husband’s pronouncement of Talaq divorce, of neither of which she had been forewarned.  She not only felt scorned but was adamant that, without her express consent (which it is not suggested had been forthcoming) the taking of a second wife by the Husband was contrary to Iraqi law.  She had made no bones about telling the Husband in the conversations recorded on SKYPE that she would have him put in prison for his transgression.  She was true to her word.  Between July and October various police procedures and court proceedings happened in Iraq. The Husband started them, and there was also joint process issued by the Husband and by his brother, Gaylan.  But the principal proceedings were initiated by the Wife.  It is a complicated story.

He was what may now be described as deafeningly silent as to the previous tenure, transfers and alleged ownership of various Iraqi properties.  He said nothing then, although subsequently bitterly complaining that his family, and inferentially he, were much disenchanted that the Court had ordered evaluation of their property.  When challenged about his silence, the Husband gave make-weight explanations, including what he termed bad communication between himself and his lawyers, who he said were fighting the case in their way, and the costs consequences of such communication.</span>

It also came at a time when the Husband, I find, felt a strong sense of anger and indignation that the Wife, as he saw it, was failing in her duty to uproot herself from England to Iraq.  He was of the opinion that she had no right to share in any commercial success of his in Iraq. This conclusion is supported, but by no means dependent upon, extracts from the SKYPE dialogue.  In its course the Husband variously complains that the Wife has not helped him at all; that it was she who left him by not coming to Iraq; that he warned her to return, but she had not returned; that, when she herself went to Court, she had woken him up; that Iraqi resources (he was dealing with the Italian Village at the relevant juncture) were none of her business; and that, if she did not come to Iraq, there was nothing for her at all. </span>

The Wife was given permission to rely on her existing valuations, with a time limit imposed as to further valuations. The Husband was given permission to adduce his own expert evidence of the valuation of real property in Iraq in response to that relied upon by the Wife.  In both instances the valuers were enjoined to use their best endeavours to comply with the requirements of Part 25.

Few, if any, of them will have taken the Husband by surprise.  The Husband meanwhile produced a Statement which, in terms of the subject-matter which one would have expected to be covered, omitted more than it included.  It did, however, attach one-page statements of Mawlan and Rokan.  The Husband also raised, to an extent exceeding anything said previously, allegations of fraud and bribery against the Wife and Mazin, and put in material casting aspersion upon the Wife’s Iraqi valuations, to which I refer again in paragraph 184.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10.5pt">A number of issues arise in connection with the Iraqi proceedings, even if, as in the case of the issue as to the Husband’s remarriage, the proceedings (in the absence of a finding by me of reckonable conduct) do not impact directly upon the assessment of financial resources in Iraq and therefore the quantification of any financial relief award. The principal issue from the Husband’s viewpoint arises from the obvious untruth of any assertion by the Wife that he had misappropriated $5m of funds which she had supplied from her own earnings whether as a doctor or otherwise. The Husband says that this complaint is what landed him in jail, but the documents make clear that the catalyst for his imprisonment was in fact the charge, and admission, of remarriage. It is very understandable that the Husband should have latched very firmly onto this extract from the record of the Iraqi proceedings.  He first raised the point in his Form E and thus exposed what is a mystifying conundrum. On the one hand, it seems incredible that the Wife would make an allegation which is so far from the truth, so easily disprovable and so likely to be exposed in the English proceedings.  She insists that the inaccuracy arose only from misunderstanding arising from linguistic difficulties (she not speaking Kurdish) and that, as soon as she realised that what she had told the police in Erbil had been so badly misinterpreted, she took steps through her Iraqi lawyer to return to the court and set the record straight.  There is also the point that her Statement varies considerably from what Mazin told the Erbil police, whereas, if she was intent upon portraying a radically false picture, one suspects that they would tell a harmonised story. Mazin too told me that his allegations against his father had been misunderstood: specifically, the officer to whom he spoke found it impossible to understand the concept of a re-mortgage as he had sought to explain it.  That said, the Wife’s narrative to Othman was a great deal wider of the mark than Mazin’s.</span>

Given the Wife’s furious reaction against the Husband arising from her genuine conviction that the Husband had both remarried without her knowledge and consent and had surreptitiously removed family assets to Iraq, I think it probable that, in describing the history to the police in Erbil, she became carried away and resorted to a degree of exaggeration, but to a precise extent which I am unable to specify.

In oral evidence he made various assertions to the effect that the video tape of his interview with Othman was incomplete in as much as there had been previous conversation between them and that the transcript of what does appear on the video is inaccurate.  </span>

The fact is, however, that his allegations are completely unsubstantiated and I have no reason to suppose that the complaint will be successful.  Indeed, reading the transcript, one finds it difficult to understand precisely what it is of which the Husband complains, given that the interview was not the only occasion upon which he confessed to remarriage and, that matter apart, there is nothing unduly prejudicial to him in the transcript. The key point, however, is that at no stage, although he has had a copy of the video (or it may be DVD) in his possession since 30</span>

It is notable too that, whereas the Husband has alleged that Othman threatened him, and pleads in the Defence that under the prevailing conditions any person would have said anything to be released, elsewhere he explains his admission of remarriage as motivated by a wish to have his wife return to him, which is markedly different.</span>

Nothing was said about him in the Husband’s Defence.  In oral evidence the Husband, who gave a florid description of Rasheed as being the most corrupt man in Iraq, said that in about March of this year he, Rasheed, had told him in Iraq that he had been in receipt of a bribe from the Wife, whom he had met both at a hotel in Iraq and also at her home (i.e. Coombe End) in England.   Rasheed had given him a detailed rationale, he said, as to why he had given the Wife his support in Iraq.  The Wife and Mazin (to whom the allegation of a meeting at Coombe End was put) vehemently denied the allegation, or any wrongdoing.  Tariq Rasheed, they explained, was the specific person to whom they had been referred by the Kurdistan Regional Government in the (bureaucratically tortuous) process of obtaining official Iraqi documentation.  On the evidence before me I much preferred the Wife’s version of events, and have to reject the Husband’s allegations, which it is fair to say were not substantially pursued by Miss Dines.

When the Wife was giving oral evidence, it was put to her that she and Mazin had jointly offered such a bribe.  Later, when Mazin was giving evidence, Miss Dines made it clear that, whereas the suggestion she had made to the Wife accorded with her instructions at that time, her instructions had changed: the Husband was now asserting that Mazin (and Mazin only) had been involved. Diler Sabir is a name which appears in the SCB documentation: it seems that potentially he might have become involved in the due diligence process.  He was according to an email sent by the Husband to Mazin a lawyer who had worked freelance for Pristine at one time.  This suggestion of attempted bribery, strongly denied by Mazin and, again, flimsily based on hearsay evidence, has to be rejected. </span>

Just why this was to the advantage of Mawlan or any of the siblings was never satisfactorily explained. The same applies to another reason advanced, namely that the Husband had property in England.

The Wife, Lara and Mazin are adamant that the Husband’s family is of a financially poor background, such that as recently as the 1990’s the majority of its members lived in one, albeit substantial in size, house.  The Husband bridles at this suggestion: for example, he says, which seems to me improbable, that when all those years ago he was at university in Romania his father provided him with an annual stipend of $70,000 by way of support.  The Wife says that Mawlan and Rokan have relatively modest occupations: Mawlan is principally a teacher and Rokan sell fireplaces and bricks imported from China.

In their statements Mawlan and Rokan say nothing about their income, occupations and general financial status.  Mawlan does mention in his Statement a large loan, but puts no flesh on that bone.

None of that has happened.  No documents are produced.  No pleadings have been filed by them.  As matters stand, their participation, and their evidence, are flimsy and of little consequence.</span>

It is highly likely, however, that accession to this submission would result in the local authority never recovering the debt.

The current case is distinguishable.  The Wife’s financial position, even if the court awards her the UK assets, may not be particularly enviable when related to the lifestyle enjoyed during the marriage; but she will be far removed from homelessness or penury.  I take the view that on the facts of this case the Confiscation Order has produced a liability upon the family which should be regarded, albeit loosely, as a shackle upon the equity in Berkhamsted Avenue; that, if the liability is left to be discharged solely by the Husband, it is likely to be unenforceable; and that, on balance, the justice of the case is that the monies owing should be recoverable by the local authority from the equity in the property.

The Husband’s explanation for his denial is to the effect that, Mazin being the owner of a property at 59, Avenue Road, Kingston, he, the Husband, does not regard his share of the Munster Road equity as owned by himself, because he has hypothecated it to one or both of the other children.  I say “one or both” because he variously stated that his interest in Munster Road was owned by both children, and then that it was or was to be owned by Alan on the basis that Berkhamsted Avenue would be owned by Lara. </span>

There was no argument from counsel about it, although (I assume as a matter of formality) the Husband says in stating his open position that the deductions from the sale of the UK properties for which he contends should include “</span>

The key proposition which derives from the report is that, providing that the Husband is not properly found by HMRC to have been resident in the United Kingdom in the tax year 2013/204, a sale or transfer by him of the real property assets in his name will not result in any liability for CGT. Mr Dodge was instructed to the effect that the Husband is not resident in the United Kingdom; the Husband stated in terms in his November 2012 Statement that he was habitually resident and domiciled in Iraq; and he made it clear to me in oral evidence that he has no intention of returning to this country (now or ever).  In response to a written enquiry of mine after closing submissions Miss Dines, having taken instructions, conveyed only that the Husband has not registered for non-domiciled status in the UK and fears that CGT may be payable.  In these circumstances I proceed upon the basis that any potential CGT liability can be ignored.   </span>

In summary, the purported invoice refers to a demolition and new build, the demolition being 85%-90% of the existing building. It refers to rear extensions, side extension and loft extension to be built and gives other descriptions of work in language more readily suitable to a quotation than an invoice at the conclusion of a project.

He has known for a very long time that this liability is alleged by the Wife to be completely bogus. Supported by Lara and Mazin, whose evidence I broadly accept on the point, the Wife says that Gaylan’s involvement in the work at Coombe End was limited and of a relatively mundane nature. The detail was not investigated, but a brief description was given of other (apparently Polish) builders who did the main work, which in accordance with the planning permission granted, it is emphasised on behalf of the Wife, was not a virtually full demolition, but the building of extensions.  What is more, says the Wife, the date of the only copy invoice produced betrays its lack of authenticity, because, whereas it is towards the end of 2010, the work at Coombe End  was, as evidenced by input from an involved professional firm named Harper Tweedie, completed in August 2009.

The Wife and in particular Lara were adamant that Gaylan when in England was, and is now, a man of very limited means who according to them had run a fish and chip shop at one stage and even relied upon the State to pay his rent on the property in Wimbledon which he and his wife occupied.  Lara also pointed to a conversation she had with Gaylan’s wife, who had intimated to her that Gaylan had little money.  Be all that as it may, there is certainly no evidence that Gaylan is a man of wealth in a position to wait for several years for payment of such a large debt (which, if it is authentic, would have been consistent with Gaylan having to pay very substantial disbursements, for materials and labour, which would have put him severely out of pocket). </span>

Specifically, a sum of £175,000 was, he said, paid to Gaylan by Portners in 2012, of which £150,000 was in reduction of the principal sum owing.  This is an impossible explanation, because the re-mortgage funds did not materialise until 2012, 16 months after the date of the invoice.  Moreover, if it be true that in 2012 (c.18 months after the Husband’s Form E) £150,000 was paid to Gaylan in reduction of the debt (strenuously disputed by the Wife), then on the Husband’s case the sum outstanding would now be reduced to £483,400; but the Husband has alleged throughout the proceedings that the higher sum is owed, which makes no sense.  In his September 2013 Statement, he said that one of the liabilities which according to him should be met from a global sale of the UK properties is, as he puts it, “[a] loan to Gaylan Baiz £633,400”. </span>

The figures in this judgment make it abundantly clear that, if the loans are real and payable, no balance of funds for any venture in Iraq would ever be available, and the Husband must know that.</span>

It was called Lara Cosmo Clinic.  In about 2009, in circumstances almost inevitably in dispute as to whether it was at the Husband’s or at the Wife’s behest, the business was terminated.

However, he has adduced no evidence in support of that proposition. He simply says that the Wife has past experience, and established skill, in beauty treatment and that there is no reason why she should not turn her hand to techniques, for example the giving of treatment by injection, which exceed her previous experience and will require further training. It is clear that he also deems it important that the Wife obtained, albeit over 30 years ago, a degree of medicine and had some limited training or as she says work experience in nursing at a hospital a considerable number of years ago.  Alternatively, he says, if she would come to Iraq, she could be recognised and practice as an actual doctor.  That is a proposition which seems fanciful.  </span>

She is 54 years old on her next birthday, and has had at best limited success in the field of beauty treatment over the years to which I have referred.  It is true to say that I found her very defensive on the subject: she relied heavily upon her age which according to her would prelude employment and certainly did not show willing.  My instinct is that she may have a limited earning capacity if, once Coombe End is sold, she turns her mind and directs true effort to the search for some work, which she should; but arithmetically the quantum of any earnings achieved would probably have only marginal effect.  Certainly, the Husband needs to understand that, if this issue were to be resuscitated in the future, it is unlikely to be resolved in his favour in the absence of much harder and more reliable evidence than has emerged at this hearing. </span>

In her July 2012 Statement, in describing the Husband’s Iraqi assets, she identified “ …. hotel: US$1-2,000,000”.

The Husband denied that in the conversation it was the hotel being referred to, but the transcript gives the lie to that denial, which looks absurd.</span>

She expanded in her narrative Statement, stating that she and the Husband had in fact gone to the German Village with her friend Niaz and Niaz’s sister; the Husband had told her that the properties were being purchased only as investments; and she had now obtained valuations of German Village properties and believed that they were worth $300,000 each.

Whether the Husband now has as many as three fully unencumbered properties in German Village worth the amounts asserted by the Wife I do not know; and, again, I am mindful of the absence of Land Registry corroboration.  The extent of my uncertainty, however, is substantially the fault of the Husband, who I conclude has not been fully frank as to German Village.  His Defence, as in other instances, does little but create further confusion. The Wife had claimed a declaration that the Husband is or has been the legal and beneficial owner of and/or controls “the German Village house”, although it is apparent from the text on the previous page that the word “house” is a typographical error for “houses”.  In similar manner to his pleading re the summer house, the Respondent pleaded that “</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10.5pt">the German Village house [was] never either registered to him or beneficially owned by him</span>
	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10.5pt">”.   This again involves an implied admission that there is an area named German Village and that there is or are a house or houses the existence of which the Husband recognises, albeit not its / their ownership.  This approach is radically contrary to his oral evidence, where the Husband imputed to the Wife and Mazin total fabrication.</span>

Then, under the heading “The [Wife’s] Case” it is said that in 2011 the Husband and Mazin visited the estate agents who were selling the Ashti properties; the Husband had purchased a number of them; and it is unknown whether he still holds them or has sold them, as to which he is put to strict proof. Under the closing “Claim” heading the relief sought as to Ashti is a declaration or finding that the Husband is the legal and/or beneficial owner of “the Ashti house”, which is puzzling because according to the previous narrative the house had been sold in 2012.

She stated a recollection that the Husband bought four properties in Ashti although she has only obtained proof in respect of one property, as to which she remembers that on its sale the Husband showed to Mazin and her the cash received.  Mazin supported this case in his Statement, saying that he had been with the Husband to an estate agent where he made a payment for one property in Ashti, although he recalled that he had in fact purchased four properties in Ashti in all.  He recalled an occasion when the Husband sold a small plot of land in Ashti, on which occasion he pulled the cash proceeds out of the bag and they covered his, Mazin’s, bed.  The Husband said that a particular photograph scrutinised in cross-examination depicting a wealth of cash was in fact to do with a loan of cash from Mawlan to the Wife for the purchase of a property.

In her Particulars of Claim the Wife pleaded the 2006 purchase and identified the area in question as 71 dunams (which per official documentation it is). She says that the land is used for agricultural purposes and provides a profit for the Husband, as to which she puts him to proof, but that she is aware that it will be very valuable in the near future if planning permission is allowed for building construction, which is probable.  She says that the Husband has spoken of the potential of his land if planning permission should be granted.

I find this difficult to believe.  Not only does openness and accessibility accord with the seemingly obvious rationale behind any Land Registry, but the fact is that the Wife has managed to obtain extensive Land Registry documents to do with properties which have stood in the Husband’s name.  Further, the Husband, who must on his case know the precise location of the property or properties in Najaf which interest him, failed, in particular at the February 2013 hearing, to seek any direction as to their evaluation in the terms, for example, of the direction obtained by the Wife the detail of which is at paragraph 50 above.  </span>

There is no evidence of transactions involving comparable property and the observation that that is apparently the way they do it in Iraq affords no comfort.

This was the first time that any such proposition had been mentioned (it is not mentioned in the Family Minutes); and it is notable that, when in questionnaire the Wife asked for details of the qualifications and architectural experience of Rokan (impliedly enquiring how his 75% shareholding could possibly be justified), the Husband replied “.... </span>

What does emerge from an examination of the evidence, however, is that yet again the Husband’s evidence paints an improbable picture and is internally inconsistent.  He went to Iraq to exploit what he hoped and came to perceive were rich business opportunities.  Eventually, he incorporated Pristine and used it as the vehicle, or certainly the principal vehicle, for his commercial enterprise.  In the world of property development, construction and architecture he had considerable experience.  He had a team around him consisting of his General Manager, Parvez, two architects, a structural engineer and two secretaries. Nothing that he has said or that emerges from the wealth of documentation persuades me of the likelihood that he would ever structure his business in such a way that he was in reality a 25% beneficial shareholder. I am confident that as between himself and his brothers he has been regarded as the sole, or certainly a strongly majority, shareholder.</span>

It is uncertain on the evidence how long the total period was in aggregate, but my impression is that a not insignificant number of months during the overall 2 – 2½ years were spent in the UK, and some time was also spent in Iraq away from Erbil in connection with his football activity.  He was, however, in contact with his father when in the UK and seems to have had considerable, but not comprehensive, knowledge of his father’s activities.  He was very clear in his evidence that the Husband had informed him that he was making big profits. If so, it was hardly surprising, given that generally business in Erbil was booming (this is common ground), and the Husband, who in fact speaks 7 languages, had good underlying qualification and experience for the purposes to which his efforts were directed. Mazin believed his father, and in my judgment for good reason: in August 2011, for example, he was writing to him in his attempt to persuade him to return to the UK and observed that over in Iraq people loved the Husband for his money, but here in the UK it was his family that loved him.</span>

(In Form E he had said that he was “often” paid in cash, which is not a trivial inconsistency). It should be noted, however, that later he did attempt, so it seems, to put something of an official stamp of upon his previous assertion of low earned income by producing a document dated 10/12/2012, addressed to the solicitors of Pristine and headed “The Report of Auditor”. It is signed by a man whose last name is Al-Saidi and says that the author has checked the overall budget of the company as it was on 31/12/2011, the result[ing] calculations and the annexed statements for the financial year ended on the same date.   He continues inter alia to the effect that the company has not practised any activity that achieves revenue during the year. I regard this document as of no probative value.   Apart from being mindful of the Husband’s case as to his engagement of Ms. Tousa, I observe that the large OMV contract was in place throughout 2011, and none of the documents Al-Saidi states he has seen and no figures have been produced.   </span>

The Wife suggests that the Husband would hardly have flown to Italy, which apparently he did, to finalise the deal if it was going to prove unviable. She also refers to an email from the Husband to Mazin in November 2010 in which he told him to email Mr Natuzzi himself and state that Pristine were ready and “</span>

He was carefully asked whether he wished to alter anything in his Defence as being inaccurate, to which he replied that he did not.  In that document he talked specifically of plural contracts with multi-national companies.  This cannot be an error: yet he declines to identify them (save as to OMV).

I am confident that by 2010 – 2011 he was involved in his own right and/or through Pristine in some significant number of income-producing professional engagements, as I am also that over a period of several years he was involved in a significant number of property transactions.  It is impossible for me to know the precise level of the Husband’s income (which he stated to SCB was up to $500,000 per annum).  Nor do I know whether, with an eye to these proceedings, the Husband has reduced his commercial activity. My ignorance is once more, to state the obvious, the Husband’s doing.  I conclude on the evidence that he has an earning capacity of some hundreds of thousand dollars p.a.  Doing the best I can, and allowing for the possibility of past exaggeration, I put it at not less than $300,000.  It could certainly be more, up to £500,000.</span>

Nor did he totally mislead SCB about his Iraqi assets and income.  As to assets, on his own case SCB were not exercised about Iraqi assets at all; but, that apart, he would have been well aware of the risk that it might be searchingly checked by SCB as part of the due diligence exercise the prospect of which he knew about.  The same applies to income, as to which I regard it as improbable in the extreme that the Husband would brazenly state an income of $500,000 per annum when in truth he had no income whatsoever.  Exaggeration is one thing, and a possibility in this instance, but pure myth another.  Further, as I have indicated, very little weight can be given to the evidence of Mawlan and Rokan.

As to the Wife, it seems to me an inevitability that, whether or not she achieves ultimate retention of all UK assets, the properties at Coombe End, Knightsbridge Court, St, Mary’s and Berkhamsted Avenue (and probably The Downs too) will have to be sold without significant delay.  When I put this proposition to Mr Shaw during his closing submissions, he simply responded that the Wife would very much like to maintain her residence in Coombe End.   That may be so; but I am sure that the aspiration is unrealistic, given the size of the SCB mortgage and the express recognition by the Wife through Mr Shaw that the Wife can in practice expect to achieve no recourse to Iraqi financial resources.   So, the Wife will have to move to alternative accommodation; but at what cost?  It will need to be sufficient to house herself and, for a few years, Lara.  (I have no doubt that she will want to provide the facility of a home for Alan too at least for the short-term future, but this is not strictly her obligation).   Even when Alan and Lara have left home, she will have the need for at least three-bedroomed accommodation with, therefore, adequate guest facilities.</span>

I reject summarily the Wife’s contention that, on the assumption that the Husband has in fact remarried and did so without her permission, and further that that would be contrary to Iraqi law, his action in doing so is conduct which it would be inequitable to disregard and should sound in the computation of financial award.  Remarriage in whatever circumstances does not qualify as such conduct any more than the Wife’s behaviour in pursuing Iraqi legal proceedings with a view to achieving the Husband’s incarceration. Making due allowance for cultural considerations arising from the parties’ ethnic origin and religious convictions, I nevertheless find unattractive, but no worse than that, both the Husband’s failure to give notice of intended remarriage and the Wife’s determination to have him punished so dramatically.  </span>

For avoidance of doubt, Miss Dines and her instructing solicitors do not represent Mawlan or Rokan: the application was made by the Husband, in relation to whom Mawlan and Rokan were potential supporting witnesses.  As such, it should have been apparent to the Husband for many months past that it was incumbent upon him to put his house in order by adducing properly constituted evidence from Mawlan and Rokan and taking all necessary steps to ensure either their presence in England for the giving of oral evidence or the hearing of such evidence by video-link between England and Iraq.  It is elementary that, to that end, the necessary arrangements, both in terms of visa applications and the appropriate application to the court for video-link hearing of evidence, had to be made promptly and efficiently.  All I received was an indication that the UK Consulate in Iraq had not responded to attempted telephone (and possibly email) enquiry about the non-receipt of the necessary visas; nor had the Principal Registry of the Family Division reacted to similar enquiry about the possible organisation of a video-link hearing.  There was no suggestion that any personal attendance had been made upon the Consulate or Registry in an attempt to advance the matter. Plainly this was not good enough.</span>

The Husband had had many months during which to put his case in proper evidential shape; and the opportunity to collate evidence from Gaylan, Sidek Rashheed or Kareem had existed for many months.   Even if it be the case that the information from Sabir has come to the Husband only very recently, its substance would be too flimsy to justify adjournment of a 2 week trial.   It goes without saying that, in the context of a renewed application for adjournment made 17 days after the conclusion of oral evidence and on the very day of projected closing submissions, only a totally compelling ground for adjournment would be sufficient to engage the Court.  </span>

Miss Dines was reduced to submitting that there is what she calls a cultural issue, of which I should take judicial notice.  Iraqi people, she says, are prone as a matter of custom, and perhaps personality, to give short or what Miss Dines termed blunt responses without supplemental explanation.  Similarly, she says, the Husband’s general failure to provide documentation save in rare instances should be regarded as resulting not from any unwillingness to do so, but from a natural disinclination, culturally based, to engage in this manner.  The above description is largely framed in my words, but I think that it fairly reflects the thrust of Miss Dines’ submission, which I have no hesitation in rejecting. I recognise no such phenomenon, of which, moreover, there is no extraneous evidence.  I do not doubt that the Husband’s failure to produce supporting documents, which Miss Dines has sensibly recognised is highly prejudicial to him, stems in many instances from their non-existence. </span>

I have to record my conclusion that the Husband has failed to establish any of the propositions mentioned. Moreover, in general terms I much preferred the evidence of the Wife, Lara and Mazin, both individually and collectively, to that of the Husband.   The Husband was an unimpressive witness by any standards, both in demeanour and in the substance of what he had to say.  Allowance must certainly be made for the fact that his English, whilst adequate, is far from perfect and for the genuine need from time to time for a question or line of questioning to be repeated, explained or expanded.  But I was satisfied that the Husband for the most part fully understood the theme and the detail of Mr Shaw’s questions in cross-examination and that all too often he demonstrated not so much an inability as an unwillingness to give a straight answer to a straight question which was often explicable only by reference to the unreliability of the case he had been or was now advancing. There were many inconsistencies and self-contradictions in his oral evidence, only relatively few of which are referred to in this judgment.  Mr Shaw produced several pages of examples in his written closing argument.   I concur with the vast majority of them.  Miss Dines, meanwhile, (through no fault of her own) challenged virtually none of them. </span>

Certainly, she was capable at times of exaggeration, as I have mentioned, and I take account of that.  Miss Dines did her best on her instructions to demonstrate that the Wife has, as she put it, an inclination to massage the facts when it suits her.  So, on instructions, she spent a great deal of time examining with the Wife the content and purpose of a reference which a Dr Zainy had written many years ago upon the strength of which she applied either for some sort of traineeship or as she says work experience in a hospital in London.  Her (in the scheme of things limited) financial transactions with Mazin came under scrutiny.  And there were many other examples.  To Mazin too, many similar suggestions were made designed to impugn his credibility, for example to do with a representation as to the precise usage of Lara’s car made for the purpose of its insurance; his time spent and not spent living at Coombe End; a property owned by him in Avenue Road, Kingston; his mortgage arrangements on that property; and so on.  Years ago Mazin was in trouble for possession of some sort of stun gun.  The Husband was exercised by this irrelevant fact and tried unsuccessfully to deploy it to his advantage.   </span>

Their mode of giving evidence was, in each case, measured and straightforward; and there were times when each was willing where appropriate to concede a point or recognise that, on a given matter, there was limitation to what they were saying.   Crucially, I formed the strong impression that the reason why they had stepped off the fence to support their mother was their sense of indignation, and of threatened injustice, arising most particularly from the Husband’s denial that he has any significant financial resources in Iraq.  I acquit them of any improper motive, including in particular financial gain for themselves, as was put to them by Miss Dines in cross-examination on instructions. For completeness, I add that I believed Mazin to the effect that he never intended to threaten his father (save with the prospect / fact of these proceedings).</span>

This is a judgment which is perhaps 25-30% longer than what might be regarded as the norm for a 13 day case of this type.  That is a matter of regret, but there are good reasons, to do with certain exceptional features and the plethora of detail.  Even now there are many areas of evidence and dispute to which no reference is made in this judgment, but I confirm for avoidance of doubt that I have taken account of all the evidence and argument and the omission of material arises from my conclusion that it is unhelpful and/or irrelevant to my decision.</span>

The first relates to liabilities asserted by the Husband, not those which are yet to be paid and therefore still owing, but those which have already been discharged in particular from the SCB re-mortgage monies.   The second is to do with the arrogation to himself by the Husband of the net balance of rental receipts received from the properties at Knightsbridge Court, St Mary’s Road and Berkhamsted Avenue since March 2012. In each case one immediately has a strong sense of the bird having flown, in that any funds properly regarded as misappropriated by the Husband will by now either have been expended by him, whether in the UK or Iraq, or possibly are now held in Iraq.

Both Husband and Wife signed what was termed a Financial Statement, the bottom line of which was that, the SCB re-mortgage monies received and all costs, liabilities and disbursements discharged, the balance available to the clients was £370,390.75.  The Wife says that she simply did not read the Statement in its detail and, as ever, signed it “blind”, a proposition upon which, predictably, she was robustly cross-examined. The three discharged liabilities which the Wife has challenged are “Laith loan repayment £115,000; Jalal loan repayment £112,000; and Sheik Tahir and Gaylan £175,000”.  The Laith loan repayment is said by the Husband to have been in respect of works effected to 23 St Mary’s Road and, whereas as ever there is a lack of corroborative documentation, in this particular instance I am not prepared to conclude that the indebtedness is invented: it does have some ring of truth about it.</span>

There was, I accept from the Wife, a clear understanding that those rental monies would be utilised to make each month a substantial contribution towards discharge of the overall mortgage interest liability.  In the event, however, the Husband has had the use of a large proportion, certainly in six figures in sterling. I shall not descend to such detail as was examined, because the necessary particulars are in large measure notable for their absence.

Plainly, if the Wife were awarded all or some of her costs (for my decision in default of agreement) and, if such order is implemented voluntarily or were to prove enforceable, the Wife’s capital fund after purchase of alternative accommodation would be substantially enhanced.  The latter is a proverbial big “if”.  That consideration, put to one side, the Wife could have a residue after housing provision of something in the region of £825,000 - £875,000.</span>

(£70,000 p.a. would require a fund of c. £1.4m).  Moreover, a strict application of Duxbury is questionable per se, as the authorities demonstrate, and for obvious reasons.  In a case where some substantial reduction in lifestyle looks inevitable, a degree of elasticity is in my view appropriate.</span>

I am not, particularly given the uncertainty imposed upon me by the Husband as to size of his wealth, prepared at this stage to impose a term.</span>
