The litigation flows from cross-applications for financial remedy orders.  The Applicant,  US (“the Husband”), issued his application in May 2011.   The Respondent,  SR (“the Wife”), issued her application some eleven months later in April 2012.  Whilst the marriage has since been dissolved, the Decree nisi pronounced in February 2013 having been made absolute the following day on 15 February 2013, for the sake of convenience I propose to refer to the parties in this judgment as “Husband” and “Wife”.  Each should be aware that I intend no disrespect to either in doing so.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The parties were married in August 2000, having by then lived together in a relationship which involved cohabitation for at least 5 years.  Three children (all daughters) were born to this couple during that relationship.  At the date of their parents’ marriage, the girls were respectively 5 years, almost 4 years and 5 months old.  A is now 19, B is 17, and their younger sister, C, is 13 years old. The commencement of the litigation was advertised in December 2010 when the Wife’s (then) solicitors served a draft Petition seeking dissolution of the marriage.  The Husband issued his own Petition in the R County Court at the beginning of March 2011.  In the years which followed, the proceedings have been characterised by increasing mutual hostility and multiple allegations on each side involving unauthorised property dealings and a failure to comply with the obligations owed by each party to the other and to this Court to make full and frank disclosure of their respective financial positions.  The proceedings have proliferated with litigation in Russia and in this jurisdiction.  Many hundreds of thousands of pounds have been spent by this family on supporting various teams of lawyers in each jurisdiction.  I am told that the total costs generated to date are now just under £1 million<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="1">
		<p class="FootnoteText">
		  <span style="font-family:Garamond">The Wife’s costs to date (including fees paid to her two previous firms of solicitors) are £381,830 (of which £289,582 has been paid).  The Husband’s costs according to the Form H which was sent to me after the conclusion of the hearing are £572,612.76 which includes an allowance of £15,000 for future costs.  He has paid a total of £564,900 towards those costs.</span>
		</p>
	      </authorialNote>, a staggering sum given that this case cannot, by today’s standards, be seen as a “big money” case regardless of the merits of either party’s case in relation to the existence of undisclosed assets.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">To state that the litigation is likely to have proved to be a financial disaster for this family is an understatement.  I have been provided with competing schedules which show that the liquid assets available to this family amount to some £4 million (depending on the value to be attributed to one of the Russian properties), with a further £1.763 million / £2.14 million held in the Husband’s three pension funds, one of which is now in payment. At the outset, each side contended that there were further undisclosed assets which were being concealed from the Court.   By the time the hearing concluded after eight days of oral evidence, Miss Bangay QC and Mr Sear abandoned that aspect of their case which relied on the existence of undisclosed assets held by the Wife.  Instead, they seek to persuade me that I should reattribute to the Wife’s account a further sum of c.£1.63 million representing either the value of properties which she has disposed of one way or another during the course of the marital breakdown at an undervalue, or being monies which she has spent or dissipated unreasonably.  Mr Ewins and Miss Headley contend that the Husband still holds (or should be treated as holding) significant but unquantified sums either in the form of cash, shares or by way of property ownership.  In their opening submissions, they contended on behalf of the Wife that the Husband <span style="font-style:italic">“must have several million pounds of shares hidden under the name of a third party”</span>.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">These are all matters with which I shall have to deal during the course of this judgment as I proceed to make findings of fact based upon all the evidence which was put before me.  However, the salutary lesson which flows from all that has occurred to date is that this couple and their children are likely to be facing a very different financial future in their retirement (for that is what beckons) from that which they might have enjoyed had matters been dealt with differently.  In terms of the allocation of responsibility for the present state of affairs, that will come at a later stage of this judgment following my analysis of the facts.  However, it is right to record at the outset that the Husband is likely to have to bear responsibility for a significant element of the costs incurred to date and the effective “derailment” of what should have been a full final hearing which was listed in contemplation of a final resolution of both the computation and distribution aspects of the cross-applications currently before the Court.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">At a very late stage of these proceedings, it emerged that he had over the course of more than two years of this litigation, and on a number of different occasions, deliberately misled the Court, the Wife and her advisers and his own legal team as to the true state of his finances.  He failed to disclose the existence of two offshore accounts (in Dubai and Jersey) one of which, as at May 2012, contained a sum of US$845,065, being undisclosed earnings from an extended contract of employment with an offshore company registered in the BVIs.  What his own legal team have since described as <span style="font-style:italic">“the big lie”</span> has, since it emerged a month before this hearing, contaminated the entire approach of the Wife’s legal team in terms of their preparation for trial.  Thousands of pages of documents have been re-scrutinised and the scope of enquiries of third parties and other entities (supported by orders which I made at the outset of these proceedings) has resulted in a situation where, as both sides acknowledged, the enquiry which I have conducted over the course of 9 days has inevitably been limited to an <span style="font-style:italic">OS v DS </span>fact-finding exercise<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="2">
		<p class="FootnoteText" style="text-align:justify">
		  <span style="font-family:Garamond">When that joint submission was made to me on Day 6 of this hearing, at the beginning of the second week, I indicated that I would keep matters under review as the evidence progressed and, in particular, as it became clear what – if any – responses there were to the third party disclosure orders which I granted the previous week.  </span>
		</p>
	      </authorialNote>. Throughout the course of the hearing, I was presented on an almost daily basis with fresh evidence in the form of responses relating to the disclosure orders which I made.  The Husband’s (admitted) lies to this Court and his deliberate falsification of evidence (which took the form of forged bank and credit card statements) is conduct of the most egregious nature.  He has shown himself to be contemptuous of his former wife and equally contemptuous of this Court.  He has been in flagrant breach of the clear obligation which he owes to both to provide a full, frank and transparent exposition of his financial circumstances with the inevitable result that huge expense, additional work and the very valuable resource of court time has been taken up unnecessarily.  The impact of that conduct on the outcome of these proceedings and any sanctions which flow from it will be matters which I shall address later.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">When this hearing commenced on 16 October 2013, after two days of judicial reading, I had before me 17 court bundles of documents.  As further evidence came to light, additional bundles were lodged.  As I write this judgment, the documentation in this case – including counsel’s opening and closing submissions – now occupies a total of 25 lever arch files.  In terms of what the Husband’s own counsel  have referred to in their closing submissions as the <span style="font-style:italic">“confusing miasma of evidence”</span>, both legal teams were confronted with a formidable challenge.   A number of satellite issues emerged during the course of the hearing with which I dealt as they arose.   I have had the benefit of detailed written submissions from counsel at the start of and conclusion to this case.  In terms of the fact-finding exercise on which I am about to embark, I have read and listened to submissions on the law and the correct approach which I should apply to the categorisation of the many issues arising.  I have already expressed my thanks to counsel for the careful and (no doubt) time-consuming investment they have made in their combined attempts to assist me in my task of establishing the facts in this case.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Husband is now 62 years old.  Following the dissolution of his marriage to the Wife, he has remarried.  He is currently living with his third wife, GS (who is 26 years old), and their 2 year old daughter (K) in a rented apartment in Kazakhstan.  His first wife, DS, to whom he was married for over 16 years and with whom he appears to have maintained a reasonably close relationship, died in January 2013.  Her death brought to an end his obligation to meet a joint lives periodical payments order, although he did not disclose the fact of her death or the cessation of that financial obligation until shortly before the start of this hearing.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Husband’s working life has been spent in the oil and gas industry.  Having graduated from University with a geology degree, he began his career in the United States.  He returned to the UK to work in the North Sea and subsequently found employment with B Corporation, which was later to become B Ltd.  Throughout the years of his first marriage, the Husband lived both in Scotland and in London.   In 1995, he was employed by G Ltd as the company’s national manager in Russia, at which point he moved to Moscow.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Thus, by the time he met the Wife, the Husband had already established a successful career in the gas and oil industry and was accustomed to living an expatriate lifestyle which had involved a number of moves.  He was in his early forties when they met whilst he was on one of his frequent business trips to Moscow.  Whilst there is an issue between the parties as to the point at which they began to live together, it matters not for the purposes of this judgment.  The Husband accepts that their relationship developed quickly and, certainly by the end of 1994, he was living in her apartment on each occasion when he was in Moscow.  Their first child, A, was born on 13 December 1994 during a visit to his home town in Scotland.  The following year, he secured permanent employment with G Ltd and the family of three moved into a rented property in Moscow, provided by his employers.  B, their second daughter, was born on 14 September 1996.</p>

At that point, the family moved into one of the properties which is the subject of the cross-applications for financial relief.

He was made redundant by G Ltd, receiving a severance package of c. £180,000.  He managed to secure a non-executive directorship with the I Ltd, a British company which ran trade exhibitions and conferences.  That position was secured in part because of the company’s extensive connections with Russia and the Husband’s experience of working in that country.   He was subsequently to accept a full-time position with  I Ltd on a salary of US$700,000 per annum.  For the next two years, he was based in Moscow whilst the Wife stayed with the children in their English home.</p>

When his employment with I Ltd ended in 2005, he encashed those options and received approximately £1.5 million on which he paid no tax because of his status as a Russian resident.  Throughout the course of the next three years, from 2005 to 2008, he was unemployed and the family was dependent upon savings he had generated over the years and the funds which flowed from the exercise of his options.</p>

His remuneration was fixed at US$500,000 net per annum on the basis, as the Husband told me, that his employer would be responsible for regularising the tax position with any relevant tax authorities.  The $½ million was to be his on a tax free basis.  In addition, for the first year, he was to receive a guaranteed contractual bonus of US$200,000 paid quarterly, together with expenses incurred for rent and utilities.

He maintained that position from his first voluntary disclosure in Form E (July 2011), through Replies to Questionnaire in February 2013 and in correspondence sent by his solicitors on his instructions.  In September 2013, he revealed not only his seamless transition into a third 12 month service contract (which in fact turned out to be a further 15 months ending on 16 December 2011) at an annual fee of US$650,000 net, but also the diversion of those funds into a previously undisclosed H Bank account which he had opened in Dubai before giving instructions to transfer the funds to another undisclosed H Bank account in Jersey.  As at mid-September 2013 when he made that disclosure, the balance in the latter account was US$873,652.  He was forced to explain how he had consciously and deliberately taken the decision to conceal the existence of that continuing income stream (and the monies he was accruing as a result).  By his own admission, he concocted a careful strategy to conceal the existence of these funds from the Wife, her advisers, his own advisers and the Court and by his actions directly implicated his employer in that plan <span style="font-style:italic">(“I therefore asked K Ltd not to pay my salary until I had thought about how I might protect those payments….”)</span>.  </p>

This was achieved by downloading the original statements online to a laptop computer and altering the numbers by means of an Adobe reader programme.  Whilst the Husband was to tell me that he did not have the necessary technical skills to undertake this task, his present wife, GS, did.

Certainly over the last two years of the marriage, the Husband had the benefit of some significant tax free earnings.  The Wife speaks in her written evidence of holidays at five star resorts three times a year and I was told about one particular family holiday spent over their last Christmas together in Bali.  The children (in particular, A) enjoyed horse-riding and I heard evidence about the costs of livery at a local establishment in Moscow, as well as the not insubstantial costs of repatriating to the UK one of the children’s horses at the end of the marriage.</p>

The Wife contends that the direct catalyst for their separation was the Husband’s decision to pursue his relationship with the woman who was to become his third wife. The Husband’s case is that the development of that relationship may have led him to conclude that divorce from the Wife had become inevitable but it was not, in isolation, the sole cause.  I have seen email exchanges between these parties which lead me to conclude that, from the Wife’s point of view, there were undoubtedly strains in her relationship with the Husband before his relationship with GS developed.  Whilst I allowed each of the parties a certain amount of latitude in their cross-examination on this point because of the context which the breakdown of the marriage provides for the more difficult analysis of the various property transactions which were ongoing throughout this period, I have come to the clear conclusion that in the weeks between April and June 2010 (which culminated in the incident at a hotel in London) the parties’ relationship was in a state of turbulent flux.  However, it is clear to me it was the Wife whose distress at its demise was more acute.  I think it is highly likely that she would have been willing to repair the marriage at several points during the early part of 2010 had the Husband not determined to pursue his relationship with his present wife.</p>

It is not difficult to understand the Wife’s predicament: she had agreed to relocate on a permanent basis with the children to a country which was not her own with all the change which such a move would bring.  She believed that she would be making that move with the security which marriage to the Husband had brought her and would continue to provide.  In the midst of the unfolding of that new chapter of family life, she found herself supplanted in his affections by a much younger woman who, at least in this Wife’s mind, was the potential usurper of much of the financial security which had been available to the family up to that point in time.  The Wife was very honest about the depth and extent of the anger which she felt towards the Husband.  As he himself accepts, she had a long history of depression and was emotionally vulnerable.  Indeed, that fragility had manifested itself in more than one episode when she had been treated as an in-patient both in Moscow and in  England. </p>

Indeed, it is part of his case that he has misled banks and individuals as to his financial circumstances in the past but he says he has told me the entire truth.  First, I must decide whether or not he did deliberately tell lies.  If I find that he did, I have to ask myself why he lied.  The mere fact that someone tells a lie is not in itself evidence that the person concerned had undisclosed assets.  An individual may lie for many reasons.  They may possibly be “innocent” ones in the sense that they do not denote a false presentation of his current financial position.  They may be lies to bolster a true case; or to protect someone else; or to conceal some other disreputable conduct or out of panic, distress or confusion.  In this case, earlier lies may have been intended to conceal a collapsing financial empire.  More recent ones may have been to conceal previous wrong doing.”</p>

There is a public interest in the proper maintenance of the wife by her former husband especially (but not only) where the interests of the children are engaged.  Partly for that reason, the proceedings, although in form adversarial, have a substantial inquisitorial element.  The family finances will commonly have been the responsibility of the husband, so that although technically a claimant, the wife is in reality dependent on the disclosure and evidence of the husband to ascertain the extent of her proper claim.  The concept of the burden of proof, which has always been one of the main factors inhibiting the drawing of adverse inferences from the absence of evidence or disclosure, cannot be applied in the same way to proceedings of this kind as it is in ordinary civil litigation.  The considerations are not a licence to engage in pure speculation.  But judges exercising family jurisdiction are entitled to draw on their experience and to take notice of the inherent probabilities when deciding what an uncommunicative husband is likely to be concealing.  I refer to the husband because the husband is usually the economically dominant party, but of course the same applies to the economically spouse whoever it is.”</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As to adverse inference, it seems to me that, particularly in the circumstances of this case, care needs to be taken in differentiating between the two separate concepts which flow from the drawing of adverse inferences against a party.  In this case I am asked by each party to draw adverse inferences against the other.  In the case of the Wife, she relies on lies told by the Husband about the existence of funds which he had always denied (but which he has now been forced to reveal) as the basis for her case in relation to the existence of other assets which he has yet to disclose.  This limb of the concept of adverse inference is likely to result in one of two findings.  Either the asset or assets (in whatever form they may take) exist and are assumed to be available to the non-disclosing party, or they do not.  Depending on the conclusion which is reached, in the second stage of decision-making as to distribution, that non-disclosing party will either be presumed to have access to those assets or he will not.  The other potential outcome from drawing an adverse inference against a party is different.  This sounds in presumed or notional reattribution.  If, for example, a judge is asked to find that a party has deliberately, wantonly and wrongfully disposed of an asset at an undervalue (let us say through an unauthorised sale of that asset at less than its open market value) and has squandered the proceeds without notice to the other party, the adverse inference which the court is likely to be asked to draw is that the party at fault should be presumed to be holding funds to an equivalent (and full) value of the asset which has been sold.  This is the process of notional reattribution which is fundamentally different from a finding that a party should be presumed to have access to funds or assets which it has found actually to exist.  Thus, in notional reattribution cases, when a judge comes to the second stage of deciding how to distribute assets as between the parties, he or she will be conducting that exercise on the basis of an assumption that a party should be treated as holding an asset or assets which it is acknowledged do not exist.  Each is a form of add-back but in one case the court’s finding is to the effect that the assets (or the value of the assets) is actually available to a party; in the other, the finding is to the effect that it should be treated as being available but is not.  </p>

As I have said, the distinction has been highlighted by Miss Bangay QC and Mr Sear in their opening submissions and I accept that the distinction is an important one because findings in respect of each attract different sanctions.  In the case of matrimonial misconduct, a positive finding against a party is likely to operate as a form of financial penalty in that party who is found to have perpetrated the misconduct is likely to receive less in terms of the quantification of the award made at the conclusion of proceedings, but subject always to the overarching consideration of fairness. Section 25(2)(g) of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 imports into the judicial discretionary process the ability, in appropriate circumstances, to take account of marital misconduct if it would be inequitable to disregard it. On the other hand, litigation misconduct, such as a failure to make disclosure of assets or a financial presentation which is established to be defective in some form or another, sounds in an award of costs.</p>

It seems to me as a matter of construction that s 25(2)(g) is plainly aimed at marital misconduct.  If the applicant’s misconduct is limited to misconduct within the ancillary relief case long after the separation of the parties, it is, in my judgment, questionable whether that factor should go to diminish the quantum of the financial award.</p>

In circumstances where, as I have already described, the majority of the visible assets in this case are likely to be required to meet the future needs of these parties and their children in their different circumstances, absent findings that either the Husband has a continuing and substantial income stream and/or has access to significant assets which he has yet to disclose, needs are likely to dominate the distribution process.  In these circumstances, and in the light of the need for caution highlighted above, I may need to tread with care before proceedings down the road to reattribution depending on the findings I make after my analysis of the evidence.        </p>

I appreciate that aspects of that evidence were technical and involved an appreciation of property law and procedure different from our own.  However, on many of the issues arising from her use of significant sums of cash realised as result of the property sales, I found her evidence to be unhelpful and unreliable. Whilst accepting, as I do, that it is not easy to reconcile historic expenditure from cash receipts without some form of contemporaneous record (which we did not have here), I was at times left in a position where I was simply unable to reach any reliable conclusions as to where money had gone.</p>

That much is acknowledged by the Wife in many of her early emails to him.  He looked after them without assistance from the Wife during his visits back to the UK and I have evidence that he was closely involved with assisting A with one of her school projects.  At one stage, when her health was failing as a result of the stress of the divorce, the Wife even suggested that he might be the better parent to care for the girls.  When A had her own psychological crisis in the summer of 2012, the parties appeared to be able to put their differences behind them for several weeks when the Husband returned to FC to be with the family.

He says that the balance of the overall cost was met through interest which had accrued on funds he had lent to the Wife’s brother-in-law (a loan about which I know no more).  Work was ongoing for about 18 months and the Husband contends that he remitted cash funds to Russia which he used to pay the builders.  He says the property was subsequently transferred into the Wife’s sole name.</p>

She has subsequently averred that any contribution which the Husband made was repaid to him in the sum of US$55,000 by way of two ‘money gift contracts’.  In her section 25 statement, she says that the Husband contributed a sum of US$25,000 which was repaid to him in May 2008.  Whilst the circumstances of its acquisition are unclear because of the conflicting accounts given by the parties, there is no dispute between them that this was the home occupied by her mother albeit that the title to the property was, until July 2010, registered in the Wife’s sole name.</p>

I say “sold” although the documentation produced by the Wife shows that the transaction was put into effect by her execution of a deed of gift to her sister.  I have seen a copy of an English translation of a Russian document, produced by the Wife, which is dated 25 July 2010 and which is headed “Land Parcels and Residential House Gift Contract”.  The contracting parties are the Wife and her sister.  There is no reference at all in the document to any consideration paid for the transfer; indeed, it is expressly stated to be a gift.  In contrast, the Wife says that the agreed price for the transfer was $120,000 with one half of that sum being paid “up front” and the balance due from her sister on an unspecified, but deferred, basis.  She has produced what is said to be an English translation of a contemporaneous “Contract for Settlement” bearing the same date as the Deed of Gift.  That document records on its face an obligation on her sister to repay the sum of $60,000 within three years on an interest free basis (this presumably being the deferred portion of the consideration).  According to the Wife’s section 25 statement, by October 2013 her sister had repaid all but £24,500 of the outstanding balance.  She says she knows not when the balance will be repaid because her sister needs to sell her own property in order to make the full repayment and there is some defect or delay in securing the registration of her ownership of that property in the local Russian Land Registry.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Wife was cross-examined about this transaction.  She accepted that the ‘Debt Contract’ had not been notarised and was unable to provide any information about the individual who had drafted it.  She was asked about the application of the first tranche of $60,000 which she said she had received from her sister.  Whilst she had stated earlier in replies to a questionnaire that it had come to her in cash and she had immediately paid it to the contractor who was carrying out the repairs to Property R, she was to retreat from that position in her oral evidence.  When it was pointed out to her that at that date she had sufficient money in her accounts to meet the cost of the repairs and that there was nothing by way of a receipt from the builders, the Wife told me that it was her practice to pay in cash (just as it was the Husband’s). I find it difficult to reconcile that evidence with the fact that she appears to have withdrawn cash of c.£9,000 from her bank accounts in three separate transactions between 2 and 9 July 2010; those withdrawals she herself had identified as being destined for the Property R repairs.  Further, she told me that she anticipated cashflow problems as her future overheads were likely to be high given that she was in the process of relocating the family (and the horse) to the UK.  It is difficult to understand in those circumstances how she felt she was in a sufficiently liquid position to loan to her family some RUB500,000 (c.£11,000) on 27 August 2010, just over a month after the sale/gift transaction had been completed.</p>

The only evidence I have in relation to the cost of repairs at Property R (said to be the reason for the disposal of the property) is a single sheet of paper which bears some manuscript figures and dates and which suggests that as at 21 July 2010, there was a balance of some RUB 1.7 million to pay which included the cost of materials and a deposit on account of the work to be undertaken.  That same document bears a headline figure of “2,350,000”.  I know not whether that is the figure relied on for the total cost of the work.</p>

I shall come back to the various documents signed by the Husband as they related to the property portfolio in due course, but it is right to record at this juncture that there is a significant issue between the parties as to the circumstances in which these documents came into existence and the Husband’s knowledge of their legal effect under Russian law. The English translation of the Gift Contract purports to have been signed on 25 July 2010 yet there is reference in the body of the document itself to an application made by “the Grantor” (the Wife) on 30 <span style="text-decoration:underline">December</span> 2010.  Whether this was an application for formal registration of the transfer of the property into her sister’s name, I know not.  It appears that registration was formally completed on 21 January 2011, so it may very well have been.  However, it does not explain why a document which purports to have been signed on 25 July should contain a reference to another document prepared some five months later, unless the original was backdated.</p>

The August 2010 valuation produced by Ms AA specifically referred to problems achieving a sale of the property because of the “lack of the road”.  These valuations she sent to the Husband by email despite having notified him by a separate email dated 31 August that year that she had sold the property.  She explained to me during her oral evidence that she had taken this step <span style="font-style:italic">“automatically” </span>in order to demonstrate the real value of Property K.  She said that she was aware that if she had not taken this step, she would inevitably have been asked why she had not done so and that she had requested property valuations for their entire portfolio because <span style="font-style:italic">“we were about to divide everything”.</span> Whilst the Wife has at various points in her evidence relied on a position that the Husband had no interest in Property K (it being outside what she has called the “marital régime”), it seems to me that even she would now acknowledge that, in the absence of a properly concluded agreement between them reflected in an order of the court, there was little option but to <span style="font-style:italic">“carry on with the process” </span>as she was to tell me in cross-examination. </p>

Perhaps of greater significance is the absence of any direct evidence from the Russian lawyers who were involved in the preparation and execution of the various documents which the parties were to sign.  Whilst I appreciate that the two sale transactions were conducted on the basis of private arrangements put in place by the Wife (and were, thus, not arm’s length transactions as we would understand the term), I would have been greatly assisted in reaching my conclusions as to the documents signed by the parties as between themselves had I had some evidence from the lawyers which each instructed at the time.  That evidence is not before the court and there has been no order for its production during the case management stages of this litigation. That is not intended as a criticism of either side’s preparation : I am only too well aware of the problems confronting the Wife’s legal team (in particular) in the run up to this hearing.  I make the point simply because, in reaching my conclusions, I have had to proceed on the best available evidence which, in many respects, leaves many questions unanswered.</p>

It was no doubt a sound investment given the rising local property market.  Property R was part of a new development which was being constructed and the property was purchased “off plan”.  The Husband has stated that he paid about US$1.7 million for the plot and the construction costs to acquire the “shell” of the property, with a further US$375,000 spent on the internal specification and ‘fit out’ costs.  I have been taken to the original contract documents which suggest slightly different costs but it matters not for the purposes of this judgment.

I propose to deal with the sequence of events in relation to this abortive transaction in my analysis of the course of the parties’ dealings with one another in the context of the litigation chronology.  For present purposes, it is enough to record that the purported sale did not proceed and litigation between the Wife and Mr AAA in Russia eventually led to a compromise agreement between them whereby he agreed to accept three months’ rent as consideration for the sale contract being set aside.</p>

Although the Wife contends that she was involved in arranging finance on this project, I have not seen any evidence of that.

The Husband remained in Kazakhstan pursuant to the contract with K Ltd (through MH Ltd) which he had renewed the previous September.  I know from his itinerary that he was frequently travelling on business and no doubt the plan was that he would return to the UK to spend time with the family as and when he could.  The Wife and children apparently intended to return to Moscow for the school holidays.  The family’s income at that point consisted of his salary (US$600,000 per annum, tax free) and the rental income from Property A and Property B.  As the breakdown of the marriage played out in the early part of that year, it was not until the summer of 2010 that the Wife and children returned to live in FC in circumstances to which I shall come.</p>

The Husband’s case is that he told the Wife he had met someone else in mid-May during one of his visits to Moscow.  The Wife’s recollection is that she received this news in February that year during one of his visits to Moscow.  She says she did not take him seriously.  When he visited the following month, in March 2010, she says that he asked her to arrange a visit to a local notary’s office so that he could sign over to her his half share in Property R and Property A.  At that stage, it appears to be the Wife’s case that these documents were intended to do no more than facilitate her involvement with the ongoing rental arrangements.</p>

The Wife contends that the Power of Attorney which he signed on that occasion in relation to Property R was designed to enable her to deal with those matters locally in Russia on his behalf.  An English translation of the document (which is dated 8 April 2010) shows that he did indeed delegate those functions and responsibilities to her for a fixed period of three years.

However, he says that his understanding, informed by the Wife’s explanation at the time, was that the document he signed was no more than a power of attorney which would enable her to manage the property and secure a reduced rate of tax on the rental income (6% instead of 13%, which would have been the flat tax rate without the benefit of her entrepreneur’s relief).  He contends that the documents were prepared by the Wife and typed up by the notary’s assistant.  He contends that he could not read or understand the formal contents (other than names and addresses) as his Russian was far from fluent.  In response to the Notary’s questions addressed to him in Russian, it is his case that the Wife effectively “coached” him in his responses although he knows neither what he was asked nor how he responded.  He says that the Wife had made it clear to him that if his answers were not satisfactory, there would inevitably be a delay whilst the documents were translated into English.  According to the Husband, there were subsequent discussions between them about Property A and the fact that she could not sell the property without his permission.</p>

The Wife says that the Husband followed up his 5 May email with a telephone call saying he would prepare all the documents and she needed simply to sign in the presence of a lawyer.  I do not accept that this call occurred and certainly not in the context of an offer by him to transfer to her outright any interest he might have had in their joint property portfolio.

She alleges she was hit with a belt with sufficient force to cause bleeding<span style="font-weight:bold">.  </span>When she told him she could no longer cope and intended to get in-patient treatment at a hospital in England (leaving him in charge of the girls), there was a further altercation during which she alleges that he assaulted her again.  The Husband denies that he behaved violently towards the Wife. I believe that her account has been embellished.  Even if there was a physical confrontation in the course of their argument, I find it highly unlikely that an injury of this severity would not find reflection in the medical records which were produced at the time.  Further, the parties’ dealings with one another in the ensuing weeks, the Wife’s decision to leave the children in their father’s care and the later email correspondence (which makes no reference to or suggestion of this level of violence) lead me to the conclusion that I can place little reliance on this aspect of the Wife’s evidence.</p>

Present at the meeting, apart from the parties, was Mr AR, the assistant to the lawyer who handled the Property R transaction.  According to the Wife, the object of this exercise was to put in place three separate powers of attorney in favour of three different lawyers who would then be in a position to complete the transfer of the title of Property R and the other Russian properties to her.  I have translations of those documents in the bundles.  The three lawyers named in the power of attorney are Mr K, Mr RA and Mr RO.

Much has been made by Miss Bangay QC of the Husband’s inability to speak fluent Russian and/or to understand the complexity of technical or legal documents.  The Wife, for her part, contends that, whilst he was not fluent, he had an adequate grasp of the language and had frequently opened conferences by addressing his audience in Russian.  Whilst the Husband’s conduct to date in this litigation causes me to scrutinise with great care and caution all aspects of his evidence to this Court, I find it is unlikely that he could, without assistance, have understood comprehensively the detailed content of these legal documents and that he was, to an extent, relying on his own subjective interpretation of what he thought he and the Wife had agreed, if not on the direct translation by the Wife of those documents.  I suspect that at that stage he was more likely to have been consumed by his new relationship and was, no doubt, suffering the inevitable feelings of guilt for the predicament in which he was placing the Wife and the children in the light of her manifest distress.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I am reinforced in this view by the fact that all personal email correspondence between the parties appears to have been conducted in English, despite the Wife’s less than perfect use of that language.  As I have recorded earlier in this judgment, she was assisted throughout the hearing by an interpreter and, whilst she appeared to understand most of the questions which were put to her, she chose to give me the majority of her answers in Russian, which were then translated to me by the interpreter.  I have not seen a single example of any form of communication directly between these parties in Russian.  If, as the Wife contends, the Husband was fluent in that language to the extent of being able to understand detailed legal documents, I question why there is not some evidence of domestic everyday communication between them in that language (which would plainly have been easier for her).  She did not seek to challenge the Husband’s evidence to me that English was the language spoken in the home during the marriage.  Whilst the children appear to have some proficiency in Russian (I know not whether they are fluent Russian speakers), the Husband never spoke Russian at home, as the Wife herself was to accept.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In terms of the emails passing between the two parties, it is perfectly clear to me that the Wife herself at no stage believed that the transactions involving the Russian properties which were undertaken in October 2009, and April and June 2010 were part of the process of implementing a clean break settlement between them.  As soon as 7 July 2010 (just a week after the incident at the hotel in London to which I shall come), she was writing to the Husband asking him for settlement proposals in the light of her intended move to the UK.  The following week, they were corresponding about the work which needed to be done at Property R, with the Husband advocating that they should sell all the properties.  At the end of August that year, the Husband was again writing to the Wife about what was to happen to the properties <span style="font-style:italic">(“You want funding but have all the property – not feasible”)</span>.  That prompted the Wife, by way of an immediate response, to forward to him details of estate agents’ valuations for the properties with an indication (for the first time) that she had sold Property K for US$120,000.  On 31 August 2010, the Wife sent a lengthy email to the Husband containing a list of 19 points, dealing with the divorce, the children’s issues and the properties.  She asked him to set out what he saw as a fair settlement both on an interim and a final basis and referred him to the valuations which had already been sent.  In that email, she refers to her understanding that he had changed his mind about giving her all the properties and concluded her email with a request that the Husband should set out in writing what he proposed before she left Moscow.  Specifically, in the event that he was intending to make a claim again the properties (option B, as she put it), she offered to <span style="font-style:italic">“cancel the registry of Property R on my name [sic] and ½ would be on your name as original”.</span></p>

Her email concluded with a further exhortation to the Husband to make some final settlement proposals.  The valuations which she had sent to him (dated 8 September 2010) confirmed that, as of that date, the properties had a combined estimated value of <span style="font-weight:bold">US$9.87 million </span>(or just under <span style="font-weight:bold">£6.5 </span>million).  By mid-November that year, she had decided to take the initiative and set out a list of her own demands in terms of settlement.  (These are the settlement terms to which I referred earlier in paragraph 74.)  By that time she had taken English legal advice, as is clear from the correspondence and the terms of her email.  Leaving to one side the feasibility of the proposals she made, this was what she was asking for by that stage :-</p>

Certainly, by 27 December at the end of 2010, the Wife sent an email to the Husband to confirm that, as he was well aware, she could not sell anything without his consent and she was not taking steps to sell.</p>

That said, these discussions were ongoing at the time when the parties (and particularly the Wife) were coming to terms with the breakdown of their marriage and all that flowed from it.

Specifically, I reject her evidence that <span style="text-decoration:underline">he</span> had given instructions to the lawyers to prepare the four spousal consents for sale and/or that he had given instructions to his lawyers to provide her with copies of the same the following October.  That evidence cannot sit with the letter which Mr J wrote on her instructions to the Husband’s solicitors on 17 December 2010.  Indeed, it is quite clear from a letter which Mr J sent to the Husband’s solicitors on 17 May 2011, some five months later, that he himself had not been made aware of the existence of the spousal consents for sale in December.  In response to a letter he had received on 6 May 2011 from McGrigors (predecessors to H’s current solicitors who had taken over conduct of his case), Mr J was responding to urgent enquiries made on the Husband’s behalf about his recent discovery that three of the Russian properties had been sold (Property K to the Wife’s sister, the sale of Property R and Property B).  No doubt having taken the Wife’s instructions, he responded by serving on McGrigors copies of the notarised gifts and consents to sale.  Whilst acknowledging, somewhat grudgingly, that the Husband might be entitled to 50% of the proceeds of Property B (some RUB13 million), Mr J maintained on the Wife’s behalf that she was perfectly entitled to sell Property K and Property R without further account to the Husband.

Whilst they were physically estranged by this point, their email correspondence over the previous fortnight demonstrates clearly the extent of the residual feelings of attachment which the Wife still had for the Husband. He, in his turn, appeared to be open to constructive dialogue in order to find a solution to their difficulties.  They are painful emails, but – at that stage - they are not angry emails.  Their overriding tenor is the need to protect the children from the consequences of the marital breakdown.  In one, the Wife appears to acknowledge the extent to which her capacity to parent the children alone in England had been compromised as a result of what she described as her <span style="font-style:italic">“mental upset”</span>.</p>

It seems to me from everything which I have read and heard about their communications at this time that, despite her contention that the marriage had broken down by April that year, she was still not through the (obviously) painful process of emotional disengagement from the Husband.  He had moved on.  The Wife was to tell me in cross-examination that the driver who took her back to the airport the following morning had also been instructed later in the day to collect GS from the airport in order that she could join the Husband.  Whether or not that was the case, it seems to me inherently unlikely that the Husband would, on 29 June, have been encouraging the Wife to stay in his hotel room.  She contends that there was a discussion between them before he left for dinner about a settlement.  Given that they had together attended at the offices of the notary to sign the Gift Deed and spousal consents only a few days earlier, effecting what the Wife believed (or so she told me) was a settlement of the Russian properties on her, I find it difficult to understand what more needed to be said.  </p>

I do not accept that she designed any such strategy.  Notwithstanding the fact that she had taken preliminary advice from a solicitor about her situation the previous day, I take the view that the most probable explanation for these events arises from the Wife’s continuing wish to engage in a dialogue with the Husband over the future of their marriage.  She was obviously in an emotionally unstable state at the time.  Had her earlier accounts of severe violence against her by the Husband been true (the drawing of blood from a blow with his belt some six weeks earlier in May 2010), then I doubt whether she would have put herself in such a vulnerable position.  I accept that the Husband did not invite her to spend the night with him in the first instance.  However, I do not absolve him of all responsibility for this incident.  I suspect that he had been drinking when he returned to the room.  I accept that there was aggression and verbal abuse given and received when he declined to take breakfast with her and, whilst it is not necessary for me to make detailed findings about who did what to whom, I am prepared to accept that the aggression manifested itself in some violence on both sides.  I tend to believe the description which the Wife gave to me of the manner in which she was pushed to the far wall by the Husband.</p>

I have referred to the contemporaneous contract which records her sister’s obligation to pay to her a sum of US$60,000 which the Wife contends represents the deferred element of the purchase price agreed between them.

She appeared to suggest during cross-examination that this was the first time she had committed the fact of the sale to writing, implying that he may have been aware of the sale because of something she had said before this date.  I do not accept that evidence.  I find that, if the transaction was indeed a genuine disposal of the legal and beneficial title to the property, it was undertaken without notice to him.  Miss Bangay QC and Mr Sear contend that the entire transaction was a sham and that the Wife is still the owner of the property.  In support of that submission, they rely not only on the deficiencies in the various documents, the absence of any reliable evidence of the first tranche of the alleged consideration having been received by the Wife, the flaws in her case as to a shortage of ready cash at the time and the fact that she appears to continue to have free use of the property whenever she is in Russia.  I have already referred to the absence of <span style="text-decoration:underline">any</span> reliable evidence as to the receipt or application of the US$60,000 which the Wife maintains she applied towards payment of the Property R repairs.  During the course of the oral evidence, I asked the Wife whether she thought it important to establish the evidence of the receipt and application of these funds in the light of the inaccurate responses she had given in her Replies to Questionnaire.  Nothing was forthcoming during the remaining days of the hearing from any source (and specifically not from her sister) and I am therefore left in a position of having to reach conclusions on the basis of the Wife’s evidence alone.</p>

As I have said, I have no evidence at all from the Wife’s sister to assist me in unravelling this legal knot.  There may well be other reasons for the Wife’s (and children’s) presence during holiday periods at her sister’s / their aunt’s property (if it is indeed now her property).  However, those doubts do not preclude an enquiry as to whether it would be right to reattribute to the Wife in these proceedings the value of the property or the sums which she has received as consideration for the transfer (including the unpaid portion of the debt which she says remains outstanding from her sister).  When the Wife was asked about why she had not produced the spousal consent to the sale of Property K when the transfer was registered on 30 October 2010 (she having received the same earlier that month), she told me that she did not have the document with her when she attended at the Land Registry and knew that she would have to pay a fine of RUB1,000 as a result of its absence.  Again, I do not have evidence to assist me with the administrative process of land registration under Russian law, but it seems to me that her response demonstrates a remarkably cavalier approach to matters.</p>

She accepts that in July 2010 when she entered into the transaction with her sister, all the Russian properties were being advertised as available for sale on a central Moscow property register; she was aware that the Husband’s position at the time was that all the properties should be sold; and she was merely waiting for settlement proposals as to the appropriate division of their assets.  She told me in specific terms that although she considered there had been an initial agreement, the absence of a formal order in the matrimonial proceedings meant that they were obliged to carry on with the process.  She agreed in response to a question from Miss Bangay QC that one of the first letters written by her (then) solicitor, Mr J, on 1 December 2010 (setting out the need for a clear agreement that neither party would significantly change their existing asset structure without agreement from the other in writing) was a sensible proposal.  Further, she accepted that she understood from the Husband’s solicitors’ response on 2 December (to which reference has been made above in relation to the undertaking not to deal with any of the four Russian properties) that no transactions were to be undertaken without prior consent.  She went on to elaborate her answer by telling me that her belief was that the reason why he had agreed to execute the gifts of his half share was to avoid paying tax on his interest in any sale proceeds.</p>

Whilst I am satisfied that that there were defects at the property which required further work (both parties agree upon that), the evidence in relation to the works which were actually undertaken by the contractors and the sums expended by the Wife in meeting these costs is far from clear.  In her oral evidence she was unable to provide me with any further assistance.   From one of her personal Unicredit accounts, she apparently made a loan of some RUB500,000 (c.£11,000) to her mother and sister just a month after the Gift Contract of Property K.  In Replies to Questionnaire, she stated that that loan was <span style="font-style:italic">“to secure a deposit for a future purchase of property”</span>.  I know nothing more about this transaction but it seems to me that it sits unhappily with the Wife’s account of a liquidity crisis.  I also bear in mind that the bank statements she has produced (which have now been collated into a chronological sequence) appear to show that, as at 8 July 2010, just over a fortnight before the Gift Contract was signed, she had RUB1.74 million standing to the credit of her Unicredit account ending …. 3385.  From annotations which she has provided in respect of withdrawals from her Unicredit account ending …0901, she appears to have withdrawn a series of fourteen cash payments, each in the sum of RUB20,000, over the course of three days from 2 to 5 July 2010.  Together these total RUB280,000.

The following month, on 20 January 2011, and without notice to the Husband (or, one has to assume, her English solicitor), the Wife agreed to sell Property B to Mr O for a total consideration of RUB26 million (about US$900,000 or £560,000 on exchange rates prevailing at the time).  The property had been valued just four months earlier by two separate agents at US$2.178 million and US$2.4 million.

She says that she did not understand how to complete the Form E and was struggling with language difficulties and making herself understood.  She says that she has never accepted that 50% of the Property B sale proceeds belonged beneficially to her husband and the use of the word “trust” was Mr T’s, rather than her own.

I find that in her initial discussions with the accountant, Mr T, she was providing information which confirmed the Husband’s potential entitlement, albeit that she has now resiled from a complete acknowledgement of that position.

Thereafter, whilst it is impossible to conduct any complete analysis, it appears that these funds too were subsequently spent on lawyers’ fees and living costs.  I do not have a breakdown, but the Wife was to tell me about significant sums she had remitted to the UK to pay her English lawyers (some £44,000 went to F Co).  There was a further dispute over the heating system in Property R which had failed and damaged the property as a result of which the Wife paid some RUB2 million to the  O Group.

First, how much – if any - of the RUB26 million which the purchaser paid should be reattributed to the Wife’s account given that this was plainly a matrimonial property in respect of which she now accepts no settlement had been reached ?  That question requires consideration and some analysis of whether she acted reasonably in spending what amounts to the entirety on those sums in circumstances where even she accepts her analysis of that expenditure is wholly unreliable.  Secondly, given that the sale to Mr O was plainly at a significant discount in the light of true market value, if there is to be a reattribution, what is the proper figure at which to fix it ?</p>

I accept that in the months between January 2011 and April 2012 (the period covered by her analysis for Form E purposes) she will have had expenditure which included not only living costs but part of the relocation expenses of moving the family back to the UK in September 2010.  She undoubtedly had both legal and medical costs, as well as rent in Moscow for a short period before Property A became available as a base for the family when they returned in the holidays to Moscow.</p>

It amounts to £946,174 (or just under £1 million in less than 3 years).  The Wife agreed in response to a question put to her during cross-examination that this is probably what she had spent.  The reconciliation shows that, of traceable funds, just under £170,000 went to her lawyers (although the Wife was to tell me that a significantly greater sum was paid out in legal costs), some £332,800 was spent on living expenses leaving unexplained cash expenditure of just over £205,000 and unidentified debits from her bank accounts of just under £240,000.  Whilst the monthly average spend increased over this period (largely because of the increased burden of legal costs from June 2011 to May 2012), it shows a flat average spend of approximately £344,000 per annum.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The late delivery of statements in respect of many of the Wife’s Russian bank accounts and the absence of full translations (other than her own selective handwritten annotations) coupled with the Wife’s own inability to provide the court with any clear or complete explanation as to how she applied the cash funds she received from the sale of the Property K and Property B sales leaves me without any proper forensic trail to demonstrate how these funds have been spent (as she claims they have).  It is accepted that the Husband ceased to make any financial contribution towards the family’s expenses after May 2011 when he discovered that the properties had been sold.  I have already taken into account the fact that this was a period when she had heavy overheads in terms of the cost of relocating the family to England.  She was running teams of expensive lawyers in two jurisdictions and spending significant sums on the private investigations she was pursuing into the Husband's financial affairs.  The annual budget which she produced with her Form E in May 2012 suggests a financial need (including the children’s expenses) in excess of £215,000 per annum. That includes the cost of running a home in this country and in Moscow.  In circumstances where the Husband had been earning a six figure tax free salary equivalent to some £400,000 per annum, that budget cannot be dismissed as purely aspirational for so long as that income remained available to him.  Of course, she had the income from the Property R rent (which she puts at about £85,400 net per annum).  Whilst it is not territory into which I must tread for the purposes of this fact-finding exercise, I suspect that the availability of an investment rental income and the amenity of two homes in different parts of the world may not be available to this Wife in future, unless I am persuaded about the missing millions still said to be held by the Husband.</p>

She maintained that she needed a fighting fund to commence litigation against the Husband in Russia.  She had already instructed English solicitors who had served a draft Petition on the Husband’s English solicitors.  There does not appear to have been any issue taken by him as to jurisdiction.  Yet on 21 February 2011, almost immediately after the sale of Property B, she instructed Russian lawyers to commence divorce proceedings in Moscow.  Much of the information supplied in those proceedings was misleading.  She sought to give the impression of a Russian-based family, resident in Moscow, and a father who was not making any financial contribution to the family’s financial support.  Whilst it is true that there were no formal arrangements in place for interim financial provision, it is not disputed that he was meeting all the children’s educational expenses including the fees at X School in  the South of England which they had been attending since September 2010; he was paying the mortgage and other utility bills on the property at FC in which they were living during term time; he had provided cash for a car for the Wife’s use and she was (or should have been) in receipt of about US$45,000 per month from rental on the Russian properties.</p>

I am told that those documents would have been determinative in a Russian court.  I have no evidence to that effect and I do not know whether the circumstances of their execution may have provided the Husband with a potential defence to her claims in the Russian court.    It may be that she felt better enabled to pursue covert enquiries into the Husband’s financial circumstances using contacts she had made in Moscow.  Wherever the truth lay, just one week after the issue of her Russian divorce proceedings, she had negotiated a sale of Property R to Mr AAA (again, without notice to the Husband).  The purchase price agreed upon was RUB120 million (about US$930,000) as against a 2010 valuation of US$4.6 million.</p>

She said she felt unable to rely on the continuing availability of the home at FC because she was required by the Husband to vacate the property every time he returned to see the children.  Given that there were by now proceedings underway in England and in Russia which would inevitably involve a final dénouement of this family’s financial arrangements, I find myself unable to accept that answer.  I have come to the clear conclusion that the purported sale of Property R was another step taken by the Wife to liquidate assets in Russia as a <span style="font-style:italic">fait accompli</span>.   </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is probably unnecessary for me to descend into detail about the reasons for the abortive sale and the subsequent litigation over the property in Russia regarding the recission of the sale contract.   I have not seen the Russian pleadings.  However, according to the Wife’s explanation to me, there should have been two separate contracts for the house and the land.  The purchase price of RUB30 million shown in the contract dated 28 February 2011 was for the house alone.  There was no reference to the separate consideration for the land which would have increased the total sale price to RUB120 million (which she thought she had agreed).  She had intended to remit the cash proceeds to one of her Russian accounts for onward transmission to the UK.  The contract, as drafted, would not have enabled her to justify remission of the full purchase price.  For reasons which are not clear to me, the sale nevertheless proceeded on the basis of the defective contract and Property R was duly registered in Mr AAA’s name in April 2011.  The following month, the Wife commenced proceedings in the Moscow courts.  Initially, Mr AAA was seeking a payment of RUB3 million to compromise the litigation.  Instead, the parties reached an agreement (a copy of which was produced by Mr Ewins during the hearing).  Mr AAA received directly from the tenants then installed at Property R a further three months’ rent.  No money changed hands as between him and the Wife who thereafter received the Property R rent in full for May, June and July 2011.  As part of the compromise, the title was rectified and the property remains part of the parties’ resources for the purposes of these financial remedy claims.  Nonetheless, I take the view that her attempt to dispose of the property is likely to have been part and parcel of her strategy to liquidate the Russian assets before further traction had been achieved in the English divorce proceedings.</p>

On the basis that the Wife and children were to be permitted to reside at FC until the conclusion of the cross-applications for financial remedy orders and on the Husband’s undertaking to remove the injunctions (“arrests”) which were then registered, on his application, against the two Russian properties (which were otherwise mortgage free), the Wife was permitted to charge her interest in Property R and Property A in the aggregate sum of £200,000 for the purposes of funding her legal costs in these proceedings.

In their written closing submissions, Miss Bangay QC and Mr Sear have suggested that such an approach would be wrong in law because of the terms in which section 22ZA are framed.   Whilst I accept that s 22ZA(3) is mandatory in its effect that the court must not make an order under the section unless it is satisfied that, without a contribution, an applicant would not reasonably be able to obtain appropriate legal services, I disagree that the import of the ‘reasonable’ test does not allow a judge a measure of discretion as to the manner in which it is proposed the alternative funding should be obtained.  The discretion is inbuilt into s 22ZA(1) and (2) in any event and,  had the court been aware that liquid funds of more than $½ million were easily available to meet what was clearly a pressing need on the Wife’s side with a final hearing looming in less than 3 months, I remain of the view that the outcome might very well have been different.</p>

I have in the papers a translation of a medical certificate dated 23 August 2013 signed by Dr K which records a period of hospitalisation in Moscow as an in-patient from 15 August to 5 September 2013 for the treatment of recurrent depressive disorder (moderate severity with somatic symptoms).  Her consultant psychiatrist records a history of affective pathology with current depressive episodes in the last three years.

I have to say that I do not understand how an agreement in principle from the Wife to follow that course would have produced funds in sufficient time to secure the listing of the final hearing but in response to the Wife’s objections to realising the Russian assets (<span style="font-style:italic">“she still considers that the husband has substantial undisclosed assets”)</span>,  Miss Bangay QC told the Judge that <span style="font-style:italic">“There is not one shred of evidence that the wife has produced that the husband has not made full disclosure of his assets”</span>.</p>

I have no doubt that he was indeed anxious to proceed with the October hearing, confident in the knowledge that he had “got away with it” thus far and hopeful that he could secure final orders at the conclusion of that hearing based upon his continuing fraud on the court.</p>

Miss Bangay QC asserted on behalf of the Husband that the Wife appeared to have run through liquid capital of about £1 million which was impossible to trace without her Russian bank statements.  Mr Ewins was clinging to his submission over doubts surrounding the authenticity of the H Bank statements which the Husband had produced.  The Judge made a raft of directions at the conclusion of that hearing including an order requiring the Wife to provide her missing bank statements and, significantly, an order which required the Husband to provide an authority which would enable the Wife to obtain directly from H Bank copies of his bank statements.  The Husband was required to serve a sworn undertaking to the effect that he had made comprehensive, full and frank disclosure of all his assets.  The Wife was injuncted from disclosing to any third party either orally or in writing any documents or information which she had obtained as a result of the litigation. (This latter order flowed from the Wife’s – subsequently admitted – disclosure of the Husband’s Kazakh lease to his landlord’s local tax office.)</p>

Both parties’ lengthy section 25 statements were late and only exchanged on the last working day before the hearing.  I have already referred to the fact that I granted a number of third party disclosure orders at the start of the hearing.

It concerned one of the issues which I have to decide as part of this fact-finding exercise.  I have already referred to the fact that the Husband’s rented apartment in Kazakhstan is alleged to have been the subject of a burglary in the first week of January 2013.  On 17 May 2013, the Husband’s solicitors had served a copy of the police report regarding that break in.  The Wife, in her very recent statement, had alleged that this document was a forgery, an issue which had not been raised at the Pre-Trial Review.  The Wife’s legal team had obtained a witness statement from AL, a lawyer working in London who was qualified both in English and Russian/Kazakh law.  Such was the climate of suspicion by that stage that I was told the Husband’s team had not been alerted to the fact that enquiries as to the authenticity of the report had been made for fear that he might sabotage or otherwise seek to influence them.  I ruled that, if evidence as to the authenticity of this report was to come in, it must be on the basis of joint instructions to a single expert.</p>

That did not become available until 24 October 2013.   The thrust of Mr Ewins’ assault on the authenticity of the report produced by the Husband is that  its particular reference (or KUZI) number does not relate to any incident which took place at the address shown in the report (the Husband’s rented apartment which he shares with his present wife and daughter).  That much appears to have been established as a result of enquiries undertaken locally.  The Wife’s case, in terms, is that the Husband and/or GS have manufactured both the account of the break in and the report or Certificate of Inquiry.  It was, she alleges, an entirely “put up job” and the smashed family photographs and evidence of localised disarray which I see in the photographs which were taken at the time are entirely staged.</p>

In terms, what he tells me is that an individual reporting a break in and theft of personal property would be issued with a notification token bearing a unique case reference number (or KUZI).  That document (a pro forma) comes in two parts.  A tear-off slip is given to the individual reporting the crime and a counterpart is retained for official purposes.  He goes on in his statement to tell me what an English court might expect to see once a decision is taken to launch criminal proceedings in respect of a reported crime.  In this instance, and in addition to the notification token, there would be further evidence of formal orders (i) instituting the criminal case, (ii) recognising the victim of the crime and (iii) recognising a civil plaintiff.  The Husband was cross-examined about the absence of any documents other than the certificate he had produced.  It seems to me that, in the absence of any suspects being identified and without evidence that a decision has been taken to prosecute any identified individuals as alleged perpetrators, it is not entirely surprising that these further documents are not available.  As far as I am aware, no one in the Interior Ministry or other relevant prosecuting body has taken the decision to institute criminal proceedings.</p>

Folders containing documents relating to the divorce proceedings, his bank accounts and K Ltd had been emptied.  I have been shown copies of the photographs taken by the Husband’s mother-in-law which appear to show blue markings striking through or obliterating the faces of each of the Husband, GS and their child.

Other inconsequential items had been taken including some of his wife's clothing, a watch and some unopened aftershave.  He told me about a bright orange computer bag bearing the insignia of G Ltd which had been removed.  That has some resonance with the email which he sent to Mr Pulford, his solicitor, on 13 January 2013, the day before their Skype conversation, when he referred to two “visitors” from Moscow.  In cross-examination, he told Mr Ewins that his father-in-law had used his previous police connections to make some investigations which had revealed some CCTV footage taken at the local airport which appeared to show two individuals travelling together, one of whom had an orange bag.</p>

He points to a gaping lack of evidence in circumstances where there should be a trail of official enquiries.  He asks me, rhetorically, where I find the photographic evidence taken by police from a wide angle lens showing the complete disarray which is alleged to have been left by the intruder or intruders?

When she was cross-examined by Miss Bangay QC, she said that in fact she had only contacted one individual and it was his decision to contact other third parties who were instructed to make the deposit with the Bank.  The first investigator was Russian.  She had no contract with him but gave a specific undertaking not to use his name in any future court proceedings.  That individual was a gentleman called VM.  She met him in Moscow in July 2011 and their meeting in a hotel coffee house (or somewhere similar) lasted approximately two hours.  In addition to a payment of RUB3 million (some £58,000), she handed him a copy of the Husband’s business card on which was printed his email address.  His brief at that stage was to establish whether or not the Husband was working, something which the Wife told me was very important in terms of the Russian proceedings which were ongoing at that time.  Over and above that, the Wife’s evidence was that she had no idea what VM did because at no stage did he report back to her save to tell her that the payment of US$500 had been made successfully to the credit of the Husband’s H Bank account in Dubai.</p>

Her determination to uncover the truth and the animus which she had towards the Husband by this stage of the proceedings is very clear from all that I have heard and read.  I have no doubt that much of this was communicated in terms to VM during their two hour meeting in July 2011.  She had set the hare running with little or no effective control over what might happen thereafter, and I am left in no doubt that the break in at the Husband’s apartment in January 2013 was somehow connected with those activities and those individuals, whomever they may have been.  For the avoidance of doubt, I do not make any findings that the Wife was directly involved in procuring or facilitating the break in.  I am prepared to accept that she had no knowledge of it until it came to light on 1 February 2013 when Mr Pulford wrote to Ws (then) solicitors to alert them to these events and to suggest that she was involved.</p>

I have reached the clear conclusion in this case that, notwithstanding the lies he has admitted, the Husband has now given a full account of his assets.  I find that there is no reliable evidence from which I can safely conclude that he continues to deceive the court about his ownership of shares, property or any other cash funds.  I have explained why I reject Mr Ewins’ submission to me that, as a matter of law, his previous lies are a sufficient evidential foundation – without more - from which I can infer that he has substantial undisclosed assets, far less that they are likely to be equivalent to the (pre-sale) value of the Russian property portfolio or anything closer to his earlier suggestion of many millions of pounds.</p>

First, I have the Husband’s evidence and the explanation which he gave to me of his reasons for withholding from the Wife information about his employment and the sums he was depositing in the H Bank account.  It does not in any shape or form excuse his conduct but it provides a context for his actions which I am prepared to accept.  Secondly, whilst Mr Ewins suggests that it is for the Husband to put before the court evidence which provides a complete answer to the non-disclosure case which is pursued, I do not see what more he can do.  I have been prepared in this case to make a significant number of disclosure orders against third parties, both resident in this jurisdiction and outside.  I have given Mr Ewins, Miss Headley and their team as much room to manoeuvre in their further enquiries as they felt they needed.  I did not seek to contain in any way the ambit of those enquiries at the start of the hearing because I took the view they had proper grounds for extending them as widely as they did.  The only brake which I introduced was the guillotine which I imposed on the conclusion of the hearing which had then occupied this judge and the court for 11 days.  Even then I indicated that I was prepared to receive further evidence flowing from third party enquiries if relevant information came to light between 8 November 2013 and the delivery of my judgment which I had promised to prepare over this New Year vacation.  As far as I am aware, nothing further has come to light which might have a material bearing on the facts which I have to decide.</p>

Whilst it is a matter of public record that share options in K Ltd have been made available to some of the company’s senior employees, there is still no reliable or admissible evidence or information before me which suggests that the Husband holds shares or that anyone else is holding shares on his behalf.  The mere fact that he has lied in the past does not entitle me to enter into the realms of pure speculation and the enquiry has to stop at some point in order to enable these parties to move forward beyond this litigation.</p>

He was paid well by industry standards for the job which he did.  The net benefit to him was the equivalent of a gross taxable income of over US$1 million.  He told me that K Ltd has over 13,000 employees but only two or three ex-patriate consultants, of whom he was one.  His evidence in relation to the termination of his contract was that he had been told on 16 September 2011 that his services were no longer required since the company was no longer undertaking the international work which he was brought in to advise upon.</p>

I have already rejected her evidence of an early discussion in 2010 leading to a concluded agreement that she would keep the Russian properties and he would keep his ‘shares and savings’.  In her section 25 statement, the Wife’s evidence about these ‘shares’ (paragraph 69) is extraordinarily vague.  She simply refers to a general discussion (without giving any specific details) which <span style="font-style:italic">‘centred around an idea’ </span>(no more than that) whereby he would keep all his ‘<span style="font-style:italic">bank accounts, shares and income which I understood, and still believe, were (and are) significant</span>’.  She had experience of the Husband’s previous ability to realise cash from the sale of his shares with I Ltd some nine years ago in 2005. She was pressed during the course of her oral evidence for more detail as to the basis of her belief that he was still holding shares.  In response to questions put to her in cross-examination by Miss Bangay QC during the second week of the hearing (and for the first time), she told me that at some point in the later stages of their marriage, the parties had discussed buying a villa in Spain.  Her preference was for the South of France.  In order to fund that purchase (there was no discussion of selling the Russian portfolio), she said that her Husband had told her he was planning to work for three years with K Ltd and/or J Ltd and his remuneration would be modest but he would receive shares in lieu.  There is no reference whatsoever to this discussion or those plans in her written evidence and I find myself unable to place any reliance upon it as evidence which suggests that what I have been told by the Husband is not the truth.  As I have said, I do not regard the income he generated through K Ltd as being “modest” by any standards.</p>

Those funds (or part of them) were paid into his Kazkommertzbank account.  Those loans had been made in contemplation that he might purchase a property and, I recall, to assist with some medical expenses which he incurred at the time of his present wife’s confinement.  The loans have since been repaid and the decision to investigate the purchase of property abandoned.  Whilst I have nothing against which to test that evidence (apart from that of his wife, who confirmed the loans made by her father), I have to ask why he would be borrowing funds if he genuinely had access to substantial offshore resources.  Further, there is nothing in the bank statements which he has now disclosed which suggests to me that this Husband is living an extravagant lifestyle or spending in a manner which is inconsistent with what he tells me about his lack of earned income.</p>

Mr Ewins told me, on instruction, that the note had been seen by B in 2011 at FC, that she had taken the photograph in August 2011 and had at that stage showed it to her mother (who does not now recall seeing it).  Whilst the Husband was in Kazakhstan from 22 August 2011 (where his youngest daughter had just been born), he had been in the UK and at  FC from 17 to 31 July 2011.

He is, in my view, unlikely to be in a position to present himself in the offices of any of the top headhunters or recruitment consultants and walk from there into an international position which is going to generate the sort of income he has been paid for the last two to three years of his working life.</p>

Had it been made, I should also have rejected a submission to the effect that he now holds the property as her nominee.  She also, by this concession, acknowledges that the Wife has indeed run through all the cash which she received from the two property sales in addition to the rent she received from the retained Russian property.  It is not suggested (and there is no reliable evidence which would enable me to find) that the Wife has an undisclosed account or accounts and/or that she retains significant sums of undeclared cash in her niece’s safe, the SBER Bank safety deposit box or indeed anywhere else.   Rather, the thrust of Miss Bangay QC’s argument on behalf of the Husband is that I should reattribute to the Wife a sum representing funds which she <span style="text-decoration:underline">should</span> now be holding.  I was in some difficulty discerning whether it is still alleged on behalf of the Husband that the Wife should still be treated as the owner of Property K.  In the light of my earlier observations about the registration of that property in the name of her sister, I take the view that the Property K disposal falls to be considered under reattribution principles rather than as a property in specie which the Wife still owns and which can be sold pursuant to orders of this court to realise market value in due course.</p>

That is the sum which is actually available to these parties to meet future housing and income needs.  The pension report prepared on 21 May 2013 suggests that the Husband’s three pension funds are likely to produce a gross retirement income of c. £57,000 per annum.  The pension funds on their own will not support the income needs of the Husband, Wife and the children, far less his new family who are also financial dependants at the present time. I do not know whether that computation takes account of the £198,000 odd which he has recently commuted to fund his legal costs. I suspect it does not, but in any event it is clear that, on the basis of my findings as to the Husband’s absence of income and his lack of prospects for the future, some provision in respect of income needs will have to be made available for these parties’ future income needs out of their liquid capital resources.  I do not expect that the Husband will contend that this Wife has any effective earning capacity and she remains the primary carer for three children who have not yet achieved independence. It seems to me highly likely that Property R will have to be sold and that will bring to an end the rental income on which the Wife and children are currently living.</p>

On the basis that the Wife has indeed spent the entirety of the funds produced by the sales of Property K and Property B (as I find she has), what I am being asked to do, in effect, is to create a balance sheet as between these parties which assumes that she has available a sum of £1.62 million (the sum contended for on behalf of the Husband) to meet her future needs, which plainly she does not.</p>

One of the particular difficulties in reattributing a precise sum to the Wife’s account is the complete absence of <span style="text-decoration:underline">any</span> reliable evidence as to how she actually spent the funds received from the sale transactions and the reasonableness of that expenditure.  I have set out my analysis of this conundrum in paragraphs 168 to 178 of my judgment.  I am therefore left with two alternatives.  Either I accept that the entirety of the funds she received were indeed required to meet the costs which she was incurring throughout that period of time, or I fix upon some notional – and, inevitably, arbitrary - figure as to what it might have been reasonable for her to spend, much as Bennett J did in the <span style="font-style:italic">McCartney </span>case. In that case, the alleged ‘overspend’ ran to a seven figure sum and thus the figure fixed on by the learned judge (£500,000 or 40% of the overspend after allowance for legal costs, disbursements and the like) was entirely realistic and proportionate.  It is significantly less here and, by the time an allowance has been made for legal expenses and relocation costs, probably not significantly in excess of the Wife’s annual budget (which I accept is based upon the family’s former standard of living).</p>

I am hopeful that, with the issue of the extent of the Husband’s non-disclosure conclusively resolved by my findings, the parties may well be in a position to begin negotiations which will obviate the need for a further hearing or hearings.  Each has a first class team of lawyers on board and I would encourage them both to take this course and preserve what is left of the assets which will be much better utilised in meeting the family’s needs than in funding another expensive round of litigation in court.</p>

I do not propose to reattribute any sums in respect of the cash funds which the Wife actually received from Mr O (c.£500,000) or the proceeds which she says have been received from Property K and the garage.  These sums have been spent and I am simply not in a position to determine that this expenditure was either wanton or reckless<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="9">

However, I take the view that, on the basis of the range of expert valuation evidence which I do have, there can be no issue at all but that the sale of Property B to Mr O at a price of RUB26 million was both wanton and reckless.   None of us can know what price she might have achieved had there been a commercial attempt to market the property in 2010 but I am quite clear that, by her actions, the Wife has deliberately disposed of a valuable investment at a very significant undervalue and, as a result, the parties have sustained a loss which cannot be ignored.  I have limited the reattribution to £1 million which is less than the full overspend for which Miss Bangay QC contends. Her computation is based upon the highest point of the two formal valuations which suggested values of betweenUS$2.178 million and US$2.4 million (<span style="font-style:italic">per </span>the Wife) and US$2.667 million (<span style="font-style:italic">per </span>the Husband).   </p>

I have already made reference to the agent’s reference to some problems with road access and it may well be that US$140,000 would not have been realised after a commercial marketing exercise.  I have no way of knowing but that is the conclusion I have reached and £1 million is the figure upon which I have fixed by way of reattribution in order to hold the balance of fairness as between these parties.  Whether that notional figure can stand in full after a consideration of the Wife’s needs will depend upon the next stage of negotiations and/or the findings of the court.  Inevitably, some or all of that sum may need to yield to needs but I do not consider that the Wife can be wholly absolved from the consequences of her own conduct.</p>

To the extent that she resorted to the instruction of third parties in the face of the Husband’s deliberate concealment of his true financial position, he must bear some responsibility, however inappropriate the means of his discovery might have been.  It was, after all, the discovery of the H Bank account number which was eventually to lead to the disclosure of his false evidence.

The fact that she believed she would be in a better position to secure the Russian property portfolio in a Russian court may very well have constituted a legitimate juridical advantage and she was being advised, so I am told, by an experienced Russian legal team.  My censure of her conduct in securing the various documents by misleading the Husband as to their contents and her intended use of them has already been reflected in a reattribution of funds to her account. I accept that the particulars which she supplied in the Russian divorce petition were not accurate but I do not propose to add back the costs of those proceedings.  The Husband had himself launched his own proceedings in Russia prompted by his discovery of the Russian property dealings.  The Wife was to concede jurisdiction in England by the beginning of 2012 and the order made by consent by Baron J on 9 May 2012 dealt with the costs of the suit on the basis of the agreement which the parties had reached.</p>

She accepts these deficiencies in her early disclosure and I heard evidence as to the circumstances in which, from Moscow, she was liaising with her English solicitor and accountant in an effort to produce her draft Form E.   I agree with Mr Ewins’ submission to me that her errors of omission are on a wholly different scale to the Husband’s non-disclosure.  By the time she came to submit her second (and full) Form E in May 2012, most of the deficiencies in her disclosure as to bank accounts had been made good.   </p>

I bear in mind that for the most part, the complaints relate to a period when the Wife was pursuing her allegations of non-disclosure against the Husband and was also in the process of changing solicitors.  When her current solicitors, Levison Meltzer Pigott, took over conduct of the case in June 2013 shortly after the FDR hearing before Mostyn J, there were significant funding difficulties which were not resolved until the PTR in September that year.  She had to contend with issues of her own health as well as A’s psychiatric breakdown during that period and, subject to what I have to say about costs generally at the conclusion of my judgment, I consider it would be disproportionate to penalise this Wife in costs because of these litigation shortcomings when the Husband’s own litigation conduct has been so appalling.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This issue arises out of the fact that the Wife was able to secure an official government document from the local Kazakhstan land registry which she believed to be evidence of GS’s interest in a property. The property referred to was an address in Kazakhstan.  That is, as I accept, the home of her parents and I have seen evidence which appears to suggest that the property was provided by the Kazakhstan government to her father free of charge in return for his long service in government employ (over thirty years work for the National Security Committee).  The E-Gov document produced by the Wife (and dated 2 April 2013) in support of her contention that GS owned (or may have an interest in) the property was procured at her request by a friend of the Wife’s called  Miss B who, it appears, conducted a search at the land registry.  That individual’s name had been redacted on the version sent to the Husband’s solicitors.  GS told me that she was able to enlarge the document font on her computer screen and thereby reveal from underneath the manuscript redaction the identity of the individual who had requested the search of the register.  In fact, it transpired that this document is not simply a document showing property ownership but is also a record of the official registered addresses of the individuals whose names appear on the face of the document.  GS is recorded as being registered at her parents’ address.  I am told that her registration as a resident at this address entitled her to some element of beneficial ownership (she told me it was as to a one-sixth share) but whether this interest goes beyond some form of protected status of security in relation to continuing residence at the property, I know not and it probably does not matter for the purpose of this inquiry.  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There is an issue as to whether or not that document was obtained illegally and/or whether it was forged.  By way of comparison, I have a copy of a similar government certificate which was obtained legitimately by GS on 13 May 2013 in relation to the same property.  It bears a different date and certificate number but the format is more or less identical on the first page, apart from what appear to be some watermarks on the second document.  By the time I travel to the second page of the document, however, I can see a significant difference between the two.  In the list of rights registered against this particular property, the Wife’s document shows a single name, that of GS.  The formal certificate which was obtained by GS some six weeks later bears a full list of five names, being each of the family members.  When the Wife was asked in cross-examination about the omission in her document of the other names, she told me that it was no more than a <span style="font-style:italic">“silly mistake” </span>in that when she had sent the document to translators, she had been asked whether she wished them to translate all the names on the second page.  The Wife had asked them only to provide a translation of GS’s name.  It appears on the earlier certificate obtained by the wife as “GS born on June 12, 1987”.  </p>

Had five names appeared on the Russian original dated 2 April 2013 but only one in the English translation, I might have been persuaded by that answer.  However, the Russian document clearly shows only one name in the registration section and thus the Wife’s evidence makes no sense. </p>

She told me that she and Miss B had no social connection in the wider sense and that she had never enquired about her husband’s job, influence or connections because <span style="font-style:italic">“it would have been impolite to ask”</span>.  She described the suggestion that Miss B was a woman of some considerable influence as <span style="font-style:italic">“absurd”</span>.  I was left at the conclusion of this evidence none the wiser as to why, in this event, there was any need to involve a third party in obtaining the certificate and I did not find the Wife’s evidence convincing. </p>

The Wife denies that she knew GS’s IIN number prior to being handed a document which had been obtained by her lawyer in Russia.  She did not know anything about the circumstances in which he had obtained it.  Wherever the truth of this particular episode lies, I find that on the balance of probabilities the Wife did not act in good faith.  There appears to be clear evidence of some editing or tampering with the April land registry document.  Whether it was edited or forged, I know not but I am prepared to accept that it was not obtained by wholly legitimate means.  The prospect of the Wife involving in these very personal affairs one of the school mothers with whom she had little or no personal connection is, I find, completely unrealistic and I do not believe it.  Further, the Wife’s assurance to me that she would never have done anything which might cause fear or apprehension to GS simply will not sit with the very personal (and sometimes excoriating) content of the letters and emails which she sent to both the Husband and other third parties.</p>

I am asked to find that she concealed that income for almost three years.  In fact, whilst it did not appear, as I accept, in any of her formal disclosure documents, the Wife told me that she had provided that disclosure informally to her previous solicitors, Forsters.  Mr Ewins was subsequently able to produce evidence that she had indeed communicated receipt of that rent to them and I have now been provided with a copy of the email recording that fact. It is dated 4 May 2012 and it was sent to her solicitors with a manuscript revision to the relevant page of her draft Form E.  The fact that she had informally disclosed this fact to her previous solicitors does not, of course, detract from the force of Miss Bangay QC’s submission that there was no formal disclosure to the Husband or his solicitors.  It does, however, provide partial mitigation in terms of whether or not it was the Wife’s intention to mislead.</p>

It may be that in terms of value, the sale of property by the Wife at a significant loss was greater than the sum which the Husband failed to disclose.  I do not regard that fact alone as absolving him of a costs penalty for his own conduct.  The sale of the properties had been disclosed.  It was a significant feature of the case and its forensic unravelling was always likely to occupy a significant part of the time which had been allocated for hearing the case.  The fact that the Wife has failed to persuade me that there was a justification for her actions and the fact that I have found she has not established her case in relation to the Husband’s knowledge as to the nature of the property dealings and the documents they both signed does not, in my view, neutralise or reverse the burden of costs in terms of his own non-disclosure.</p>
