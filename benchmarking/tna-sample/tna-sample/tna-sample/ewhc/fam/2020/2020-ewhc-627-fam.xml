The parties met whilst the mother was working as a finance director at his factory and they began a relationship in July 1996. The father was married at this time to HD. The mother became pregnant with their first child, DD, shortly thereafter. DD was born on 18 April 1997 and is now aged 22.

The mother and the children moved to England in the summer of 2010 and they have lived here permanently ever since. Initially the family lived in rented accommodation. The family home (“the London Apartment”) was purchased by the father in April 2011 and was thereafter extensively renovated at a cost of some £800,000. The mother and children moved into the property in March 2014 following completion of the renovation. The family home is valued at c.£10 million, the price reflecting the exclusive nature of the address.  The father continues to live in Russia and has visited the family in the UK about four times a year for four days or so each time.  </p>

The mother discovered that it had been vandalised on 9 April 2018. She accused the father of being responsible for orchestrating the vandalism but at the fact-finding hearing in the Children Act proceedings Recorder Genn did not find the mother’s allegation established. The property does however now require very extensive repairs. Damaged items will need to be replaced. It is currently uninhabitable and neither the mother nor children have returned to it since the damage was caused.  </p>

I shall consider this in more detail later as it is relevant to one aspect of the mother’s claim. In any event the mother returned £690,000 to the father and retained £300,000 as ‘security’. The mother says that intimate relations between herself and the father ended in 2016. The father says that it ended much earlier. </p>

Recorder Genn found as a fact that this was a gift and that it had not been intended that DD transfer to the father his alleged beneficial interest in the N City Property in return. However a dispute arose between the father on one side and DD and the mother, TD and GD on the other which very quickly turned highly acrimonious. The mother says the father had, over a period of years, become emotionally and physically abusive to her and the children. This abuse reached a crescendo in December 2017 and January 2018 as the dispute over the sums given to DD exploded into threats by the father towards the mother and DD. The threats became backed up by actions when the Foundation sought to evict the mother and children from the London Apartment.  </p>

Extensive and serious findings were made against the father at this hearing. On 25 January 2018 the mother applied without notice for an occupation order and non-molestation orders under the Family Law Act 1986 along with a prohibited steps order to prevent GD being removed from the jurisdiction. These were granted by DJ Hudd. The Family Law Act orders expire in March 2020. The father does not oppose their extension. </p>

Following the hearing before Recorder Reardon (as she then was) the case was allocated to a judge of High Court level. An FDR was listed before Mr Justice Francis on 6 February 2019 which went part heard but was not resumed. On 30 July 2019 the mother’s application for a legal services payment order and the pre-trial review came before me and I case managed the application to a final hearing to commence on 20 January 2020.   </p>

The father did not accept that he removed the items of jewellery the mother identified and contended that her remedy was under the Torts (Interference with Goods) Act 1977 rather than Schedule 1. Mr Pocock did concede that an allowance for jewellery might form part of a carer’s allowance under Schedule 1 and so this issue of the mother’s jewellery remained live. The issue of whether the investor monies were a loan or a gift was addressed. Mr Howard submitted that it was relevant because monies expended by the mother out of the £300,000 ‘security’ she retained from the investor monies would have been her money if it was a gift and thus to the extent that those monies were expended for the benefit of the children the court would be able to direct a lump sum be paid to reimburse the mother. Although Mr Pocock took issue with whether the court could or should make any such order ultimately it appeared to me that there was an issue to be determined in respect of those funds. Thus HF, the father’s lawyer and board member of the Foundation, would be a potentially relevant witness. </p>

At the time the court would be making the order he will not be a child within the meaning of Sch 1, para 1(2)(a) or (b).

The use of the word ‘is’ in paragraph 3(2)(a) would also support the construction that an order can be made at a time when the child is 18. It seems to me that if the court has the power to make a periodical payments order in respect of a ‘child’ who has reached the age of 18 where the application was made prior to the 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> birthday that the court would also retain the jurisdiction to make other species of order under para 1. Para 3 is looking at the duration of orders in terms of commencement and end date rather than the jurisdiction of the court to make any order at all. As a matter of logic if educational or special circumstances apply so as to justify the court making periodical payments orders which extend beyond the child’s 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> birthday those special circumstance would as a matter of fact (albeit not of law) be just as relevant to the issue of whether they provided the  factual foundation for a capital order. If Parliament had intended that the court should lose the ability to make an order when the child reached the age of 18 in the course of pending proceedings it surely would have addressed the issue. If the court lost the power to make the order it would require the court to then join the child to the proceedings or at least to ascertain whether they wished to then make their own application. I do not think it can be right that procedural delay the fault for which might lie entirely at the door of either the court or of the respondent should have the potential to ‘knockout’ an application which was legally permissible and which was evidentially sustainable at the time of determination. Such an interpretation would potentially breach both the article 6 ECHR and article 8 ECHR rights of the applicant and the children and would be contrary to their welfare, whether as a primary consideration or simply as a consideration. It could in any event be partially remedied by joining the adult child as a party and deeming an application to have been made by them pursuant to Sch 1, para 2 albeit there would be a more limited range of orders available. This would still encompass both income and capital. If I am wrong in my conclusion that the proper interpretation of Sch 1 is to allow the court to make an order under paragraph 1 (2)(a-</p>

This is because whilst the act allows applications brought by the parent of a child under 18 at the date of the application to result in orders lasting beyond the age of 18 if the child is in education/training, and allows adult children to bring their own applications for periodical payments or lump sums, it does not allow a parent to make an application for periodical payments or lump sums on behalf of their 18+ child even if that child is in education/training or under a disability (I assume this means special circumstances).  They make the following points in support of their submission that I should interpret Schedule 1 so as to allow an application by a parent in respect of (or on behalf of) an adult child.

In ZH (Tanzania) the UK Supreme Court explored and explained the distinction between decisions directly affecting the child's upbringing where welfare was the paramount consideration, and decisions which affect the child more indirectly where welfare is a primary consideration. Where welfare is a primary consideration the decision taker should not treat any other consideration as inherently more significant but should consider the best interests of the child first. Insofar as the later decisions impact on what Hale J said in J v C in terms of welfare not being the first consideration, it seems to me that in so far as the law may now require welfare or best interests to be considered as a first consideration as part of all of the circumstances of the case it is a modest shift of emphasis.  </p>

In that case, the parties, who had not cohabited, had a two-year-old child. The father described himself as 'fabulously rich' and conceded that he could pay a lump sum of £10 million if he were ordered so to do. At first instance, the mother was awarded, inter alia, £450,000 for a house; £30,000 for furnishings; and periodical payments of £35,560 pa to be reduced by £9,333 on the child's seventh birthday. The mother appealed (successfully) to the Court of Appeal, which increased the housing fund to £1 million; the furnishing fund to £100,000; and periodical payments to £70,000 pa (less state benefits). Thorpe LJ gave general guidance in relation to future Sch 1 applications. The main principles can be summarised as follows: </p>

Those were the authorities also referred to by Hale J (as she then was) in J v C supra (at 155), where she briefly traced the legislative history of the 1989 Act, and the Family Law Reform Act 1987, its near identical predecessor.

Under para 2(1)(b) a person over 18 may apply for a periodical payments order and/or a lump sum order against either or both of his parents if 'there are special circumstances which justify the making of an order'. By this route is derived an unrestricted jurisdiction for the court to order financial relief to a disabled applicant of any age providing that the disabled applicant has a surviving parent who is not cohabiting with the other parent. Paragraph 2 is complementary to the provisions contained in para 1 enabling 'a parent or guardian of a child or any person in whose favour a residence order is in force with respect to a child' to apply for financial relief including, but not limited to, periodical payments and/or lump sums. Paragraph 3, dealing with duration of orders for financial relief, provides that para 1 orders may extend beyond a child's eighteenth birthday if 'there are special circumstances which justify the making of an order'. Thus I conclude that whether the application is by a parent in relation to a child or whether the application is by a person over the age of 18, the court's jurisdiction, provided there are special circumstances, may extend until terminated by either the death of the payer or the payee." </span></p>

Although decided under the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 the powers utilised were equivalent to the Sch 1 powers.

However, if one goes on to look at the provisions concerning the circumstances in which a person over 18 can make an application, and the duration of orders for financial relief and the definition of a child, the analogies between the provisions of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 and Sch 1 are so close that in my view there is effectively for present purposes a complete overlap. The cases concerning the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 demonstrate that having regard to the scheme and purpose of the legislation – and thus as a matter of statutory construction – the powers in para 1(2)(d) and (e) should only be exercised so as to confer an absolute interest on the relevant children in special circumstances.

Absent special or exceptional circumstances capital orders which provide a benefit beyond minority or the cessation of tertiary education should not be made. It is equally clear that what can amount to special or exceptional circumstances is restricted. Matters relating to changing societal attitudes, the wealth of a parent, or the like will not suffice. Disability creating an ongoing need for support might. The absence of a parent playing any supporting role for their child might. The appellate courts have recently eschewed glosses upon statutory language. In this case the identification of exceptional or special circumstances warranting the making of outright capital orders for the benefit of children does not seem to me to amount to a gloss but rather is an application of the statutory powers based on principles which emerge from case law.  The power to make outright capital transfers exists but will only be deployed in limited circumstances and where the evidence justifies it. It seems to me that what one is focusing on is the child and whether there is something about this child or this child’s situation in particular vis-à-vis that parent that creates a situation which exceptionally (i.e. as an exception to the usual rule) generates a need for the child to be provided with capital which will be of benefit to them as an adult possibly for many years. </p>

By the time Mr Howard finished his submissions at around 4:20pm it was not possible for me to deal with the detailed legal submissions that Miss Moys wished to make in support of the mother’s contention that the court could make a lump sum order in respect of TD who is now 18 and has not made an application himself, and including an invitation to me to conclude that Sch 1 was discriminatory in respect of the children of unmarried parents and that in accordance with s.3 of the Human Rights Act 1998 I ought to interpret various provisions of Sch 1 so as to permit the court to make orders in respect of DD, a child who had reached the age of 18 prior to the date of application.  Having stated that I would not accept both oral and written submissions and given the time we had reached I directed that the issues of law set out in Ms Moys’ document would have to be considered by me on paper after the father had had an opportunity to respond in writing.

The way in which the legal issues relating to my jurisdiction to make orders in respect of DD and TD developed was unfortunate. It did not enable me to explore the issue in oral argument. The way in which the mother's case was presented was to focus on the factual and evaluative issues with Mr Howard devoting the vast majority of his submissions to those issues and delegating the legal issues to Ms Moys. Given the boldness of the submissions, their reliance on s.3 of the Human Rights Act, issues of discrimination, and the interface between legitimate statutory interpretation and declarations of incompatibility, the way in which the mother's team prioritised matters plainly did not permit of any detailed consideration in court. Given the considerable number of other issues in the case I confess it has not been possible in the course of the preparation of this judgment to dedicate the time to those legal issues which they might otherwise consume if time were unlimited. I have allocated what I consider to be a proportionate amount of time to them having regard to the apparently relatively limited priority that the mother's team gave them. </p>

I remind myself that the demeanour of the witness in giving their evidence can only be part of the picture. Some people are confident liars. Others are anxious tellers of the truth. Memory is in any event unreliable and a witness can be entirely genuine and indeed honest in their recollection but they may still be mistaken. However that does not mean that demeanour and body language are irrelevant. It is all a matter of context, judgment and degree. In respect of lies told by the parties I give myself a Lucas direction and remind myself that a party may lie for many reasons including fear or embarrassment and that the fact that a party has lied about one matter does not mean that they have lied about everything. In particular the fact that the father was found to have been dishonest in the fact-finding hearing does not mean that all his evidence is dishonest.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">The mother gave evidence through an interpreter although her statement did not require a translator’s declaration. She clearly has some facility in English. Her written and oral evidence were in the main consistent with each other. Her written statements are detailed and are in the main also consistent with each other. There is some development of her evidence over time, for instance in relation to the investor funds but given the purpose for which the original statements were deployed the absence of some detail in respect of various matters is not in my view an indication of subsequent fabrication. Most of her written and oral evidence was consistent with the documentary evidence that is available. Considerable criticism was directed at the mother in relation to her alleged dilatoriness in the presentation of her evidence or offers. I do not consider any matter which relates to the presentation of her open offer or her final statement are indicative of anything that would undermine her credibility; they are more likely to be a product of the logistics of the process. She was composed, moderate and polite in her approach. She is clearly highly intelligent and is fluent in money matters; her description of what various bank statements showed and her correction of counsel well illustrated this. On occasions when talking about matters directly relating to the children’s situation or the impact of events on them, for instance having to move, she became emotional.  Not surprisingly as their primary carer throughout their lives she showed considerable emotional attunement with the children and insight into their states of mind. She said in relation to GD that when they moved to London her heart was in N City and still is. She also spoke of GD’s love for her father and how difficult it had been for her; she clearly being his favourite.  Although at times she gave rather long narrative answers I did not gain the impression that she was being deliberately evasive. On several occasions she stopped to correct or clarify an answer she had given and she had the appearance of someone who takes care in what she says. There were occasions when she was demonstrated to have exaggerated, for instance [C286] when she asserted that the London Apartment had been their home throughout most of their lives. This was plainly inaccurate however it was a relatively isolated example.   When she spoke of the father and her relationship with him she appeared in some respects to demonstrate regret, bitterness or anger, however this did not seem to dominate her thinking. The impression she gave was of someone who had been very much in love with the father and who had committed </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-right:0.25in;text-indent:0.00in">herself wholeheartedly to him notwithstanding that he had not reciprocated. She described how she had always been loyal to him and how he trusted her in relation to financial matters. I think she is probably correct in this. In this respect she at times appeared to be rather naïve about him saying that she had always known or believed that she and her three children were the most important to him. Although there were elements of her budget where her evidence suggested a degree of discomfort with the subject matter (bicycles and the dog) suggesting perhaps that these were exaggerated, her evidence about financial matters did not display an unhealthy focus on money. Her evidence as to the developing affluence of the father and its impact on the housing and lifestyle of herself and the children seem to me to be genuine in that she accepted what the father provided rather than her pushing for it. Her evidence chimed with the father’s in this regard. It was he who clearly was in control of the purse strings and who took the significant financial decisions which led to the developing standard of living for the family. It was clearly he who directed the purchases of property in Russia, the purchase of the London Apartment and the lavish furnishings which accompanied it. The mother did not come across as a gold-digger. Indeed if anything her evidence including her bank statement suggests that she is content with a more modest lifestyle than the father is. When she gave evidence of how the father had stopped her having a cleaner she was not indignant but matter of fact. Her evidence of the father’s spontaneous generosity, for instance in relation to the 4 carat diamond ring, appeared to be entirely genuine in her recall of how he came to give it to her. In her schedule put together to demonstrate the cost of re-furnishing the flat were the father to remove the antiques, there are many examples where in her like-for-like replacement she has identified pieces which are considerably lower in price than the valuation given by the father or the price originally paid. One example is item 24 [E328] whether the mother’s replacement item is priced at £8,879 compared to the price paid for the item the father seeks to remove which was £61,250. Overall her schedule is priced lower than the value attributed by the respondent. This does not suggest that the mother is deliberately exaggerating to artificially inflate her claim. </p>

That is not to say that there is not some element of spin or exaggeration or opportunism in respect of some of the items she is claiming for. However where these are present I believe that it is motivated through insecurity for herself and for her children at what the future holds when the father’s obligations terminate. </p>

She also found that money whilst an important backdrop was not the central issue for the mother. The findings she made in respect of the abuse that the mother alleged both in respect of herself and the children demonstrates, as indeed does the judgment overall, that Recorder Genn considered the mother and the children were for the most part giving a truthful account. Having regard to the extremely serious nature of some of the allegations which might at first blush have seemed florid, exaggerated or improbable the conclusion that the mother and children were telling the truth about them is important. </p>

His evidence and his demeanour were far more variable than that of the mother. I shall deal with this in some more detail below. In general he was polite and respectful to the court although at times he and Mr Howard clashed. On occasions he became emotional when speaking of GD. It was abundantly clear that she holds a special place in his heart as his first daughter and that his attitude to his sons and GD were quite different.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">Although the broad narrative of his written statements has generally remained consistent there have been changes of detail or emphasis in relation to facts or intentions which are significant. For instance in his statement of 12 April 2018 he stated that it was in 2008 that the mother suggested that she should relocate abroad in order to provide the children with an international education and that ‘<span style="font-style:italic">it was very much a decision of her own making</span>’. In a later statement of 24 January 2019 he said that it was shortly after GD’s birth in 2005 that he and the mother began discussing the possibility of her and the children relocating abroad. In his oral evidence he was clear that the idea for the mother and children to relocate was very much his idea. In his April 2018 statement he said that the London Apartment isn’t really a suitable home for the mother and children whilst in his statement of January 2019 he says that he had always intended the London Apartment to be the home of the children and the mother for as long as they were in her care. In April 2018 he said he and his wife and child would like to live at the London Apartment; I’m not sure why it would be appropriate for his wife and young child but not for the mother and the two older children. By January 2019 his position had changed on the basis that the London property market had changed very significantly over the previous two years. He did not elaborate on why some nine months before he wanted to retain it as his main home in London. His position in relation to the furnishing of the London Apartment has also altered. In April 2018 he said they furnished the London Apartment with a number of valuable antiques because they knew it was his home and his investment. In his statement of 7 May 2019 he describes how he has been collecting antiques with the principal purpose that he would <span style="font-style:italic">’like to help to promote and develop cultural life in my home town of N City’ </span>and the only reason they were in the London Apartment was because he had put them there. These are a few examples of the shifts which are evident from his statements. In oral evidence he maintained that he had never said he would buy apartments for the other children and that DD was a special case because of his vulnerability. I was not really able to understand what the vulnerability was as the father seemed to be describing difficulties in DD forming attachments to women. However it is clear that in evidence to Recorder Genn [D29, #77] he had said he would by TD a flat. Thus there is considerable material which points to the father being inconsistent in his account.   </p>

In his oral evidence he was able to identify without hesitation paragraphs within the mother’s evidence when he wanted to refer to something she had said. This made his apparent inability to recall various other matters very hard to understand. His answers to questions about the mother’s jewellery both in terms of what he had taken from her and in terms of the list of items which the mother had described being bought was wholly unconvincing and evasive. He suggested that an email from him to Credit Suisse directing the transfer of funds to the mother in 2006 may be a fake or had been modified. The mother produced the original. He said he could not give that money as it was the Foundation’s and all he could do was make a request as a beneficiary. When </p>

His desire to see his children make their way in life through their own efforts as he did, is in many respects laudable. However it ignores the very different life he has created for them both by his decisions as to their lifestyle and where they should be brought up but also by their domestic arrangements that he has created by his multiple families. It also of course ignores the abuse he has subjected them to, abuse which he simply does not accept. His characterisation of the very serious findings as behaving very inappropriately do not get close to an acceptance of the findings or acceptance of the impact on the mother and children of what he did. In his oral evidence he was difficult to pin down in terms of what he accepted. His ultimate position appeared to have reverted to his position as it was before Recorder Genn which was that the majority of the allegations had been fabricated by the mother in her pursuit of money. He did seem to acknowledge, although again I was not entirely clear from his oral evidence precisely what, that he had said and done things in the heat of the moment that he regretted and which were inappropriate. Although in general he gave his evidence in measured terms his capacity to become angry was demonstrated in exchanges between himself and Mr Howard when he became irate and said he would shout at Mr Howard if Mr Howard shouted at him. </p>

When questioned about the investor funds he sought to control the questioning by insisting on precise figures being given albeit he undoubtedly knows the amounts being spoken about (his precision over paragraphs earlier shows this) and was just doing it in order to put himself in control. His later precision over the amounts of interest that she got on the investor visa bonds showed his facility with numbers and memory. Having earlier said that lawyers were present at the investor visa meeting he was later highly evasive about who was present at the meeting. When asked about the 3 day fact-finding hearing he asked for clarification of which hearing. </p>

At one stage he commented in relation to the events of late 2017 and 2018 that he felt helpless. It seemed to me in reality that the problem was that he could not control events or in particular the mother and children at that stage. That he should seek control is hardly a surprise given his position. He has become an extremely wealthy and influential entrepreneur and is no doubt used to being in complete control of the business empire around him. The nature of his relationship with the mother and the children and that of his other partners and children would tend to reinforce his being in control. This is a product not only of his control of the finances but is a product of his personality and indeed at times he is a charismatic man. The force of his personality would I think be hard to resist. His evidence in relation to, for instance DD’s ears, was to the effect that he took charge and organised everything. This is typical of his approach. He needs to be in charge because he believes that he is best placed to be in charge. </p>

His evidence in relation to his sons also displayed an element of pride and affection. However his attunement to them and their emotional needs is limited by the dominance of his own personality and needs. He answered many questions about the mother and children by saying something about himself. It is self-evident that the father’s needs come first in any situation. The needs of his wife or partners and his children may be taken into account or met insofar as they do not clash with his. He seemed utterly oblivious to the impact on the mother or his wives, still less his children, of the parallel lives that he developed to suit his not their needs. His evidence both in written statements but also orally that he asked the mother if he and his new wife and daughter could come and reside at the London Apartment whilst they were in London and his apparent surprise at her angry rejection of this suggestion demonstrated he is oblivious to how others might feel. The emotionally abusive, indeed coercive and controlling behaviour, that Recorder Genn found him to have perpetrated both in threatening to tie the mother to a chair and stab her, in saying to GD that he was going to come to London and slit DD’s throat, in telling TD that he should beat up DD to make him return the money, and in threatening to evict the mother and children from their home and to return GD summarily to Russia showed a degree of ruthlessness, cruelty and utter disregard for the impact on the children’s emotions which can only be a product of an overwhelming need to fulfil his emotional need to be in control. His rejection of the findings, his characterisation of them as fabricated and a product of the mother’s pursuit of money demonstrate the continuation of this approach. There is no suggestion in his evidence that he has accepted any of the serious allegations; the effect of his evidence is to minimise them and even then to blame his behaviour on stress and his health. He has taken no responsibility for it. </p>

He said that he does not believe that GD is fearful of him.  He relies on those parts of the Cafcass report and the mother’s evidence which identify that GD misses the father as supporting his position. What he does not recognise or accept is the psychological impact on GD of the conflict she feels internally trying to manage her fondness or love for her father with the awful behaviour that she knows he is capable of. He did not appear to accept there was any genuine need for the three children to have therapy as a result of his abusive behaviour; this being a logical corollary of his non-acceptance of it.

Whilst of course he is capable of telling the truth and indeed did so in respect of various uncontentious matters in his statements and in the course of his oral evidence, where either his financial interests or his emotional interests were engaged his evidence can be highly unreliable and entirely subjective. This is particularly so in relation to any matter relating to his behaviour towards, relationship with and in regards to the future of the children. He is at present unable to be objective about the mother. Given she is, I conclude, able to identify with a good degree of emotional insight what her children’s emotional and other needs are, and insofar as it is possible for a mother in this situation to be objective about them, she is able to put her children’s best interests before her own. I consider her appraisal of the children and their needs to be far more reliable and accurate than the father’s which is wholly divorced from the reality of his behaviour and the issues that that gives rise to. In relation to factual matters and issues of finances which fall to be evaluated by reference to the parties’ evidence, for the most part I prefer the mother as a witness in terms of honesty, reliability and accuracy both on matters of fact and in her evaluation of the children’s current and future wishes and needs. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">In the course of his evidence HF accepted that there were a number of inaccuracies in documents that he had prepared including in his witness statement which was of course accompanied by a statement of truth. In that he maintained that a payment from the Foundation of £46,850 on 9 June 2010 was a payment made to the mother in relation to the investor visa. This assertion had also been made in the letter of 31 May 2018. Cross-referencing to the mother’s bank statements made very plain that the payment was not made in relation to the investor visa but rather was made in relation to the rental of a property for the family. There are other inaccuracies including his assertion within his witness statement at paragraph 15 that following the obtaining of citizenship in late 2016 the mother should have repaid the funds to the Foundation. Given that he had accepted that the payments to the mother represented a distribution of funds to the father the mother had no obligation to repay the funds to the Foundation. HF described this as “imprecise”. He used the same phrase in relation to a letter written by him on 22 December 2017 [E311] where he described the Company as being owned 100% by the father when in fact it was owned by the Foundation. This not only illustrated imprecision but also demonstrated as did many other areas of HF’s evidence that the Foundation was the alter ego of the father. Although it had been plain from the evidence that the father was the sole beneficiary of the Foundation and could in practice direct the board to distribute the assets of the Foundation according to his will with in effect no practical discretion to decline to do his will, what had not been evident (at least to me) was that the terms of the Foundation actually allowed the father to manage the assets directly and to require for instance the bank Credit Suisse to make payments at his request and without further input from the board of the Foundation. This was certainly the case in relation to the payments made in 2009 and may have been the case in relation to the payments made in 2006. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">HF referred to the Home Office guidance in relation to the requirements for an investor visa. At paragraph 12 C he set out an extract from it which confirmed that the funds that an applicant relied on could be money owned solely by their unmarried partner. What he did not include was that the applicant must have permission from her unmarried partner to have control of the money in the UK. I asked HF to explain how the mother had the father’s permission to have control of the money in the UK if she was under an obligation to repay the funds to the Foundation (or the father). The father himself had made clear in his evidence that it was his view that the mother had no right to deal with the capital at all but rather was entitled to receive the interest on the sums. The inference that one has to draw from HF’s evidence that the mother was under an obligation to repay the funds, not an equivalent sum but the same funds, was in line with the father’s evidence and would indicate that the mother in fact did not have control over those funds contrary to the requirements. HF and the father both gave evidence that they had been involved in the process of obtaining the visa. This would be entirely consistent with the pattern of the father being in control of events in the lives of the mother and the children. This raises the possibility that some form of misrepresentation may have been made to the Home Office as to the mother’s control of the funds if the father and HF’s evidence is correct. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">The purchase of the London Apartment was originally made by the Company and was dealt with by HF. He was unable to recall much of the detail of this although it took place in 2010 and was thus much more recent than the 2006 payments. His evidence in relation to the letter of 22 December 2017 was also couched in cautious terms. He was ‘probably’ given the information in the letter by the father; it seems to me self-evident that he was undoubtedly given the instructions in the letter by the father, in relation to both the alleged ownership of the antiques, the nature of the antiques, the fear that there might be a conflict and the father’s intention to involve the police. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">The overall impact of all of these matters leads me to the conclusion that HF’s evidence may not be as reliable as it appears at first blush. It is clear that he has a very close relationship with the father and his loyalties are to him. Relying on memory in relation to events 14 years ago is unsatisfactory. Memories are not recording devices and it is well recognised that sincerely held beliefs as to the accuracy of memory may well be wrong. The accumulated effect of the passage of time, later discussions and loyalties all play a role in affecting the reliability of memory. Apart from anything else even if HF were correct in his memory there is the possibility that the father in fact was saying something different to the mother and that his intentions were in fact quite different to those relating to HF. Overall I therefore do not gain much assistance from HF’s evidence in relation to the issue of why the funds were paid to the mother in 2006.  </p>

		    <span style="font-style:italic">and the mother started discussing the possibility of the mother and children relocating abroad to benefit from an international life and education in Western Europe. He says that they had not then decided which country would be most appropriate. He says he undertook most of the planning and because he was aware that whichever country was chosen the mother would need to show she had significant funds in her own name which she could invest. He therefore instructed the Foundation to pay those sums into her account but they did not have the power to make a gift to her as she was not a beneficiary. He said he had complete control over the account and that the funds were invested in bonds and other stocks. [D82] HF says there was no personal file for this period and no documents relating to these transfers other than, he expected, the direction to the bank might exist. However he was unable to say in respect of these transfers whether the father made the request directly to the bank (as he did in 2009) or whether the Foundation itself did the administration. No attendance notes or instructions exist relating to the period. He said he recalled the subject being discussed with the father dating back to 2006.  The money was paid as a distribution to F not to M and it was a matter for him what he did with it. Although his statement said the mother should have returned the funds to the Foundation when she secured her visa in his evidence he said this was not correct and there was no obligation on the mother to do so as it was treated as a distribution made to F. </span>

		    <span style="font-weight:bold">It is not easy to disentangle this initial transfer of funds from the later transfers. Although in her statement in support of the without notice application the mother did not state she had been given the monies in 2006 I do not consider that that is an indication that she has subsequently fabricated it given the nature of the applications at that time and the relative urgency. The father’s evidence and that of HF to some extent was presented at times in a way to suggest this was a payment by the Foundation to M which she was obliged to return but the oral evidence made clear this was not so – why then was it presented in the way it was?  The father’s evidence that it was only in 2008 that he began thinking of the family relocating abroad would plainly be wholly inconsistent with his current case. He is a man who has an excellent memory and so it is curious that he should get the date wrong particularly when his current case is that discussions of relocation commenced very shortly after GD, ‘his Princess’ was born.  The evidence suggests that the father is capable of spontaneous and extraordinarily generous gestures. This is in particular illustrated by his purchase of a flat for DD but is also supported by the mother’s evidence as to the purchase of a £149,850 ring and the very considerable sums spent on individual items of furniture for the London </span>

		    <span style="font-weight:bold">demonstrative whether in showing affection, distress or anger. It seems clear that the father had fallen heavily in love with RD as he terminated his relationship with the mother and the children. This is not something he did when he married his current wife. His personality is such that the mother’s evidence of him having been captivated or obsessed with RD is entirely plausible. It is also certainly within the capacity of the father’s personality to have felt sufficient guilt and for that to have manifested itself in his transferring very substantial sums to the mother to provide security to her and the children who were then aged only 9, 5 and 1.  It emerged in the course of HF’s evidence that the estate planning in the Foundation made provision only for the children and not for the mother. This would also lend support to the mother’s account of the father’s sensitivity to her insecurity. The father was well aware of the mother’s financial acumen as he had been working with her and had witnessed her abilities in P Co. He knew she was not the sort of person to squander funds or to invest them dangerously.  He was also probably aware that the nature of their relationship (she in general doing as he asked and he being the dominant partner) would mean that if he did want the funds back at some point in the future she would probably return them anyway. This had occurred with the shares. Taking account of all of this and my general conclusions as to the credibility of the mother and the father I consider that the transfer in 2006 was more likely than not made in the circumstances the mother described. From her point of view it was a transfer to her for her security in the future; in terms a gift. I conclude that the father must also have intended her to perceive it in this way although it seems probable that although he described it as such to her he had in mind that if he wanted it back he could probably secure its return from her. </span>

He said that he would never write it as a gift and that because he was against this being a gift how could it influence the citizenship the fact that it was not her own money. He said they told him there was a small risk. He said that whilst the mother had the right to take the interest on the money she did not have the right to use the money and it was to be returned after the investor visa was obtained. </span>

		    <span style="text-decoration:underline">spontaneous disclosure by the husband under cross-examination.</span>
		    <span> </span>
		    <span style="font-weight:bold">There was no reference in the father’s written evidence about this meeting and no documentation has been produced from it. It seems surprising, given the focus in his statements on whether this was a gift or not, that this emerged only in his oral evidence. The extract of the immigration conditions [C227] relating to the investor visa state at paragraph 60 that applicants may rely on money that is owned solely by their unmarried partner but they must have unrestricted rights to transfer and dispose of the money and permission from the unmarried partner to have control of the money in the UK. The father’s case before me is that he was not the mother’s partner and that the mother did not have unrestricted rights to dispose of the money or to have control of the money in the UK. It seems improbable that lawyers versed in these applications would have allowed an application to be submitted if they were aware that the father did not accept being in a relationship with the mother or that she was under an obligation to return the monies to the father after the visa was obtained and that therefore she did not have an unrestricted right to dispose of the money or to have control of it in the UK. By this time the father was free of his infatuation with RD which had led to his gesture in 2006. He and the mother were in my view back in a relationship including an intimate one by this stage. He was back in control of the lives of the mother and children and I find it hard to believe that he did not consider that the funds were being gifted to the mother. It seems likely that as a result of the requirements in relation to the visa and the need for the mother to have the right to dispose of the monies and to have control of them, that the precise terms on which she was exchanging the original funds for the £1m were left hazy in order to ensure that the immigration application was honestly made. It may well be that the mother at the time chose to interpret this as a direct exchange or it may be that as time has passed and events have occurred that she has reinterpreted matters. </span>

It is abundantly clear that very considerable time and expense went into the creation of it. Although the father may well have had in mind the purchase of a property that would also be a good investment I have no doubt that the principal reason for purchasing the property was to provide a home for the mother and the children and the father when he visited. His statement earlier in the proceedings that he had wanted it also to be the home for his new wife and his child illustrates his thinking. The mother’s evidence about the process by which the renovation of the London Apartment was undertaken, the use of a designer and the father’s decision that the property would better be furnished with antiques rather than modern furniture appeared to me to be both consistent with the other evidence as to the father’s decision making but also appeared to be an account drawn directly and spontaneously from her memory. A reference to communications between the parties at this time also appeared to me to be genuine. The father’s changes in his position as to the ownership of the antiques or the loan of them undermines his assertion that they were in some way bought for display purposes. I am quite satisfied that all of the items purchased for the London Apartment and currently in situ were purchased as part of the plan to create a stunning family home in which the mother and children were to live for many years and which the father would enjoy on his visits. Had the father wished to purchase them as items to display in Russia he could have shipped them to one of his many properties in Russia or warehouse them there. </span>

In his Children Act statement of 12 April 2018 the father said that she said she only had £690,000 remaining. He did not mention the issue of £300,000 being kept by her as security. In his statement of 24 of January 2019 he says that when the mother agreed to be repaid at the end of the summer she said she would repay the remaining £300,000 at a later date [C130] and he decided he would pursue it later. </span>

		    <span style="font-weight:bold">Some criticism was made of a document that the mother had produced in English setting out the emails. It appeared to be suggested that she had only produced part of the information provided so as to suggest that in fact she only had £690,000 worth of bonds left and that the rest had been spent. This did not seem to be consistent with the father’s own evidence. On the father’s case the mother would have had no reason to argue about the return of the funds when she was not primarily motivated by money (as found by Recorder Genn and my own impression) and given that she had not in fact spent anything other than the interest. Thus the fact that there was a disagreement over the return of the funds would suggest that the mother believed she had rights to the funds. This would be consistent with her evidence about the 2006 and 2009 transfers and what was said to the Home Office in support of her application for a visa and perhaps citizenship. Given the father’s later threats in relation of eviction from the London Apartment it is in my view plausible that he would issue a threat to prevent the mother and children leaving Russia. He said it would not be possible for him to prevent the mother leaving which must be right but would not be the case in relation to TD and GD who were both under 16. I therefore accept the mother’s evidence that she returned the £690,000 under pressure from the father but held out to retain the £300,000 as security. I accept that the father’s response led the mother to believe he had agreed to this as he did not require the return of the £300,000. I do not accept that there was nothing he could have done. His character is such that if he had decided he wished the full amount to be returned he would have taken the necessary steps to force the mother to return it. Thus as a result of these discussions whatever the position was in relation to the 2006 funds or the 2009 funds it seems that an agreement was reached that the mother should return £690,000 and retain £300,000. I appreciate that the mother may have some argument that this agreement was reached under duress but I have not heard sufficient evidence or submissions on this issue to explore it in more detail. It seems to me that the dynamic between the mother and the father at this time was such that in general the mother agreed to do what the father wished although this may have been a rare moment when she found the determination to stand up to him in a small way particularly having regard to her beliefs as to her ownership of the 2006/2009 funds. In general terms, though, she was then (and still appears to be) grateful for all that he has provided for her and the children, and so I doubt that it would have taken a great deal of pressure to make her agree to return a large part of those funds. Thus those £300,000 in funds are to be regarded as legally and beneficially owned by the mother. The remaining £690,000 were returned to the father and I am not satisfied that they constitute a debt owed to the mother.      </span>

At that time the father was saying that he had expected to sell the mother’s N City flat and to pay the lump sum out of that whilst also buying a small flat in N City for the mother. Record Genn did not accept this and concluded [paragraph 92] that it was his impulsivity that underpinned the crisis and that he had a change of mind about the basis upon which he would give the money. DD’s refusal to bow to his father’s demand and to either say he would transfer any share he had in the N City Property to the father or to return the money led to the father’s abusive side emerging with full force.   </span>

		    <span style="font-weight:bold">“I find that the issue of money, whilst forming an important backdrop, was not the central issue for the applicant mother. It was an important backdrop because I find as a fact that she was dependent on the father and from the email exchanges, and indeed from much of the father’s own evidence, it was quite clear that he used both the security of the London Apartment and his continuing support as an emotional tool against the mother and the children. So, to that extent, money is indeed central to this case but central insofar as, and I accepted mother’s evidence on this, her need to keep the children secure both in terms of a roof over their head and their maintenance. In that context, I accept father’s evidence that whilst the £607,000 was a very generous sum of money, it was not particularly significant to him. What was significant to him was the need for respect and his imperative to teach his children lessons about the meaning of life and, to that extent his toughness training for his boys.  </span>

[97] having looked across the evidence and listened to all of it very carefully, I consider it much more likely than not that having put up with a relatively consistent and what may have seemed in some way a manageable level of abusive behaviour, that the change to the much more extreme and potentially risky behaviour and threats in January 2018, as I have said, much of it ultimately conceded by the father, indicated a much more extreme and frightening level and different quality of threats… [102]… However, given the fact that I find all of the family were exposed to those ongoing threats that the family could lose their home, that they would suffer as a result of the father’s anger, it seems much more likely than not that GD’s views were views that she had formed herself. </span>

He has accepted that his wealth is sufficient to meet any reasonable order which the court might make and that his objection to the mother and children remaining at the London Apartment is not based on affordability. He accepts that if they were to remain there it would not impact upon his ability to meet his needs and those of his immediate family. The evidence suggests that in addition to a very prosperous factory in N City the father also has fairly extensive property interests. At times he has held, through the Tallmann Foundation, very significant sums of money in investments. Although HF declined to disclose the total value of the interests held by the Foundation, whether in terms of the value of the Company which held the shares in P Co. or the cash and investments held, the impression he gave was that the transfer of £1 million was not a significant sum. The purchase of the London Apartment for £6.4 million, its refurbishment at a cost of £800,000 and the sums spent on antiques and jewellery measuring in the tens and hundreds of thousands of pounds indicate a man of very significant albeit not fabulous wealth. </p>

His assertion that his income from business activities has reduced very significantly because he is no longer the managing director of the P Co. group is hard to understand given he is the sole shareholder in the group.

His description tied in with that of the mother in this respect. However over the years it seems that when it has mattered to the father he has been capable of spending extraordinary sums whether it is £500,000 for a painting, £150,000 for a 4 carat diamond ring, or £6.4 million for the London property and £800,000 to furnish it. The father was capable of lavish spending on the mother and children for holidays as well as entertaining in London or elsewhere. However even allowing for this the depiction of both the mother and the father of their lifestyle was not one of constant high spending and opulence. What it did demonstrate was that when the father wishes it he is able to have access to very considerable sums of money to make lavish provision for himself and his family. </p>

It also rests on their need for security (emotional as much as physical) over the coming years.  There is no financial need to sell it given the father’s millionaire’s defence. He never complained about the cost of the service charge when he was using it as his home or when he first decided to purchase the property.

Mr Howard also relies on the fact that part of the abusive behaviour was the threat to evict the mother and children from the family home which was controlling and abusive and designed to reassert his control.  It is a bad message for the children if having threatened to evict them he now is able to remove them from their home. The children need to stay there for their emotional security and stability and the court is entitled to take account of their welfare. The father clearly remains a risk to them given he is totally in denial. The evidence shows him to be ruthless, impulsive, volatile and unassessed. He hates the mother and has breached the order by communicating with the mother and harassing the mother’s lawyer in Russia. The reality is he wants them removed to regain control and so he can install himself. The unparalleled security arrangements contribute to its value. However they also contribute to the sense of safety that the mother and children need. This is a real and continuing issue. The history of his abuse and his denial of it results in him being an unassessed and ongoing risk. The mother and children are with good cause highly fearful of the father and they know that their current home is safe and secure. Removing them from it will have a detrimental emotional impact on them. </p>

In particular she relies upon the involvement of independent third-party trustees and the security that this will give the mother and the children and the court’s disapproval (see Re N) of parents being involved in the control of the property. The father’s proposal of a lease would leave open the possibility of emotional control being exerted because he would remain the beneficial owner. Loopholes exist which would allow for the possibility of a judgment against the father being obtained and enforced against the property. This could not happen with a settlement. Furthermore the father suggests that the lease should terminate upon the death of the mother. This would leave the children without a home and unable to require a fresh lease. Alleged or minimal tax savings should carry little weight given the millionaire’s defence. </p>

He is not fabulously wealthy in the league of billionaires and oil sheiks. The reported cases such as Re P and Re A involve properties in the region of 3 ½ to £4 million where the father was fabulously wealthy and so the value of the London Apartment is disproportionately high even by those standards. There are many other properties which are significantly less costly both in terms of their capital value and their annual upkeep as shown in Mr Dyer’s report which would be more than adequate for the mother and children in terms of their location, size and amenities. Selling the London Apartment would enable the father to purchase both a property for the mother and children but also another property for himself and his wife and young daughter. The mother and children do not need the level of security that comes with the London Apartment and which leads to the increase in its price from effectively a £3 million to a £10 million flat. He has not been a threat for the last two years, he will not have keys to a new property and any non-molestation order will have the effect of protecting the mother and children if (which is not accepted) he does present a risk. Part of the property is not occupied and they do not need a spare bedroom. One of the properties identified by Mr Dyer would be more than adequate to meet the mother and children’s actual housing needs and their need for a sense of security.

Although it was purchased and renovated for the whole of the family, the day-to-day lives of the mother and the children have been spent living in it. The dayto-day life of the father has been spent living in his home in N City. Although it may be his London home it is that for only a couple of weeks each year. Conversely although the children return to N City for several weeks each year and are on holiday for several more weeks their day-to-day lives during school term time are lived here, and so for the vast majority of the year London and consequently the London Apartment is their home. They were relocated from Russia because the father desired it and so were uprooted from their home, schools, culture and all that was familiar to them since their births in order to make new lives in London. Although the father may have perceived it as a temporary relocation, from TD and GD’s perspective given they were only nine and four at the time, the fact that they have lived in London, been schooled in London and made their lives in London through their formative years </p>

The fact that the father sought to evict them from the property in my view also adds weight to the argument that they have an emotional as well as physical need to remain there. What sort of message does it give if the father who seeks to evict them by foul means ultimately succeeds through the courts?

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">In terms of size the property is appropriate for the mother, TD and GD. The fact that it has a spare bedroom is entirely in keeping with the standard of living to which the children have become accustomed and the probability that either family or friends will need accommodating from time to time. A number of the alternative properties put forward by the father would also have spare bedrooms. The exclusive location and the accompanying security are features which attracted the father to the property in the first place. That is why he considered it would be a good family home and a good investment. Apart from the fact that he will not be able to occupy the property as his home those features remain. Although the father argues that it may no longer represent a good investment there is no expert evidence that this is so and it seems to me there is an equally valid argument that the exclusivity of the address and the features which go with it will make it more resilient to variations in the market as it will always have appeal to the ultra-rich. The father may be right that objectively speaking the mother and children do not require the level of protection from him that goes with the address. However the reality is that both the mother and children have been subject to extremely serious threats and a degree of actual violence by the father and so it is hardly surprising that they are anxious and fearful about what he will do. He certainly proved himself capable of quite unexpectedly vicious behaviour in late 2017 and early 2018. The level of security though seems to me a minor factor overall. Nor does it seem to me that the issue of the value of the London Apartment should dictate the outcome. It may be disproportionate compared to alternative similar properties which can be secured in London. The value may be disproportionate compared to other reported cases. However this is the property that the father (and the mother to some extent) chose for the home for the children in London. Albeit this was to be the father’s home as well, given his limited periods of time in London, it must have principally been chosen as a suitable home for his children and the mother. Given the deployment of the millionaire’s defence and the father’s acceptance that the property’s retention will not impact upon his ability to meet his needs and those of his other families, the question of value assumes less prominence. Thus I conclude that the London Apartment ought to be retained as the home for the children and the mother. </p>

I note that the father’s stable of cars in Russia does not include the latest models or the largest of vehicles although his ownership of a Bentley indicates a high level of luxury. A budget of £55,000 for the purchase price will allow the mother to select either a large but lower specification vehicle or a more luxurious but smaller vehicle for herself and the children. Given the father agrees it ought to be renewed every four years I will provide for this. An allowance for the trade-in value of the mother’s vehicle will reduce the headline figure. No indexing is required, the need will reduce over time anyway as the children become more independent of the mother.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">I do not intend to descend into the detail of the budget and the particular criticisms. This is a big money case and I consider it appropriate to paint with a broad brush. This is a case where the father is very wealthy and the children have lived a high standard of living and should continue to experience a standard of living that bears some sort of relationship with the father’s. I remind myself that I must of course not seek to provide the mother with a standard of living the same as if she and the father had undertaken the commitment of marriage. But she should have control of a budget that reflects her position and that of the father both socially and financially. In calculating a carer’s allowance I have regard to the fact that the mother has given up work since she moved to London and the father’s involvement with the children over the last two years and into the future is likely to be either non-existent or very limited. She will therefore have the sole responsibility for their upbringing. As I have set out above I do not consider the mother to be primarily money motivated and nor do I consider her to have provided a way of life for the children which has been dominated by living a luxurious existence. However their way of life has involved living in one of the most exclusive parts of London, having a driver as part of their family retinue, experiencing extensive holidays whether in Russia, the Middle East, Europe or the USA and being able to experience life in all its forms at the top end of the scale whether in terms of extracurricular activities, clothing, entertainment or otherwise. There are some aspects of the mother’s budget which are plainly impermissible, in particular expenses claimed in respect of DD which she cannot obtain by the back door of her own needs. However including within the budget items which relate to the mother’s personal expenses including personal grooming, clothing etc. are clearly indirectly of benefit to the children. Having a cleaner, having a driver, a high standard of foreign holidays [D53] all seem to me to be part of the reasonable needs of the children albeit the family may need to make some choices as to how the gross amount of maintenance is actually deployed. Some of the sums are manifestly not extravagant for instance food at £200 per week and eating out at £200 per calendar month. On the other hand a total of £23,295 the bulk of which is made up of additional lessons for GD seems, as the father suggests, on the high side. I have regard to the fact that the amount the mother spent in 2017 cannot have included all of the holiday costs and so the £120,000 identified by the father is probably the bottom end of her expenditure. He said that in the period 2011 to 2017 that on average he paid her £9,000 per month or £108,000 per annum. He said this included DD so her current expenditure ought to be lower although this ignores both inflation and the fact that the mother will now be meeting expenses that the father used to meet directly. The receipt and spending of some £185,000 directly from the father together with a further £17,000 from the Company, some of which may have been referable to 2018 expenditure, probably represents broadly an upper limit. Even a relatively shallow dive into the competing budgets shows that simply adding in the costs of the driver at roughly £26,000 per annum, the more generous holiday allowance of an additional £30,000, a more generous clothing allowance for all of £10,000, extra cleaning of £4,000 and something towards the costs of maintaining the N City Property brings the total towards £200,000. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">I therefore conclude that the sum of £200,000 per annum represents the appropriate global sum for maintenance. This will be RPI linked, back-dated to the date of the application (giving credit for sums already ordered and paid). In broad terms and having regard to the fixed costs of items such as housing or the driver which will not alter when for instance TD falls out of the equation it seems to me that allocating 20% of the total sum to each child with the remainder being the carer’s allowance would properly reflect the balance between the children’s direct costs and the carer’s allowance. Thus £40,000 per annum per child until 18 or ceasing full-time tertiary education (to first degree but including a gap year) with the remainder as the carer’s allowance. As a cross-check to this division I note that the mother allocated about 17 ½% per child and the father allocated about 25% per child. The carer’s allowance element will of course come to an end when the second of the children’s maintenance terminates. </p>

Although he accepts that the case law identifies exceptional circumstances where such provision might be made this was referable to matters such as long-term disability. In addition he submits that the court cannot make an order when the child is an adult and providing for GD once she is after 18 or for TD now he is over 18 is impermissible. Both the jurisprudence and the purpose lying behind the Sch 1 provisions make clear that the court’s powers are targeted at children who are dependent adults. Hence there is no reported example of the court making long-term capital provision for a child which extends into their independent adulthood. It is entirely inappropriate to seek to dictate to the father what dispositions of his money he should make to his children during his lifetime. If he wishes to provide a home to them that is a matter for him; equally if he does not wish to do so he should not be obliged to do so. </p>

Having said that, it is clear from the authorities that in some circumstances where the court identifies some continuing dependency such an order can be contemplated. The obvious example would be that of a disabled child who might need a specially adapted home long into adulthood. However I do not think that dependency is necessarily so narrowly confined. Dependency connotes some form of vulnerability or need continuing from childhood into adulthood which can be remedied by capital provision. I am satisfied on the evidence that I have read and heard that both TD and GD carry with them a vulnerability arising from their childhood which will endure into their adulthood. The children have seen a psychotherapist and the preliminary report was available to Cafcass. It is quite clear that both TD and GD need therapeutic support as a consequence of the father’s abuse. Quite how one comes to terms with your father threatening to slit your throat or your mother’s throat and threatening to throw you out of your home I am unsure. Long experience in children’s cases and the research into the long term effects of abuse on children (see amongst others the report of Drs Sturge and Glaser [2000] Fam Law 615) suggests to me that whilst these children may be able to get on with their lives they are likely to carry the emotional scars in some shape or form for a very long time indeed. This is a product of the abuse that they have been subjected to by the father. Another component of this is the ongoing risk that the father presents. He is used to getting his own way and determining what his family does. He was quite clear in his evidence that he hopes or even expects the children to return to his fold when the scales fall from their eyes and they see that he was the victim of the mother’s manipulation rather than vice versa. That of course is a complete inversion of the findings made by Recorder Genn and my own conclusions. That he says he forgives the children rather than seeking their forgiveness encapsulates his unrepentant rejection of the real substance of the findings made by Recorder Genn. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">I therefore conclude that it is more probable than not that the father will in due course seek to resume a relationship with the children and will seek to persuade them to join him and his business in Russia. He is likely to approach that on the basis that he is the wronged party with the expectation that the children will realise the wrong their mother has done. That of course is completely contrary to their reality. His track record of using his financial muscle to seek to control was most evident in his actions in relation to the family home in December 2017 and January 2018, but his behaviour towards DD over the £607,000 and in relation to the investor visa monies in August 2016 are further examples of him exerting control in relation to financial matters. It therefore seems to me more probable than not that when the children do reach adulthood and do not willingly return to his fold that they are likely to face some sort of financial ultimatum from their father. At that point they will be peculiarly vulnerable as the maintenance will have come to an end and they will have lost their long-term home in the London Apartment. At that point they will be at their most vulnerable to the exertion of financial control whether directly or indirectly via the mother who will also be vulnerable at that point. I therefore consider that their vulnerability or potential dependency upon their father results in a clear need for financial and emotional protection. This protection can only be provided by giving them a sufficient degree of financial independence from the father to allow them to withstand the sort of pressure that is likely to be brought to bear upon them through some sort of financial ultimatum and which the emotional abuse they have sustained makes them so vulnerable to. That, I am satisfied, amounts to an exceptional circumstance which justifies the making of a capital award which will endure beyond their minority, beyond their dependency whilst in education and into an indeterminate </p>

Only by giving them the means to say no to their father’s exertion of financial control can they be properly protected and provided for in the future. I’m quite satisfied that this is a legitimate use of the Sch 1 provisions. I do not consider that the existence of a non-molestation order, even if it extends long into the future, will address the issue. I ask myself rhetorically, if this situation does not amount to an exceptional circumstance justifying their deployment what, other than physical disability or clear lack of capacity, would? Thus I consider that they need and that their welfare justifies the provision of a ‘financial ultimatum’ (FU) fund to enable them to deal with this probable scenario. </p>

I conclude that the appropriate capital award for the FU fund should be broadly referable to that which enabled DD to find independence from his father by the provision of a sum which allowed him to buy a flat. In broad terms it seems to me that the sum necessary would be in the region of £650,000, including purchase costs. </p>

Another alternative would be to provide within the terms of a settlement for a sum equivalent to 6.5% of the gross sale price. It seems to me that a property adjustment order provides the greatest security to the children allowing for the fact that I do not consider it likely that the value of the London Apartment is likely to fall significantly compared with the rest of the London property market. However as there was limited time and to explore the alternative mechanisms should the parties wish to make further submissions on this in relation to the drafting of the order I will permit that.  </p>

In his evidence the father identified that many of the items had been given an excessive price tag and he gave some particular examples where he considered that the price given was somewhere between three and 10 times the cost that he considered was reasonable. He questioned who had provided the quote and considered that they were grossly overcharging. In his open offer he had said a realistic figure was £25,000. The mother’s figure amounted to £300,000. The schedule she provided identified the cost of the items damaged to amount to £154,000 and the total quote which I think was including labour was given at £300,000. On further exploration the father accepted that his figure of £25,000 was perhaps on the low side and he said that he could refurbish it for £32,000 which he described as a very significant sum in terms of the cost of housing and labour in Russia. However he did acknowledge that the figure he had given was what he could refurbish the property for given his extensive knowledge of and contacts in the construction industry. He said that if anybody else did it it could be much more and went so far as to say the cost could be infinite.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">Plainly given the findings made against him the father cannot be involved in the refurbishment of the property and so the opportunity to refurbish it at a significantly lower cost is not available. It may be that the mother will face some difficulties in having the refurbishment undertaken given the father’s status in Russia. However I remind myself that the total cost of the refurbishment of the London Apartment was £800,000. That was in London and that was on the basis that the property was both renovated and furnished with high value antiques. The international living cost index in at a glance 2019/ 2020 identifies London at 100 and Moscow at 64. I think it reasonable to assume that N City is cheaper than Moscow. Thus the estimate of £300,000 seems more likely to be the estimate of a builder pricing by the wealth of the client rather than by the actual cost of undertaking the work with a sensible margin of profit. Given the vast disparity between the mother’s and the father’s position my capacity to get to a genuine or reliable figure is limited. Neither party has produced costed schedules from builders/designers in N City. Given that the property is no longer intended to be the primary home of the children I do not consider that it is a reasonable need to refurbish the property in a manner identical to that which existed prior to 2018. It was created then as the children’s principal home. £32,000 is likely to be the very bottom end of the cost of refurbishing the property and I think a realistic figure is 2 ½ times that to create a holiday home for the children when they are in Russia. Thus a lump sum of £80,000 is the appropriate sum. </p>

Pergolas at the London Apartment is costed at £5,200 (£2,600 now and £2,600 in 2025) new furniture for the children’s bedrooms or studies is costed at roughly £21,000.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">The mother’s budget includes provision for birthdays, Christmas, parties and replacement of items in the household. I do not consider that the extremely generous provision contained within additional capital budget can be described as a reasonable need for the children. Watches, graduation presents and parties are part and parcel of day-to-day living and I do not consider that the evidence establishes a clear tradition in this family that establishes a need in this regard beyond the ordinary annual budget. If GD had desired a dog there have been funds available to the mother which could have been deployed to buy her one. I do not consider that she has a need for a dog which the father should be obliged to meet. Driving expenses for TD and GD it seems to me are an income expense and can be incorporated out of the budget. Given that the children have lived in London for some 10 odd years it is somewhat surprising that if they wanted to bicycle around a London Park bicycles have not been acquired for them so far. The costs of obtaining phones, computers and the maintenance of the pergola due now and some additional or replacement furniture seems to be reasonable. However I do not consider that a sum in excess of £10,000 is required to meet these reasonable needs. £10,00 is the lump sum I will order in respect of this head. Dentistry costs and past therapy costs are part and parcel of day-to-day living and to the extent that there will be dentistry costs in the future there are elements within the mother’s budget for meeting health needs. The past therapy costs have as far as I can tell not identifiably been met from the mother’s funds rather than maintenance but I consider these should be reimbursed if quantified by provision of relevant proof. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in">The mother advanced a claim for a lump sum in respect of the cost of the jewellery. That amounted to £249,750. The father denied that claim in its entirety and submitted that even if accessories such as jewellery could properly form part of a lump sum in this sort of sum it was wholly unjustified and outside the jurisdiction of the court. Mr Howard maintained that it could be characterised as a need of the carer which fell into the grey area identified by Mr Justice Bodey. Whilst I have concluded that the father did remove the jewellery and whilst I’m sure the children would welcome its return, I do not consider that it can be properly characterised as a need of the children for the mother to have it restored to her which should sound in financial orders available to the court. As I have set out above if the father wishes to exchange the jewellery for some of the items in the London Apartment that would appear to me to be a pragmatic solution albeit not one which the court can order. </p>
