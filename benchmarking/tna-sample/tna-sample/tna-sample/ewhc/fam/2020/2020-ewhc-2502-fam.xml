Later, she was complaining of a tummy ache and was vomiting on and off throughout the night. The following day, 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April, she did not go to nursery but was looked after by her paternal grandmother, whilst her mother took her sister to hospital to have a cast removed from her arm. When the mother returned, she noted that K’s eyes looked puffy and she appeared sleepy and she took her to the GP. Her GP was concerned about her high heart rate and swollen face, suspecting sepsis. An ambulance was called, and K was taken to hospital. She was noted to be drowsy and poorly perfused, with tachycardia and slightly increased inflammatory markers. It was suspected that she might have sepsis or meningitis and antibiotics and antiviral drugs were given. A blood test grew no pathogens and the inflammatory markers improved. She remained tachycardic and drowsy, with fluctuating responsiveness and at one point, was noted to be fully responsive and sitting up in bed. However, in the early hours of the morning of 6 April, she had a sudden cardiac arrest and despite full CPR over about an hour, she did not recover and died. </p>

However, Dr Palm was concerned that some of the usual features associated with meningitis or sepsis were not present; there was no evidence from the brain of meningitis or encephalitis. There was no evidence suggestive of any pre-existing congenital or acquired natural illness or other medical condition that could have caused or contributed to her death. There was no evidence to indicate an ongoing overwhelming infection or sepsis. There were no traumatic injuries other than resuscitation related rib fractures. There was evidence of an acute mode of death, likely due to heart failure. The heart muscle showed necrosis. She returned to take hair samples from K. </p>

The other evidence was principally focused on the issues of drug use and domestic abuse. </p>

At that stage, the Local Authority initially advanced an application seeking to adjourn the final hearing on the basis that aspects of the evidence were unlikely to be sufficiently clear or complete so as to enable a final hearing to proceed. However, the adjournment application was not advanced when it became clear that the court would be unable to hear the case until, at worst (and most probably), early 2021 or at best (and unlikely), October 2020. The matter was listed for a final case management hearing on 3 April 2020. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Arrangements were made by the parties and the court for a hybrid hearing which permitted the parents and PGM to give evidence before me in person and to enable them to see each other give evidence, with some of the advocates being present and others participating remotely. On 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June, I heard evidence from the maternal grandmother; it had been intended that the mother would give evidence on the 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June but, on the 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June, she took an overdose of (I was told) antidepressants and was admitted to hospital.  On the 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June, the hospital confirmed she was an inpatient and in need of ongoing medical monitoring and assessment by the mental health team, requiring at least a further 24 to 48 hours of inpatient management. As a result, the scheduling of the witnesses was rearranged so that the paternal grandmother gave evidence on 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June and the father on the 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> and 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> of June. It had been hoped that the mother might have been able to give evidence at some point in the week commencing 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June but, although she was discharged from hospital, arrangements were being pursued to admit her to a crisis unit and by 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> July, her treating psychiatrist, provided a brief report confirming that, in her opinion, she did not believe the mother then had capacity to instruct her legal team. She said that the mother was experiencing a depressive episode, presenting as low in mood and anxious and was to commence antidepressant medication, as well as accessing counselling. It was therefore, not possible for the mother to give evidence and to complete the case. Given the difficulties that had been experienced in securing clear information as to the mother’s medical position, I provided for the instruction of a single joint expert, Dr McEvedy.  The case was adjourned to the week commencing 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July, in the hope that the mother would by then be able to give evidence, either at an attended hearing or at least remotely. </p>

He assessed the mother on 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July, and confirmed that, in his opinion, the mother was capable of conducting the proceedings, albeit the mother told him she did not feel able to take part in the proceedings. His opinion was that, whilst participation would be challenging for the mother, she demonstrated capacity and was able to give evidence, albeit any cross examination should be conducted with as much sensitivity as possible. Somewhat to my surprise given what all concerned had been told earlier, he recorded that the mother had taken an overdose of antidepressants with alcohol and cocaine. The mother told him that this had been with suicidal intent. When he saw her, she had not further harmed herself although later that week a further episode of self-harm was recorded by the unit staff. He was unable to offer her a likely diagnosis or diagnoses as he had not had access to her psychiatric or medical records, but noted that from the information he had seen and from her own account, she had a substance misuse disorder as well as whatever illness or personality difficulty which gave rise to her recent crisis. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The mother filed a statement on 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> July in which she said that she did not feel she was in a position to give evidence as she was not in the right frame of mind. She said she was extremely muddled and confused and that her mind had blocked out much of what happened, although this was not consistent with Dr McEvedy’s findings. She said in her statement, that she did not foresee her mental health improving in the near future and that she needs help and time to focus on herself. As a result, she said that she was not in a position to care for the children, although was not giving up on them. She said that, as she needed time to help herself, she considered that it was best that the children be placed with her sister. She said in that statement that she knew she had not been fully honest about her past drug use, although I note that she does not refer to having consumed cocaine in relation to the recent admission to the hospital. On 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2020, each of the parties informed the court that, in view of the mother’s position, no party sought to compel her to give evidence and that they were prepared to proceed on the basis of her tape-recorded interviews and her statements.  </p>

On Monday, 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May the Local Authority filed an amended threshold. This contained a very significant change in the nature of the allegations. The Local Authority replaced the allegation that cocaine had been administered, or negligently ingested, with an allegation that cocaine was ingested whilst in the care of and due to the culpable actions or neglect of either the mother, the father or the paternal grandmother. Alternatively, they culpably failed to protect her from the same. Thus, although still an extremely serious allegation with potential criminal ramifications, it was significantly less serious than before. The Local Authority no longer pursued findings in respect of the maternal grandmother; accepting that the hair strand testing and screening of her home were consistent with exposure to drugs from others’ actions.   </p>

They have included detailed and extensive submissions on the evidence as it originally stood and as it has been refined or developed over the course of the trial. I am extremely grateful for the time that all of the legal teams have dedicated to presenting their clients’ cases, whilst also assisting the court. I cannot hope to fully reflect the depth and breadth of those submissions in this judgment. To do so would make what is already a very lengthy judgment nigh on impossible to navigate or digest. Most of the parties’ cases revolve around the interpretation of the evidence, which I set out at length later in this judgment and to summarise the evidence the parties rely on would involve extensive duplication. I will address some of the evidential points and submissions in my survey of the evidence and in my analysis, but even those cannot fully incorporate all that has been said or written. I have attempted to focus on what seem to me to be the essential arguments and evidential points, so as to enable the parties to understand why I have come to the conclusions that I have, rather than to deal with each and every point made. The essential elements of the parties’ cases, in support of their position in respect of the threshold, I attempt to summarise below. </p>

The lack of detail in their accounts and, in particular, their behaviour later that day is highly suspicious.

The later Lextox reports are consistent with the earlier Lextox reports. The results provided by Chemtox, after the conclusion of the evidence are unsatisfactory and the court should rely on the better evidence of the Lextox reports. The Local Authority must prove that the mother interfered with her hair if the court is to prefer the Chemtox report. They cannot do that and it is improper to infer or speculate as to how the mother might have acquired the knowledge of how to influence a drugs test. By July 2019, when the directions hearing took place, she was unaware that a further drug test might occur, she undertook not to interfere with her hair and the opportunity to do so between the direction and the taking of the sample was limited. Her evidence should be accepted on this. </p>

The court can also conclude that the paternal grandmother knew of father 1’s dealings; there is no other interpretation for the covert recording conversations. She condoned the mother and father 1’s use of drugs by caring for the children so they could consume. She was relaxed about discussing drugs with her son. The evidence of her familiarity with drugs and ease around them should inform the court’s assessment of the hair strand testing. The Chemtox results can be relied upon and the court should note that these hair strand samples were taken when the parties had almost no notice of samples being taken  due to the police interest in cocaine  having been involved in K’s death. The drug mapping which found traces of cocaine all over the paternal grandmother’s home supports a picture in its entirety which supports the Chemtox results being accurate. </p>

Rather, it must take account of a wide range of matters which include the expert evidence but also include, for example, its assessment of the credibility of the witnesses and the inferences that can properly be drawn from the evidence. The court must take into account all the evidence and furthermore consider each piece of evidence in the context of all the other evidence. The court invariably surveys a wide canvas. A judge in these difficult cases must have regard to the relevance of each piece of evidence to other evidence and to exercise an overview of the totality of the evidence in order to come to a conclusion.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Thus, the opinions of medical experts need to be considered in the context of all of the other evidence. Appropriate attention must be paid to the opinion of medical experts, those opinions need to be considered in the context of all the other evidence. It is important to remember that the roles of the court and the expert are distinct and it is the court that is in the position to weigh up the expert evidence against its findings on the other evidence. It is the judge who makes the final decision. Cases involving allegations of this nature often involve a multi-disciplinary analysis of the medical information conducted by a group of specialists, each bringing their own expertise to bear on the problem. The court must be careful to ensure that each expert keeps within the bounds of their own expertise and defers, where appropriate, to the expertise of others. When considering the medical evidence in cases where there is a disputed aetiology giving rise to significant harm, the court must bear in mind, to the extent appropriate in each case, the possibility of the unknown cause [<span style="text-decoration:underline">R v Henderson and</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">Butler and Others</span> [2010] EWCA Crim 126 and <span style="text-decoration:underline">Re R (Care Proceedings: Causation)</span> [2011] EWHC 1715 (Fam)].

It is always desirable, where possible, for the perpetrator of non-accidental injury to be identified both in the public interest and in the interest of the child. Where it is impossible for a judge to find on the balance of probabilities, for example that parent A rather than parent B caused the injury, neither can be excluded from the pool and the judge should not strain to do so [<span style="text-decoration:underline">Re D (Children) [2009] 2 FLR 668 </span>and <span style="text-decoration:underline">Re S-B (Children)</span>]. Where a perpetrator cannot be identified, the court should seek to identify the pool of possible perpetrators on the basis of the real possibility test, namely that if the evidence is not such as to establish responsibility on the balance of probabilities, it should nevertheless be such as to establish whether there is a real possibility that a particular person was involved. When looking at how best to protect child and provide for his future, the judge will have to consider the strength of that possibility as part of the overall circumstances of the case [<span style="text-decoration:underline">Re S-B (Children)</span> at paragraph 43]. Finally, when seeking to identify the perpetrators of non-accidental injuries the test of whether a particular person is in the pool of possible perpetrators is whether there is a likelihood or a real possibility that he or she was the perpetrator. In order to make a finding that a particular person was the perpetrator of non-accidental injury the court must be satisfied on a balance of probabilities. It is always desirable, where possible, for the perpetrator of nonaccidental injury to be identified both in the public interest and in the interest of the child, although where it is impossible for a judge to find on the balance of probabilities, for example that Parent A rather than Parent B caused the injury, then neither can be excluded from the pool and the judge should not strain to do so </p>

Another is that they are lies told for other reasons stop further possibilities include faulty recollection or confusion at times of stress or when the importance of accuracy is not fully appreciated, or there may be inaccuracy or mistake in the record-keeping or recollection of the person hearing and relaying the accounts. The possible effects of delay and repeated questioning upon memory should also be considered, as should the effect on one person hearing accounts given by others.

However, as the  closing  submissions of the Mother and the Guardian argue (and indeed the general rule proposed by Johnson J is subject to ‘particular facts’) the statutory framework and the jurisprudence suggest a more nuanced approach which takes account of the circumstances of the refusal or failure to give evidence and the nature of the issue and the evidence which is given by other parties.      </p>

These are inquisitorial proceedings rather than adversarial, where the welfare of the children is at stake and where the authorities on fact-finding require the court to survey all the evidence and to avoid compartmentalisation. The legislative framework allows for the admission of hearsay evidence. The approach to lies in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Lucas </span>requires a more measured approach. At one end of the spectrum, there will no doubt be cases where the court is satisfied that a person has deliberately refused to come to court to support their written statement and where there is no excuse or explanation. In that scenario, the court might take a bright line approach and refuse to place any weight on any of their evidence and draw inferences against them that any allegations are true.

He reviewed the previous cases at paragraph 26 and set out 12 propositions which were agreed between the expert witnesses in that case. Many, perhaps all are reflected in the evidence given in this case by Dr Cirimele and Professor Forrest. I note that those 12 propositions relate to adults.  </p>

The extraction of chemicals from a solid matrix such as human hair is inevitably accompanied by margins of variability.  No doubt our understanding will increase with developments in science but, as matters stand, the evidence in this case satisfies me that these testing organisations approach their task conscientiously.  Also, as previous decisions remind us, a test result is only part of the evidence.  A very high result may amount to compelling evidence, but in the lower range numerical information must be set alongside evidence of other kinds.  Once this is appreciated, the significance of variability between one low figure and another falls into perspective. </span></p>

	      <span style="font-style:italic">I must say something about the reporting of test results as being within the high/medium/low range.  In fairness to the testing organisations, this practice has developed at the request of clients wishing to understand the results more easily.  The danger is that the report is too easily taken to be conclusive proof of high/medium/low use, when in fact the actual level of use may be lower or higher than the description.  You cannot read back from the result to the suspected use.  Two people can consume the same amount of cocaine and give quite different test results.  Two people can give the same test result and have consumed quite different amounts of cocaine.  This is the consequence of physiology: there are variables in relation to hair colour, race, hair condition (bleaching and straightening damages hair), pregnancy and body size.  Then there are the variables inherent in the testing process.  Dr McKinnon explained that there is therefore only a broad correlation between the test results and the conclusions that can be drawn about likely use and that it should be recognised that in some cases (of which this is in his opinion, one) there will be scope for reasonable disagreement between experts.  </span>

I accept the evidence of the witnesses for the testing companies that when one analyses thousands of tests, patterns can emerge that help when drawing conclusions.  It would be artificial to require valid data to be struck from the record because it falls below a cut-off level when it may be significant in the context of other findings.  That would elevate useful guidelines into iron rules and, as Dr McKinnon says, increase the number of false negative reports.  What can, however, be said is that considerable caution must be used when taking into account results that fall below the cut-off level. </span>

It may of course come, in the case of cocaine, from the presence of powdered cocaine itself which the child may touch and transfer to its hair. Dr Cirimele also included, within his description of environmental contamination, a child ingesting cocaine powder by touching powder which was present on a surface, including toys and then putting their hands in their mouth. However, cocaine and its metabolites would also be present in the environment from the sweat or urine of an adult who had consumed drugs. Sweat or urine could be transferred from the hands or body of an adult onto the hair of a child. Environmental contamination could also come from crack cocaine being smoked with the smoke landing on the child’s hair. Direct ingestion could also take place by the child breathing cocaine smoke. Smoke particles or their residue could remain after smoking had ceased which could be responsible for contamination or (it seems to logically follow) ingestion. Thus, whilst test results might in broad terms point to environmental contamination they might also reflect an element of ingestion.  </p>

He said there were no controlled studies to his knowledge.

Dr Cirimele was questioned extensively on the significance of his findings in this regard. In his evidence in chief he appeared to agree with what Dr Forrest said during the experts meeting [E309] which was that ‘<span style="font-style:italic">a hair root was a fairly protected area and so wouldn’t be exposed to contamination during the post-mortem examination and it would represent drugs which may have been ingested by the child which had been circulated in the blood in the last few days before their death</span>.’ In the course of further questioning on the issue Dr Cirimele gave as his opinion that the issue was not quite as straightforward as that. He explained that when testing the hair root it was not possible to delineate precisely the border between the root and the hair and that in testing it when the root was cut off it would include the root envelope including a small part of the hair fibre itself. He said that in an adult it was easier to identify the root which was below the skin surface but with a child it was less clearly delineated. Thus, he explained that in testing the </p>

He also said that it was possible for cocaine on the surface of the hair and scalp to pass into the derma. He said that if the test results had demonstrated the presence of cocaine which was higher than that present in the proximal part of the hair then that would be a clear indicator of the ingestion of cocaine because a higher reading at or below the skin surface in hair would not be consistent with external contamination which had caused lower levels in the immediately adjacent hair. However, when as in this case the test results demonstrated levels of cocaine and its metabolites in the hair root which were comparable to those found in the most recently grown hair his opinion was that the presence of cocaine and its metabolites was more probably due to contamination than ingestion. However, he said that the test results did not rule out ingestion and were not inconsistent with it. The terminology which he used in the report in this regard which was that it did not indicate that K was more exposed to the drug closer to the time of death, is to be interpreted it seems to me as the results did not show a significant or detectable change in the level of exposure immediately prior to her death. </p>

More than this he opined that the absence of any ‘spike’ or anomaly in the pattern indicated that K had not been exposed to a significantly greater amount of cocaine at any particular time.  </p>

He therefore posed the question of what had occurred during that period of time which might have affected the results. Clearly one issue he was concerned about was whether the hair had been treated in any way which would have affected the presence of drugs in the hair. In particular he focused on the fact that the Lextox results detected BZE in the hair of both the mother and the paternal grandmother which he said was inexplicable by normal processes. BZE would be present in hair either through ingestion or environmental contamination but would always be associated with the presence of the parent drug i.e. cocaine. He said all of the literature and his understanding was that if BZE was present through environmental contamination there would be higher results for the parent drug. However, BZE presence alone could be explained by the application of hair treatments which had eradicated the presence of cocaine but left traces of BZE which is not a true metabolite but can also be created through the application of alcohol or bleach </p>

There were a number of possibilities as to what had happened including contamination from an earlier sample, laboratory error in labelling, contamination when the sample itself was taken and cocaine being given to K whilst at the hospital (this would explain the presence of BZE in a later blood serum sample and not in the earlier sample). He thought that it was unlikely that the sample had been erroneously labelled or contaminated by the testing equipment because the procedures existed to prevent this and there was nothing to support this. Nor did he think that the issue of background noise in gas chromatography testing was a likely explanation for the result. His abiding opinion, (and he was robustly challenged on all of the possible alternative explanations),  whether the sample was urine or serum and taking account of all of the issues relating to the possible problems with the sample was that the reading obtained by Dr Patterson represented the presence of BZE within the body at the time it was taken and thus represented some form of ingestion of cocaine by K in the period of days immediately preceding her death.  He acknowledged that the value given would be affected by whether the result was interpreted by reference to the values relevant to serum or the values relevant to urine but it was inescapable that BZE was present ‘more than minimal but not substantial’. The absence of cocaine being detected in the sample was consistent with the half-life of the parent drug cocaine and its metabolite BZE. He said it would be expected that the half-life of cocaine would lead to it being undetectable in blood something like 10 hours after its consumption and that it would disappear from urine more quickly than its metabolite BZE would. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.00in">He said one must be very careful about making assumptions about how much cocaine was ingested and when K was exposed. He emphasised the limitations of toxicological testing and what could be extrapolated from test results. He said that the presence of low levels of BZE in the urine sample in his opinion suggested consumption between 3 to 5 days prior to the test. He noted that issues such as dehydration or low blood sodium might have meant that K was producing more concentrated urine which would have led to the BZE being detectable in it for longer.  If it had been consumed more recently it is more likely that other samples including from the liver would have shown its presence. He said that what he knew of the description of K’s reported illness did not depict her as a child acutely ill or severely ill which would be more consistent with an overdose level. The lack of research or evidence of how much cocaine would need to be consumed to lead to this damage, and how children processed cocaine meant it was difficult to say much about the quantity that K may have consumed. He said it would be more than a trace but not necessarily very much. There are so many variables in relation to children and their sensitivity. He couldn’t say the type of cocaine consumed, how much, how frequently and/or the circumstances of consumption. His opinion was most likely oral ingestion but he accepted it could have been ingested by any of the mucous membranes including through the nose and eyes. He did not consider that the toxicological or other evidence pointed to the amount ingested being indicative of an overdose.  </p>

He said that studies showed that there could be widely varied results reported by different laboratories in respect of hair which theoretically represented the same time period. He did think that the results for the mother and paternal grandmother were at the far limits of the differentials he had seen. Having looked at the results for father 1 from Chemtox and Lextox he said that the differences noted there were within the normal range of differences reported. He did not think there was a need to seek explanation for the differences other than that. </p>

Whereas the later tests did not detect anything in that period and continued to detect nothing through until May/June 2019 when BZE was detected at an almost identical level to that detected in the earlier test. The test then detected no trace of metabolites until the sample covering the period of the middle of March 2020 until the middle of May 2020 when cocaine, BZE and cocaethylene were detected above cut off levels.

She was instructed following the suggestion at the Metropolitan Police experts’ meeting at the end of January although the application pursuant to part 25 was not made until March. Unfortunately, the Professor contracted Covid 19 and her report was received on 21 April. She was instructed to carry out a very broad task namely ‘<span style="font-style:italic">Please review K's medical records and identify any potential origins of the cardiac necrosis, identified during postmortem</span>.’ She was provided with the entirety of the bundle including the parents’ police interviews and statements as well as the medical records and the reports of the experts instructed in the family case and the experts instructed by the coroner and police. She carried out a wide-ranging review which I think reflects the broad nature of the instruction that she was provided with and the material that she was provided with.

Whilst I do not accept that she was drawing such conclusions but was raising questions (which may have been a product of her child protection role in her clinical practice) and nor do I accept that she had approached the case with a closed mind or that she prejudged that K had died of cocaine ingestion, her report was phrased in a direct way that was in contrast to some of the other reports.

This is speculation, but her presentation was extremely atypical especially in the absence of sepsis. Although there was no evidence of a true 'dilated cardiomyopathy' in K, when this develops related to Cocaine it is likely to be as the result of serial insults and damage to the heart muscle over time. K was only 3. Cocaine does also however acutely alter the stiffness and contractile function of heart muscle (Refs 1 &amp; 2) and would therefore leave it vulnerable to, for example, a drop in oxygen levels related to reduced consciousness level and breathing effort.

The shaking and jerking are from increased nervous activity in the brain but may not always represent true seizures. They can also represent distress / agitation (Ref 8) and disturbed consciousness. There may be specific heart muscle injury from ischaemia (reduced blood supply from increased sympathetic nervous system activation, as well as increased heart rate and heart muscle oxygen demand). However, there are also more indirect effects on the heart muscle due to constriction of the blood vessels of the body causing increased resistance to blood flow around it and higher blood pressure, which reduces the heart’s ability to relax and fill. This can cause back pressure on the lungs and other organs and fluid retention. Cocaine also directly affects the chemistry of the heart muscle cells and therefore increases the risk of dangerous heart rhythm disturbances (usually ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation). </span>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.00in">Children tend to be robust and keep going even with reduced heart output until they suddenly collapse. In particular whilst children are awake the body produces chemicals which continue to stimulate the heart. When a child falls asleep when their heart is in low output the stimulant chemicals are removed and can lead to the heart function dropping below the threshold at which it can sustain effective circulation. The presence of excess fluid causes further work for the heart to circulate blood. This can then result in PEA. The inability to restart K’s heart is consistent with a primary cardiac problem rather than a respiratory or infective cause. </p>

Having heard the further opinions that cardiac necrosis was unlikely to be associated with the resuscitation attempts Dr Hawcutt was more confident in his identification of cocaine as the cause of a cardiac necrosis which then led to arrhythmia and death.

The other possible causes of death including the misadministration of the vomiting/nausea drug which the NICE guidelines indicated could in association with hypokalaemia lead some patients to heart arrhythmia; hypovolaemic shock, a sodium deficiency leading to heart arrhythmia and the possible relevance of the low potassium amounting to an electrolyte deficiency which might have caused heart arrhythmia were all tested in extensive detail. He said that the administration of the anti-vomiting drug combined with the low potassium was unlikely in his view to provide an explanation although he accepted that the NICE guidelines contained a reference to some patients experiencing heart arrhythmia. He said the potassium levels indicated were only just elevated. He said he had never encountered hypovolaemic shock having caused damage to the heart although accepted that theoretically it was possible. He said the electrolyte issues with low sodium and high potassium were minor compared to her symptoms of a high heart rate and poor perfusion and the high lactate levels. He said the evidence from UCH suggested that K was adequately hydrated, and thus low blood pressure caused by dehydration was not indicated. He also said that low blood pressure caused by leakage of fluid from the blood vessels perhaps linked to an infection was not indicated. He said that potassium deficiency was in his view a red herring. He said that sodium deficiency (the sodium levels were low and increased as a result of the provision of </p>

He did not rule it out completely but said it was unlikely. In relation to the possibility of her death being caused by sepsis although there were symptoms which were consistent with an infection (viral or bacterial) and the post-mortem results were not determinative because  antibiotics and antiviral drugs may have removed markers of infection he said if they had removed the infection why did she die? He also said that if there had been an infection one would have expected the CRP test results to have increased very significantly over the slightly raised figures that she presented with on admission to hospital. He therefore did not think that infection was the cause. He was pressed on the inconsistencies between the toxicological evidence, the pathological evidence, in particular the apparent discrepancy between the evidence of Prof Forrest that the reading in the urine suggested ingestion 3 to 5 days prior to the test and the evidence of Dr Ashworth that the cardiac necrosis was caused not later than six hours before death and not sooner than 48 hours before death. There was some discussion, initiated by me, over whether those timeframes were bright lines or whether they were blurred edges. He remained of the view that  with the established presence of cocaine, cardiac necrosis which could be caused by the vaso-constrictive effect of cocaine in shutting off the blood and oxygen supply to parts of the heart muscle could lead to the death of heart muscle tissue which could either interfere with the constrictive efficiency of the heart muscle or with the electrical pathways of the heart which might have led to arrhythmia and this was the most probable explanation for K's death. He accepted that there were features which were not consistent with it for instance the sodium deficiency which he could not explain. However, he said that other explanations did not fit as well with the findings as cocaine induced cardiac necrosis. He accepted that K appeared to be well on the afternoon of 3 April and that her complaining of a tummy ache and vomiting could be associated with her having ingested cocaine. He said that the oedema around the eyes was consistent with ingestion of cocaine as the cardiac necrosis would affect the efficiency of the heart pumping blood to and from the parts of the body and that inefficient blood circulation could lead to the build-up of fluid in the tissues an obvious location being around the eyes. </p>

The state of the heart was consistent with there being no anatomical abnormality, or evidence of abnormality in the mitral and other valves because although they were absent  any abnormality would have led to changes in the other compartments of the heart. The process of autolysis, namely the breaking down of the tissue of the heart following death over the period of months which had elapsed before he examined the heart plainly limited what he was able to detect. Thus, he was unable to detect inflammation.  </p>

He was clear in oral evidence that they demonstrated the small spots of cardiac necrosis in the heart. He was also satisfied that they showed a limited amount of inflammatory response i.e. cellular changes indicating the beginning of the process of the body responding to the death of the tissue, viz the cardiac necrosis. It was his view that the nature of the cardiac necrosis together with the limited inflammatory response allowed the timing of the cause of the cardiac necrosis to the period of not later than six -12 hours before death and somewhere in the region of up to 24- 48 hours before death. His evidence of the upper limit was more ‘bright line’ than the evidence of some of the other experts in particular Dr Cary and Dr Palm. He said that he was unaware of the timing of the death in relation to the resuscitation attempts and hence he had referred to resuscitation, as a possible cause of the cardiac necrosis. However, when he learned that death had occurred within one hour of the commencement of resuscitation, he said he did not believe that cardiac necrosis could develop and become visible within that one-hour window. He accepted a number of other possible causes of cardiac necrosis including low blood pressure, arrhythmia, acute vaso-constriction and hypovolaemic shock.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">He explained that the cause of cardiac necrosis was the interruption or loss of the blood supply and oxygen to that tissue which caused it to die. He said it was death of the tissues before death itself and was not associated with post-mortem changes in the tissue. As it died the body would respond by seeking to heal the tissue which would cause the inflammatory response. When he was speaking of what he saw on the histological examination of the slides taken at the second post-mortem on 22 May he said that the process of autolysis meant that he could not detect myocyte necrosis (i.e. it could have occurred but it was not detectable due to the degeneration of the tissue over time’s death);  however he did say that even allowing for autolysis he would have expected to see some evidence of inflammation in the form of what he described as the ghosts of lymphocyte   cells. He said the absence of those meant there was not myocarditis. He explained the Dallas criteria for diagnosing myocarditis and the twin pillars of inflammation and myocyte damage. What did not emerge clearly until Dr Palm gave evidence was that in myocarditis it is inflammation that is the commencement of the process with the myocyte damage being caused by the inflammation. Hence as he said borderline myocarditis can be diagnosed if there is inflammation alone but not if there is myocyte damage alone. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In his oral evidence, Dr Cary said he worked as a cardiac pathologist before becoming a forensic pathologist. That role (also that of Dr Ashworth), meant that he was well placed to address the heart related issues. He emphasised that although his report identified the cause of death as unascertained, this was a product of the ring fencing that is part and parcel of the role of the forensic pathologist. Thus, he would take account of the pathology, the histology, the toxicology, but the evidence of clinical presentation and the evidence of the parents was not a part of the material he brings into his evaluation. He emphasised the advantage that the paediatric cardiologist and the court has in drawing on a wider range of material than he could. He particularly emphasised that this was as he described it ‘a whole picture case’ and that actually it didn't involve much forensic pathology. He accepted the limitations of toxicology and drug test results in terms of determining when, type of, how much, frequency of cocaine which had been ingested. He also accepted that K's was a strange case from his point of view. He accepted that in his role as a forensic pathologist in cases of suspicious deaths it was sometimes simply impossible to ascertain how the death had occurred. He said that pathology is imperfect. In relation to the role of cocaine in K's death, he said that the hair root tests were not the smoking gun that he had originally thought they might be, having regard to the lower level of cocaine metabolites found in the hair root and the limitations on hair root analysis described by Dr Cirimele in particular in relation to the possibility of contamination. Although it is fair to say that he did not make common cause with Dr Cirimele in terms of the likelihood of contamination as he considered that the hair follicle or root was more embedded in the scalp and thus less susceptible to contamination. He also did not consider the absence of findings from the fluids which extruded from the liver to be definitive, as he explained that a better way of liver sampling is to homogenise the liver cells themselves and test them because the drug binds to the cells and might not pass into the fluids. He said that the presence of BZE in the urine sample together with the other evidence of exposure to cocaine and the damage seen meant that the only viable explanation, in his view, was ingestion of cocaine. He said that having read the reports of the other experts and discussed it with them he was not suggesting deliberate administration or repeated administration and that it may have been a small quantity which was ingested. He said the evidence from studies of babies exposed to cocaine in utero suggested young children's hearts were susceptible to damage and it may be in small amounts. He said many children were exposed to cocaine contamination and it was a not infrequent finding in post-mortems that children had cocaine in their hair thus environmental contamination was something more children were exposed to but thankfully relatively few died from it. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">He said that cardiac necrosis could arise from a number of conditions or causes. He was able to rule out many of them for instance a tumour of the gland which produces adrenaline, an overproduction of which might cause vasoconstriction and necrosis. He said that adrenaline (in the context of administration during resuscitation) could be responsible for some of the findings recorded by Dr Palm at H1572 (in particular contraction band necrosis) but that would not explain the totality of the findings. The findings were not consistent with having been caused in the hour prior to K's death. In any event given that there did not appear to be a resumption of circulation in K in the hour during which resuscitation was attempted and the body would not have been circulating blood, which would be necessary for the process of the inflammation to take place. He said the figure usually quoted to get an inflammatory response is a minimum of 3 to 6 hours although he said he had never seen it in one or two hours. He said this was because, in order to get  an inflammatory response, you have to reach the stage of not only the neutrophil attaching to the blood vessel wall but have to pass through it into the tissue thus causing the inflammation. Thus, he said the true time of death might better be taken as the timing of her collapse at around 4:42 AM. He said adrenaline damage from stress was possible to rule out and referred to a case of a number of individuals who had been exposed to extreme stress, being caught in a lift during a fire and how cardiac necrosis was found they being aware they were about to die. He also said that it was impossible to delineate between possible cocaine-related myocardial damage and that caused by systemic hypotension. There had been some debate with for instance Dr Ashworth but also Dr Hawcutt about the definition of myocarditis. Dr Cary said he would use the term myocarditis to describe a condition in the heart caused by viral or bacterial infection and it was not used to define the sort of damage found in K's case. He said that stimulant drugs could cause cardiac necrosis in two ways. Firstly, by vasoconstriction in which the blood vessels narrowed and prevented the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart muscle tissues. He said that the damage to the tissue was not immediate but evolved over a period of hours after the blood supply was restricted. He identified another form of damage which he described as hyper contracture where the cells are shocked by the stimulus and contract so sharply that the cell bursts causing its death. The cell is then dead. He said that the cells of the heart do not regenerate or repair themselves but die and are replaced with scar tissue. In the case of hyper contracture, the cell death is immediate, and the process of necrosis then commences. In vasoconstriction cases there is a time lag between the vasoconstriction occurring (when the stimulus is applied) and the death of the cells. In relation to the timing of the cause of the necrosis he said that it was much easier to say that it must have happened not less than 4 to 6 hours before death but setting upper limits was much harder. He was pressed on this in particular by Ms Isaacs and Mr Twomey and said that 48 hours was about right but it was far more imprecise than the lower limit. He said that there was a range of views on it. He said 48 hours was a ‘ballpark’ upper limit. As an electrical organ damage to the heart muscle would interrupt the signals in the heart. This was consistent with Dr Hawcutt’s description of how damage to the heart muscle tissues could either affect the efficiency of the muscle's ability to contract and thus pump or the electrical signalling which provided the rhythm of the heart. As the necrosis evolved the impact could become more significant leading to heart arrhythmia and collapse. </p>

Although the necrosis would not be evident. (NB Dr Hawcutt said that if he had been aware that cocaine may have been consumed a 12-point ECG might have been conducted which could show distinct traces which would indicate necrosis.). </p>

It consists of muscle cells which are called myocytes which contract. In the right ventricle she found areas where the myocytes were virtually dead. These were surrounded by inflammatory cells which were part of the body’s response to the damage to the myocytes. Neutrophils are the white blood cells which fight against infection. Eosinophils are also a white blood cell which is part of the immune system. Mononuclear cells are also a subtype of white blood cell which are there to clean up around a damaged area. Neutrophils and eosinophils are the early responders from the bone marrow to damage with mononuclear cells arriving later. The standard texts refer to a period of 12 to 24 hours for neutrophils to be seen following a myocardial infarction. The mononuclear cells take longer. Some studies may refer to 6 hours for the cells to appear, but mainstream is 12 to 24 hours for the earliest appearance. These white blood cells were present around the damaged myocytes and in the interstitial tissues which support the heart muscles and nerves. She said they were unmistakable to a pathologist and could not be confused with myocarditis. She described this as spotty areas of necrosis. This damage would need the passage of at least 12 hours to become detectable on microscopic examination. Whilst one might see neutrophils and eosinophils with other conditions the presence of the mononuclear cells was only consistent with damage to the myocytes. The spotty necrosis might represent damage caused by the toxic effects of cocaine. It could not be consistent with resuscitation efforts because neither sufficient time elapsed for the inflammatory response to develop (in one hour or less) and nor did K’s heart output ever recover so as to allow blood circulation which could have carried adrenaline  </p>

This is called the sub-endocardial area. It is more vulnerable to low oxygen levels than the outer areas because the blood vessels which supply it pass through the outer layers of muscle (Professor Bu’lock added that every time the heart contracts the blood supply to the sub ended area is restricted). The interventricular septum is the part of the heart which separates the left and right ventricles Two different types of necrosis, were seen in this area. Firstly, contraction band necrosis, which is the death of cardiac myocytes obvious under microscope as bright pink bands. This could be caused in the last hour of life. (I think she was referring to death of the cell by hyper-contracture) This is not linked to the resuscitation either as although they could theoretically be caused by the resuscitation process, if K did not regain cardiac output, they cannot be attributed to it. This could be due to hyper-contracture (the cell bursting) or to vaso-constriction (lack of blood supply and thus oxygen).  Evolving ischaemic necrosis is muscle tissue which is dying as a result of a lack of oxygen. It is acute; recent and developing. It might be a function of the heart efficiency deteriorating secondary to the other damage or it could be directly related to cocaine. It is not associated with the presence of white blood cells responding as the damage is still developing. However, ischaemic damage does also require cardiac output in order for it to evolve. As K did not regain cardiac output after her collapse, it is not likely related to the resuscitation. One might not see a white blood cell response to evolving ischaemic damage if the heart is not sustaining normal blood pressure. </p>

In adults if cocaine has been used for a long period of time and the adult has survived the areas of the heart which have sustained necrosis become scarred. It is called cocaine induced cardiac myopathy. Heart cells do not replace themselves. Dead cells simply become scar tissue. Damaged areas of the heart prevent it functioning properly.

The details of the medical treatment that K was given after she collapsed were accurately reflected in the medical notes. She is also clearly highly organised. The account she gave of collating documents, organising them in order to demonstrate that father 1 had been living with her and the children since 2017 (when he claimed they separated) was another facet of her ordered and detailed approach. She kept a log of record and significant matters which either occurred or what she remembered in order to incorporate them into her evidence. The level of detail that she was able to give in various respects was both impressive in terms of her memory but also in my view indicative of the accuracy of her recollection. Her recall of father 1’s telephone numbers, of the events on her return home on the afternoon of the fourth and subsequent events including telephone calls made and received are a few examples of this ability.  Her ability to tell a story from start to finish in chronological order and in considerable detail was a huge contrast to father 1. In the interviews in May and July she seemed eager to provide information and in the main appeared to be very open and cooperative. She did not simply agree with matters put to her or try to fill gaps but demonstrated an ability to reflect in order to be accurate. An example was when it was suggested that social services had been involved on 3 April, because a telephone call had been received from a local authority number and she was able to think through to the conclusion that the nursery may have a Local Authority linked number. I did not get the impression that she was a person who sought to fill gaps by speculation but rather preferred accuracy.  </p>

She referred repeatedly to the incident where father 1 allegedly smashed her head on the stairs. However, the absence of any detail of any other incidents whether given in her interview or in her statement, particularly having regard to the log she kept of things she recalled for inclusion in her statements suggests that she was unable to recall any other specific incident of father 1 using physical violence against her. Given how good her memory is and how organised and detailed she is this seems inconsistent with frequent incidents of physical violence. Were there to have been other incidents where father 1 had used a similar level of physical violence the mother’s nature suggests a detailed account would be available. The two incidents that she does describe are of a sort which appear to be similar in terms of the alleged level of violence which she says occurred very regularly and so it  seems unlikely that the explanation is that those two were more memorable by their nature. Her overall description of the nature of their relationship in 6 July interview the horrible ending characterised by physical abuse did not seem to marry up with her later description of it. She describes him as being verbally abusive up until 2014, then describes the incident when he  grabbed her hair and  smashed her head on stairs and then the next incident she describes is that when he kicked her in the stomach on 16 April 2019. The general effect of her account is of arguments although she says in general terms that he hit her. Her description of why L chose to stay with the maternal grandmother seemed to be more linked to the arguments and verbal abuse rather than L regularly witnessing father 1 hitting the mother. L herself of course refers to father 1 pushing the mother rather than to him hitting her.  </p>

In amongst the huge amount of material dealing with other matters the references to him threatening to bury her in the park, of having her kids taken off her and to her being fearful of the consequences and not wanting to be hit any more are lacking in context or detail. She refers to regularly asking him to leave in connection with it and being regularly hit or the house being smashed up. This does not seem to be consistent with the rest of her evidence or other evidence in relation to the extent to which physical violence or violence to property was a feature of the relationship. Given how regularly she did ask him to leave it seems likely that either it was not always connected with drugs or that if it was it was not accompanied by the response from father 1 that she seeks to depict. I think her apparent reticence and perhaps fear when telling the police that he was a dealer (“do I have to say… Can you make sure I’m safe”) is genuine but this may be a fear of the consequences from father 1 but might also be the fear of consequences from others or a general fear of acknowledging the role cocaine played in the household.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The mother’s evidence in relation to drug use both herself and father 1’s involvement is different to that which relates to the events surrounding K’s death. The mother’s account is less willingly given and is less detailed. Her initial interview speculated that K may have been exposed to drugs at the nursery or in the park and yet by her later account the most obvious source of cocaine exposure was father 1 and the bag he allegedly carried with him into and out of the mother’s home on a daily basis. She later speculated that the drugs may have come from him; by him sniffing it or taking it in the house and it dropping onto her. Her own account of her drug use has changed. In the early interviews she referred to use every 4 to 6 weeks, by January 2020 she was accepting use every 2 to 4 weeks. In her response to the threshold in April 2020 she maintained she had not used drugs since February 2019. The Lextox report of June 2020 resulted in the mother admitting that she had used cocaine on 6 April 2020 and the 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May. The information provided about the mother’s overdose in June did not include reference to her having taken cocaine until that was disclosed by Dr McEvedy. Thus, there is a significant question mark about the mother’s frankness in relation to matters relating to drugs. In the January interview when told of L’s account the mother’s response was simple denial in relation to it being possible for L to have witnessed drug dealing in the house, to where drugs were kept, to where L had seen them being used. When taxed on how she could have known father 1 was  taking cocaine on a daily basis she maintained that she never saw him use cocaine in the house but knew he was on it because of his appearance and behaviour. I am thus unwilling to accept that the mother’s evidence in relation to matters relating to drugs is reliable. </p>

It is self-evident that their relationship endured for many years and that P was conceived only shortly before K’s death and following a miscarriage in February 2019. The mother herself accepts that when she threw father 1 out she very quickly allowed him to return. Even when describing 16 April assault, she spoke of him having come back the next day and there did not seem to have been any further consequence. What is perhaps significant is that she told him to leave on 22 May when she was told by the police that cocaine was a factor in K’s death. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Father 1 gave evidence from the witness box over a period of half a day and remotely for the best part of the day. Mr Twomey had sought to adjourn the commencement of his evidence until Monday morning as father 1 said he felt ill and had done for two days. In the absence of any medical certificate and given he was at court I declined that application. On Monday morning I was informed that he was still feeling unwell and was unable to attend court and so agreed that he should give evidence remotely. The medical certificate that was provided on Monday recorded that he had told his doctor he began feeling unwell on Thursday after eating some food. This was not consistent with what I was told on Friday. I bear in mind that he may have been feeling unwell and inevitably must have been feeling anxious given the importance of the case. He did not appear to be obviously unwell when he gave his evidence although he asked to leave court on a couple of occasions to go to the bathroom in connection with feeling unwell. He was measured and even tempered, he was polite and answered questions. He was not obstructive or combative.  On many occasions he said that his memory was poor as a result of the traumatic events he had experienced with the death of K and the removal into care of his children. He was unable to recall really with any detail the events of the third or fourth of April without significant prompting by reference to other accounts that the mother had given or by reference to photographs or telephone records. His first statement said that he was not at the mother's home on the third or overnight. His second statement appeared to accept that he was. In his oral evidence he was very vague but ultimately accepted that he was in the home overnight from the third until the fourth and was in and out during the day on the fourth. His recollection of events of the third during the day or the evening and night was almost non-existent. He seemed to recall playing FIFA late into the night and texting a friend until about 6 AM although later said he did not recall using his </p>

He seemed to have a better recall of the day of the fourth and his description of K sleeping on the sofa most of the day with his mother looking after her was at least consistent with the paternal grandmothers. However, I was far less satisfied as to his account of the reasons for his coming and going during the day. His account of having visited a friend and having taken his dog out for a couple of walks was given for the first time from the witness box and I was left unsure of what his movements really were or the reasons for them. Whilst he may have taken the dog to the toilet and whilst he may have visited his friend, I don’t believe that he was simply collecting some clothes and simply taking the dog for a walk.  In relation to his drug use he maintained in his oral evidence that he had never taken drugs at the mother's home and repeated this several times. His second statement though had accepted consumption of drugs at the mother's home in the circumstances she described. It was this statement that he told his counsel and Ms Isaacs was the accurate one and that he had remembered more as a result of reading the mother’s statement. However, he now maintains that it is accurate in some ways but not in this. I am satisfied having regard to the mother’s evidence and his own statement of 30 August that he did consume cocaine in the house and his current position is a lie. His account of how frequently he took drugs was also highly variable. On occasions he appeared to accept weekly consumption in others he appeared to assert monthly or bimonthly consumption. Given his long involvement in drug use and that of his mother, I am satisfied that his assertion that he was unaware of the possibility of cheating a drugs test was untrue. His observations in the covert surveillance about the wraps was to accept the bag and wraps were his.  However, when cross-examined about the ‘pings’ he denied any knowledge of the meaning of that word and said he would refer to them as tickets. The impression I got was that he was trying to then distance himself from the wraps. However, in the surveillance he did indeed refer to the wraps as tickets and referred to them being in his bag, although he did not accept the jumper, they were wrapped up in was his. The conversations recorded covertly contain clear indications that steps had been taken by the family in advance of this search and their arrest to distance themselves from drugs. The partial conversation about father 1 and R speaking is hard to see in any other sense. The fact that the mother was notified in advance of the possible link with cocaine and K’s death and her communication of this to father 1, clearly provided an opportunity for anyone who wished to remove evidence of drug use or dealing before the police action. The photographs of the paternal grandmother’s home show a house in a state of considerable disarray and this might explain why the wraps were still present in the house- they had simply not been noted during any clean up. His account of his work history was also hard to follow and so highly variable that I was satisfied he was not being honest about it. Whilst I’m prepared to accept that he was making deliveries on a motorbike what he was delivering is more difficult to accept. He did not take the opportunity of producing any documents to support his assertion that he was working as a delivery driver for delivery or a Chinese takeaway. </p>

He accepted he had clipped L or perhaps pushed her away when she kicked him. His general position was that the Mother had given as good as she got and he frequently responded to a question by saying “Yes, I did that but she was as bad”. Another response alongside ‘I can’t remember I’ve blocked it out’ that appeared very frequently was “Why would I do that, that would be stupid? Why would I kick the mother in the stomach that would be ‘stupid’?” However, in relation to his memory he was on occasions able to recall very clearly and spontaneously what the position was; he remembered very clearly that two balloons filled with white powder were tested for drugs and were negative. I am satisfied both in respect of his memory and behaviour that his responses were a device to enable him to distance himself from events. I am prepared to accept in relation to his memory he may have tried to forget events of the 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> and 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April and the days surrounding K’s death although I will return to the possible reasons for this. In relation to his responses to behaviour which showed him in a bad light, I am satisfied this was to deflect responsibility, for instance his attempt to lay responsibility for his hitting L on her by saying that she had kicked him.  In many ways his evidence was inconsistent with itself but also with the mothers,  maternal grandmother and  paternal grandmother who although they were not always consistent with each other were pretty consistent in relation to father 1’s alcohol misuse and propensity to bad behaviour when drunk. His evidence of his involvement in drugs was also inconsistent with much of the other evidence whether it was the documentary record or that of the Mother or L or his own mother.   </p>

However, that doesn’t seem to extend to doing very much for them whether in terms of physical care or financial support. When I asked his mother what she thought his view of father 1’s role was she was unable to identify anything that she thought was his. All the evidence points to the mother being in effect the sole carer for the children with the support of her mother and the paternal grandmother with father 1 being present in the house but peripheral in terms of his role in caring for them. Rather than being a hands-on father sharing the responsibility for raising the children as it seems he could have done given he was not in regular employment he seems to have pretty much done his own thing rather than sharing the burdens and benefits of raising his children. His explanation for not taking K to the GP’s on the afternoon of 4 April was hard to understand. On the one hand he accepted that she appeared to be deteriorating and he said he was worried about her condition as was his mother. He said that he did not take her to the GP’s because she always wanted her mummy and he worried that taking her would have caused her stress which might have caused her to have an epileptic seizure. I have been unable to detect anything in the medical records which support K seizures as being stress-related but in any event even if father 1 believed they were, it still does not satisfactorily explain why he made no effort to either take K to the doctor or even to call to speak to a doctor or to call 111 when he thought she was really unwell. M had been seriously ill with meningitis and K had some health scares so his lack of action seems surprising.  After K was taken to hospital the phone records and the mother’s account support the conclusion that he did not attend the hospital until some point after 10 PM. He knew at about 5:30 PM when he and the mother spoke that K was being taken by emergency ambulance to UCH with suspected sepsis and yet he did not attend until some 4 ½ to 5 hours later. His explanation for not attending related to the need to look after the dog until a friend became free and an unwillingness to leave the dog alone at home due to previous complaints about the dog barking when left alone. I simply cannot accept those as adequate explanations for failing to attend at the hospital when his daughter had a possibly life-threatening condition. His phone records suggest he was at the mother’s home for lengthy periods, although not taking her calls and for far longer than was necessary to get some bits and pieces ready to take to hospital. He was then out and about for 45 minutes; far longer than was necessary to drop the dog off at his friend’s house before returning to M’s home and remaining there for a further 45 minutes. Thus, his evidence as to his movements that night was also highly questionable.  </p>

As Ms Cook said she deserves some credit for her readiness to give evidence; in comparison to the mother and even to father 1.  She has a hearing difficulty but appeared to manage well with the use of a headset.  She was in the main calm and measured; at times she seemed emotionally flat and I wondered whether it was the effect of medication.  She was not obstructive or evasive and by and large gave factual answers to questions. Although she was prepared to make some criticism of father 1 in terms of his alcohol consumption, his behaviour when under the influence of drink and his consumption of drugs it became clear over the course of her evidence that her criticism of him was tailored and that whilst making criticism she was also minimising his behaviour. When asked questions on behalf of father 1 she said that although the mother had complained about father 1’s behaviour she said she got the impression from the mother that she gave as good as she got. She denied that father 1 became aggressive when under the influence of alcohol but rather was annoying; she had earlier described him as possessive and paranoid about the mother having affairs. When asked about the amount that father 1 drank she described his drink of choice as a low alcohol drink which he would drink half a bottle of and leave the rest in the fridge. These were very far removed from the impression she gave in answer to earlier questions and the general concerns that she had expressed about, for instance, the level of father 1’s drinking. She maintained that had father 1 been dealing he would have told her that as he was so open and emotional. She described him as devoted to his children although was unable to identify any role that he took other than play music to them or sitting watching programmes with them on television. She could not believe that he would be capable of being violent to the mother, particularly not kicking her.  She appeared to be similarly protective in respect of her daughter Q and her involvement in drug use.   </p>

Her explanation as to how she came to take LSD was extraordinary. When cross-examined about whether she had attempted to manipulate the hair strand testing results she maintained that her hair could not be straightened with straighteners and denied any knowledge of the possibility of interfering with the results through the use of dyes or otherwise. She appeared rather insouciant at the suggestion. She had given the impression that she had done nothing to her hair between the May and August hair strand testing but on cross examination by Miss Hyatt it became very clear that her hair did need attending to between the two which may have included the rebraiding of her hair. She sought to distance herself, father 1, R and Q from use of and handling of cocaine and in particular crack cocaine. </p>

Her description of K being lethargic and sleeping on the sofa, waking up a couple of times and coming to give her “granny cuddles” seemed a genuine memory. On the other hand, she was unclear as to father 1’s coming and going and the reasons for it. Part of her evidence which seemed hard to accept was her assertion that she considered K to have been quite unwell; 7/10 by mid-afternoon, and yet she did nothing about it. Her explanation that as K’s grandmother she did not have the authority to take her to the doctors was plainly an excuse. But what should one infer from this? Did she fail to take care because she knew something had happened on her watch which she wanted to cover up or had she not really appreciated how poorly K was and was overstating her level of concern in her evidence or is her character such that she would not take the initiative particularly given her previous history with all forms of authorities. The attitudes revealed in the covert surveillance demonstrate more than anything her desire and that of father 1 and Q to protect themselves. Their hostility to the investigation into the death of K insofar as it impacted on them and might have disclosed wrongdoing on their behalf shows an unattractive focus on their own self-interest rather than shining a light on what caused the death of K.  </p>

Her evidence supported the conclusion that father 1 had a tendency to drink heavily and to be jealous and argumentative or aggressive when in drink. However, her evidence did not support father 1 as being physically violent or seriously threatening.

The maternal grandmother’s description of him as being kind and considerate and prepared to do anything for you when sober is one I could see having seen him give evidence when he was polite, calm and placid. However, I see no reason to disbelieve her description of the other side to him when drunk of being a nightmare, capable of smashing items and highly suspicious of the mother. Whilst the maternal grandmother said that she was not aware of any violence prior to K’s death she said it would not surprise her if it were true. She said she didn’t think the mother would have told her as she knew she would have reacted by having words with father 1. However, she does not appear to have witnessed anything in her daughter which made her think that she was being subjected to violence and indeed the mother’s case is that she was only subjected to physical violence on limited occasions. However, it is clear that the mother did not tell her mother everything because the maternal grandmother was completely unaware of her daughter’s use of cocaine. Given the maternal grandmother’s utter disapproval of drug-taking it is perhaps no surprise that the mother did not ever let on that she was consuming drugs. How many daughters would tell their mothers? Her account of the incident after K’s death was broadly consistent with that given by both the mother and father 1. However, bearing in mind her description of L as a quiet and placid girl it is reasonable to infer that L had seen something quite shocking to cause her to attempt to kick father 1 which resulted in him hitting her. The mother’s immediate complaint to the maternal grandmother of father 1 having kicked her I accept was made. </p>

That means seeking to incorporate and take account of all of the evidence; that of the parents and other carers, the expert scientific and medical evidence, other evidence from police, from medical records, from the children. In seeking to apply that wide perspective one must be cautious about giving too much weight to individual items of evidence and compartmentalising the evaluation. Of course, in relation to medical evidence in particular there are occasions when it may amount to an absolute answer as to a particular issue which might have the effect of ruling in or ruling out some particular hypothesis. In this case there are almost no absolutes in terms of what the ultimate issue is.  </p>

However, the acceptance by the parents of the effect of the medical and scientific evidence was in reality accepting the inevitable. They were of course entitled to test the evidence in these proceedings and I entirely understand how impossibly difficult it must be for a parent or grandparent to accept that the death of  a child was caused by drugs which one or more of them brought into the household where K ought to have been safe. I have no difficulty in reaching the conclusion myself that the combined effect of the detection of cocaine in K’s hair and urine, the myocyte damage leading to cardiac necrosis, the evidence of deteriorating cardiac output with raised lactate and developing oedema and K’s sudden collapse in the morning of 6 April as her heart finally gave out lapsing into pulseless electrical activity demonstrate that she is another tragic victim of innocent ingestion of an illegal drug.  </p>

In this case the picture is very broad indeed given the volume and variety of evidence. As a result of the stuttering progress of the case I have also been able to read and re-read much of it, to re-watch the video interviews, to reflect on the chronology and all of the evidence contained within it. Over the three months of the case as the very many pieces of this particular jigsaw have been turned over, and been put together by the lawyers, by the experts, by the parties and by me a picture or perhaps more accurately a graphic novel has slowly taken shape which I am confident represents an accurate balance of probabilities story of what has happened in this family which ultimately led to the tragedy of K’s needless death. </p>

What the parties have said since then of course plays a significant part in understanding that trail but the preexisting evidence also plays its own role. Although of course the credibility of the parties is an important component this is not a case where one of the significant role players is a reliable witness the court can turn to for an honest and reliable account on all issues and where the outcome could be determined simply by concluding that one party’s  account was to be preferred as the honest and accurate account and where the others could be discarded as being unreliable or dishonest. It is only the maternal grandmother who I considered to be a reliable and honest witness and her evidence whilst important is plainly that of the person who was outside the circle of knowledge of a most important part of the lives of the mother, father 1 and the paternal grandmother, namely that of cocaine consumption. In mapping the trail, I am incorporating either expressly or not evidence and findings which emanate from the chronology (including hearsay evidence from Swansea and social services’ records), from my assessment of the parties’ evidence, from the medical and scientific evidence and all that I have read and heard. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The paternal grandmother’s life has been punctuated with tragedy, very violent domestic abuse, mental health difficulties and drug and alcohol misuse. I acknowledge and accept that historic material in the chronology is hearsay and sometimes second or third hand hearsay.  Some of it is consistent with or corroborated by other direct evidence or the matter recorded is consistent with other evidence which satisfies me that it is appropriate to rely on it. Other material I am less comfortable with, including the historic references to the paternal grandmother’s crack cocaine use. The chronology suggests that her children were exposed to elements of all the consequences of this. The chronology also suggests that her children and grandchildren suffered incidents including inadvertent prescription drug ingestion suggestive of a chaotic domestic environment where the children might have been much loved but were periodically exposed to emotional or physical harm as a consequence of the emotional impact on the paternal grandmother of her own traumatic experiences. Father 1 himself has suffered extreme trauma in the loss of his two siblings in a house fire and the death of his father. He appears to have been exposed to the paternal grandmother’s experience of domestic abuse and drink and probable drug misuse. His forensic history shows periodic criminal activity dating back to him being 16 and even at that age drugs were a feature of his life where his conviction for theft and burglary resulted in a recommendation that he participates in assessment of drug use. By his early 20s his involvement in drugs had not abated when he pleaded guilty to possession of cannabis and cocaine and received a community order. References to father 1 occasionally showing a propensity to violence; an altercation with a girlfriend, the paternal grandmother’s reference to him being violent to Swansea social services, the reference to him kicking a door and damaging it. </p>

The maternal grandmother and her other children appear to have lived their adult lives uncontroversially. The mothers caution for shoplifting when she was 12 and her acceptance that she first took cocaine and when she was about 18 indicate a very different person and lifestyle from that of father 1 although might perhaps give a hint of an emerging rebellious streak. From L’s birth when the mother was about 19 she would appear to have focused on raising L including getting her own flat. </p>

It is clear from the totality of the evidence that father 1 is occasionally prone to losing his temper. This is an aspect of his Jekyll and Hyde character which the mother, maternal grandmother and paternal grandmother have all spoken of and appears to be well documented. It would appear to be linked to alcohol and/or drug consumption and as father 1 is a frequent consumer of both the emergence of Mr Hyde whether simply angry, verbally abusive, damaging property or resorting to physical violence on occasions which seem to have been a regular blot in the life of the mother and others in father 1’s close circle. Father 1 denies ever having been violent to the mother or spitting in her face. He accepts there have been times when they argued and he says this was usually the mother shouting and screaming at him. He denies smashing a television and ruining the blinds. The evidence of the maternal grandmother of her knowledge of the frequent rows her witnessing the television hanging off the wall, L describing father 1 shouting at and pushing the mother all further corroborate the evidence of father 1’s capacity to behave badly. At the lower end of the spectrum of his behaviour I’m prepared to accept that it falls within the broad range of poor behaviour acknowledged in <span style="font-style:italic">Re A</span> as not amounting to abuse. However, at times his behaviour clearly passed that threshold. </p>

The description of father 1 being someone who would do anything for you is a reflection of his good side and it would seem that the mother also saw this. Notwithstanding his Mr Hyde tendencies there was obviously an attraction that the mother felt for father 1; she displayed some jealousy of a possible link with a former girlfriend and I thought spoke somewhat wistfully or admiringly about father 1 at times. Thus, their relationship does not appear to have been straightforward but complex. The maternal grandmother described it as toxic by 2019 but this was preceded by seven odd years when that toxicity had either not been present or was only slowly building. The evidence of the mother, the paternal grandmother, the maternal grandmother and father 1 all supported the conclusion that following a row the mother would throw father 1 out but that he would return very shortly afterwards possibly even the next day and the relationship would resume. The mother never saw the need to seek help from police, the GP, a health visitor, her family or the courts. It is of course possible that she was experiencing domestic abuse but through shame or </p>

However, the relationship was deteriorating it was a continuing one and I do not accept that father 1 separated and moved out of the mother’s home as he claims. Why the mother said he did not live there I’m not sure perhaps benefits issues might explain it but it is not something I need to determine. All of the evidence from the mother the maternal grandmother, and the paternal grandmother and indeed very much of father 1’s own evidence demonstrates that he was part of the mother’s household with his belongings, his PS4, his fish tank being there and he was treating it as his home albeit doing very little to support the household whether financially or practically. The health visitor and other notes record father 1’s presence in the home on a regular basis.

He maintained it was for personal use and was cautioned accordingly. He said it was kept in a safe to ensure the children didn’t have access to it. The mother appears to have told the Local Authority that she had no idea that the safe and the drugs were in her property and told the local authority father 1 did not live at the address. I cannot accept that this was the case. It was the mother’s home and she and father 1 both had a shared use recreationally of drugs. </p>

His long-term involvement in possession and supply of drugs, his regular usage, his subsequent involvement, his hair strand tests all point to the probability that in 2015 he was a small-scale runner of drugs. It would seem to be a source of income for him although he may also have been delivering food for a living as well. The mother says that father 1 never contributed financially and never had any money yet during interviews recounted family phones he, she, and the children had, along with their tablets, flat screen televisions and the like seen in the photographs of her flat. It is not clear where the mother got the money to support her lifestyle and it seems likely that father 1 contributed in some way from the proceeds of his drugrelated and other delivery activities. </p>

She told the health visitor that she had a lot of support from father 1. Father 1 in particular draws my attention to the absence of any reports to authorities in support of the mother’s claims of domestic abuse. The mother in contrast reminds me of the difficulties victims of domestic abuse face in reporting that abuse even when the opportunity arises. In her later police interviews the mother characterises the relationship with father 1 as horrible and seems to backdate that for its entirety. In particular given the picture presented by the documentary records, or more accurately the lack of any documented history of domestic abuse, together with the evidence from the paternal grandmother, the maternal grandmother, L and father 1 and the mother’s failure to give evidence in support of her allegations of domestic abuse lead me to conclude that save where they are corroborated they cannot be established. So in 2018 I do not accept that this relationship was one which was characterised by domestic abuse in the form of frequent verbal and physical abuse or of threats to bury the mother in the park, to report her to social services or to remove the children. It seems fairly clear that by 2018 the relationship was deteriorating more rapidly and developing the level of toxicity which led the maternal grandmother to urge the mother to end the relationship for the children’s sake if nothing else. I accept that there were frequent arguments precipitated by father 1’s drinking and drug use which caused him to become possessive and abusive which led to the mother throwing him out and led  L to want  to spend increasing time with the maternal grandmother rather than at home and the toxic atmosphere there. </p>

Her initial account was of consumption every 4 to 6 weeks. This later shifted to consumption every 2 to 4 weeks. Her description was that this took place primarily at home. She said that she did not take drugs whilst she had the care of the children. However, whilst K and M may have regularly stayed with the paternal grandmother the evidence of N’s staying away overnight is very thin indeed. There is some evidence that he stayed perhaps one night with the maternal grandmother but on the mother’s lowest assessment of frequency of drug use in N’s first year of life she would have taken cocaine on roughly 26 occasions and there is no suggestion at all of him having been away from her with that sort of frequency. Indeed, he was only one in January 2019. That suggests he would have been in the house on occasions when the mother and father consumed cocaine. Her assertion as recently as April that she had not taken drugs since February 2019 was demonstrated to be untrue by the Lextox results in June 2020 showing recent consumption. That prompted the admission from the mother that she had taken cocaine on the anniversary of K’s death and again on 7 May. Although she has not admitted as much in the statement she filed recently, the evidence of Dr McEvedy is that she told him she also consumed cocaine and alcohol with the overdose of antidepressants. The consumption of cocaine on the anniversary of K’s death seems quite extraordinary but as the mother has given no explanation nor been questioned on it I am unsure what to make of it. The timing of the Thursday 7 May consumption postdates the conclusion of the expert evidence and the pause that I afforded the parties to consider their response to that evidence.

The consumption of alcohol appears to have tailed off which would coincide with the mother’s pregnancy. In contrast the Lextox report shows a reducing consumption of cocaine and cocaine itself is not detected in the samples representing January to February and February to March which is a period when the mother accepts, she took cocaine. If indeed the mother’s evidence of fortnightly use is accurate, she would have taken cocaine on several occasions during that period. Dr Cirimele stood by the results obtained by his laboratory in respect of the mother’s hair strand test taken from her on 23 May 2019. The obtaining of the supporting test results themselves took some time to achieve but they support the figures in the report itself. I do not accept that the presentation of the results undermines the conclusions drawn from them. Both Dr Cirimele and Prof Forrest were cross-examined at length on them and I’m satisfied that the Chemtox reports are an accurate reflection of the mother’s increasing drug use from the summer of 2018. I do not accept the mother’s submission or indeed that of Ms Cook that I should prefer the Lextox reports. There is an obvious difference between them which is that the hair sample is given 10 weeks later and might produce different results in any event although the effect of the expert evidence was that the difference in results was so marked that it was probably outside the understood margin of variability as between laboratories or samples. However, one has to look at the entirety of the evidence relating to drugs rather than simply the test results in any event. The mother’s evidence in relation to her drug use is inconsistent and unreliable. She has not come to court to give evidence in relation to it which reduces the weight </p>

The Lextox report deals with a different sample but one has to address the possibility that the sample was interfered with. Given the level of drug use within this household and family and in particular given father 1’s long-standing involvement in drugs and his previous experience of hair strand testing within family proceedings I have no doubt that one or more of father 1, the mother or the paternal grandmother was aware of the possibility of influencing the results by hair treatment. I do not consider this to be speculation but a reasonable inference to draw from the longstanding history of drug misuse but also the fact that the Lextox results are so inconsistent with the Chemtox result but also inconsistent with the admitted history of drugtaking. Notwithstanding Ms Isaacs’ submissions as to the lack of notice that the mother would have had of the possibility of further hair strand testing, the limited opportunity to undertake treatments, her undertaking to the court and the absence of any evidence in the Lextox report itself of interference on the balance of probabilities I’m satisfied that the explanation for the difference is an attempt to cheat the test by hair treatment. I’m satisfied that the same applies to the test undertaken on the paternal grandmother’s hair. Ms Hyatt’s cross examination of the paternal grandmother elicited evidence about the possibility of the grandmother having had to do something with her hair which had not been the tenor of her earlier evidence and given the rest of the surrounding evidence which relates as much to the paternal grandmother as to the mother I’m satisfied that on the balance of probabilities the </p>

It may be that there was an agreement that father 1 should take the rap by producing test results which showed ongoing use whilst the mothers and paternal grandmothers would not. However, that is supposition and not a finding that I either can or need to make. Ultimately, I conclude that the mother continued to use cocaine over the period leading up to April 2019. On the balance of probabilities this was on an increasing basis and perhaps in the earlier part of the period she was using it every 4 to 6 weeks as she originally asserted and by the later part she was using it every fortnight. </p>

The totality of the evidence paints a compelling picture of father 1 being the principal actor when it comes to drugs. Ever since his youth he has demonstrated a propensity to use and to supply drugs. The combination of the police intelligence, his own acceptance of drug use, the paternal grandmother’s acceptance of his drug use, L’s evidence, the results of the covert surveillance, the findings of the police drugs mapping and the hair strand testing all  lead me to conclude that father 1 was by this stage deeply immersed in the drugs world both as a user and as a supplier.

On any view he seems to have been a small-scale operator. It is entirely conceivable, and the evidence supports the conclusion on the balance of probabilities that he was involved in the processing of drugs in some shape or form. The covert recordings and his acceptance that the drug wraps found in the jumper in the paternal grandmother’s house were  his, support the conclusion that he was himself handling drugs by repackaging and presumably cutting them before supplying them onwards. The evidence as to his finances, or indeed as Mr Twomey would say the absence of any significant evidence associated with dealing  support the conclusion that he was a relatively low-level operator in the field handling small amounts, limited amounts of money and perhaps largely undertaking the activity in order to provide a supply to himself and to the mother. I do not accept that no weight can be given to L’s interview. Read in its entirety it is clearly not the end product of a process of leading questions but in the main is spontaneously given evidence from L. The foster carer records also support her referring to father 1 being involved with powder and also in low-level domestic abuse. Both in terms of the sections of conversation which suggest father 1 had acted to suppress evidence about drug misuse along with his acknowledgement of the tickets supports the conclusion that his involvement was more than low-level personal use. I’m satisfied that father 1 had progressed from low-level supplying of cannabis onto low-level supplying of cocaine.  </p>

In respect of the paternal grandmother’s property the lodger clearly was also responsible for a relatively high level of drug usage and thus carries a significant level of responsibility for the drugs mapping findings in that property but father 1 was also there. The paternal grandmother says that she has never taken crack cocaine, cocaine or heroin but that she did occasionally smoke cannabis in her youth but not since she was in her 20s. She said that father 1 used to use cannabis but she thought he had stopped. She says he has had a drinking problem in the last couple of years. She says that father 1 told her that he and the mother occasionally used cocaine. She understood they used it every couple of weeks. She says father 1 told her that the mother would ring him asking him to get more cocaine. Conversely, she says the mother also used to tell her that father 1 was possessive, was on cocaine, was drinking and that she was kicking him out. She did not think he was a dealer. She also said that the mother would drink when not pregnant and was often hung over or the worse for wear after a night’s drugtaking. She says on a few occasions not more than three times she saw the mother with a lot of cash. </p>

The mother in particular and the Guardian have urged caution in seeking to more closely identify the time of ingestion. The local authority and the paternal grandmother in particular suggest the evidence does support a clearer window. It is certainly true that the behaviour of father 1 and paternal grandmother in the three hours or so in which K was in their care on the afternoon of the fourth is hard to understand. Father 1’s actions in particular are very uncertain but more importantly the fact that K was not taken to the hospital nor any call made to a GP when they both said that they considered she was quite seriously unwell is difficult to understand. Their explanations of father 1 being worried that it would set off an epileptic fit or of  the paternal grandmother is that she did not have parental responsibility and could  not do so, does not stand up to very much scrutiny. Furthermore, the paternal grandmother’s failure to respond to the mother’s calls that evening and father 1’s failure to hotfoot it to hospital are also hard to explain. However even Ms Isaacs did not go so far as to suggest that one could infer legitimately from their inexplicable or suspicious behaviour that they were covering up for the ingestion of cocaine whilst they were caring for K. It seems to me that there are other more logical and probable explanations. </p>

The chronology supports this has not simply be limited to consumption but also the sale of drugs. He has a conviction for supplying a Class A drugs convictions for possession of class A drugs and the circumstances of his convictions including that in 2015 support a conclusion that he has been a dealer of drugs. The police intelligence, father 1’s dishonesty  about his work record, his dishonesty about his consumption of drugs, the results of the police searches, the mother’s evidence of his possession of significant quantities of drugs his acceptance of the bag and tickets found in the paternal grandmother’s house all point to the conclusion on the balance of probabilities that father 1 was dealing drugs. Father 1’s dishonesty in relation to his consumption of drugs at the mother’s home and other documented instances of dishonesty including in relation to the denial of drugtaking when he put himself forward to care for his daughter are examples of dishonesty which are relevant in Lucas terms to the conclusions which I draw in relation to father 1’s involvement with drugs.

This together with the paternal grandmother giving M a bath and leaving her phone in the kitchen are an adequate explanation for her lack of response particularly when she was in contact with father 1 who had been in contact with the mother. Father 1’s activities and the paternal grandmother’s reticence to provide a clear account of what he was up to suggest that he was engaged in activities relating to drug operations. In particular his failure to attend hospital immediately he was notified that K was being blue lighted with suspected sepsis can only be explained by a more urgent business. Walking the dog or not leaving the dog alone are wholly inadequate explanations and together with his telephone activities with the multiple phones which the mother gave detailed evidence of in her police interviews satisfies me that he was engaged in drug-related activities on the evening of the fourth when K was first admitted to hospital. </p>

In fact, one area of the paternal grandmother’s evidence which I am prepared to accept is her account of a relatively uneventful three-hour period during which K mainly slept on the sofa apart from waking for cuddles and a drink, the preparation of some form of lunch and generally minding the children. The paternal grandmother’s inability to adequately explain what father 1 was up to I’m satisfied is related to her covering up for father 1’s drug-related activities. Given the importance of the day - it being the last that the paternal grandmother saw K alive - and father 1’s later  activities it seems to me to be a reasonable assumption that he was engaged in something drug-related of which the paternal grandmother was aware. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">More importantly it seems to me is the evidence relating to K’s deteriorating health from around 6 o’clock on the third through to 16:30pm on the fourth. The evidence from Prof Forrest and from doctors Cary, Palm, and Ashworth suggest the early hours of the morning of the 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> as the upper end of the bracket for the causation of the myocyte damage. Dr Cary suggests that 6 hours might be added to that as the ‘event’ which led to the myocyte damage although all the estimates were in effect ball-park or loose. At 14.18pm K was in the sole care of the paternal grandmother and father 1 which would appear to be the lower limit for the ingestion of cocaine which was not detectable in the blood but was detectable in urine by 24 hours later. Although K’s symptoms of tummy ache, vomiting, a raised temperature, and puffy eyes are all nonspecific they are also all consistent with cocaine ingestion leading to myocyte damage, cardiac necrosis and reduced cardiac output. I agree with Ms Cook that if one has a known cause of death as we do here  symptoms which would be non-specific if there were an unknown cause of death can  properly be regarded as related to that cause of death absent some other explanation. Of course, it is conceivable that K was suffering from some bug or food poisoning in evening and night of the third and fourth of April and that at some point on 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April she subsequently ingested cocaine which continued or magnified some of the pre-existing symptoms arising from her food poisoning or bug. However, I conclude that it is more probable that those symptoms were linked to the ingestion of cocaine and that they were part of a continuum in particular the oedema around the eyes, the raised heart rate the raised temperature which led to her admission as a suspected sepsis case.

I’m therefore satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the ingestion of cocaine preceded the onset of K’s symptoms of tummy ache, vomiting, raised temperature and puffy eyes and that they were the cause of them rather than an independent cause such as a tummy bug </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">That places the ingestion of cocaine at some point in the afternoon of 3 April. The mother’s account of her movements on the third and the fourth has been detailed and in the main consistent from the first account given on 6 April through to her accounts in interview in May and July 2019. I accept that her account of father 1’s whereabouts has progressed from that given to the first interviewing officer. However, at that stage her account was given against a backdrop of K’s unexplained death. I accept that if the mother had known that K had ingested cocaine or had otherwise been exposed to some serious risk that the mother would immediately have sought medical attention. A track record of seeking medical attention for all of her children demonstrates a considerable concern for their health and all the evidence that is available points to the conclusion that the mother is generally a careful and risk averse parent to these children. Her home is spotless, stair gates are in place she generally takes primary responsibility for them. The absence of mention of father 1 from the early accounts is therefore not a surprise or a matter of concern albeit I accept that the mother’s evidence on this has not been tested. However, the account she has given in interviews and statements but in particular in her police interviews is so spontaneous and detailed that I accept that it is on balance a accurate account. Set against father 1’s varying accounts where he sought to distance himself from being present in the house in his first statement to his cautious acceptance of the accuracy of the mother’s account I am satisfied that he was in the house on the afternoon of the third. He was there on his own for significant periods of time albeit was in and out. I have accepted that he was engaged in the supply of cocaine and that albeit on a modest level this involved the processing of the drug at some stage by putting it into wraps. It may also have involved some consumption of cocaine. He was also prone to drink from lunchtime onwards. It seems most probable that the cocaine that K ingested was present in the mother’s home as a result of father 1 having brought it onto the premises and having processed it in some way in an area which the children would have access to. Whether this was actually cutting and re-wrapping the drug or consuming it and whether its presence   in quantities sufficient to cause the myocyte damage was as a result of alcohol or drug induced clumsiness,   dog induced accident or otherwise I am unable to determine. It is more probable than not that the cocaine that K ingested came to be in the flat that afternoon or evening on that day. The cleaning regime of the mother and maternal grandmother suggests it is less likely that it would have been present for any length of time. Father 1 suggests that the cocaine was the mothers and may have been in her drawer - one of the locations the drug mapping located cocaine. On the balance of probabilities, I do not accept that the mother was independently obtaining cocaine from third parties and keeping it in the flat. That is not consistent with the previous history or her then drug usage. What is probable is that this was father 1’s cocaine which through carelessness came to be present in K’s home in sufficient quantities and which she accidentally came upon and ingested causing the myocyte damage, cardiac necrosis reduced cardiac output </p>

Precisely where in the house and all the circumstances in which K came to ingest it, I do not consider that it can be determined. However, my conclusion that it was father 1’s drug which was carelessly left in the mother’s home and there ingested by K is where responsibility ultimately lies. I accept that the mother did attribute K’s illness to something like a stomach bug or food poisoning. Given those non-specific symptoms there was nothing to alert her to the possibility that her daughter had ingested cocaine. However, I am satisfied that the mother was aware of father 1’s drug-related activities and that he conducted aspects of it on her premises. Given his known propensity to drink and periodically to become abusive the possibility of cocaine being present in the children’s home in an uncontrolled fashion was a real one which the mother must at some level have been aware of. However, she was tied to father 1 for reasons which I do not fully understand and was unable to break her relationship with him. I do not accept that this was a result of her being in fear of father 1 to such an extent that she could not take action. It was more subtle than this. The mother’s evidence of father 1 having made threats to bury her in the park or to have her children taken from her appeared to be given with some genuine conviction but  I do not accept that they characterised the nature of the relationship prior to K’s death. It may be that following the emergence of cocaine as a possible cause of K’s death that conversations between the mother and father occurred in which the possibility of losing the children or the possibility of the mother disclosing father 1’s drug dealing took place in which such comments were made by father 1. I do not have sufficient evidence to determine precisely how such things came to be said but  I am satisfied, on balance that they  were not a feature of the relationship of the mother and father prior to K’s death and certainly not as described by the mother in order to exculpate herself from failing to protect the children from the risks father 1 presented by regularly bringing and processing cocaine on the mother’s premises. </p>

Although it might be said that the unreliability of the evidence of the mother, father 1 and the paternal grandmother as to their involvement with drugs should lead the court to infer not only that they were powdered cocaine users but also crack cocaine users I’m not prepared to make that leap and it does not seem to me to be central to the establishment of the threshold or indeed to the levels of culpability of the mother, father 1 or the paternal grandmother. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.00in">Although the disclosure to the hospital staff of the possibility of cocaine might have led to medical action which would have prevented her death I’m not satisfied that the possibility of K having ingested cocaine would have been on the mother’s radar given the non-specific nature of the symptoms, the fact that she had not witnessed anything herself and the doctor’s suspicion of sepsis. Doubtful though I am of father 1’s reliability I am prepared to accept that he loved his children and had he known that K had ingested cocaine he would somehow have indicated this although that is a very fine balance given his determined efforts to distance himself from responsibility and to protect his own skin. On balance he is sufficiently self-absorbed and sufficiently unaware of much relating to his children’s health and welfare that I’m not sure it would have occurred to him that he might have left some cocaine around and one of his children might have ingested it. However, given his primary responsibility for having carelessly left the drug available to be ingested this is perhaps of only marginal importance. </p>

It was not ingested in the time she was caring for K with father 1 on 4 April. She was not present in the home when it was ingested. She does though bear some indirect responsibility in that she was the head of a family who were steeped in Class A drug misuse and had been for many years. </p>

She also was well aware of his deteriorating alcohol abuse and it was a selfevident risk that in handling drugs in either her property or in the mother’s property there was a real risk that careless handling would leave drugs in the environment where they might be ingested by children. The frequent presence of K and M in her own home her cavalier attitude to the presence and consumption of drugs by father 1, by the lodger by her daughter plainly represented a risk to them which is reflected in the environmental contamination of their hair part of which is attributable to presence in her premises. It is luck rather than judgment on her behalf that no harm came to them. </p>

For her father who for all his flaws I have no doubt loved her deeply.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">K’s death was needless. It was avoidable. Insofar as blame or responsibility can and needs to be attributed, I have made my findings. It is hard to avoid the conclusion that the history of each of the responsible adults formed the people that they were on and leading up to the 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April and shaped their behaviours. Thus, whilst father 1 bears primary responsibility, the mother secondary and the paternal grandmother a more diffuse responsibility they are not one-dimensional ‘bad’ characters.  The paternal grandmother’s own life has been marred by tragedy and abuse and shaped her attitudes to her son’s drug use, her own and her family’s lifestyle including drug use  but she is also a loving and caring grandmother who enjoyed caring for her grandchildren and in many ways was able to offer positive care. Father 1’s early life including the deaths of his siblings and his exposure to the serious domestic abuse and instability of the paternal grandmother’s mental health issues have undoubtedly shaped him and contributed to his willingness to involve himself over a long period of time in illegal and dangerous drugs and to become so complacent that he exposed his children to a substance that ultimately killed K. That was the last thing he wanted and perhaps if he could rewind the clock he might find some way of diverting himself from the path that led to K’s death. He perpetuated the cycle of tragedy that he himself lived through; K has joined her uncle S and Aunt T both child victims of their own tragedy. He also loved and loves his children and in Dr Jekyll mode had much to offer – he undoubtedly could and should have done more. How the mother ended up where she did is more complex. Her life appears largely to have revolved around her children and apart from her descent into frequent drug use and her inability to see or accept the real risks her deteriorating relationship with father 1 and his drug related activities posed to her children she was a good and loving mother. For the paternal grandmother and father 1 to escape from the lifestyle that led to the tragedy of 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April is harder to discern given the length of time they have lived it. For the mother a return to the straight and narrow is perhaps more probable although I do not doubt the very profound impact on her psyche of the death of her daughter, the realisation of her role in it and the loss of her other children. I hope the experience she has lived through leaves her or perhaps gives her the strength to escape.  </p>

I have little doubt that adults, young people and children will continue to die from the deliberate and inadvertent ingestion of illicit drugs. The complacency that accompanies frequent misuse is perhaps one of the biggest problems.  Whether this family is able to learn from this tragedy remains to be seen. I hope they and others do.    </p>

The medical records do not suggest a mother who is either negligent of her children’s health or someone who is suspicious of health services or otherwise reluctant to engage with them. The overall picture which would emerge from the medical records would suggest a mother who gives priority to her children's health. This would conflict with a theory that she would suppress information which might be relevant to her child's health. Thus, her failure to mention cocaine, against the backdrop of the children's medical history, would be more consistent with her being unaware of the possibility that K had been exposed to cocaine rather than her deliberately suppressing knowledge either actual or constructive that K might have been exposed to cocaine. The overall picture presented by the medical records seems to show the mother being the individual who took primary responsibility for the children's health. Father 1 is mentioned in the records as being present in the home and on occasions giving information to hospitals, but the overriding impression is that he is far less involved in the day-today interactions with health agencies. The records do show him playing some role in the house and being said to be supportive.</span>

K really enjoyed sitting together with her peers and she was very capable to self-serve roast chicken and potatoes. She was not very keen to eat vegetables, but she would have a second portion of chicken, extra potatoes and ice cream. K was picked up by her mother after lunch </p>

He found an old Haribo empty sweet box and gave that to me. K asked me for some juice and seem to be fine and so I tried laying her down again but she continued to be sick and so I sat her up again. I could see that she had brought up the juice that she just had. I asked Father 1 to keep an eye on her and told him to make sure that she was sick in the bowl whilst I cleared up the sick.

We all got into bed and then that’s when she started waking up, at 2 o’clock in the morning, and he wasn’t in the bed.. He was sitting on, in my room I’ve got my bed here, and then I got a window and then I had a chair and it was next to a chest of drawers with the telly on its top, and he was sitting in there. And I screamed at him, I said why you just sitting there, she’s being sick, like can you don’t get something like a bowl, or a sick… Anything for her to be sick in. And eventually he did that. So, I sat her back like upright. But the bowl next to her and I told him to watch while I cleaned all the sick off the floor, I go and get like…. I got a CIF cleaner and that and so I can clean all the floor up. So, he did that. I cleaned up the floor. You could tell he had been drinking and was on something. You could… Just the way his behavior was like…. He was lip drooped. His eyes were flickering like his eyes were like literally like flickering to the back of his head… He couldn’t talk properly.

My mum brought L back over in the morning as L needed to collect something for school and I explained to my mum that K had not been well in the night. I brought K downstairs with the others and laid her on the sofa as she still didn’t feel well and was heaving. I called Father 1 downstairs and told him to watch the kids whilst I quickly got ready as I had to collect L from school at 12 noon to take her to the hospital to replace her cast on her arm. I called PGM and asked her to come over to help look after the children whilst I took L to the hospital as I knew Father 1 would complain if he had to look after them on his own. PGM arrived at around 11 AM and I went to get ready. K was very tired but I assumed it was because she had been up in the night and so I let her rest. I was a little worried because I thought her face looked swollen and so I asked both PGM and Father 1 to see what they thought but they felt that she just looked tired. I asked PGM if she could make sure that K was drinking fluids. </span>

So, I obviously brought K downstairs with me. I opened the door for L and my mum was standing at the security gate. I said mum (inaudible) I think she caught a sickness bug from the nursery... She was like has she been up all night. And I said yeah like, she’s like on and off, she’s been sleeping on and off. In my mum’s like just make sure she drinks plenty. So, I made sure that she was drinking anyway she always had a bottle of juice or water whatever she wanted. And I can’t remember if it’s, I shouted at him to come down and to help me because I had to get myself ready because even though L was taken school I still had to pick her up early because she had to go to the hospital, to have her a full cast on, on her arm</span>. <span style="font-style:italic">So, I don’t know if it was that day or the day before I rang his mum (inaudible) it might have been that day I’m not sure.

And that before I left M with him, his mum and him, I… I thought her eye this top bit here, this bit here, I thought it looked a bit swollen like it was a little bit raised…[K] I asked his mum and him and I said does… Does like her I look </span></p>

I was angry and upset that neither PGM nor Father 1 had thought to call the GP because of that but they told me they were waiting for me to take her. I called the doctor and explained what was wrong and they told me to bring K down to the surgery immediately. I asked Father 1 to watch the kids whilst I took K to the GP, but he refused and PGM would only take M with her. In the end L ended up helping me with N. L pushed N to the doctors whilst I pushed K in her pram. I think we arrived at the doctors about 5 to 5:15 PM; it was only five minutes’ walk down the road. Whilst we were in the waiting room K wanted to get out of the pram so I let her get out but she had no energy and was nearly sick again and so I got a sick bowl from the receptionist. The doctor asked a number of questions, but they were concerned about her appearance and they were also concerned that K didn’t have diarrhoea and that her sick had been different colours. The doctor called in another doctor to see what they thought and they both were concerned that it could be sepsis and so called an ambulance </span>

Have they put the cast on. And I said yeah, I said it all takes time like you know having to seeing a different doctor, like everything. I said her appointment maybe at 20past-1 but it's going to take a few hours, you know what hospital are like, and then he was like okay. I asked how K was. Oh, she's fine. I asked </span>

So, I rang the doctors and I said I just got home from being at the hospital with my eldest, my three-year old’s faces really swollen…… It’s too much for him and then I just lost it at that point because you can see how unwell she was and how she wasn’t… She wasn’t K any more she was, it was like the life and been sucked out of her. The doctor said… Took us in the room and I explained like she just had the sickness…..

The weight of the evidence from the mother, the paternal grandmother the maternal grandmother and L suggests that the origins were probably related to father 1’s drinking or drug taking and either the mother taking exception to this or alternatively father 1 being jealous and possessive and accusing the mother of being unfaithful. A shouting match developed with the mother then throwing father 1 out. The detail the mother gives of father 1 scraping her finger has the ring of truth and caused her to become even more agitated. This I am satisfied appears then to have led father 1 to kick out at her. I accept that he did so; the mother’s own evidence, the </span>

		    <span style="font-weight:bold">evidence of the mother’s contemporaneous complaint in the maternal grandmother and L’s response all support the conclusion on balance of probabilities that father 1 did kick her. This led L to try to kick father 1 and he in turn hit her with an open hand around her head. I am satisfied this is an example of father 1’s dark side when in drink. The mother was pregnant, father 1 probably did not want another child and his inebriation and loss of temper resulted in him kicking out at the mother’s stomach. It was no doubt a spur of the moment action which he probably now regrets but nonetheless it was a deeply unpleasant act which was upsetting for the mother, maternal grandmother and L must also have been frightened by his slap to her head. Again, it was spur of the moment and probably under the influence of alcohol and at a time of intense stress following K’s death. However, it is a manifestation of what father 1 is capable of. It is one of only two or three occasions on which the mother gives a detailed account of father 1 having used physical violence.  At some point thereafter, father 1 returned to live with the mother and the children because the final separation of the mother and father 1 did not occur until the mother was told by the police that cocaine was believed to be linked to K’s death. Given that the mother’s memory for detail and the steps she took following the parties’ separation to detail relevant events including incidents of physical abuse the absence of further detailed accounts supports the proposition that father 1’s use of physical violence towards the mother was limited to a handful of occasions over 8 years rather than being a frequent feature of the </span>
