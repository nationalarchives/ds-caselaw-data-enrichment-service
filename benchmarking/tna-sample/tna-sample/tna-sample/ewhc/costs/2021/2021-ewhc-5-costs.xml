Whilst it is the SSHD’s case that there should be a “different” order, it has not been explained in the written materials which have been submitted what that order should be, the application having been undertaken on the papers without oral submissions.  That said, it is to be inferred that the replacement order should be “no order as to costs” or that the Claimant pay the SSHD’s costs of the provisional assessment to be summarily assesed.  </p>

On the day before her planned removal, Duncan Lewis Solicitors obtained state funded legal assistance which in due course was extended for the issue of proceedings against the SSHD for unlawful detention.  As a result, the removal was stayed.  The proceedings then took their course in the Central London County Court, until, on 4 October 2019, a settlement was reached under which the SSHD agreed to pay damages of £12,500 plus costs on the standard basis, to be assessed if not agreed. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">On 28 April 2020, the Claimant served her bill.  It sought profit costs of £54,290.00, £18,633.16 for disbursements (of which £14,000 was for counsel) making a total of £74,060.46 as between the parties.  As the bill did not exceed £75,000, it was referred for provisional assessment under CPR 47.15, and, as I have said, I carried out that assessment on 27 November 2020. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">It is agreed that the bill was allowed in the sum of £41,436.66 inclusive of disbursements.  In addition, also by agreement, there is interest payable to 5 January 2021 in the sum of £2,924.41, together with the costs of provisional assessment of £1,500 and the court fee of £1,106.  No request was made for an oral hearing to review the provisional assessment under CPR 47.15(7).  It follows that subject to the SSHD’s application that I should make a different order for the assessment costs, the matter has been completed and a final costs certificate can be issued.  </p>

It was right that the bill had been substantially reduced, but the SSHD had not obtained a more advantageous judgment at the provisional assessment.  On the contrary, the SSHD had done worse than the offer and the Claimant had achieved more by going to provisional assessment.  Disregarding interest and the costs of assessment, the Claimant had bettered the offer by £1,436.66.  When both those sums were taken into account, the amount by which the SSHD had failed to achieve a more advantageous outcome was even more striking. It meant that the offer had been beaten by £7,267 equating to an additional 18% of what the SSHD had offered.

Here, the offer was £40,000 “all-in”, whereas the Claimant recovered £41,436.66 before considering interest and the costs of assessment to the date of the offer.  It is trite law that a “near miss” is not good enough - see judgment of Stewart J in <span style="font-style:italic">JLE v Warrington &amp; Halton NHS Trust Foundation Trust</span> [2019] Costs LR 829 at paragraphs 40-44, and in a Part 36 context at least, it is not open to judges to take into account the amount by which an offer has been beaten.  I see no reason why the position should be different here, where the Claimant has gained a more advantageous result by going to assessment, with the margin of the win not being a matter which the court can take into account.  Put differently, I do not consider that I should give more weight to an offer, which was an offer but not one that complied with Part 36, than I would have done had it been compliant.

That would place a non-offering paying party at an advantage over a paying party who has tried to settle the costs, but whose offer has not been quite enough.  It would provide a potential reward for a paying party, who sits back, having deliberately made no offer, to rest secure in the knowledge that a successful challenge can always be advanced later  under CPR 47.20(1)(b) if the bill is reduced by a significant amount after a good day in court.  In circumstances such as these, Rule CPR 47.20(1)(b) and (3)(b) could simply be argued in every case where the bill has been reduced without an offer made, in disregard of the Court of Appeal’s guidance in<span style="font-style:italic"> Global, </span>that a party who is vulnerable for a smaller sum than the amount claimed, should use Part 36 to protect their position.

The exception is where a paying party would have no way of knowing whether there has been fraud or other skulduggery by a receiving party, such as claiming costs where it was known that there had been a failure to comply with the indemnity principle.  Such a situation would arise where the receiving party had made a bargain with his solicitor not to be liable for any costs so by operation of the indemnity principle, nothing would be recoverable from the paying party.  These would be matters to which only the Costs Judge would be privy, since a retainer letter, which would provide the answer, is a privileged document only available for the court to read upon receipt of the receiving party’s papers lodged for assessment under CPR 47.19 PD 3.12.  Other than that, I cannot think of a circumstance where a paying party whose without prejudice offers have been too low, could successfully argue that the receiving party should be deprived of the costs of assessment.  That is particularly the case here where the SSHD’s open offer under PD paragraph 8.3 to CPR 47.9 was also way off the mark, with nil having been offered, a deficiency of over £41,000. </p>

However, the application has raised an interesting point upon which I am aware decisions have gone both ways at Costs Judges’ level.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">The conclusion I have reached is that having failed to protect itself by making an effective offer under CPR 36 or by a “without prejudice save as to costs” offer, or through its open offer, the SSHD cannot succeed on a <span style="font-style:italic">“Let’s see by how much the bill has been reduced</span>” argument and then deploy CPR 47.20(1)(b).  To permit that would be to discourage the making of offers, and enable paying parties who advance no offers, to be in a better position to argue for a “different order”, than those who make offers in a genuine attempt to settle the costs.  However, as I have said, I am aware that there is no consistency on the Costs Judges’ corridor on this point.  For that reason, I consider a definitive view at a higher level would assist parties in understanding where they stand, when they make a Part 36 offer which is too low, or no offer at all, but then argue that they can rely on CPR 47.20(1)(b) to their advantage, depending upon how good a day they have had in court.  If asked, I would give permission to appeal and in that eventuality, invite the parties to transfer the case to the High Court so that the appeal is dealt with by a High Court Judge whose decision will be binding.  </p>
