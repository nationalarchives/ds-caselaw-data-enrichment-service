The risk premium was therefore £320 (including LPL’s commission and Prentis Donegan’s brokerage totalling £112) leaving a net premium of £208.

Section 25.2 of the Agreement refers to commission: "as specified in Appendix 1", but no Appendix 1 has been produced. Mr Ross was asked if he could confirm that it was £78 per head at that stage. He replied that there was confusion as to what the commission was during 2000. He knew that the premium was inclusive of brokerage but "we were never very comfortable hence why we were chasing documents, as to what the exact breakdown was. We knew that it was around £112". Because Mr Ross had not seen the binding authority and did not see it until November 2000 he was not aware that there was a gross premium income limit. (See Section 21, I/43/2285K) Because of his later experience he was however able to confirm that the £3 million limit would have been divisible by the figure of £320 (the risk premium inclusive of brokerage) to calculate the number of policies which could be sold (i.e. 9375). When it became apparent that there was such a limit, and that the company was approaching the limit, TAG became dissatisfied with Mr Raincock and subsequently other arrangements were made. Mr Ross confirmed that for the 2000 year there was no contractual entitlement on behalf of underwriters to any further premium than the £320 per case.</span></p>

Mr Ross’ contemporaneous note of the meeting (I/2392) has the words "assessment and monitoring £400" next to the figure of £480 to AAB. The note of Mr Hoddes who also attended the meeting, (I/2393) refers to a £400 assessment/monitoring charge and £75 commission. Whilst his note of the LPL commission is £83. The total figure in each note is £840. Mr Ross was unable to confirm whether the £80 described in his letter as being "for commission" was commission for bringing cases into the scheme.

The Lloyds underwriters required to be informed of the different routes to market and of any major changes to those routes. TAG had to have permission to use the Lloyds brand name. The various routes to market used by TAG included direct TV advertising and brand advertising of the TAG name as a backup to other routes to market, such as stands in shopping centres and door to door canvassing, there was also newspaper advertising and some radio advertising.

TAG began issuing polices with NIG from the beginning of February, with whom a policy wording had been agreed, and the premium allocation was as set out in the formal agreement of 1 July 2001 (I/43/2435) (see para 34). Prentis Donegan &amp; Partners had nothing to do with this agreement which was directly negotiated between TAG and NIG. There is therefore no brokerage element in the premium. Different types of cases were allocated to the Lloyds policies and to the NIG policies. It was important for TAG to be able to identify which cases were with which underwriter, not only for reporting purposes but also because there were different terms relating to premium allocation. Once there was computer software in place the individuals who activated the cases and put them on cover would select the underwriter. This was done on a purely random basis. </span></p>

Mr Ross did not really know how exhibition consultants were paid, suggesting that they might have been given a salary and a commission for productivity but he confirmed that they were not franchisees. </span></p>

The panel solicitor does not contract with AIL to pay the fee, except that in the early scheme the fee was paid by the panel solicitor as a disbursement on behalf of the claimant. As the AIL fee is paid by the claimant through a loan, the claimant is liable for the interest accruing on the loan once the AIL invoice is discharged, and remains liable for the interest regardless of success or failure of the action. By the time the AIL invoice is rendered the investigation works have been completed. The claimant pays AIL’s fee at the outset and Mr Ross asserted that the claimant’s liability for the fee is discharged by way of the loan or by the claimant direct. If there was no loan, the outcome of the case has no bearing on the claimant’s responsibility to discharge the fee (see Mr Ross’ witness statement C/29/661 at para 8).</span></p>

Mr Ross appears to have operated for a considerable period on what he hoped was the agreed position. Thus, although the initial agreement with LPL is dated October 1999, it was not until November 2000 that he received details of the insurance cover under which the company was operating. It was at that time that the capacity problems were revealed. In his evidence Mr Ross expressed surprise that a number of the documents did not appear to reflect the scheme as he had understood it to be operating. Since however, TAG has signed up to the various agreements which I have set out, TAG must be taken to have agreed that its scheme would operate in accordance with those agreements even though, as in the case of the BESSO agreement, it was not finally signed until some 19 months after it was said to have come into force. There appears to have been a level of naivety on the part of those involved in TAG who appear to have felt that they could run the TAG scheme as they thought appropriate with no great regard to the terms subsequently agreed. One specific instance which demonstrates this is the TAG binding authority under which Mr Ross is the only person authorised to sign. Something which apparently he never did. </span></p>

It also shows the number of claims to date and the ultimate failure rate. Similar information is provided in the second report (M/3387).

In addition it was a term of the agreement that for each new policy written £150 would be paid to the underwriter to offset losses in relation to the 2000 year Lloyds facility. The 2000 year was underwritten as to 45.5% by Catlin. The additional premium of £150 agreed in October 2002 was attributable only to Catlin’s participation. The 2002 facility enabled TAG to underwrite 20,000 policies, meaning that the payment of £150 per policy produced approximately £3 million. Mr Coss suggested that this was distributed "as to approximately £248 over 12,080 polices which represents 45.5% of the 26,550 policies underwritten by TAG on behalf of Lloyds in 2000". He suggested that this effectively meant that Catlin would receive £456 per policy excluding brokerage, while the other underwriters would receive £208 per policy.

I was also interested in formalising the underwriter’s partnership with TAG by creating a "swing premium" mechanism whereby the underwriters would receive by way of refund from TAG an additional premium allocation to the extent justified by underwriting performance. For the 2001 underwriting it was agreed that there would be an initial premium allocation to underwriters of £328.50 per policy including £16.50 brokerage to the Lloyds broker. Up to an additional £238 per policy making a total of £566.50 would be payable to the underwriters to the extent necessary to cap the underwriters loss ratio at 80% …"</span>

First Mr Blair described the accounting systems in use in the early part of the scheme as being fairly basic and not providing the detailed information which is available for cases after the Test Cases. Secondly, it may be that the actual cost of carrying out the insurance services is £310 but it does not follow from that that it would be appropriate to require a paying party to pay such an amount. The figures with regard to the costs of AIL serve to illustrate the difficulty. Mr Blair puts the cost per case at £266.77 without any profit element. No doubt the profit element would increase that figure to the amount actually charged by AIL. In the course of argument however Mr Charlton has accepted that the amount properly allowable in respect of the work done by AIL would be in the region of 1 hour at the relevant rates (say £100). I derive no assistance from Mr Blair’s evidence. </span></p>

Such solicitors accept cases on CFA terms which carry no success fee. His firm also does other cases on CFA which carry success fees of varying amounts. He set out in his witness statement his extensive experience in carrying out risk assessments in various types of case and at paragraph 20 (C/32/799) explained that he had carried out a retrospective risk assessment of the Test Cases handled by his firm. He suggests this was done for the purpose of making a comparison under Costs Practice Direction paragraph 11.10(1). He calculates success fees ranging from 23.5% to as high as 61.5%, although from these figures is discounted the irrecoverable element. In his exhibit SDM3 (C/32/823) he has set out a comparative table. The notional success fees claimed range from 18.5% to 56.5%. The TAG premium is put at £998, save for one case (Harrison) where it is £840. This figure is compared with the products of Accident Line Protect and LPL. To the premiums quoted by these companies the notional success fee has been added in each case. In every LPL comparison the LPL premium plus the notional success fee is more than the TAG premium. In the Accident Line cases, all but two, Mellor and Ward, produce a figure greater than the TAG premium. Mr McCulloch suggests that the policy benefits offered by ALP and LPL were inferior compared to the TAG policy. </span></p>

He thought the lower level of cases in March/April was due to the fact that TAG was having difficulty with some panel solicitors during that time and he agreed to take on the handling of other firms files. Some 1600 files were taken on in this way, of which only 500 developed into claims. In the middle of 2002 large numbers of files were being received (eg, 669 in May) from solicitors who were not performing adequately. About two thirds of these files were never actioned and were closed because Mace &amp; Jones could not receive any instructions. In addition there were some 500 other cases throughout the period where the client did not sign the CFA for one reason or another. Of a total of 5,238 clients referred to the firm by TAG Mr McCulloch estimated that 3,634 proceeded.</span></p>

Mr McCulloch agreed that if his firm were to participate in the scheme, which included this form of funding, any disbursements recovered had to be paid straight back to the Bank for the client’s account but if the firm failed wholly or in part to recover disbursements, the firm personally undertook to repay the Bank.

He was, at that time, looking at what TAG had to offer in the round. Mr Ross was at that time looking for sensible firms to expand the AAB business. With his third witness statement Mr McCulloch produced a schedule headed "Analysis of work carried out by AIL – TAG Test Cases" (N/2/7). The purpose of the schedule was to set out what had been provided by AIL that was on the firm’s files. He had been provided with time sheets from AIL and tried to analyse what had been done at AIL to produce the information. He used, in his analysis, the actual times on the time sheets where there were such times or if the times were unclear he inserted estimates, but in using the actual times he has rounded them up into six minute units. </span></p>

(I express no view as to the position under OM5). Mr McCulloch, like Mr Ross, appears to have been willing to conduct cases whilst disregarding the clear contractual provisions relating to the payment of the AIL fee. His assertion that he is entitled to charge the AIL fee as a disbursement must also fail. For reasons which appear below I am not persuaded that the client ever authorised payment of the AIL fee or agreed to pay it personally. The solicitor is clearly liable to AIL for the fee under the terms of the panel solicitor’s contract with AIL. He states that he thought that the payment was the client’s own expenditure and confirmed that he could not have ordered the work because he did not know the client or the case. In any event, as appears below, in my judgment the payment to AIL is not properly a disbursement but is a referral fee. It is therefore irrecoverable under either of those heads.</span></p>

The formula agreed in respect of RTA cases up to £10,000 which settle before proceedings produces figures for costs of approximately half the level sought in the comparative table (ie, £1160 to £1300). If the predictable costs figure is used for that exercise the total is even lower. On any reading, the total reached in respect of the RTA cases is less than half the premium charged by TAG. Whilst different considerations may apply in the case of Perkins, which was an industrial accident, and Johnson, which was a trip case, I am not persuaded that the level of success fee suggested (46.5% and 56.5%) is justified.</span></p>

It will be seen from table 3 that a premium net of IPT of £139 produced a 0% margin over the discounted burning cost. To achieve the same 62% margin a premium of £311 is necessary (£327 including IPT). If the premium of £950 is adopted, the margin over discounted burning costs is shown to be 145%. The reduction from the discounted burning cost figure of £388 shown in table 2 is entirely due to the lower premium. The amounts in respect of disbursements and third party (ie, defendants costs) are unchanged. If it was assumed that the premium to cover the risk of paying the premium itself could not be recovered from the losing party, the discounted burning cost itself would then be reduced to £97. The premium required to produce a margin of 62% would then be calculated simply by adding 62% to the £97 figure. This would give a premium of £158 (£157.14 rounded up) plus IPT, a total of £166 (£165.90).</span></p>

The first is the nature of the benefits to which the litigant is contractually entitled in exchange for the payment of the premium. This falls to be determined from the terms of the contract under which the premium is paid. Section 29 permits the recovery of a premium where this is payment for insurance against the risk of liability for costs. If payment of a so called premium buys a collateral entitlement to other benefit it is, to say the least, arguable that the premium cannot, to that extent, be recovered under Section 29. Thus the court has to consider the terms of the contract under which the premium is paid to see whether it is simply a contract of insurance against liability for costs or whether it is something other than, or additional to, that."</span>

I would look equally askance at the recoverability, in similar circumstances, of a premium for a fire policy which included the cost the insured had to incur in installing and maintaining a sprinkler system as a condition of his insurance cover, or a premium for a household insurance policy which included the cost of installing and maintaining a burglar alarm.</span>

The question is whether this case is an exceptional case of the type which Brooke LJ had in mind in paragraph 87 of the judgment which I have just quoted. Mr Neish argues, and I accept, that what is exceptional about this case is that I am not dealing simply with the question of whether the recoverable premium claimed is reasonable but rather dealing with a claims management company selling a basket of services. Whilst the methods used to sell the product and the precise details of the scheme are not identical with that used by Claims Direct there are broad similarities and the insurance arrangements in particular are very similar. As Mr Neish points out this is not surprising because they appear to have been designed by Mr Brian Raincock of LPL dealing with the same underwriters: Mr Lewis and subsequently Mr Thompson of Catlin and Mr Hacker of Alleghany. In these Test Cases there is a complex contractual web in which eg, solicitors agree to do certain acts in the future on behalf of clients they do not have and agree to be liable to AIL in respect of work which they do not authorise. I add to these factors the fact that I have been told that some 250,000 cases await the outcome of the decision on these Test Cases. Mr Ross in his first witness statement (D/40/1022) states that TAG is the acknowledged market leader in the provision of ATE products to the general public to support personal injury claims. Accepted claims currently number 10,000 to 15,000 per month. According to the Datamonitor Report "Personal Injury Litigation 2001" TAG is described as having a market share of 15%. In those circumstances it is, in my judgment, correct to treat the TAG Test Cases as exceptional and to carry out an analysis to determine how much of the premium claimed is properly recoverable. </span></p>

On that basis he suggests that the premium should be reduced from £198 to £167 and then further reduced to £129. The Claimants criticise this arithmetical exercise suggesting that no element of the premium, whether as originally paid or ultimately received by underwriters for the 2000 year, was ever attributed to these elements of the contract of insurance. It is, they suggest, therefore wrong in principle to make a reduction in such circumstances. The Claimants also point out that Mr Cowley’s exercise was done with the benefit of hindsight (a criticism which the Defendants accept). The Claimants go on to argue that if any exercise of deduction for non qualifying elements of cover is to be done by reference to the actual results of the business it must be done by reference to what would have been a "correct" premium, otherwise underwriters, and through them claimants, will be penalised by a deduction to represent non qualifying elements in circumstances where too small a charge was being made by underwriters for actual burn cost. They do not, however, suggest what the "correct" premium should be.</span></p>

He expresses the fear that the production of actuarial evidence and its analysis by specialist actuaries like Mr Cowley would have the effect of making costs assessments throughout the country very much more complicated.

He suggests that the proper exercise is that carried out by Mr Cowley in his revised table 2. This automatically makes an adjustment for the element of self insured premium which can no longer be claimed. The Defendants’ schedule, he argues, fails to reflect that, eg the various commissions which form part of the premium, have to be insured. In schedules 3 and 4 to Mr Charlton’s closing submissions he sets out the results arrived at by Mr Cowley during cross-examination (in each case the investment income element has been reinstated) ranging from an AIL fee of zero and charge for insurance services of £30, up to an AIL fee of £100 with insurance services of £150. These produced various figures for premium ranging from £434 to £1,015. In schedule 4 to the closing submissions Mr Charlton sets out further calculations using Mr Cowley’s model. These encompass a number of situations from AIL fee zero and insurance services £250, to AIL fee £310 and insurance services £400. The premiums thus arrived at range from £966 to £1,242. Mr Charlton explains that the figures used were put in for illustrative purposes and not as any sort of bid by the Claimants. The exercise serves to illustrate how the figure for premium moves as other figures are altered.</span></p>

Mr Neish argues that there is an inflationary spiral in any premium which insures itself. Having raised the point however Mr Neish then stated that the Defendants did not have the materials or the analysis to deal with the point at the moment and therefore did not, in these cases, seek a specific deduction for that element. He made it clear however that this would be an issue to be decided in the future. In these cases he limited himself to arguing about ring-fencing, the premium indemnifying the cost of funding and the premium indemnifying the AIL fee. </span></p>

The only material difference is that the continuing insurance services do not include the requirement that TAG should arrange for the client to attend medical examinations. In the CD Test Cases the court at first instance concluded (judgment paragraphs 189 to 193) that all of these items were properly to be regarded as insurance services except initial service 4 (obtaining further information) and continuing services 1 (obtaining witness statements) and 3 (arranging for client to attend medical examination). The Claimants accept that the same result will apply in these Test Cases but argue in respect of Continuing Service 3 (costs draftsman) that this should be regarded as a proper insurance service because, Mr Charlton submits, it is an element of the insurance claims handling service provided to underwriters and is only required to be performed "where there is a claim under the insurance". He submits that it is not a costs assessment process for the purpose of every claimant’s claim. Mr Ross dealt with this in his evidence.

The difference between the minimum fee of £395 which a panel solicitor had to pay a claims manager and the sum of £425 quoted in the prospectus as a direct cost suggests a net outlay of £30 by MLSS on each claim, but I do not consider this figure casts any particularly useful light on anything the Master had to decide. It is clear that MLSS incurred significant expense in performing the "insurance services" required of them under the 26 August agreement. The central issue under question 2 is whether the Master was entitled to lift the veil and to be influenced by what was actually being provided in return for the premium allocation paid to MLSS …"</span>

On that basis the Defendants do not resist the addition of a further £30 to the base premium and commission referred to above.

Whilst this type of work was regarded in the Claims Direct cases as part of the claims management services provided by MLSS which led to a reduction of the MLSS element of the premium in Claims Direct, the same is not true in the case of TAG since insurance services are provided only by TAG. The Claimants argue that it is wrong in principle simply to look for a bare cost which might be calculated, after the event, for TAG’s provision of insurance services. It is suggested that what matters is not the ultimate actual cost but the amount which underwriters were prepared to pay, namely £480. The fact that underwriters were prepared to pay £480 to TAG does not assist me in arriving at an appropriate figure to add to the basic premium figure in respect of insurance services.</span></p>

The Claimants give no suggested figures. Adopting for the moment the figure of £390, the addition of insurance services valued at £100 would produce a premium, including IPT, of £514.50 (£490 plus £24.50). Using the £30 suggested by Mr Neish gives a figure of £441 (£420 plus £21). </span></p>

Goshawk and Brockbank Syndicates participated; TAG itself became the coverholder. Because of the rapid increase in the number of cases TAG was taking on, and the need for further capacity, TAG entered into a separate arrangement with NIG (see below). The premium for both types of policies was £950 plus IPT (£997.50). In the Lloyds cases the premium paid to underwriters and brokerage amounted to £328.50 (£312 plus £16.50). £621.50 was paid to TAG as "underwriters contribution to costs". There was provision for "swing premium" which depended upon the level of losses incurred. This required TAG to pay additional premium by way of rebate of the underwriters contribution to costs. The swing was between 80% and 125% of losses but with a cap of £550 per case. The indications are, from Mr Primer, that results to date mean that this swing premium will take effect.</span></p>

Mr Neish argues these are not "qualifying losses" in respect of which the Defendants are liable to pay.

Mr Neish argues that the CFA does have a success fee but it happens to be zero. In my view Mr Neish’s approach is to be preferred. A similar situation arises in relation to VAT. Certain supplies are zero rated, others are exempt. Supplies which are exempt are not liable to VAT, those which are zero rated are liable but the rate is zero. In the end it appears to be a distinction without a difference. In my judgment the court should cross-check the premium value against alternative funding options whether or not those options fall within CPD 11.10(1).</span></p>

On that basis Mr Neish does not challenge the reasonableness and proportionality of the premiums which he arrived at as a result of the exercise which he carried out.

The fact that Mr McCullogh was prepared to run his cases with a nil success fee was not merely because he was willing to trade away a success fee for a volume of cases but because he had in mind the paramount interests of his potential clients. Mr Charlton suggests that for cross check purposes it has to be assumed that each case does involve the solicitor in an element of risk and that is what Mr McCulloch had attempted to do in his analysis.</span></p>

Mr Charlton set out in Appendix 5 to his closing submissions the results of Mr Cowley’s exercise utilising the up to date figures for disbursements and third party costs and removing the discount from investment income. Mr Charlton also used what he described as the correct brokerage figures of £112 for the 2000 year and £16.50 for the 2001 year. He also used for the purpose of this exercise £30 in respect of insurance services. The figures so produced were £535 for 2000 and £532 for 2001. Mr Charlton pointed out that these figures were put forward simply to illustrate the incremental effect of changing some of the assumptions. He did not accept the figure in respect of insurance services and had inserted nothing in the calculations for AIL. Nonetheless given that this is part of a cross check exercise these figures must be seen against the figures produced by Mr Neish (£330 and £441) as a result of his exercise. </span></p>

Allowing no discount for investment income and no fee for AIL, adopting the figure of £253 for disbursements and £77 for third party costs, further allowing brokerage of £16.50, underwriters profit of 25% and TAG commission of 25%, together with £30 in respect of insurance services, a premium of £480.30 (£457.40 plus £22.90 IPT) is arrived at. Mr Charlton adopted various figures for insurance services, up to as much as £150. Given the remarks of Brooke LJ in the Claims Direct judgment I do not see how figures of this magnitude can reasonably be charged to the paying parties. As Mr Primer demonstrated in his evidence, because the account was picking up some adjustment of the brokerage and commission became justifiable and the figure for the 2000 year was reduced from £112 to £45, whilst the underwriters share increased. I have been struck by the comparatively low figures which are actually insuring the risk. As Mr Neish points out, this is an operation on an industrial scale and there are no doubt economies of scale. Brooke LJ expressed the view that in allowing the figure of £30 for insurance services in the Claims Direct cases I was perhaps being over generous. I certainly see no evidence in these Test Cases that it would be appropriate to exceed that figure. Given Mr Neish’s concession that the Defendants would accept a figure of £30, that is the figure I adopt. If the allowance for insurance services were to be reduced to £20 the premium, including IPT, would become £458. </span></p>

Using a figure for insurance services of £30, it will be seen that Mr Cowley’s cross check figure falls between the Claimants’ and Defendants’ figures in the 2001 year and is somewhat higher than the Claimants’ figure in the 2000 year. The figures which I allow are those which appear to me reasonable and proportionate in all the circumstances. I do not say that these are the only correct figures but they are within a bracket of what I would regard as reasonable. I allow: for 2000, a premium of £450 including IPT; for Lloyds 2001 £480 including IPT; and for NIG 2001 £425 including IPT.</span></p>

He argues that since credit facilities were made "to enable the client to pay for the premium due under a policy and/or disbursement" and since the AIL fee is included within the reference to "disbursements", and since the solicitors gave an undertaking to the client to recover the AIL fee, that fee cannot fall within the definition of a referral fee. In my judgment Mr Charlton’s submission on this point does not address the underlying questions, namely: who was contractually liable to pay the AIL fee, and, if it was a solicitor was the AIL fee a reward to introducers by the payment of commission or otherwise?</span></p>

From November 2000 until the new form of client application form came into use, in about October 2001 (there may be earlier instances which are not within the Test Cases), the position was that the client paid for the AIL fee through the new First National Bank funding arrangement. At no point did any of the panel solicitors actually pay any money. From October 2001 Mr Charlton submits that the position is that the client continues to pay the AIL fee and in so doing is discharging a personal liability which he undertakes directly to AIL because of the agreement contained in the new application form to instruct AIL. Mr Charlton argues that in the first two periods the clients liability arises through the agency of the solicitor, whereas in the third period the liability arises direct without any agency of the solicitor. </span></p>

The client care letter did set out the solicitors’ current hourly rate and mentioned disbursements such as court fees, investigation fees and expert’s fees. While it is now clear that "investigation fees" must have referred to the AIL fee, there appears to be no way in which the client could have known this or what amount was to be charged in respect of investigation. </span></p>

At the outset Ms Ashmore was told no more than Mrs Johnson. OM4 sets out the arrangements in relation to funding, but this is a document governing the way in which the panel solicitors must operate, it is not a contract with the Claimant. By the time AIL wrote to TAG confirming that their investigations were complete, the client knew no more than that an accident investigator would contact her to seek more detailed information. In Mr Neish’s submission, which I accept, this work was done by AIL as agent for the panel solicitor to enable the panel solicitor to see whether or not he wished to take on the case. </span></p>

Mr Neish argues that this is not surprising since the arrangement was between AIL and the panel solicitor. Work has been done pre-retainer pursuant to that contract and for which the paying party cannot, in my view, be liable. The AIL invoice was sent to the solicitors, although the payment was now made direct to AIL out of the client’s loan account. It may be, after the introduction of OM5, that the client enters into a contract with AIL but prior to that there is no contract, even when the new form of application is used.</span></p>

This device is of no value or benefit to the client. It is of value to AIL since it provides automatic provision for payment. It is also of value to the solicitor in that it saves him from having to pay AIL and assists him in seeking to recover this sum from the client’s opponent.</span></p>

In my judgment the invoice, which is sent as soon as the panel solicitor has accepted the case, can refer only to future work, ie to work done after the solicitor has been retained. In order for a disbursement to be recoverable it must have been made by the solicitor on the client’s behalf or be an out of pocket expense of the client personally (see Re: Remnant [1849] 11 Beav 603 at 611; Re: Buckwell &amp; Berkeley [1902] 2 Ch 596 CA and Brown v Barber [1913] 2 KB 533).

Prior to the acceptance of the case by the solicitor there is no client and therefore no authority. It is quite clear therefore that any recoverable element of the £395 plus VAT could only be in respect of work undertaken by the claims manager after the case has been accepted. It may well be that, once the case has been accepted, the claims manager carries out work, on the instructions of the solicitor, for which it is appropriate to make a charge, the cost of which may be recoverable as a disbursement. On the evidence before me, applying the above principles, none of the cases contain details of work which would bring the amount properly chargeable near to the figure of £395 plus VAT."</span>

This was on the basis that the solicitor appointed AIL as its agent for the provision of investigatory works in consideration of the payment of £310 plus VAT. That provision was contained in OM1 and remained the same throughout, save that in OM3 one of TAG’s roles in relation to initial insurance services included the instruction of AIL on behalf of clients and the solicitor. I have already indicated the problem in relation to that arrangement, namely that the solicitor has taken on an obligation to pay AIL the investigation fee but has done so before there is any retainer. It may be that the client is liable to the solicitor under the terms of the retainer for that fee, but since it is not a disbursement properly so called it is not, in my judgment, recoverable from the paying party. The argument that it is a fee properly paid by the client, and therefore recoverable as such, also fails because what the client is in effect doing is reimbursing the solicitor for a liability incurred by the solicitor without any authority from the client. In my view, if the client objected to paying this amount to the solicitor, it would be disallowed on an assessment between solicitor and client. </span></p>

He sought to show by reference to the Test Cases (Schedule 1 to his opening submissions) that the AIL fee had been "incurred by the clients" by referring to the loan account statements which had had these amounts debited to them (save in the case of Pollock). In my view that exercise does no more than demonstrate the way in which the bank had dealt with the client’s loan account but does not overcome the position clearly set out in contractual documents from which it can be seen, without any doubt, that it was the solicitor who incurred the obligation to pay and who was invoiced for the amount due. It was not until the introduction of OM5 in November 2001 that some attempt appears to have been made to make the client primarily liable for the AIL fee. Mr Charlton’s suggestion that OM5 was merely an instance of the documentation catching up with the reality does not alter the contractual situation which applied in relation to the Test Cases. Indeed it was not until 27 February 2002 that TAG sent out a letter explaining the changes brought about by OM5. I find that OM5 came into operation on 19 November 2001. Any application forms completed prior to that date, even if in the so called new form, are dealt with under the terms of OM4.</span></p>

After deducting the cost of sales, the bulk of the remaining gross profit is paid to TAG as administrative expenses (for 2002: gross profit £47.78 million, amount paid to TAG as administrative expenses £47.69 million. In 2001: turnover £24.5 million, gross profit £22.10 million, administrative expenses paid to TAG £21.93 million). It is clear from this that TAG is receiving the great majority of the AIL fees and that money is, in my view, a referral fee paid to TAG as the introducer. The fact that the money passes through the hands of AIL, a company exclusively linked with TAG, does not prevent it from being a referral fee. Equally, the fact that the solicitor has not physically paid AIL, the money having been removed from the client’s loan account, does not mean that the solicitor is not liable to AIL and is in fact making the payment notwithstanding that money from the client’s loan account is paid direct to AIL.</span></p>

He argues that clause 4 of the CFA ensures that the client remains liable for the full amount of disbursements incurred whether or not recovered in full from the paying party. Clause 4 explains:</span></p>

In my view, when it is in force it will not alter the law. It will merely clarify it. In addition to the rule change, an amendment to the CFA Regulations is envisaged which will make very much simpler the steps required to be taken by a legal representative when entering into a CFA under which, in certain circumstances, the client’s liability for fees and expenses is limited to costs recovered. Also the amendment to Section 51 of the Supreme Court Act 1981 by Section 31 of the Access to Justice Act 1999 will be implemented. This also, in my judgment will not alter the law. CFA’s of all types have been regularly used and regularly upheld in all courts, including the House of Lords, without this amendment being implemented.</span></p>
