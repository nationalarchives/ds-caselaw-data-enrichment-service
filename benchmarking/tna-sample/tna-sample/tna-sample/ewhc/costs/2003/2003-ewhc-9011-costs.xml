	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">This case concerns the status of costs negotiators, N L Grant Legal Costs Management (Grants), instructed by liability insurers, Allianz Cornhill (Cornhill), to act on their behalf in relation to questions of costs. Costs negotiators have come to prominence in recent times and are typically paid by results in that they receive by way of remuneration a percentage of the reduction in the amount of costs which they achieve on behalf of the liability insurer. Such arrangements have given rise to concerns that the question of costs may be being pursued over vigorously and therefore disproportionately. In these proceedings I am dealing with one straightforward case, but I understand that the decision in principle is likely to have much wider implications.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">Costs negotiators and costs draftsmen both deal with questions of costs but, as the names imply, costs draftsmen typically become involved in drafting bills on behalf of receiving parties as well as attending on detailed assessments on behalf of both paying and receiving parties, whereas costs negotiators tend to be instructed by paying parties (usually insurance companies). Any person may set themselves up as a costs negotiator or costs draftsman without the need to pass any exam or to join any professional body or association. There is an Association of Law Costs Draftsmen which requires its members to undergo training, to pass exams and to abide by a code of conduct. The Code of Conduct is in some respects similar to the Rules of Professional Conduct which apply to solicitors. The Association has the power to discipline its members and may, if necessary, expel a person from membership of the Association. As I have said there is no requirement that costs draftsmen should be members of the Association and there are a number of costs draftsmen of great ability, experience and high repute who are not members of the Association. It must also be said that there are some who lack those qualities. As a general rule costs negotiators do not appear before this court but there is no reason to suppose, given the nature of the work which they do, that they lack competence in their own field, nor is there any reason, if certain necessary criteria are met, why they should not appear.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">Against that background I turn now to look briefly at the facts of this particular case. On 5 November 2000 the Claimant was involved in a road traffic accident and suffered personal injury. Originally liability was denied. Subsequently an offer was made on the basis of 50/50 liability which was rejected. Proceedings were commenced on 11 April 2001. There were at that stage two Defendants and both defences were served by 4 June 2001 on which date a Part 36 payment was made. The case proceeded through the normal stages of allocation and listing until December 2001 when a further Part 36 payment was made bringing the total payment to £2,000, which was accepted. The First Defendant, Mr Powell, accepted responsibility for the accident and agreed to pay both the Claimant’s and the Second Defendant’s costs. </span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">It was not possible to agree the Claimant’s costs and accordingly detailed assessment proceedings were commenced on 29 January 2002. Points of Dispute were served by the First Defendant on 22 February 2002. These points were signed by Messrs Beachcroft Wansbroughs the solicitors for the Defendant. The detailed assessment came before District Judge Stevens at Stoke County Court on 16 May 2002. An independent costs draftsman, Mr Owen Jones, appeared on behalf of the Defendant. The solicitors for the Claimant raised the question of rights of audience and I quote from the attendance note of the hearing which explains what happened:</span>

However, the Judge did not agree that it formed proper instruction and stated that on the def insurers instructions the file was passed to Grants to deal with the costs. The Judge’s view was that the def’s insurer had instructed Grants.</span>

The Defendant further submits that a letter of 30 January 2002 from Mutual Law (the trading name of Beachcroft Wansbroughs) to Grants, which enclosed the file in relation to the claim, had the effect of giving instructions to Grants in relation to the proceedings. The instructions were to assist in the conduct of the litigation by dealing with the costs and those instructions were passed to a particular employee at Grants, a Mr Swallow, by a letter of 3 September 2002 from Mutual Law. (I will consider the correspondence further in due course). In those circumstances it is submitted that Mutual Law validly authorised Grants to assist in the conduct of the litigation while themselves remaining responsible for the performance of all aspects of Mr Swallow’s duties including the receipt by him of proper detailed instructions from an authorised source. In relation to the second issue the Defendant submits that Grants’ terms of remuneration, whilst amounting to a contingency fee agreement and an agreement in support of litigation, was not champertous and in support of that contention they rely on the decision of the Court of Appeal in </span>

They do so in the interests of the public and in the interests of the proper administration of justice. Normally there are available two options to a person wishing to bring litigation. First a lawyer who has rights of audience can be instructed to appear on his behalf. Second, he can bring the litigation himself acting in person. It is an important well established principle of the administration of justice in this jurisdiction (unlike some others) that the ordinary member of the public has the right to come to court to conduct litigation themselves. Whether it is before a Magistrates Court, a County Court, the High Court or the House of Lords that right has been maintained throughout the years. But, if somebody wishing to appear in person , wants somebody who is not an advocate and who has no rights of audience to appear on his or her behalf instead of someone who has the rights of audience, that, in my judgment, has to be justified …</span>

These fears may be exaggerated, but, be that so or not, the law for centuries had declared champerty to be unlawful, and we cannot do otherwise than enforce the law; and I may observe that it has received statutory support, in the case of solicitors, in section 65 of the Solicitors Act 1957."

In so doing we revert to the statement of Lord Mustill, at page 153, that ‘the rule, now in the course of attenuation, which forbids a solicitor from accepting payment for professional services calculated as a proportion of the sum recovered from the defendant …survives nowadays, so far as it survives at all, largely as a rule of professional conduct’.

Part II deals exclusively with the authorisation of persons to provide different types of legal services, with their regulation and with Ombudsmen schemes relating to the provision of legal services. In its context it is natural to read s.58 as applying to the provision of advocacy and litigation services by those authorised in accordance with the earlier sections to exercise rights of audience or conduct litigation. There is nothing in the section which suggests that it is intended to apply to the provision of services ancillary to the conduct of litigation by the many different categories of person who have, in the past, been accustomed to assist with the conduct of litigation.</span>

This conclusion is supported by the Regulations that were passed pursuant to s.58. … The term "legal representative" is appropriate to describe a person conducting the litigation, or exercising rights of audience on behalf of the litigant. It is not appropriate to describe persons … who are providing services ancillary to those provided by those conducting the litigation.

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">"A contingency fee, that is, an arrangement under which the legal advisers of a litigant shall be remunerated only in the event of the litigant succeeding in recovering money or other property in the action, has hitherto always been regarded as illegal under English law on the ground that it involves maintenance of the action by the legal adviser. Moreover where, as is usual in such a case, the remuneration which the adviser is to receive is to be, or to be measured by, a proportion of the fund or of the value of the property recovered, the arrangement may fall within that particular class of maintenance called champerty….. It may, however, be worthwhile to indicate briefly the nature of the public policy question. It can, I think, be summarised in two statements. First, in litigation a professional lawyer’s role is to advise his client with a clear eye and an unbiased judgment. Secondly, a solicitor retained to conduct litigation is not merely the agent and adviser to his client, but also an officer of the court with a duty to the court to ensure that his client’s case, which he must, of course, present and conduct with the utmost care of his client’s interests, is also presented and conducted with scrupulous fairness and integrity. A barrister owes similar obligations. A legal adviser who acquires a personal financial interest in the outcome of the litigation may obviously find himself in a situation in which that interest conflicts with those obligations."</span>

These, then, are the reasons that have led us to conclude that s.58 of the 1990 Act, both as originally enacted and as amended by the 1999 Act, applies only to agreements concluded by those conducting litigation or providing advocacy services.

More generally, however, s.58 evidences a radical shift in the attitude of public policy to the practice of conducting litigation on terms that the obligation to pay fees will be contingent upon success. Whereas before this practice was outlawed, it is now permissible – subject to the requirements imposed by the section. These requirements do not appear designed to mitigate the mischief that had led to the banning of contingency fees - the undesirability of the interests of officers of the court conflicting with their duties to the court. Rather the requirements appear designed to protect the litigants concluding conditional fee agreements who, when the section was first enacted, were required to pay any ‘uplift’ out of their recoveries. Conditional fees are now permitted in order to give effect to another facet of public policy – the desirability of access to justice. Conditional fees are designed to ensure that those who do not have the resources to fund advocacy or litigation services should none the less be able to obtain these in support of claims which appear to have merit. </span>

They are regularly instructed by Cornhill’s branches in court actions where Cornhill’s insured is a party and required to pay the opponent’s costs. </span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">In about 1994 it seems that Cornhill’s Birmingham office agreed an arrangement with Neil Grant whereby his company would be paid on the basis of a percentage of savings on costs achieved. Although Mr Rabbitts had made enquiries about this he was satisfied that the arrangement was never recorded in writing, nor were any variations in the agreement recorded in writing until he became involved in January 2001 when he took over as manager. In January 2001 he had a meeting with Neil Grant and new terms were agreed to come into effect on 1 February 2001. Those terms were set out in a letter to Neil Grant dated 18 January 2001. Grants were to be remunerated on the basis of a commission payable at a set rate provided that they, Grants, achieved a monthly average gross saving of a given percentage on claimants’ costs over a 12 month period for a guaranteed number of cases. In the event that the target was not met Grants’ commission would be reduced to a lower percentage figure. Mr Rabbitts explains in his witness statement (paragraph 9) that the reason a percentage mark-up was chosen over an hourly rate charge was because it was a simple way to achieve quality control and went some way to relating the fees paid to the level of costs claimed. It was intended to act as an incentive to Grants to maximise the discount they were able to achieve. Mr Rabbitts goes on to explain:</span>

He submits that the words "by a qualified litigator" govern only the giving of instructions and not the employing or engaging to assist. Thus, he says, it does not matter who employs or engages the person who is to have a right of audience provided he or she is authorised to do so: in particular he need not be a qualified litigator; he could be (and often is) the client. Furthermore he suggests that since instructions may be given by a qualified litigator "either generally or in relation to the proceedings" the instructions referred to are basic instructions to act rather than the factual detail of instructions themselves which may well come from another source. He argues that "instructions" simply means instructions given by the qualified litigator to the employee or agent under which the litigator, while delegating aspects of his litigation duties to the employee or agent nevertheless remains responsible for their proper performance in the litigation of which he has conduct. He suggests that all that is required is for the qualified litigator to give the employee or agent instructions under which the qualified litigator maintains control of the employees’ or agents’ performance of his duties whether generally or in relation to specific proceedings; and from whatever source the factual detail of the latter’s instructions may come.</span>

The question then is: are Grants assisting in the conduct of litigation and doing so under instructions given (either generally or in relation to the proceedings) by a qualified litigator?

Mr Birts submits that Mr Swallow was therefore employed or engaged to assist in the conduct of the litigation by appearing at the detailed assessment on behalf of the First Defendant. He argues that in delegating the conduct of the detailed costs hearing to Mr Swallow Mutual Law did not relinquish responsibility for the conduct of the litigation but retained it throughout. </span>

The reality of the situation, as evidenced by the attendance notes which I have set out is that the whole issue of costs was passed to Grants to deal with by Mutual Law on the instructions of Cornhill. The normal process of lawyers advising the client and taking the client’s instructions and then delegating their function to a costs specialist is entirely absent. It is clear that the letter of 3 September 2002 was merely the result of difficulties encountered at earlier hearings. Although the letter of 3 September appears to be a valid letter of appointment, Mutual Law were purporting to appoint Mr Swallow to be their agent in respect of matters which they themselves had no authority to pursue, namely the assessment of costs. Grants themselves had previously purported to appoint an agent (see paragraph 28(v) above).</span>

Secondly, a solicitor retained to conduct litigation is not merely the agent and adviser to his client, but also an officer of the court with a duty to the court to ensure that his client’s case, which he must, of course, present and conduct with the utmost care of his client’s interests, is also presented and conducted with scrupulous fairness and integrity.

The Defendant was properly represented by solicitors throughout and it was their responsibility to arrange for appropriate representation at the detailed assessment proceedings and to supervise that representation. There is nothing in my view inherently wrong in a requirement by an insurance company that, when costs come to be determined, a particular firm of costs draftsmen should be instructed. Those instructions must come from the instructing solicitors who have themselves been properly instructed and who are required to consider the claim for costs and advise the client. It is abundantly clear in this case that Grants were attempting to run the detailed assessment proceedings without reference to the Defendant’s solicitors under the umbrella of the correspondence to which I have referred, which does not, for the reasons I have given, achieve its objective.</span>

In my judgment that submission, which appears to cut directly across Mr Birts’ submission in respect of rights of audience, cannot possibly be right. Section 27 of the 1990 Act states that the question whether a person has a right of audience before a court must be determined solely in accordance with the provisions of that Part of the Act. The only circumstances in which a person may have a right of audience before the court (if he does not have a right granted by an authorised body) is, if the court grants a right in relation to the particular proceedings (Section 27(2)(c)), or he is employed or otherwise engaged to assist in the conduct of litigation and is doing so under instructions given by a qualified litigator (Section 27(2)(e)(i)). Section 119 of the 1990 Act defines "right of audience" as meaning "the right to exercise any of the functions of appearing before and addressing a court …" That is exactly what Mr Swallow was proposing to do. His purpose in attending was, in my judgment, to provide "advocacy services" because he was contemplating exercising a right of audience in relation to the proceedings. As I have already found, he did not have a right of audience because he was not employed or otherwise engaged to assist in the conduct of litigation under the instructions given by a qualified litigator.</span>

In my view that submission is flawed because the "proceeds of litigation" or "spoils" as they are sometimes called will only ever take tangible form in the hands of a successful party, either as damages or costs. It is necessary to take into account, not only amounts received but also amounts preserved. It seems to me that savings achieved on behalf of a losing insurance company (to the tune of £20 million per year) is in fact a very significant element of the proceeds of litigation and Grants’ remuneration is a share of that element.</span>
