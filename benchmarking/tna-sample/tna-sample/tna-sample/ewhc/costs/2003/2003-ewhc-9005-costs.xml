The note attached copies of the letters setting out the agreement so that each Chambers could consider the full terms reached.

A special payment to be made to a third party for preparation or administrative work of the kind that would normally be undertaken by instructing solicitors would, however be regarded as an extraordinary expense. Such payments should be recorded on the fee note so that the document is transparent and so could be challenged by the party ultimately responsible for paying the fee."</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">Mr Neish explained that Ian Lee was a clerk with 4 Kings Bench Walk (a consultant clerk since 1996) he entered into an agreement with Medical Legal Support Services Ltd (MLSS) dated 19 June 1996 (Bundle 11/1/1). That agreement recited that solicitors requiring advice from counsel were required to forward the necessary case papers to MLSS, that MLSS had agreed to deliver briefs under the scheme, which required advice from counsel, to Ian Lee "for distribution by him to appropriate members of Chambers … and to appropriate members of other Chambers". The agreement also recited agreement between MLSS and each solicitor that Ian Lee was "entitled to a fee per brief to cover the administration and other expenses arising out of performance of his obligations". It was a condition of the scheme that counsel’s advice on quantum (and sometimes merits) had to be taken, the fee for which was fixed at £95 plus VAT. The effect of this was that there had to be instructions to counsel in every case. Under the agreement Ian Lee had to act as distributor of instructions to those counsel who were going to give the necessary advice. The panel solicitors sent instructions to MLSS, MLSS forwarded those instructions to Ian Lee, who identified the appropriate counsel. The advices were sent back to Ian Lee, who in turn sent them to MLSS and thence to the panel solicitors.</span>

Solicitors complained about this (see for example the letter of 13 July 2001 from Messrs Glaisyers 11/1/30: "We feel that it is extremely unlikely that [the paying party] will be willing to pay the extra sum of £15 plus VAT for administrative assistance especially bearing in mind that the instructions are forwarded directly to Chambers.")</span>

In my judgment the guidance given by the General Council of the Bar, which I have already quoted, at paragraph 15 accurately identifies the nature of the payment which should not be included in counsels fees, ie "a special payment … for preparation or administrative work of the kind that would normally be undertaken by instructing solicitors". </span>

The underlying question which I have to answer is: were the costs claimed by the Claimant proportionately and reasonably incurred and proportionate and reasonable in amount? In relation to the £15 I have indicated that it is a cost not reasonably incurred. The Defendants therefore do not have to pay it. It is a matter for the Claimants’ Solicitors whether they still seek to charge their clients that amount, but it seems unlikely that this will be possible for two reasons: firstly, Section 74(3) of the Solicitors Act 1974 provides:</span>

I am asked, if possible, to give some general guidance as to when the use of counsel might be appropriate. Mr Neish went so far as to suggest that I might indicate that it would not be appropriate in any fast track case. That would however be far too far reaching and would in effect be usurping the task of the Civil Procedure Rule Committee. If at some date in the future it is decided that fees for counsel’s advice in fast track cases should not be recoverable, rules to that effect will be passed. Until such rules are passed the matter remains one for the discretion of the Judge assessing costs. The test to be applied on the standard basis is, as I have said, whether the costs are reasonably and proportionately incurred and are reasonable and proportionate in amount. The Test Cases before me are for the most part simple, straightforward cases which competent solicitors of reasonable experience should be able to deal with without needing to resort to counsel. There may however be factually simple cases resulting in modest awards of damages which nonetheless contain difficulties, for example as to causation, in respect of which the obtaining of counsel’s advice would be both reasonable and proportionate.

In the case of Mr Brooks the Evidence of Insurance is dated 24 May 2000. Since, in my view, Mr Brooks was not committed to this insurance until his proposal or offer had been accepted by the insurers, it seems clear that no money was actually paid or committed by him to Claims Direct prior to 1 April 2000. On the facts of Mr Brooks case I can see no reason why the recoverable element of the insurance premium should not be recovered. It follows that had there been a concluded contract before 1 April 2000 that contract would not come under the provisions of Section 29 of the 1999 Act.

Experience has shown that where clients are contacted prior to the acceptance of a case by a panel solicitor, who may then subsequently decide not to accept the case, the client is left confused, particularly when a second solicitor writes to confirm he is acting for him. Consequently it is now a mandatory part of the scheme that there is to be no client contact prior to acceptance of the case.

The panel solicitor is at liberty to request additional information from the claims manager prior to the acceptance of the case. However, the claims manager must not be asked to carry out additional work, which is purely of a speculative nature. It is not in anyone’s interest to waste the claims manager’s time on a case that is unlikely to be accepted when that claims manager could be using that time to see a new client. If a simple phone call may help then by all means make it; otherwise, just return the case to the Data Processing Department as soon as possible. [page 269]</span>

The Defendants’ position is that the compulsory payment of £395 by the panel solicitor to MLSS in respect of every Claims Direct case taken on is, at least in part, a referral fee, ie a fee paid by way of a reward or commission in return for the introduction by Claims Direct of the work to the panel solicitor. The Defendants do not seek to go behind the finding in my earlier judgment (at paragraph 199) that the £395 plus VAT was charged for work by claims managers in proofing witnesses and (where necessary) preparing sketch plans and photographs. They argue that the documents produced in relation to individual test cases show that such work was performed and that it was charged for within the £395 plus VAT invoices to panel solicitors by MLSS. They maintain however that this does not mean that this standard and compulsory fee did not also include a referral element. </span>

He is intelligent and articulate and very well aware of the difficulties surrounding the Law Society’s Introduction and Referral Code. He was, as Mr Neish submitted, at the head of the developing business model and fully informed and authoritative on the subject. In my view Mr Raincock was well aware that the £395 was, at least in part, a referral fee paid by the solicitor to Claims Direct through MLSS in order to obtain the work.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">Mr Neish submits and I accept, that, taken together with the terms of the agreement between Poole &amp; Co and the panel solicitor and the Operating Manual, this information makes it clear that the payment of £395 (and the £72.50 paid to Poole &amp; Co) was in fact part of the Claims Direct income stream. The cases belonged to Claims Direct, not to Poole &amp; Co. Poole &amp; Co was not the introducer, rather it was an intermediary. It was MLSS, of which Mr Poole was a director, which distributed the work through Poole &amp; Co and which was the true introducer.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">Mr Charlton’s alternative argument, if MLSS was found to be the introducer, is that no Defendant suggests that the whole of the £395 paid to MLSS is a referral fee, because part of it was for work actually done by MLSS. The Claimants’ case is that it is not a referral fee at all because nobody knows in advance what work is to be done by MLSS and sometimes the work done may be worth as much as, or more than, the £395.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">Mr Charlton argues that the burden is on the paying party to show what element of the £395 is a referral fee; but his position is that it is a fixed fee and not a referral fee. He submits that the Claims Direct Scheme allows and encourages the panel solicitor to use the claims management services supplied by MLSS. Those services are in fact used, and, since there is no suggestion of sham, he argues that there is no need for him to produce evidence to show what the charge is for. In short he argues that it is a block fee charged at the outset for work to be done. If there is a shortfall this does not necessarily mean that the surplus is a referral fee.</span>

He points out that this figure is payable in full whatever the nature or facts of the case and whatever the nature or extent of the work actually performed by the claims manager. It is common ground between the parties that any part of the £395 which cannot be justified on the basis of the work done by the claims manager is irrecoverable. Mr Neish also points out that, although the eighth edition of the Operating Manual provides that MLSS would provide a breakdown of costs detailing the claims manager’s time to the panel solicitor, and that the claims managers were required to record their time on Cost Action Reports, such reports only appear in three of the Test Cases (Gore, Warner and Wilson). He also asserts that only six of the 15 remaining Test Cases (Benton, Sly and Morgan, in addition to the three named above) is there any evidence as to time spent/cost/value of the work done by the claims managers in the Test Cases. </span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">It is now not at all uncommon for a solicitor to pay money for services as agent for the client and then to bill the client in respect of that payment. Such a payment is not strictly a professional disbursement but is treated as a disbursement for the sake of convenience. In those cases where the client is able to pay, solicitors frequently ask for money from the client to cover those payments which the solicitor proposes to make on the client’s behalf. In my judgment, if any of the MLSS fee is recoverable it should be treated as a disbursement not as part of the solicitors’ profit costs. In my view the solicitor can charge as profit costs only that work undertaken by him or a member of his firm in the capacity of solicitor. If a task is delegated to a solicitor agent that too is chargeable as part of the principal solicitor’s profit costs. Where tasks are delegated to other non solicitor bodies any charge which those bodies make must be treated as a disbursement incurred by the client through the agency of the solicitor (see In Re Blair &amp; Girling [1906] 2 KB 131 CA). Where a solicitor, for example, instructs an enquiry agent to carry out certain work and perhaps to obtain a witness statement, the enquiry agent’s charges will be paid by the solicitor as agent for the client and will be treated as a disbursement in the solicitor’s bill. If the enquiry agent fails properly to carry out the solicitor’s instructions, or carries them out negligently, the solicitor will not in normal circumstances be liable for the negligence of the enquiry agent and the client may be able to withhold payment of the fee or to pay a reduced fee. (The solicitor may of course have been negligent in his selection of enquiry agent.) If, on the other hand, the solicitor (in his own capacity rather than as agent for the client) instructs another solicitor to act as his agent, for example to interview a distant witness, the solicitor agents’ charges are not entered in the solicitor’s bill as a disbursement but appear as part of the principal solicitor’s profit costs (see paragraph 4.6(9) of the Costs Practice Direction). One of the reasons for this is that the principal solicitor remains liable for the acts of his agent, and another is that any agency charge is borne by the principal solicitor. It forms part of that solicitor’s overheads.</span>

In my judgment the invoice, which is sent as soon as the panel solicitor has accepted the case, can refer only to future work, ie to work done after the solicitor has been retained. In order for a disbursement to be recoverable it must have been made by the solicitor on the client’s behalf or be an out of pocket expense of the client personally (see Re: Remnant [1849] 11 Beav 603 at 611; Re: Buckwell &amp; Berkeley [1902] 2 Ch 596 CA and Brown v Barber [1913] 2 KB 533).

Prior to the acceptance of the case by the solicitor there is no client and therefore no authority. It is quite clear therefore that any recoverable element of the £395 plus VAT could only be in respect of work undertaken by the claims manager after the case has been accepted. It may well be that, once the case has been accepted, the claims manager carries out work, on the instructions of the solicitor, for which it is appropriate to make a charge, the cost of which may be recoverable as a disbursement. On the evidence before me, applying the above principles, none of the cases contain details of work which would bring the amount properly chargeable near to the figure of £395 plus VAT.</span>

Panel solicitors have the option of rejecting a case, if for some reason they do not wish to take it on, but if they do wish to take it on they cannot avoid having to pay the fixed price. </span>

Investigation had shown that in 25 cases payments of £100 had been made in each case to an accident management company. These payments were described as "report fees". I quote from paragraphs 57 and 58 of the Report:</span>

It appeared that accident management companies sought to assist the victims of road traffic accidents. They used pro formas the proper completion of which would give full details of the accident and related aspects of the matter which would in effect constitute the initial instructions of the respondent and enable him immediately to pursue the clients claims. The Tribunal had before it no evidence as to the way in which those pro formas were completed. The Tribunal find that a completed pro forma did constitute a formal report and it would have been necessary to spend some time and effort in making sure that all requirement information was contained in the report. In the absence of any evidence to the contrary the Tribunal finds that the accident management companies completed the pro forma and the payment of £100 was in respect of the completion of the report and that this was a reasonable average sum to pay. The Tribunal did not find that the payments of £100 amounted to the payment of commission for the introduction of work contrary to the Introduction and Referral Code 1990."</span>

There appears to have been no investigation of when the work was done for which payment was made, nor whether that payment was properly a disbursement of the solicitor, nor whether it was a necessary pre condition to the solicitor obtaining the work.

He suggested that a breach of the Code did not render the retainer unenforceable and suggested that there was nothing objectionable about the terms of the retainer itself. He drew a distinction between the effect upon the agreement between the introducer and the solicitor on the one hand, which he concedes may be rendered unenforceable by breach of the Code, and the agreement between the solicitor and client which contains no illegal terms and under which the client is obliged to pay for MLSS services "at least on a quantum meruit basis cf Mohamed v Alaga &amp; Co".</span>

All three Defendants take the point that at least the referral element of the MLSS fee is irrecoverable. The Defendants rely on the decisions of the Court of Appeal in Awwad v Geraghty &amp; Co [2001] QB 570 and Mohamed v Alaga &amp; Co [2001] WLR 1815. Mr Neish accepted that the agreement which breached the Code was not the retainer between the solicitor and the client but the panel solicitors’ agreement with MLSS that he/she would pay a referral fee in return for Claims Direct introducing the client. Mr Neish also argues that since the retainer arose out of, and would not have existed but for the agreement to pay the referral fee, the whole of the retainer is tainted and as a matter of public policy the court should not permit the panel solicitor to enforce the retainer against the client.

The interpreter was blameless and no public policy was infringed by allowing him to recover a fair fee for interpreting; the public policy element in the case only affected fees for the introduction of clients.

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">Mobile Doctors Ltd produced a pricing structure which set out the fee payable depending upon the type of report to be obtained. Mr Game explained in his statement (paragraph 24) that the fee charged under the Claims Direct scheme was the same as that charged to any other client coming to them direct. Many of the liability insurers use the services of MDL and are charged at the same rate. Mr Game explained:</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">There is no doubt that MDL carries out a certain amount of correspondence, which, had they not been involved, the solicitor would have had to do. To the extent that this work is carried out at the same or a lower cost than if the solicitor had done it, it is recoverable. The judgment of His Honour Judge Cook in Stringer v Copley (Authorities/4) is trite costs law. I agree with Judge Cook that there is no principle which precludes the fees of a medical agency being recoverable between the parties provided it is demonstrated that their charges do not exceed the reasonable and proportionate costs of the work if it had been done by the solicitors. There may however be, within MDL’s fixed charge, an element in the nature of an administration fee which is not recoverable. Mr Charlton argues that if the fee charged is reasonable the court should look no further but merely allow the fee as claimed. I further agree with Judge Cook when he states (at p.8):</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">The Judge also raises concerns about the proper treatment of VAT. I part company with the Judge in his finding that the fees of medical support agencies "could also be treated as though the work had been done by the solicitors and charged accordingly". For the reasons I have already given (at paragraphs 78 to 80) I am of the view that such expenditure should be treated as a disbursement. I am reinforced in that view when it is remembered that a large part of the MDL fee is that charged by the expert. The expert’s fee cannot on any reading be part of the solicitor’s profit costs. Judge Cooke based his view on the decision in Smith Graham (A Firm) v The Lord Chancellor’s Department [1999] NLJ R1443 QBD. The basis of that decision (on which I sat as an assessor with Mrs Justice Hallett) was that the retired police officer could be treated for the time being as the temporary employee of the solicitors who throughout remained responsible for the conduct of the case and for the conduct of the retired police officer. </span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">Mr Neish argues that since it is not possible to break down the cost charged by MDL I should have regard to the fact that the fee was sufficient to enable MDL to pay £40 or £50 to Claims Direct in respect of every case and it would therefore be appropriate to disallow such an amount. </span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">Mr Charlton argues, correctly, that this would be an improper departure from the normal procedure on detailed assessment. The principle is clear, namely that the administration element of any fee charged by MDL is not recoverable. It will therefore be necessary for the receiving party to obtain from MDL in every case a properly broken down fee note showing the actual fee paid to the expert, the amount charged for correspondence and telephone calls and the administration element. In deciding what proportion of that fee is recoverable the court will have to take into account the solicitor’s correspondence with MDL which would not have occurred had they not chosen to instruct MDL. </span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">I appreciate that this requirement may cause considerable difficulty, both in respect of these Test Cases and in respect of other cases which MDL are involved and in which the fee paid to them is challenged. Since the paying parties in the large majority of cases are the liability insurers, who themselves use the services of MDL, I express the hope that some sensible solution can be found to enable the administration fee element to be identified so that it is not necessary, in every detailed assessment where such a fee is challenged, for MDL to have to produce the detailed breakdown to which I have referred. In my experience an administration fee of £15 is not uncommon in such cases, but I have no evidence before me in these cases and make no finding to that effect. I should make it clear that there is no criticism of MDL for charging their customers an administration fee, it is merely that such a fee is not in my view recoverable between the parties, firstly because it is not costs of the action and secondly because it fails the test of necessity when considering the question of proportionality.</span>
