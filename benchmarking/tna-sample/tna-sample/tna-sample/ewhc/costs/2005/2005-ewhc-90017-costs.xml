	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This judgment deals with the quantification of a costs capping order made by the Senior Master, Master Turner, on 17 January 2005, with the consent of the Lord Chief Justice dated 4 April 2005.  The costs capping issue throws into sharp relief the tension between the desire to provide access to justice to those with a legitimate claim and the requirement to act proportionately within the overriding objective of the Civil Procedure Rules.  Part 1 of the CPR sets out the overriding objective and sets out the way in which both the Court and the parties must approach every aspect of litigation.  The Rules provide so far as relevant:</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“There is a view that our long established Rule that costs normally follow the result of litigation engenders in litigants a ‘win at all costs’ mentality.  This is supported by some research which indicates that the existing Rule has a tendency to increase expenditure on cases when compared with a system where each party bears its own costs.  On the other hand, as one might expect, the same research indicates that any propensity to litigate which our Rule might encourage tends to be associated with more meritorious cases and greater expectations of success than does the American Rule under which, win or lose, each party generally bears his own costs.” </p>

He identified the adverse consequences of this situation and felt that they contaminated the whole of the Civil Justice system:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.38in">Since the publication of Lord Woolf’s report, the Civil Procedure Rules have had a profound effect upon the way in which litigation is conducted, and the introduction, by the Access to Justice Act 1999, of conditional fee agreements (CFAs) with recoverable success fees, together with the withdrawal of legal aid in personal injury cases, has fundamentally altered the way in which this type of litigation is funded.  This, together with the introduction of after the event (ATE) insurance with recoverable premiums, has meant that a Claimant being represented on a CFA with the benefit of ATE insurance is in fact able to litigate without risk, and has no personal interest in the level of costs being generated by his legal representatives.  It follows that in this type of litigation Lord Woolf’s eight requirements fail to operate effectively and it is therefore for the Court to take an active part in the case management of the proceeding in accordance with the overriding objective, and for the parties to assist the Court in so doing.</p>

They claim damages as a result of gastro-intestinal or viral infections contracted by themselves and members of their family whilst on holiday.  The generic particulars of claim were served on 10 March 2004.  On 13 July 2004 Timothy Oliver of Plexus Law made a witness statement stating that the Defendants would be seeking a cost capping order.  Both sides apparently agreed that the litigation was suitable for a Group Litigation Order (GLO) (see Order of HHJ Macduff dated 3 November 2004).

There had been a previous submission by the Claimants that the costs cap would only run from the date of the Order.  Mr Bacon accepts that in arriving at the costs cap it is proper for the Court to take into account the amount of costs already incurred prior to 17 January 2005.  In respect of those prior costs he points out that the Claimants are entitled to detailed assessment of their costs.</p>

After the making of the costs capping order the Claimants continued to incur costs up to 17 June 2005, the date of the order for directions made by me.  The profit costs for that period exclusive of VAT amount to £217,470.  The Claimants estimate the future costs from 17 June 2005 at a lower range of £1,404,490 (profit costs £879,990, disbursements £120,000, counsels’ fees £315,000) and higher range £1,481,715 (profits costs £956,715, disbursements and counsels’ fees as before).  These figures are again excluding VAT.  The grand total of all the Claimants’ costs, including disbursements and counsels’ fees, but excluding VAT, is, on the lower range £3,154,298, and, on the higher range £3,231,023.  (The Defendants calculate, by adding in the VAT on profit costs, that those figures would be £3,612,326 and £3,702,478 respectively).  With the addition of success fees and ATE premiums the total of the Claimants’ costs could well exceed £6,000,000.  </p>

Mr Dingemans points out that since the Defendants are for commercial and conflict reasons represented by two firms of solicitors the total costs must inevitably involve some duplication of work which should not be the case in respect of those representing the Claimants.  Mr Bacon argues that the Defendants’ estimates will be based on lower hourly rates since those instructing the defence lawyers have the commercial muscle to impose lower rates.  The Defendants’ estimate is based on a three week trial (the Claimants’ suggest the trial will last five weeks).  The estimate takes no account of any “in house” legal costs i.e. work done by tour operators and insurers.</p>

The global approach will indicate whether the total sum claimed is, or appears to be, disproportionate having particular regard to the considerations which part 44.5(3) states are relevant.  If the costs as a whole are not disproportionate according to that test then all that is normally required is that each item should have been reasonably incurred and the costs for that item should be reasonable.  If on the other hand, costs as a whole appear disproportionate, then the Court will want to be satisfied that the work in relation to each item was necessary and, if necessary, that the cost of the item was reasonable.  If, because of lack of planning or due to other causes, the global costs are disproportionately high, then the requirement that the costs should be proportionate means that no more should be payable than would have been payable if the litigation had been conducted in a proportionate manner.  This in turn means that reasonable costs will only be recovered for the items which were necessary if the litigation had been conducted in a proportionate manner.” </p>

The group contains more Claimants than any other overseas group action illness claim and brings with it what he describes as “a huge array of complex and challenging issues both medical and legal”.  He says that the illnesses suffered and the method of transmission is very different to the travel litigation cases of <span style="font-style:italic">Harris v Thomson Holidays</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Clyde v Thomson Holidays </span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Giambrone v JMC Holidays</span> to which Mr Robbins, the Defendants’ Costs Draftsman and Mr Oliver, Solicitor for the first and second Defendants, refer in their evidence.  </p>

The Defendants effectively deny that norovirus caused the Claimants any illness, arguing that: the virus was airborne within the local area and not caused by an act or omission of the tour operator; the virus was spread from one guest to another and not from any act or omission of the tour operator; and stool samples evidenced no aetiological agent for the symptoms identified.</p>

In addition, the hotel had passed local public health authority inspections.  It is the Defendants’ case that the nature of norovirus is such that there was nothing the hotel could have done to predict the illnesses arising or to prevent the virus from spreading.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:-0.50in">21.<marker name="tab"/>In support of his contention that these are highly complex claims, Mr Bacon relies in part on the confidential bundle which contains, among other things, details of the longer term illnesses suffered by some of the Claimants.  He argues that in the majority cases the Claimants suffered from a “nasty illness”.  So far as I am aware the Defendants do not dispute that the Claimants suffered from nasty illnesses.  Some, however, claim damages only for having to care for members of their family who were unwell.</p>

Under this head I have seen nothing to alter the opinion which I had already formed from reading the other papers.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:-0.50in">23.<marker name="tab"/>Mr Bacon submits that these proceedings are unquestionably complex, not just because of the number of Claimants (869), but also because of the number of Defendants; the period covered by the proceedings (October 2000 to September 2002); the expert evidence as to norovirus; evidence about the actual or constructive date of knowledge of the existence of the virus; the reasonableness of the Defendants’ actions; other illnesses contracted by the Claimants e.g. salmonella and campylobacter; steps taken by the hotel and the fact that the proceedings are being strenuously defended.  He also points out that there are difficult issues as to the transmission of the virus; and that these issues have to be decided whilst taking into account the effect of Spanish Law.  He also points out that the Defendants have retained leading counsel throughout.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:-0.50in">24.<marker name="tab"/>He goes on to argue that the closest comparable Irwin Mitchell case to the present one is that of <span style="font-style:italic">Giambrone v JMC Holidays</span>, a group action involving 662 Claimants.  In those proceedings liability was admitted at an early stage and the matter proceeded mainly on quantum issues.  At paragraph 63 of his skeleton he sets out a comparative table in order to demonstrate the greater complexity of the present proceedings.  The detailed assessment in <span style="font-style:italic">Giambrone</span> was dealt with Master Campbell, who apparently, following concessions by the paying party, allowed an uplift of 120% on top of the solicitors’ base fees.  I do not find either the table of comparison or the level of hourly rate allowed by Master Campbell to be of any assistance in this case.  Had I dealt with the case of <span style="font-style:italic">Giambrone</span> there is no guarantee that I would have arrived at the same result as Master Campbell.  Each case must be decided on its own facts.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:-0.50in">25.<marker name="tab"/>Mr Dingemans argues that the only real complexity is the number of Claimants.  The GLO has limited lead cases to 20 (although the parties appear to have selected 21 – but I am assured that this should not cause a difficulty in the future).  Therefore, for the time being at least, the Claimants’ solicitors are not having to deal with 848 of the cases, other than to keep the Claimants informed of what is happening.  He points out that the Claimants’ solicitors have obtained an order that there should be no individual medical reports and no individual Schedules of damages.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:-0.50in">26.<marker name="tab"/>Mr Bacon also points to the complexity of the issues to be tried, which I deal with below.  Dealing with the points that I have set out under this heading, having considered the papers which have been lodged on behalf of the Claimants, I can find nothing which makes this litigation in any way exceptional apart from the number of Claimants and the issues to be dealt with by the experts.  The problem of numbers has now been brought under control by the making of the GLO and the limiting of lead cases to 20.  The complexities contained in the papers which have been lodged, including the confidential folders, disclose no more difficulties than one would expect in holiday litigation which is not subject to a GLO.  The quantum issues will be few, the issues of Spanish Law, food safety, environmental hygiene, microbiology and virology, although potentially difficult, will be dealt with by experts in those fields but should not cause particular difficulty for the Claimants’ solicitors.  Paragraph 23 of the GLO requires the Defendants to endeavour to agree to use the same expert in each of the five disciplines.  Similarly the evidence of a gastroenterologist would deal with diagnosis, causation and condition of the lead Claimants.  This is all routine litigation procedure which should cause no untoward difficulties for the Claimants’ legal representatives. </p>

The present draft list of lead issues now runs to 82.  Mr Bacon argues that this increase in the number of issues has transformed the case.  In addition he points out that from an initial two Defendants the Claimants now have five opponents.  The Defendants, in their request for further information, seek a high level of detail from the Claimants.  Mr Bacon produced a spread sheet showing the information which the Claimants’ solicitors had obtained from the individual Claimants by means of questionnaires.  Mr Bacon submits that since there are five Defendants there will be different answers in respect of each Defendant.  This, he says, must increase the costs. </p>

Those witnesses would include: not only the lead Claimants themselves but other non-lead Claimants who are able to give factual evidence relevant to the lead cases; Spanish medical personnel and ex-tour operator staff.  On this basis, leading counsel for the Claimants, Mr Brian Langstaff QC has estimated that the trial would be likely to last five weeks.</p>

In the Defendants’ note of Master Turner’s decision, it is evident that he felt, that if there were two groups of Defendants the length of trial would be extended.  He did not however, indicate the possible length of trial.

He suggests that the average settlement for a Claimant with long term illness (put at 60 Claimants by Mr Garner in his fourth witness statement), is likely to be in the region of £20,000.  Using these figures he suggests that an estimate of the overall damages is something between £2,800,000 and £3,200,000, giving an average figure for damages per case of £3,680.  </p>

He seeks to demonstrate that, whilst the number of experts has been limited under the GLO, if each of the Claimants pursued their case individually, the total cost for experts would be some £8.9 million.  This is a preposterous assertion and I reject it.  He makes a similar point in respect of counsels’ fees, seeking to argue that the overall estimated fees equate to £424 per case.  This argument is again flawed since the lead cases are now limited to 20.  Similar submissions in relation to the work to be undertaken by the solicitors fail for the same reason. </p>

It has to be recognised that not every claim can be litigated economically.  Had these Claimants been litigating individually and bearing the costs risk themselves I have no doubt that the majority would not have pursued their claims, particularly if the costs included, as Mr Bacon suggests, experts’ fees of £10,000, counsels’ fees and solicitors’ costs in addition.

It is rare these days for such a litigant to be able to secure the services of leading counsel unless the size of the likely award of compensation justifies such an outlay, and defamation litigation does not open the door to awards on that scale today.  Similarly, if the introduction of this novel costs capping regime means that a Claimant’s lawyers may be reluctant to accept instructions on a CFA basis unless they assess the chances of success as significantly greater than evens (so that the size of the success fee will be to that extent reduced), this in my judgment will be a small price to pay in contrast to the price that is potentially to be paid if the present state of affairs is allowed to continue”.  </p>

In his submission, I should add a reasonable success fee to the base costs and make an overall Cap.  He relies on the fact that Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">King</span> envisaged the imposition of an overall Cap including the success fee.  It is however, clear from that judgment that the Court of Appeal had in mind defamation litigation with a CFA specifically, and not any other type of litigation.  Mr Dingemans submits that, in common with newspaper publishers, tour operators are now faced with constant claims from holiday makers who have suffered some loss or injury and those claims are themselves accompanied by “massive claims for costs against the tour operators”.  If these proceedings are typical, and, after reading the various decisions put before the Court it seems that they are, the tour operators are quite right to be concerned about the level of costs being claimed against them.  </p>

Mr Bacon states that the hourly rates reflect a large complex group action for a large national law firm which specialises in both personal injury work and claims abroad.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:-0.50in">59.<marker name="tab"/>It is appropriate to recognise that the conducting partner has additional responsibilities because of the number of Claimants and the fact that this is a group action, also because of the detailed expert evidence.  So far as the other members of the team are concerned, the responsibility is no greater than in any other personal injury litigation involving modest awards of damages.  The Claimants argue that the guideline rates are composed of a base rate plus a notional 50% uplift for care and conduct.  This is not in fact the case.  When the first guideline rates were produced in July 1999 they were replacing the previous A+B method of arriving at hourly rates, which the Lord Chancellor had indicated that he wished to cease.  In arriving at the first figures for guideline rates a 50% uplift was taken as the starting point.  Since that time however, the guideline rates have been revised four times, each time after a consultation conducted by the Designated Civil Judge for each area of the Country.  This court has no way of knowing the basis upon which the rates recommended by the Designated Civil Judge have been arrived at.  It must however, be borne in mind that there has, inevitably, been inflation since the original guideline rates were given and, in addition, the Master of the Rolls asked that the rates be banded into areas, rather than having different rates for individual locations.  The most recent revision was based only on the Retail Price Index for the period.  Thus, all that can be acknowledged is that the guideline rates contain an element for care and conduct.  The precise percentage of that element is not ascertainable.  Accordingly, Mr Bacon’s submission that it would be reasonable for the direct notional cost (the A factor) to be set at: Partner £145, Associate £130, Solicitor £120 and paralegal £85, cannot be sustained.  I have no evidence as to what the broad average direct cost of doing this work is, nor am I persuaded that there are no other firms of solicitors in Birmingham (or any other city) who are capable of handling this type of litigation.</p>

All those cases dealt with the setting of uplifts for care and conduct.

In <span style="font-style:italic">Brush</span>, Brooke J indicated that anything higher than 100% would not be granted unless the case was truly exceptional.  I have already decided that this case is not exceptional.  Furthermore, the authorities relied on by Mr Bacon related to the period when the A+B method of arriving at an hourly rate was the recognised way of dealing with the issue, and were well before the introduction of the CPR.</p>

He suggests that the work is of a specialised nature and that the firm is one of a small number of firms specialising in travel litigation and group litigation work.  In <span style="font-style:italic">Jones</span>, Buckley J allowed a higher than average rate because the work being undertaken was specialist work normally undertaken in the City of London.  The solicitors involved had to pay London salaries in order to obtain the expertise which they required.  There was no evidence about London salary rates before the judge.  He therefore allowed the sum the paying party had conceded.  None of the factors put forward by Mr Bacon justify allowing a rate higher than the normal rate for Birmingham.</p>

See Mr Garner’s fifth witness statement at paragraphs 35-39.  The estimates put forward by the Defendants do not include the individual costs.  The Claimants’ estimate for individual costs amounts to £1,000,000.  Mr Bacon seeks to take this figure and add to it the Defendants’ figure of £900,752 suggesting that, taking the Claimants’ higher hourly rates into account, there is not that much difference in the costs sought.  He points out that the figures for MB Law’s costs have gone up 20%.</p>

The Defendants’ figures are based only on a three week trial; they do not take into account any in-house legal costs which may be undertaken by tour operators and insurers.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:-0.50in">73.<marker name="tab"/>The Defendants point out that the Claimants have claimed £140,000 in respect of future correspondence and telephone calls with clients regarding setting up ATE insurance (875 hours at £160 per hour).  The Defendants dispute this on two grounds; one is that taking out ATE insurance in respect of all the Claimants is not necessary, and the second is that costs incurred in discussing and setting up an ATE policy for each individual Claimant should not, in any event, be recoverable on assessment.  The Defendants seek to rely on my decision in the Claims Direct Test Cases dated 19 July 2002, paragraphs 171 to 172.  Those paragraphs merely refer to the judgment of the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Hunt v RM Douglas (Roofing) Limited </span>18 November 1987, CA unreported.  Since there may well be an issue as to whether or not these costs are recoverable, I will deal with that issue at a later date should the need arise.  </p>

Every Claimant has, by virtue of the GLO, a potential several liability for adverse costs.  He asserts that it is necessary for the Claimants to have ATE insurance in place.  He suggests that the time estimated to deal with the obtaining of ATE insurance should be limited to approximately one hour per case.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.12in;text-indent:-0.38in">“23.<marker name="tab"/>In making the order I take into account the following matters. Firstly, the order for costs must be proportionate with the amount at stake and the complexity of the issues. Proportionality is to be judged by a two-fold test namely, initially, whether the global sum is proportionate to the amount at stake. Next, if the global sum is disproportionate the court should look at the component parts in order to determine if they are proportionate (see <span style="text-decoration:underline">Lownds v Home Office </span><a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2002/365.html">

	    <p style="margin-left:1.12in">In my judgment, if successful, the claimants' figure for damages, allowing for a proportion of failed claims, is more realistic than that of the defendants. Taking the number of claimants as 2100, the average sum in damages is just over £7,000 for each claimant on a total of £15 million. This seems to me to be a not unreasonable figure. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:-0.50in">77.<marker name="tab"/>Mr Bacon argues that in deciding on the figure for the costs cap the Court should decide the benefit of any doubt about the reasonableness or proportionality of the costs claimed by the Claimants in the Claimants’ favour.  The position would of course be reversed should the Claimants succeed in obtaining an order for costs on the <span style="font-style:italic">standard basis</span> at the end of the proceedings.  Should the Claimants succeed in obtaining an order for costs on the <span style="font-style:italic">indemnity basis</span> any costs cap decided on the basis that the benefit of doubt should be resolved in favour of the Defendants will be too restrictive.  Similarly, since the test of proportionality would not apply in respect of an order for costs on the indemnity basis the test to be applied in deciding the Costs Cap is one of reasonableness.  In my judgment the Claimants and the Defendants are adequately protected by my deciding the figure for the Cap in the way I have described and by the inclusion of a review clause should any of the factors upon which my decision has been made change significantly.</p>

This is correct, but one of the purposes of imposing a cost cap and requiring the parties to set out their proposed expenditure, is so that there is a high probability, assuming that the successful party has stayed within the figures making up the costs cap, that the parties will be able to agree the amount payable under any costs order.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:-0.50in">79.<marker name="tab"/>As I said at the outset of this judgment, Claimants are now able to litigate in a risk free environment which means that individual Claimants have no interest in controlling the actions of their legal representatives, nor have they any interest in the level of costs being incurred.  Once ATE insurance is in place these Claimants will be at no risk as to costs whatsoever and there will no doubt be an application that the amount of the ATE premium be added to the cost cap.  In addition, for the reasons I have already given, any success fee will attach to the solicitors’ base costs but will not be subject to the overall cap.  There is a very real danger that in litigation of this type, where many Claimants would not think it worth risking their own money in order to sue for very modest damages, the funding regime created by the Access to Justice Act 1999 has provided a vehicle for litigation to be conducted for the benefit of the lawyers by generating costs rather than for benefit of the clients.  This is a criticism frequently levelled against the contingency fee system in the United States in respect of class actions.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:-0.50in">80.<marker name="tab"/>The Claimants lodged details of their costs broken down, for the period prior to 17 January 2005; for the period from 17 January 2005 to 17 June 2005; and where appropriate, individual costs estimates.  The costs were further split into High Tier Generic, i.e. work applicable across the whole of the litigation, and then, Generic, relating to each tour operator.  This exercise produced details running to 387 pages in two ring-binders.  The Defendants have helpfully analysed this mass of material in a 26 page bundle which was set out, under headings such as, “Documents”, “Witness Statements”, “Disclosure”, “Experts” and “Preparing for Trial” and, under each heading, they had inserted the time allowances which they thought appropriate at the hourly rates, which in their submission were reasonable.  This exercise produced the figure put forward by Mr Dingemans of £893,652.83 for all the costs and disbursements of the litigation from its inception to trial, including counsels’ fees, other disbursements and VAT.  The Defendants’ figure for profit costs, exclusive of VAT, was £505,555.60.  In respect of future costs, the Defendants suggested an overall figure of £240,875, made up of profit costs of £115,534, counsel’s fees of £130,000 and other disbursements of £75,000, which together with VAT, made up the total put forward.</p>

Having said that, the rates claimed by the Claimants cannot be justified, nor can the times which they put forward as being reasonable in the context of this litigation.  Bearing these factors in mind I base my figures for the costs cap on the following hourly rates: Partner £250, Associate £175, Solicitor £150, paralegal £100. </p>

In respect of the Claimants’ costs incurred up to 17 January 2005, I find that those costs have the appearance of being disproportionate.  This means that when those costs come to be assessed, if the assessment is on the standard basis, the test of necessity will have to be applied.  If on the other hand the assessment is on the indemnity basis, the test of reasonableness alone will apply.</p>
