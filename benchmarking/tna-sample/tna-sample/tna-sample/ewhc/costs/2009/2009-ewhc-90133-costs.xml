	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Following the Judge’s order the matter was referred to me to deal with the detailed assessment of Ambrose Appelbe’s bills.   The first hearing took place on 15 October 2008, and on that date I made a finding as to the extent of the Solicitor’s retainer, and the estimate which the Solicitors had given in respect of it, namely the appeal by Ms Helvadjian’s former husband against the order of District Judge Green (the Green Order), and her cross-appeal against the same order, together with the potential appeal against the order of His Honour Judge Compston of 24 March 2006 (the Compston Order).    I explain the reasons for my decision below.   The matter was then adjourned part heard to 19 November 2008, and the bills and papers were gone through in considerable detail.    It became apparent that there was a conflict as to the exact instructions which Ms Helvadjian had given to Ambrose Appelbe.   The matter was therefore further adjourned part heard, with directions that the Defendant firm should prepare a typed version of Mr Morgan’s handwritten attendance note of the conference with Counsel, which took place on 19 May 2006.    Neither I, nor Ms Helvadjian could read the handwriting, and Mr Morgan himself found it difficult.   A typed copy of the note was produced in accordance with the direction, but even this has numerous passages which are marked “illegible”.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">On 21 April 2006 Ms Helvadjian, having been represented in her divorce proceedings by B D Laddie Solicitors, rang Ms Lisa Bolgar Smith of Ambrose Appelbe because B D Laddie had told her they could no longer act for her because of a conflict of interest.   Two conflicts have arisen as to the extent of the retainer, ie, as to what Ms Helvadjian asked the Solicitors to do on her behalf.   The first is the extent of the initial retainer:  did it relate both to the appeal and cross-appeal against the Green order dated 30 September 2005 as Mr Morgan argued;   or did it relate in addition to the appeal against the Compston order of 24 March 2006?</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The second conflict, which only arises if the original retainer covered the appeal of the Compston order, is whether or not Ms Helvadjian instructed her solicitors to proceed with that appeal, or to do nothing about it.   The handwritten attendance note dated 21 April 2006 of Lisa Bolgar Smith records that:</p>

Ms Helvadjian says, in her mind, there was:  on the one hand an appeal, namely her husband’s appeal and her own cross-appeal, both against the Green order;  and on the other hand an appeal against the Compston order, so that when she spoke of there being two appeals, that is what she had in mind.

Ms Helvadjian accepts that she did have a meeting, which lasted about an hour.   On the same day, 24 April, a client care letter was sent to Ms Helvadjian setting out the rates for partners and assistants and asking for a sum on account of £25,000.    </p>

Ms Helvadjian’s cross-appeal was dated 14 October 2005.  She had also lodged a response to the husband’s appeal dated 24 November 2005 and a further notice of appeal on 27 November 2005.   Ms Helvadjian amended her notice of appeal on 3 March 2006, and submitted grounds to support her application on 16 March 2006.    In the order of HHJ Compston, dated 24 March 2006, he directed that Ms Helvadjian should “either confirm reliance on five existing notices of appeal, or serve upon the husband’s solicitor one complete notice in lieu of the five existing notices”.  She had amended certain notices of appeal and there had been an error on one, and so she had issued a further one.    It was therefore possible to suggest that there were five appeals in all against the Green order (see Schedule of Appeal Papers, bundle C, pages 29 to 32).    Ms Helvadjian was adamant in her evidence that all she had agreed to withdraw was her cross appeal against the Green order.  She did not agree to withdraw the appeal against the Compston order. </p>

She wanted her skeleton argument to be put in.   The appeal ended on 26 May, which was the deadline for lodging the skeleton argument.   She asserted that Mr Morgan did know that she still wanted to appeal.  She asked if she could have her documents so that she could prepare and file a skeleton argument in the short time remaining.  She was, however, informed that the papers would not be available until the following week.   As a result her appeal against the order of HHJ Compston was struck out.     </p>

Mr Justice Mumby dismissed the husband’s appeal.   Ultimately very little time had been spent on the Compston order appeal.    He did not agree that the bundles which had been supplied by Ms Helvadjian related mainly to the Compston order.   There were five bundles of trial bundles and transcripts, the essence of the appeal against the Compston order was the objection to Preston &amp; Co doing the conveyancing.   The husband had alleged that Ms Helvadjian was “frustrating the marketing” and obstructing the sale.    He had therefore applied to alter the order so that Preston &amp; Co could do the conveyancing.    Mr Morgan confirmed that by his letter of 22 May to Preston &amp; Co he had informed them that Ms Helvadjian was not pursuing the cross-appeal against the Green order.

It is difficult to see what more Ms Helvadjian could have done to confirm her instructions that she wished the appeal against the Compston order to proceed, albeit after receiving comprehensive advice from Mr Morgan that her appeal had no merit.   Ms Helvadjian still maintains that Ambrose Appelbe have misunderstood what she was saying about the Compston order, and that accordingly their advice in respect of it is bad advice.     The issue before me is not whether the advice given by Ambrose Appelbe was good or bad.   The question which I have to decide is:  what instructions did Ms Helvadjian give to her solicitors, and did they carry out those instructions?</p>

While I can see that such terms may be desirable in the interests of solicitors to avoid just the sort of problem that these solicitors found themselves in, their implication is not necessary for the performance of the contract and I would not for my part be prepared to consider their incorporation by implication into a contract of retainer absent any express term to that effect.</p>

An agreement I knew nothing about before arriving in their office at short notice.    I disagreed with the large interest rate of 15% and was told to seek advise (sic) from a solicitor next door to them, who understood the predicament I was in, and suggested I sign it but hang on to it and renegotiate.    However James Freemantle after telling him this offered to carry my papers and would not give me back the Sears Tooth agreement, but told me instead he would not hand over to Ms Bolgar Smith before I had negotiated.    However, he did hand the document over and Ms Bolgar Smith would not negotiate.    James Freemantle also told me, as the other side’s application was adjourned generally, and the court was not happy about the court application, I would get my costs back.    However, that never happened and they did not even apply for them.   2 days later I became a litigant in person.”</p>

With regard the fees for the hearing of 5/6/06, I understand that you will be obtaining an order for Mr Preston to pay my costs and therefore there is still a costs hearing?   However there is still the issue of the costs for the hearings leading up to the 24/3/06 that Mr Preston said in the last hearing that he was instructed by his client to give costs off me.    One of my main concerns when I came to yourselves.    This issue/appeal of HHJ Compston’s order and the appeal was what I requested your assistance for at the outset and was quoted £25,000. </p>

In regard to the Sears Tooth agreement, you said you would hold the papers until I have discussed the interest as I was advised not to hand them over until I had discussed a better interest rate and had also strongly felt myself that 15% was too high.    (I had secured the borrowings as a way of mortgage to facilitate my legal fees, but it is Mr Preston who prevents me from drawing down).   A differential over base would be more normal …” </p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“Regarding the £24,000 placed on account with us, it was stated to you at the start that we required £25,000 to be put on account.    Due to your financial situation you were only able to provide £24,000.    At no time was the figure of £25,000 a quote for the work to be done on your behalf, but merely the sum we asked for to be placed on account.    As discussed we estimated that the appeal would cost at least this and maybe more.   This can be seen from our client care letter of 24 April 2006.    In the event the work involved was considerably more than anticipated and we also had to deal with the subsequent costs issues and applications for sale of the property. </p>

We discussed costs again in detail at the meeting prior to you signing the Sears Tooth agreement and advised you at that meeting of the costs outstanding plus an estimate of the ongoing cost.   In respect of the Sears Tooth agreement, I would reiterate that the 15% interest is not negotiable.    The Sears Tooth agreement was a necessity in order to ensure you were able to cover the costs of the work done on the appeal and subsequent to the same.   You were advised independently by Simon Beccle before you signed the agreement. </p>
