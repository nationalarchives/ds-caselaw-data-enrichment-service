	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is unnecessary to set out the background in  detail because the history of the dispute between Mr Hawkes and Mr Cuddy can be found in the judgment of His Honour Judge Havlock-Allan QC at [2007] EWHC 1789 (Ch) on summary judgment. His judgment was appealed to the Court of Appeal   [2007] EWCA Civ 1072) their judgment being given on 17 October 2007.    The full trial took place over three weeks before Lewison J (see [2007] EWHC 2999 (Ch) and [2008] EWHC 210 (Ch)), his judgment also being  the subject of an appeal to the Court of Appeal (see [2009] EWCA Civ 291). In a nutshell, the litigation involved a bitter dispute between Mr Hawkes and Mr Cuddy about Neath, a company with two issued shares, one held by Mr Hawkes and the other by Mr Cuddy (although registered in the name of Mrs Cuddy).    Neath is the owner of the assets of Neath Rugby Football Club.    It is also one of the two equal shareholders in Neath-Swansea Ospreys Ltd, which owns the prestigious and well known Ospreys Regional Rugby Team (“the Ospreys”). The other share is owned by Swansea Rugby Football Club of which the shareholders are   Mr Davies, Mr James and a Mr Roger Blyth.  At the material time, Mr Cuddy and Mr Blythe were the joint Directors of the Ospreys, one nominated by Neath and the other by Swansea.  By about May 2006, relations between Mr Hawkes and Mr Cuddy had broken down completely, and on 3 May 2007, Mr Hawkes issued a petition brought under Section 459 of the Companies Act 1985, alleging that the affairs of Neath had been or were being conducted in a manner that was unfairly prejudicial to himself as a member of that company;   on a cross-petition brought by Mr Cuddy under the same section, similar conduct was alleged against Mr Hawkes.    The principal aim of the Hawkes petition was to seize control of Mr Cuddy’s half share in Neath and then to remove him from the Board of the Ospreys.  For their part, the Swansea representatives had made clear that if Mr Hawkes was successful, Swansea would petition to wind up the Ospreys rather than have Mr Hawkes on the Ospreys’ Board.  By the time the matter had been played out in the Court of Appeal, the litigation involved not only Mr Hawkes and Mr and Mrs Cuddy, but also Neath, the Ospreys and the Welsh Rugby Football Union.    According to a schedule of costs prepared for the Court of Appeal, Mr Cuddy has spent over £1.25 million on legal fees. </p>

On 28 November 2008, Eversheds issued a claim form for the amounts outstanding on the bills out of the Cardiff County Court and within those proceedings, Mr and Mrs Cuddy obtained an order for detailed assessment under Part III Solicitors Act 1974.    On 13 March 2009 District Judge Phillips transferred the assessment to the SCCO where the matter was balloted to me.  I completed the assessment on 21 October 2009, save for the three issues referred to in paragraph 1 of this judgment.</p>

Alternatively, if the terms were effective only when signed by Mr Cuddy (shortly after 30 May 2007), no bill would be due until the end of June and the second only at the end of July.    For my part, I consider the retainer letter simply formalised the terms upon which Eversheds had agreed to represent Mr Cuddy (and Mrs Cuddy) when Mr Richards met Mr Cuddy for the first time on 8 May 2007.    I do not believe that this is controversial.</p>

The estimate was given orally in the Piercefield public house, Chepstow on either 26 or 28 June or 3 or 4 July 2007, but most probably on 26 June.    Accordingly, Eversheds should be limited to the estimate subject to an uplift of £50,000 which Mr Richards told Mr Cuddy in a telephone conversation between 7 and 19 July 2007 would be charged for additional work falling outside the estimate.    </p>

In reaching its conclusion, the court should bear in mind in particular what Mr Cuddy was told about the likely overall costs as against the level of the invoices he received.</p>

It was made expressly clear to Mr Cuddy by Mr Richards, both orally and in writing, that it would not be possible to provide an estimate until the summary judgment application was over.   Accordingly, Eversheds’ costs should not be capped, but should be allowed in the amount that the court has already assessed as being a reasonable sum for the firm to have charged for their work, namely £376,000.    </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As to estimates, it is agreed that Eversheds did not act for a fixed fee and that an estimate is not a quotation that the work will be carried out for an exact sum. On the contrary, there is an element of “wriggle room” and the figure can go up or down (but not by too much) depending upon whether the work took more or less time than expected.  Guidance on this point can be found in <span style="font-style:italic">MasterCigars</span> [2007] EWHC 233 (Ch).    At paragraph 89 (91 in the Bailii report), Morgan J said this:</p>

In a case where a solicitor does not give his client an estimate, the result will not generally follow that the solicitor is unable to recover any costs from his client. In a case where a solicitor does give his client an estimate but the costs subsequently claimed exceed the estimate, it will not follow in every case that the solicitor will be restricted to recovering the sum in the estimate. What these two decisions of the Court of Appeal repeatedly state is that the court may "have regard to" the estimate or may "take into account" the estimate and the estimate is a "factor" in assessing reasonableness.”</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“In my judgment, the legal process involved in a case where a client contends that its reliance on an estimate should be taken into account in determining the figure which it is reasonable for the client to pay is as follows. The court should determine whether the client did rely on the estimate. The court should determine how the client relied on the estimate. The court should try to determine the above without conducting an elaborate and detailed investigation. The court should decide whether the costs claimed should be reduced by reason of its findings as to reliance and, if so, in what way and by how much. Whether there should be a reduction, and if so to what extent, is a matter of judgment. Specific deductions can be made from the costs otherwise recoverable to reflect the impact which an erroneous and uncorrected estimate had on the conduct of the client. Such an approach requires the court to form an assessment of the impact of the estimate on the conduct of the client. The court should consider the deductions which are needed in order to do justice between the parties. It is not the proper function of the court to punish the solicitor for providing a wrong estimate or for failing to keep it up to date as events unfolded. In terms of the sequence of the decisions to be made by the court, it has been suggested that the court should determine whether, and if so how, it will reflect the estimate in the detailed assessment before carrying out the detailed assessment. The suggestion as to the sequence of decision making may not always be appropriate. The suggestion is put forward as practical guidance rather than as a legal imperative. The ultimate question is as to the sum which it is reasonable for the client to pay, having regard to the estimate and any other relevant matter.”</p>

He contends that a discussion took place in the Piercefield in late June 2007; (he now accepts 27 June stated in Cuddy I may be incorrect and it could have been either 26 or 28 June, or 3 or 4 July).   The occasion was after a day in court.    Mr Cuddy recalled that he, Mr Evans and Mr Richards had intended to call in at a pub just off the Old Severn Bridge crossing, but as this had been closed, they chose the Piercefield near Mr Richards’ home in Chepstow.     According to Mr Cuddy’s statement (Cuddy III, paragraph 24), Mr Richards stated that the total fees would be £150,000.    Mr Richards also demanded payment of £100,000, which Mr Cuddy said he could manage by the end of July 2007, to which Mr Richards had responded by saying that if his request was not met  “I will  have your  f<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">***</span>ing house” or words to that effect.    It was Mr Cuddy’s belief following this conversation that Eversheds’ costs would be £150,000.    In a subsequent telephone conversation with Mr Richards after he had received the interim invoices, Mr Cuddy recalled his being told by Mr Richards that, due to unpredicted work, he anticipated that the total fees would be around £200,000 (Cuddy 1, paragraph 23).  However, it had not been until after Mr Cuddy had terminated the retainer and he had received the final invoices that he had learned that the costs exceeded £432,000, far above the revised estimate of £200,000. Until then, he had no idea that Eversheds’ costs amounted to anything like that figure.</p>

In his view, there had needed to be a “catch up” meeting as to “where we were going” during the trial.   He could not remember the exact date either, but he did remember that (a) the venue was the Piercefield and (b) the nature of the discussion.   Mr Evans recalled that it had been Mr Richards who had raised the question of costs and that he had mentioned the figure of £150,000.     Mr Richards had said that he (meaning Eversheds) needed to be paid, that the costs were £150,000, and that he would take Mr Cuddy’s house if necessary to ensure that that happened.    Mr Evans had interpreted this as meaning that the costs were going to be £150,000 for what Mr Cuddy had instructed Eversheds to do.     At first, Mr Evans had thought the reference to Mr Cuddy’s house had been made in jest.   In fact, this had not been the case because when Mr Evans had mentioned that Mr Cuddy’s house was, in fact, in Mrs Cuddy’s name, Mr Richards had replied to the effect that “that was alright, because she was a Defendant too”.</p>

In fact, what Mr Richards meant (as he made clear in the witness box) was that whilst there was no meeting on 27 June, that did not mean that no such meeting had ever taken place.    During cross-examination, Mr Richards agreed that there had been a discussion in a pub but that had not been on 27 June because he had spent that day in Cardiff.   Mr Richards thought it unlikely that the meeting had been during the trial; more likely, he thought, it occurred after Mr Cuddy had received the interim invoices or when the judgment was handed down.    He did not recall Mr Evans having been at the Piercefield, but could not be certain on that point.  At all events, Mr Richards denied providing an estimate of £150,000 in a pub or anywhere else.    </p>

At the end of the proceedings, the trio agreed to meet in a pub to discuss the day’s events.    Both Mr Cuddy and Mr Evans think it could have been that date (Evans II, paragraph 4 and Cuddy III, paragraph 24).   Mr Richards does not know (transcript page 78, line 22) but he accepts a meeting did take place in a pub.  In my judgment it is improbable that it was after Mr Cuddy had received the interim invoices or after judgment as Mr Richards has suggested. In my view it is more likely that it was the 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> because Mr Richards did not attend court on the 27th and Mr Cuddy did not receive the interim invoices until after the summary judgment hearing had been concluded.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Because the intended pub had been shut, the trio went instead to the Piercefield.   The question of costs arose.   Mr Evans was concerned that the dispute between Mr Cuddy and Mr Hawkes was or could potentially become, prejudicial to Neath.    Aware of what his costs were to mid June because on his case he had obtained a print out up to 13 June and had or was on the point of raising invoices for this sum (Bacon closing submissions paragraph 73 a), Mr Richards mentioned the figure of £150,000, and that he would be expecting £100,000 to be paid on account.    From Mr Evans’ view this was memorable because Mr Richards had added that if he was not paid,  he would “have [Mr Cuddy’s] f *** ing house”, an exchange that became even more memorable  when it emerged  that the house being in Mrs Cuddy’s name would not be a problem to payment because she was a party to the proceedings. From Mr Cuddy’s perspective, in the absence of any other information about fees, this was what the summary judgment would cost.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Having given due consideration to this evidence, I accept the accounts of Mr Cuddy and Mr Evans that a figure of £150,000 came up in conversation, and whether it was said in jest or not, that Mr Richards had stated that he would “have” Mr Cuddy’s house if he did not pay. I reach this view because in the absence of any attendance note or other documentary evidence that is supportive either way, I found Mr Cuddy and Mr Evans both to be unshakeable in their recollections whereas Mr Richards was not. His witness statement originally gave the impression that there had been no meeting at all. He clarified that point orally but still could not be sure whether it was during or after the trial and whether Mr Evans had or had not been present. There is also a good reason for Mr Richards having had a figure of £150,000 in mind which he then mentioned; he had already drafted the interim invoices in this sum and knew that that was Mr Cuddy’s exposure up to 13 June. For these reasons, I prefer the evidence of Messrs Cuddy and Evans about the Piercefield.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in"> However I do not agree that these mere words can be elevated to the status of an estimate with the consequences that Mr Marven urges on me must follow.    I reach this conclusion for the following reasons.    First, both Mr Cuddy and Mr Evans accepted that the meeting at the Piercefield developed an importance which had not existed in their minds at the time.    Mr Cuddy’s evidence was that it was only as time went by that it had become clear how very relevant the Piercefield had been (transcript page 27 line 20). Mr Evans’ view was that none of this was then important  (transcript page 67 line 34) although what he thought must be qualified by the fact that it was not to Mr Evans that the estimate (if it be that), was being given. Second, no confirmation of the figure in question was requested or given and it is common ground that no individual document actually mentions the sum of £150,000.  Third, the fact that the conversation about £150,000 was not thought to be of particular relevance or importance at the time, does not sit comfortably with Mr Cuddy’s submission to the Court that he had been very disturbed and shaken by what had taken place (Cuddy 1, paragraph 21). In my judgment, if Mr Cuddy   believed the discussion about £150,000 was an estimate, he is mistaken in this respect; expressed in legal-ease, the form of words used by Mr Richards was not a binding estimate from which Eversheds cannot now resile, and to which the firm is bound so the estimate point fails.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Such a conclusion is consistent with Mr Evans’ evidence.    His response to Mr Bacon’s question “how was this [the £150,000) mentioned?” was:  “the costs were £150,000”.   In my opinion that is open to more than one interpretation, namely that it was £150,000 to date, or alternatively that it was going to be £150,000 all-in.    It follows that whilst the figure was mentioned by Mr Richards, it was not said in the context  “It’s £150,000 for the job”, albeit that such a figure to an experienced solicitor such as Mr Evans to cover a s459 petition and summary judgment, might not have appeared out of place.  It follows that Eversheds’ costs will not be limited by what was said at the Piercefield.</p>

Between that date and 19 July 2007 the invoices came to Mr Cuddy’s attention.     On his case they were in line with the figure he had been given at the Piercefield, but in a subsequent conversation with Mr Richards, there had been an upwards revision which had concerned him because the case would cost another £50,000 taking the total to £200,000.     Mr Richards agrees that there was a conversation, but denies he said “£50,000”.  Like Mr Cuddy, he cannot recall the exact date of the conversation.</p>

For his part, Mr Cuddy, having received the interim invoice for £150,000 believed that the total would now be £200,000.    Unnerved by this course of events, he met Mr Davies on 19 May and informed him of his likely exposure. Having not seen either the invoices or any breakdown of them, Mr Davies then   expressed his concern in no uncertain terms to Mr Richards over the telephone on 19 July 2007.    Mr Richards’ response was to send an e mail to Mr Cuddy the following day (see paragraph 63   post).</p>

In these circumstances, I am not prepared to find that there was a revision to the figure mentioned in the Piercefield. Mr Cuddy’s recollection is just too vague when unsupported by any corroborative document and in view of Mr Richards himself having no memory of such a conversation. The submission that the estimate was revised upwards fails.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Mr Cuddy was given no information whatsoever about Eversheds’ likely costs. At no point did he ever indicate, still less did Mr Cuddy give Mr Richards the impression that he was unconcerned about costs.   On the contrary, he had no experience of litigation of this nature.    Costs were important as he was sharing the expense with Messrs Davies and James to whom he needed to report (transcript page 42, line 6).    Mr Richards was aware of this (Richards paragraph 20).     No print-out had been handed to Mr Cuddy on 15 June.   On that date his diary indicated that he had had three meetings, none with Mr Richards.   The first occasion on which he had been given any indication of the likely costs was at the Piercefield.    The interim invoices had been in line with those figures, but Mr Richards had then telephoned him to say that owing to unpredicted work, the anticipated costs would now be around £200,000 (Mr Marven’s closing submissions, paragraph 6 (v)).   Unnerved by the level of these fees, Mr Cuddy met Mr Davies on 19 July to discuss them.    Because no costs information had accompanied the interim bills, Mr Davies had telephoned Mr Richards there and then.    Even then, Mr Richards had not given Mr Cuddy any other costs information until after the judgment on the summary judgment application had been handed down on 23 July (Bacon closing submissions paragraph 42).     This information, when it came, had been in the form of two further bills for £138,406.23 and £131,779.48 for Eversheds’ work and Counsels’ fees   to 31 July respectively. Mr Cuddy had then terminated the retainer.</p>

A month into the litigation Mr Cuddy was given a breakdown of counsel’s fees and Eversheds’ costs up to 13 June, so he knew the figure incurred at that date was about £150,000 plus VAT, which sum was billed on 29 June with the covering letter being sent a week later.   At subsequent meetings and in telephone conversations which were almost daily, Mr Richards told Mr Cuddy regularly about costs issues.     In line with the retainer letter, the next bill was due at the end of July.    When this was delivered, Mr Cuddy terminated his instructions so any estimate for further work was otiose.  In Mr Bacon’s submission, in acting in this way, Eversheds met their promise to report on the amount outstanding, work in progress and disbursements on a monthly basis (closing submissions paragraph 42).</p>

He also disputes absolutely that any such information was imparted orally.   He contends that the only figure he was told was the £150,000 in the Piercefield, which was revised upwards to £200,000 by Mr Richards over the telephone after 6 July.</p>

It is agreed that no further costs information was provided by Eversheds to Mr Cuddy after his receipt of the interim invoices but before his decision to terminate the retainer (Mr Bacon’s closing submissions paragraph 32(h)). Accordingly, if Mr Cuddy is correct that he was not handed the print-out, it becomes clear that he did not receive any <span style="font-style:italic">written</span> costs information other than the retainer letter from start to finish, save for the interim bills.  In view of this, it is critical to Eversheds’ case on costs information that Mr Richards is correct about the print out and that his evidence is accepted on this point. </p>

The tasks he undertook that day are set out on page 47 of the print-out.   Nowhere is it recorded that a meeting with Mr Cuddy took place.    Mr Bacon attempted to explain this by saying that the description encompassed many tasks and that the meeting time had not been expressed separated out, but rather had remained within the block of 8 hours claimed. In my  view, his submission would have carried more weight had Mr Bacon been able to direct me to a subsequent document such as a letter, e mail or attendance note  referring to the meeting but he was unable to do so.</p>

The absence of any attendance note or subsequent e mail or letter is persuasive in Mr Cuddy’s favour; after all, it would have been a simple task for Mr Richards to have recorded what he had given Mr Cuddy in this way. Such documents as there are favour Mr Cuddy and the fact Miss Ewington was unable to corroborate Mr Richards’ account make it inherently unlikely that any meeting took place on 15 June.

His reaction was to contact Mr Davies because, on his, Mr Davies’ evidence, he (Mr Cuddy) had £150,000 to pay and was “very confused, very upset and he needed support – both physical and mental.   He was distraught” (transcript page 53, line 37). Had Mr Cuddy, indeed, been handed the print-out on 15 June, in my judgment, in all likelihood his reaction would have been the same as it was in mid July about the level of the costs.  At the very least he would have taken the matter up with Mr Davies, since he was paying some of the fees.   I consider the reason why Mr Cuddy did not say anything about the costs, on or shortly after 15 June, is because Mr Richards had not provided him with the print out.   Had he done so, I am satisfied that Mr Cuddy would have raised his concerns with Mr Davies, in which case the conversation with his fellow financier on 19 July and subsequent email by Mr Richards on 20 July  would have occurred a month earlier.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Strikingly, the email makes no mention of the print-out.    Since this was the information that Mr Davies had requested, it might be expected that there would at least have been a passing reference to it, since, on Mr Richards’ case, this had already been provided to Mr Cuddy on 15 June so he, Mr Cuddy, would have known exactly how the costs had been expended.     Mr Richards accepts that Mr Davies wanted a breakdown (witness statement paragraph 72);  had one been provided already, he could have told Mr Davies “get it from Cuddy – he’s already had a print-out” but the e mail is silent on this point too.  I consider this further supports Mr Cuddy’s evidence that he never received the print out.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Against this, Mr Bacon has made the point that it was Mr Cuddy’s evidence that he did not read important documents such as client letters or bills but my impression of Mr Cuddy as a witness was that if he was not a details man, he was certainly a “bottom line” man (see for example his answers, transcript page 26, line 36, et seq.).  For my part, I consider Mr Cuddy gave his evidence truthfully and to the best of his ability.    Although at the outset I formed the impression that in answering many of Mr Bacon’s questions by the words “I don’t remember” he was being evasive, two hours later I was in no doubt that he was being truthful.   Where Mr Cuddy remembered matters, he said so and was unshakeable.    Where he could not recall them, he said so and did not make any attempt at invention in order to cover the gap. Mr Cuddy was not a perfect witness, as Mr Marven conceded in his closing submissions (take as an example an error he had made about having paid £5,000 on account (see Cuddy I paragraph 6 and Cuddy II paragraph 6)) but in my judgment, he was honest. That is not to say that I consider Mr Richards was misleading the court. On the contrary, as he himself said, the case was intense and there were many documents which he needed to send Mr Cuddy and upon which he was required to take instructions. In the hurly-burly of the litigation I consider Mr Richards is simply mistaken in his recollection of what he handed Mr Cuddy in mid June and the  evidence he has given has fallen short of proving  or satisfying me that the material in question was provided.</p>

On Eversheds’ own evidence, Mr Cuddy was given no <span style="font-style:italic">written</span> information about costs (save for the print out) from 30 May (the retainer letter) until receipt of the 29 June invoice in the second week of July and nothing thereafter (closing submissions paragraph 32(h)).  Accordingly, unless costs were discussed over the telephone or face to face, which Mr Cuddy flatly denies save for the “£50,000” conversation and for which there are no attendance notes or letters to support, the only costs information, written or oral, that Mr Cuddy would have received from the date of the client care letter were the invoices in the second week of July.

The material before the Court simply does not support this;   firstly, Mr Richards did not trouble to prepare attendance notes to support these conversations.   Secondly, I observed Mr Cuddy as a witness several times to shrug his shoulders.   In my judgment, this could not be taken as an indication, still less confirmation, that each such a shrug meant Mr Cuddy was agreeing with every proposition put to him.   Far from it.    In my opinion, this is simply a mannerism that Mr Cuddy has (if I may put it like that), no more, no less.</p>

On the facts before me, I do not agree with him on this point.    Firstly, there are the notes to the Code which acknowledge that an estimate is not appropriate in every case.     Second, Mr Richards made it plain at the outset that he could not give an estimate until after the disposal of the summary judgment as the case was fast moving and any figures given would quickly have been out of date.    He had grounds for that view since it quickly became evident that Mr Hawkes had instructed his solicitors to throw everything but the kitchen sink at Mr Cuddy, writing on occasions up to six letters a day.    It follows that I reject in so far as it is advanced, the submission that Eversheds were in breach of the Code for want of an estimate.</p>

Having found that Mr Cuddy did not receive the print-out on 15 June, even if Mr Richards is mistaken in his recollection that a figure of £150,000 was mentioned at the Piercefield, the first <span style="font-style:italic">written</span> notification that the costs to mid June were at this level was only given in the interim invoice received by Mr Cuddy after 6 July.

My findings on the evidence have been that the first time Mr Cuddy was given a report was when he was sent the interim invoices on 6 July, but they only gave the position up to 13 June. In fact by 6 July, the costs were over £350,000, information that was available to Mr Richards “at the push of a button” (see transcript of his evidence page 77 lines 36 to 37) via Eversheds’ sophisticated time recording system (RAPID). This  enables anyone interested to access the work undertaken by each fee earner, the date, the hours billed, the rate and the billed value (Richards witness statement paragraphs 44-46) so  that a statement of the firm’s costs was “available to print-off the system at any time” ( Mr Richards- transcript page 72, line 11).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I do not consider it was Mr Cuddy’s duty to request this information;   it was Eversheds, themselves, who had written the terms of the retainer letter and the onus was on them, as the solicitors with access to the figures, to provide the relevant material.  If it was impossible to give an estimate until after the summary judgment ended on 4 July, in my judgment it certainly was not impossible to tell Mr Cuddy what he had spent and what he would be likely to incur in the immediate aftermath. Given the availability of RAPID, it is reasonable to ask rhetorically, what was difficult about telling him “We have spent £150,000 to 13 June; next week we have two meetings arranged, one conference and a case management conference which will be attended by counsel.   In addition there will be correspondence from Hawkes’ solicitors to address. The likely charge will be £ X, but we cannot give an estimate beyond the next 7 days for the reasons we have already given”?  If, at the end of the week, this information proved to be inaccurate because unpredicted costs had arisen, Mr Cuddy could have  been  told the revised position “at the push of a button”; having found instead  that apart from the interim invoices, Mr Cuddy was given no costs information from the date of the client care letter until he received the interim invoices and thereafter nothing until delivery of the final invoice, in my judgment Eversheds breached of the terms of the retainer and paragraph 6 of the Code. In short, he was entitled to reports about costs but did not get them.</p>

In his submission, the question must be answered in the same way as if an estimate had been given, namely, what is it reasonable for the client to pay?; (see <span style="font-style:italic">Reynolds v Stone Rowe Brewer</span> [2008] EWHC 497 (QB) paragraph 71)   He argues that where proper estimates are not given, it is right to look at other information provided (expressly or by implication) to clients and to what they were entitled to infer from that about the costs to the end of a particular stage in the litigation.    In the present case, Mr Marven submits that I should have regard to what Eversheds indicated to Mr Cuddy about the costs for the whole action and to what payments he was requested to make as the claim went along.  </p>

He contends that £200,000 would be a fair reflection.     As to the second point, Mr Marven argues that as the first invoice was for only £172,000 odd, a sum of round £200,000 would be a fair reflection also.

There is no issue that this was a major piece of litigation.    So far as Mr Hawkes was concerned, he had long been planning his attack on Mr and Mrs Cuddy, and once the petition was issued, he instructed his Solicitors to drive the case forward relentlessly, so that Mr Cuddy had no choice but to run at Mr Hawkes’ pace or give up.   Once Mr Cuddy had chosen to stand his ground and fight, in my opinion the litigation became one of those cases which takes over the lives of the lawyers, requiring their undivided attention in court, out of court, in office hours, out of office hours and at weekends.   I have not lost sight of this fact in deciding what is a reasonable sum for Mr Cuddy to pay.</p>

One such occasion was at the conclusion of the summary judgment on 4 July, when HHJ Havelock-Allen QC reserved his judgment.   By then the hearing had seriously overrun.     Mr Richards and Eversheds could not be responsible for that;   indeed, it is not a charge that Mr Cuddy levels at him.    Nonetheless, from then until the end of the retainer, Eversheds ran up a further £91,754.86 (including VAT) in costs and disbursements when the only court appearance in this period was the handing down of the judgment on 23 July.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">A further factor which bears with me on this point is to consider what Mr Cuddy would have done had Mr Richards actually told him how much the trial had cost and what his likely charges would be for the remainder of July.    Mention was made by Mr Marven that had he had proper costs information, Mr Cuddy might have gone elsewhere, but in my view it is idle to suppose that he would have done so before the result of the summary judgment was known.     But as Mr Marven submits, Mr Cuddy could have done other things had he been told that from the moment the Judge rose on 4 July, the costs for the rest of the month could approach £100,000.  In all likelihood I consider, for example, that Mr Cuddy would have told Mr Davies straightaway, who, as a witness, gave me the impression that he wished to know precisely how his money was being spent.    As businessmen, I believe Mr Cuddy and Mr Davies would have then discussed how the coat of legal expenditure could be cut according to the cloth, to see if there was any scope for limiting their joint outlay.   For example, would it have been essential to have both Leading and Junior Counsel attending on the handing down, or was this a task that Junior Counsel could undertake alone?    Did Mr Richards need to attend, or would it have been sufficient for Ms Ewington alone to be present?    If Mr Hawkes won, how much would counsel charge for advising on the merits of the appeal, and so on? Other matters which Mr Cuddy could reasonably have been expected to know about would have been the need for Eversheds to deal with Mr Hawkes’ solicitors’ letters in this period but he would also have been aware that the lengthy drafting sessions he had spent with Mr Richards leading up to the hearing would no longer be required. It follows, in my judgment, that Mr Cuddy’s reasonable expectation would have been that the costs to the end of July ought to be far lower than those that had gone before. Indeed, as he said in his evidence, the majority of the costs would have been expended by the beginning of that month (see transcript page 32 line 3).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I have already given my reasons for preferring Mr Cuddy’s evidence about whether or not Mr Richards provided costs information in meetings and over the telephone.  With the arguments on summary judgment having been completed and absent any information from Mr Richards about what the next stage could cost, in my judgment, Mr Cuddy could not reasonably have had in mind that the charges for the rest of July would be getting on for £100,000 or a figure anywhere that amount.  I consider these are relevant factors to take into account in deciding how much it was reasonable for Mr Cuddy to pay.     </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Plainly the answer lies somewhere between £376,000, being the sum agreed following the assessment and the figure contended for by Mr Bacon, and £200,000, being the figure advanced by Mr Marven.    Having weighed the matter, I do not consider it would be just to revisit the pre-summary judgment hearing costs.    First, Mr Richards told Mr Cuddy at the start that he could not give a realistic estimate until the summary judgment hearing was over.      Second, had Mr Cuddy been told that as the case was overrunning, the costs would be more, I do not consider he would have bailed out at that point.     In any event, Mr Cuddy was in court and could see for himself that the overrunning was not Eversheds’ fault.    Knowing the hourly expense rates, he would have been able to work out for himself the costs of each extra day would be at least £10,000.    Third, Mr Cuddy has settled Mr Hollington’s fees on the basis of an agreed reduction.    If I was to reduce the summary judgment costs further, this would, in effect, unpick the agreement Mr Cuddy reached with Mr Hollington but at Eversheds’ expense, since they would be obliged to bear the decrease.   For these reasons I shall not make any changes to the assessed costs up to 4 July.    </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I reach a different conclusion for the post summary judgment hearing period.    As I have said, after 4 July the pressure let up and there was no reason why Mr Richards could not have updated Mr Cuddy as to where he was up to that point, and where he was likely to be costs-wise by the end of July.    Based upon his then knowledge, Mr Cuddy could expect to pay for attending the handing down of the judgment and, depending upon the result, for some advice on appeal.     In my opinion he certainly would not have been expecting to pay without prior notification over £4,000 for each subsequent working day as has been the case.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As things currently stand, Mr Cuddy is due to pay £376,000 less the £150,000 paid on account.    Taking into account the factors I have set out above in paragraph 85, the fact that under CPR 44.4-(1) the court will not allow costs that have been unreasonably incurred and doing the best I can, in my judgment a reasonable amount for Mr Cuddy to pay after the Judge rose on 4 July to the end of the retainer  would be in the region of £25,000 plus VAT instead of the £91,754.86 charged. As stated by Morgan J in <span style="font-style:italic">MasterCigars</span>, the excess is not recoverable.  It follows that when this has been deducted, the costs will be reduced significantly. For convenience I propose to round the figures and assess Eversheds’ costs and disbursements at £325,000 inclusive of VAT to reflect this reduction. Therefore the final costs certificate will issue in the sum of £325,000 less £150,000 paid on account less £57,500 paid to Mr Hollington, leaving a balance due of £117,500. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Both Mr Bacon and Mr Marven made other points which for completeness I should deal with but which, in the event, did not assist me significantly in reaching my decisions in this case.    It was said in the course of argument that because Mr Cuddy has paid Geldards hundreds of thousands of pounds, this was indicative of the fact that he cared not about how much the case was costing when Eversheds were instructed.    Mr Cuddy’s evidence, which I accept, was that Geldards have provided stage by stage estimates which has enabled Mr Cuddy “to keep tabs” on the costs and to budget appropriately.    Next, it is agreed that there was a blazing row between Mr Richards and Mr Evans about the case in a coffee shop which on the former’s evidence took place on 26 June 2007, and on the latter’s case in early July.    It matters not.  Mr Richards thought the argument was about changes to Mr Evans’ witness statement. Mr Evans’ recollection was that it concerned the level of costs being expended but whoever is right, it is not clear to me how this dispute bears upon the costs that it is reasonable for Mr Cuddy to pay in this case.    </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in"> In the result, the reductions will bear heavily on Eversheds’ professional charges in circumstances where the firm can assert with justification that Mr Cuddy’s affairs were dealt with conscientiously and urgently.    When the reductions to Miss Stonefrost’s fees are taken into account and which Eversheds must bear unless she is willing to discount them, the firm will be left with heavily reduced professional charges for handling this difficult case.    Whilst this might give the appearance of being unjust, I observe that in <span style="font-style:italic">Reynolds</span>, Mr Justice Tugendhat found that that case had been “a disastrous experience for the claimant and little better for the solicitors” (see paragraph 69), but even then  he did not take any steps to address  this situation beyond the detailed assessment of the costs.   In any event, in my view all that Eversheds  needed to do  to safeguard its position was to have complied with the terms of their own retainer letter and paragraph 6 of the Code.   It would have taken little for Mr Richards, or one of his assistants at his direction, to have provided Mr Cuddy with a regular printout sent under cover of an explanatory letter or email.     Mr Richards was fond of saying during the course of the hearing that Mr Cuddy was “self made”, his wealth emanating from demolition, who was ostentatious with his money and took every opportunity to demonstrate or talk about it (Richards, paragraph 38).   If that was Eversheds’ perception of their new client, I consider Mr Cuddy was just the sort of person who needed to be given the costs information required by the Code and the retainer letter, all the more so where, as here, the litigation was fast moving, complex and expensive.    Having failed to comply with the Code and with their own terms of business, Eversheds have only themselves to thank for their omissions in this respect, for which they must now bear the consequences. </p>
