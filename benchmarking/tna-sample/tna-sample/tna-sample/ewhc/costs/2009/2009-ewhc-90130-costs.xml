	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">On 22 April 2001 the Claimant, an unemployed drug addict of no fixed abode, who had previously served a prison sentence for robbery, was the front seat passenger in a car which collided with a stationary van.    The Claimant sustained severe head injuries in the collision.   The driver of the vehicle, the First Defendant, was uninsured, and accordingly the Motor Insurers’ Bureau became involved in the claim.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The main issues in relation to the claim concerned the Claimant’s contributory negligence, since he was not wearing a seatbelt, and the value of the claim, bearing in mind the effect of his previous drug use.    A Litigation Friend, the Claimant’s sister, was appointed at the end of March 2004, and the claim was issued in April 2004.    The Second Defendant conceded liability on 6 January 2005 and judgment for damages to be assessed was entered on 21 March 2005.   The claim was ultimately settled by consent for the sum of £1 million on 25 June 2007.    The Defendants were ordered to pay the Claimant’s reasonable costs, to be assessed if not agreed. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The litigation was funded under The Accident Group (TAG) scheme.   The Claimant entered into a conditional fee agreement (CFA) with his solicitors on 20 July 2001.    Following the judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">English v Clipson</span>, dated 5 August 2002 (in which District Judge Wharton decided that the requirements of the Conditional Fee Agreements Regulations 2000 could not be met by delegating the task of giving the relevant information to the client to a TAG representative), some time between 1 September 2002 and 4 December 2002 the Claimant signed a second CFA.   The Claimant’s solicitor Mr McMullan first met the Claimant and his sister, who later became the Litigation Friend, on 28 January 2003, all previous contact had been by telephone and letter.    A conference with counsel was arranged for 4 February 2004, when counsel advised that the Claimant needed to have a Litigation Friend.  Shortly after that, on 9 March 2004, the Claimant’s general practitioner certified that he was incapable of managing his own affairs because of permanent mental disability.    Mrs Findley Clarke was subsequently appointed the Claimant’s Litigation Friend. </p>

Between 1994 and 2002 he regularly attended group meetings where speakers gave useful updates concerning this area of personal injury practice.    He exhibited his professional development (CPD) record over the years, which bore out what he was saying.    One of the talks which he attended was given by Gordon Exall, a barrister specialising in personal injury work, who was also a member of APIL.    His talk was specifically on the issue of the Conditional Fee Agreement Regulations 2000.    Mr Exall provided those attending with a check list setting out the advice which had to be given to clients in order to comply with the Regulations.    Mr McMullan used this check list for his practice, both at the time and up until it was replaced by an updated version.   Mr McMullan no longer has the earlier version of the check list.    Mr McMullan “took on board the advice given by APIL” and where possible implemented their best practice advice in his firm.</p>

Mr McMullan thought he had spoken to Joy Findley Clarke, the Claimant’s sister, at an early stage to find out what she knew about the insurance position concerning the vehicle in which her brother had been travelling.

The purpose of the policy was to protect the client so that he would not have to pay out if he lost.    Mr Mallalieu suggested that £50,000 was simply not sufficient to cover the Claimant’s own disbursements and counsel’s fees, his opponent’s costs, the policy premium and any applicable loan interest.    Mr Mallalieu pointed out that the Claimant’s own disbursements, including VAT, amounted to £112,583.35.    Mr McMullan said that had he thought it necessary he could have increased the level of cover, but he had obtained an informal admission of liability, and on 31 January 2005 obtained judgment on liability.   The Claimant’s risk, therefore, was limited to failing to beat any offer which might be made.    The Defendant would in any event be liable for costs up until 31 January 2005.   Mr McMullan stated that he always told the Claimant of any disbursements which were to be incurred.</p>

There was a training session, when Mr McMullan explained by reference to the CFA check-list, the advice that was required to be given to each client.

In particular this is because the legal expenses insurance premium is insured if you lose your case, and secondly the policy covers all of your medical fees and other disbursements as well as your opponent’s legal costs if you lose.    Further, you will not be required to make any payments to the panel solicitor, The Accident Group, or to the legal expenses insurance providers during the handling of your case.

In short, argues Mr Mallalieu, the client was told that he could not be given any of the advice or explanation he was entitled to.

He suggests that the test is one of reasonableness in deciding how far the solicitor needs to go in getting the information across to the client.    He suggests that there is a group of people who are slow witted or not interested in the advice given in such circumstances, but they are quite capable of giving instructions and do not need a Litigation Friend.     Oral advice was given twice, once by Mr McMullan and once by Mr Hesketh.    Mr McMullan said that he “did my best”, Mr Hesketh said that he had to use simple words to get his meaning across.   He thought that the Claimant had understood “most of it”.    There was no evidence that the TAG representative did anything other than what was required of her.   Mr Power submits that the solicitor does not have to guarantee that the Claimant has understood, even if the Claimant had not understood the position during the initial telephone conversation of 13 July 2001, at the subsequent meeting, on 20 January 2003 (after both CFA1 and CFA2 had been signed) Mr McMullan was satisfied that the Claimant did understand.</p>

The answer was therefore to appoint a Litigation Friend at a much earlier date.

He can only do so if he is given information and advice which are not in any way affected by the solicitor’s self-interest. The particular context of paragraph (e) relevant to the question whether or not to enter into a CFA is whether the solicitor considers a CFA is appropriate and, if so, whether he considers that a contract of ATE insurance is appropriate and, if so, whether he or she considers the particular contract which is available under the ALP Scheme is in the client’s interest. As we see it, the purpose of the regulation is to ensure that the solicitor acts and gives advice independently of his own interest.</p>

If such a person would think that there was no such risk, we cannot think that the draftsman of the Regulations can have intended that the alleged interest should be communicated.  The client would himself have no interest in being told about it.

The fact that the client can always ask more questions does not provide adequate consumer protection, because clients often do not ask questions. The purpose of the sub-paragraph is to put the client in a position where he can make an informed decision.  ...</p>

This means that in general terms they must be construed in a way which will promote, rather than detract from, such protection.  It means in particular that regulation 4(1)(a) and 4(2)(e)(ii) must be construed in a way which will ensure that the solicitor discloses to the client the true nature of his interest in recommending the insurance so that the client can make the necessary informed decision.  This entails explaining to the client the nature of the benefits to the solicitor in remaining on the ALP panel with sufficient clarity for the client to understand what they are and to be able to assess their significance. </p>

I have, however, already found that the oral and written explanations as to the solicitors’ interest in recommending the TAG policy were insufficient.    Mr Power submits that once the decision is made, and the Claimant has contracted to purchase the insurance, the protection afforded by written details to the effect that the insurance was appropriate, or that the solicitor who recommended it may benefit from repeat referrals “is of little or no value”.   He accepts that the protection consists of having the information necessary to make an informed decision.   Once the decision is made the same information would cease to be of importance.

It was on 4 February 2004 that the conference with Counsel took place, at which Counsel advised that a Litigation Friend was required.   Since Mr McMullan had specifically asked Counsel to advise on this topic, it can be said with confidence, that, as at that date, both Mr McMullan and Counsel were of the view that the Claimant required a Litigation Friend.    For the purpose of this judgment, therefore, I take that date as the date upon which the legal representatives were aware that the Claimant lacked capacity.  The doctor’s letters of 9 and 26 March confirmed the position, and the Claimant’s sister was appointed the Litigation Friend.    Mr McMullan did not enter into a separate retainer with Mrs Findley-Clarke, but simply carried on acting (see paragraph 56 above).    </p>

Mr McMullan when cross-examined said he was not aware that lack of capacity might terminate the contract.  He thought that the Litigation Friend would step into the Claimant’s shoes and take over the conduct of the litigation.    Mr Mallalieu relies on <span style="font-style:italic">Yonge v Toynbee</span> [1910] 1 QB 215 at 228 as authority for the proposition that the Claimant is no longer able to give instructions, and the contract is at that point frustrated.

The question in <span style="font-style:italic">Yonge v Toynbee</span> was the solicitor’s authority to act.

In that case, which he submits is not authority for the proposition that solicitors could not recover from their client, the solicitors could enforce the retainer against the client if the legal services were necessaries.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">For the reasons given above I find that the CFA with the Claimant came to an end as a result of his lack of capacity on 4 February 2004.    Mr Mallalieu argues that where a party has no capacity to contract at the outset, capacity may be attained at a later stage, and a party may ratify the earlier contract.   He accepts that a contract for necessaries may be enforceable in such circumstances, despite the lack of capacity.    In this case, however, he submits, and I accept, the matter turns on what happens when a party with capacity has entered into a contract which provides for continuing mutual obligations, but then that party loses capacity to manage his own affairs.   This is a situation covered by both <span style="font-style:italic">Yonge v Toynbee</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Drew v Nunn</span>, and which is spelt out by the Law Society in its guidance.    I find, therefore, that as from 4 February 2004 the Claimant was no longer able to give instructions, and the contract was at that point frustrated.   The question whether the legal services amount to “necessaries” cannot in my judgment save the contract. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The question then arises whether and to what extent the Litigation Friend can ratify or adopt the retainer.    The simple and most obvious solution, which was not adopted, would have been to enter into a new CFA with the Litigation Friend.   This could perhaps even have been made retrospective.    An additional difficulty, as at February 2004, was that TAG had already gone into administration.  There is no evidence as to whether this fact had any bearing on the Solicitor’s failure to enter into a new CFA with the Litigation Friend. </p>

It seems to me that that must be the correct approach, since the terms of the implied retainer would then represent the obvious but unexpressed intention of the parties, see <span style="font-style:italic">Hamlyn &amp; Co v Wood</span> [1891] 2 QB 488, 494.</p>

The letter of 4 May 2006 makes it clear that the same terms apply (apart from a change in hourly rates and some additional matters).    Mr Mallalieu submits that any implied retainer would have had to comply, at the time it was entered into, with the requirements of Section 58 of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990, and with the Conditional Fee Agreement Regulations 2000.   There is, however, no written retainer with the Litigation Friend, she did not sign the letter of 4 May 2006, neither is there any evidence of compliance with the Regulations unless it can be said that the explanation given on 20 January 2003, when Mr McMullan visited Wolverhampton, could amount to sufficient oral explanation.

The difficulty which arises, however, is that the agreement with the Claimant had come to an end because of his lack of capacity.    It was necessary for the Litigation Friend to enter into a new CFA with the solicitors.   As things stand at the moment there is no need for a CFA to be signed by the client.   As at 4 May 2004 the CFA Regulations 2000 did require such a signature.

It could not therefore bind the Claimant.   The Claimant does not argue that this letter is either a retainer letter or a CFA.  It was never signed by Mrs Findley-Clarke.   It follows, therefore, that the terms which apply to this retainer are those set out in the second CFA (provided it is enforceable). </p>

So far as the administration of justice is concerned, the Solicitors were faced with a difficult client and became involved with TAG, which was the subject of constant challenges in the courts, before going into administration.   The Solicitors sensibly attempted to overcome their perceived difficulties by entering into a second CFA, and eventually found themselves unsupported by TAG, which had ceased to exist.   Nonetheless, they persevered with the case and obtained a good settlement for the Claimant.

The CFA was in writing at the time it was signed by the Claimant, and Mrs Findley-Clarke had received and understood the oral and written explanations in respect of it on 20 January 2003.    By February 2004 the ATE insurance had already been in place for some time, and the Solicitors no longer had any discloseable interest since TAG had gone into administration.  They were receiving no more referrals from that company.    The only defect in the CFA between the Solicitors and Mrs Findley-Clarke is, in my judgment, the fact that it was not signed. </p>

The paying party has no control over whether the solicitor engages an independent costs consultant or carries out the work in-house, in which latter case the success fee would be payable.  On the other hand, the solicitor may elect to instruct specialist costs counsel (for such people exist) on the assessment and in that case counsel’s fee would be a disbursement and no success fee would become payable upon it, unless counsel had his own CFA.  The anomalies are not all one way.  For my part, I prefer an anomalous conclusion to an unjust one.”</p>

That breach of the Regulations does not have a materially adverse effect on the protection afforded to her as a client, nor upon the administration of justice.    I should regard it as adversely affecting the administration of justice if the Defendant in these proceedings was able to walk away without having to pay any costs to the Claimant’s Solicitors.</p>

The implication being that, if the liability was so limited, the operation of the indemnity principle would mean that the Defendant would not be liable for any more than the Claimant.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Mallalieu’s point is that there is no evidence that the Claimant was informed at any stage of his potential costs exposure (in excess of £50,000) either in relation to his own costs or to the other side’s costs.   In short there is no evidence to suggest that the true nature of his potential liability was ever explained to him.   Thus, Mr Mallalieu argues that neither the CFA nor the client care letter gave the Claimant a proper explanation of the circumstances in which he might become personally liable.    He submits that any reasonable client would, in these circumstances, be left with the entirely mistaken understanding of the extent of his liability for disbursements, or of his potential liability.    Given that the Claimant’s own disbursements, including VAT, amount to £112,583.35, Mr Mallalieu argues that there has been a breach of Regulations 2(1)(b) and/or 4(2)(a) and that the CFA is, therefore, unenforceable.     </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In the alternative, he argues that a reasonable claimant would have understood that he faced no significant personal liability for disbursements, other than what would be covered by his insurance policy.    Mr Mallalieu suggests, therefore, that as between the client and his solicitor, the Claimant’s liability for his own disbursements was capped at a maximum of £50,000, a figure which could not be exceeded unless and until the Claimant’s Solicitor advised him that this was to be exceeded, and the Claimant agreed.    </p>

His position is that any claim for disbursements above £50,000 is a claim for sums for which the Claimant had no personal liability, and is a breach of the indemnity principle.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Power for his part argues that at the time the contract of insurance was  entered into, Mr McMullan considered that the insurance cover of £50,000 was reasonable.    He says that there is no evidence that, either at that time, or subsequently, the level of cover was inappropriate, since there was never anything other than a remote risk that the £50,000 might prove insufficient.   The level of disbursements incurred, up to the date of judgment on liability on 31 January 2005, amounted to £2,952.38.    In any event, from that date onwards the Claimant’s risk of not succeeding was even lower than it had been before (bearing in mind that he was a passenger at the time of the collision). </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Claimant’s only risk, which again was remote, was that the payment in would not be beaten.    By 16 May 2007, when a Part 36 offer of £850,000 was made, disbursements amounted to approximately £23,500.   There was never any serious risk that any liability the Claimant might have had would not have been covered by his insurance policy.  Shortly after this, the Defendant offered to settle for £1 million.   The approval hearing took place on 25 June 2007. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgment the possibility of the Claimant losing this action was never anything other than remote.    The high point of the risk was after the offer of £850,000, on 16 May 2007.    Experienced Leading Counsel had been instructed, and a good settlement was achieved for the Claimant.   Although there was a theoretical possibility that the Claimant might be left with a personal liability for his own disbursements and/or adverse costs, I do not regard the failure by the Solicitors to go into that level of detail as a breach of the Regulations.   If, however, I am wrong about that, I am not persuaded that that breach has had any materially adverse effect, either on the protection afforded to the client, or on the administration of justice.    Nor am I of the view that the Claimant’s liability for disbursements was in some way capped because the Solicitors did not spell out to him the theoretical possibility that he might have an open ended liability. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The second CFA does not comply with the Regulations, in that no adequate explanation was given to the Claimant in respect of the TAG ATE insurance, or the Solicitor’s interest in recommending it.    Those breaches, however, have not had a materially adverse effect on the protection afforded to the client, or on the administration of justice.  Mrs Findley-Clarke instructed the Solicitors on the same terms as those in the second CFA.  There was a breach of the Regulations in that the second CFA was not signed by the Litigation Friend.    For the reasons given that breach has not had a materially adverse effect on the protection afforded to the client, or on the administration of justice.</p>
