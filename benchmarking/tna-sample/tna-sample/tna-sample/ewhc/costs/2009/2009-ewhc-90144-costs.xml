	      <span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:12pt">This is my judgment on two issues forming part of the points of dispute in this detailed assessment of the Claimant’s Bill. The underlying case is a personal injury claim arising from a motorcycle accident on 30 June 2003 in which the Claimant was a pillion passenger who sustained head and other injuries. The driver was the First Defendant who was uninsured. The case was a complex one. Mr Hanley suffered closed head injuries, was in a coma for 3 months and was ‘sectioned’ under the Mental Health Act. He was kept in residential care with a comprehensive care regime and not permitted to travel (such as to expert appointments) without being accompanied by a nurse or similar carer. He was not well enough to give evidence in his own case or to give adequate instructions and was a Patient throughout.</span>

	      <marker name="tab"/>
	      <span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:12pt">I will not summarise all issues in this technically difficult case but a flavour can be gleaned by considering that (at various stages) there were issues as to whether the motorcycle suffered from a latent defect such as would afford some defence to the First Defendant, whether the Claimant was knowingly allowing himself to be driven by an uninsured driver so as to render him ineligible for MIB cover (it also being alleged that the First Defendant was connected to the Claimant via a shared drug habit), whether the Claimant’s pre-existing serious conditions including epilepsy and a history of hepatitis due to drug use would have meant he would have needed care irrespective of the accident, whether following the accident his condition was so serious that he would probably never be released from compulsory Section under the Mental Health Act (affecting the extent of his need for damages relating to care), and to what extent (if he was ever released from residential section) there would be State funding for aspects of care also affecting a possible damages award. One of the other issues as to quantum was the question of life expectancy, which impacted upon future care needs. </span>

	      <marker name="tab"/>
	      <span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:12pt">The case proceeded at first on a standard retainer from April 2004 to 5 March 2006. Thereafter the solicitors acted under a Conditional Fee Agreement from 6 March 2006 onwards. As at the date of entry into the solicitor’s CFA the issue of negligence and liability as against the first defendant (the driver) had been resolved but not the extent of liability in percentage terms, or quantum, and nor had the question of eligibility for MIB cover been established (eligibility was in dispute on the basis that Mr Hanley was said to have known that the driver was uninsured). Junior counsel also acted under a CFA, with his CFA being dated 1/3/06. After the dates of solicitor and junior’s CFA’s, the issues of apportionment and eligibility settled shortly before a planned trial of the eligibility issue, on the basis of a 70% liability to be paid by the MIB and an order was made on 20 March 2006.</span>

	      <marker name="tab"/>
	      <span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:12pt">The case then proceeded as to quantum. Leading counsel was brought in (ultimately acting under a CFA, dated 10/10/07) for the quantum stage of the case after issues of eligibility and liability had been resolved but at a stage where life expectancy was significantly in issue and had been the subject of a Defendant’s Part 36 offer. The expected extent of State care of and the extent to which Mr Hanley would need to remain ‘sectioned’ under the Mental Health Act also both remained very much at large along with the over all quantum of the case.</span>

	      <marker name="tab"/>
	      <span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:12pt">Directions were made and substantial expert evidence obtained on both sides. There was intensive work with the experts on the part of the representatives for Mr Hanley. Leading counsel was I understand experienced in cases involving disputes about the extent of State funding of care. Ultimately at a joint settlement meeting an agreement was reached subject to court approval, for damages in the sum of £1.9m plus costs to be assessed on the standard basis if not agreed. The Court approved the settlement which was supported by advice by leading counsel.</span>

	      <marker name="tab"/>
	      <span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:12pt">The CFA agreements for solicitors and counsel each assumed risks arising from rejection of Part 36 offers. If the Claimant rejected a part 36 offer on advice, and later failed to beat that offer, the solicitors would not be entitled to fees after the latest date for acceptance of the offer.  Junior and leading counsel’s CFA’s provided that in such a circumstance all counsel’s fees would be forfeited for the period after receipt of the notice of payment or offer.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:12pt">Success fees were specified in the solicitor’s CFA at 100% (expressed as an overall success fee of 100% but with 10% of that figure representing cost of postponement of charges not claimable from the Defendants so that the claimed success fee in the Bill was 90%.) Leading counsel’s CFA provided a success fee of 82% and Junior counsel’s CFA provided a two stage success fee namely 50% rising to 100% if a trial brief had been delivered. I also had a note from leading counsel Mr Martin QC on the question of success fee and heard unsworn evidence from the solicitor for the Claimant who was questioned about the correct interpretation of the risk assessment documentation from which her firm’s success fee was derived.</span>

The Appeal Court held (between paras. 3 and 13 which I need not quote) that the costs judge in that case had not been ‘in a legal straightjacket’ (an expression used in para. 11 of judgment) requiring him to order interest from the original judgment date, because CPR 44.3(6)(g) to which the Master had not been referred provided that a court had the power to order that interest shall run from or until a certain date.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Arial">Mr Chawatama stressed the apparently mandatory wording of the Act and the fact that there was a right to interest on costs unless the rules allowed the court to order otherwise. The rules permitted the court to alter the date from which interest should run but there was no qualification as to the basic primary right to interest – there was no requirement to show that the client was out of pocket. Parliament had decided that from date of judgment the party was prima facie entitled to interest on the judgment debt which included (as part of the debt) his costs awarded under the judgment. The extent to which the court could depart from that was by varying the period of the interest either to cause it to run from an earlier or later date where there was a just reason for doing so. CPR 40.8 merely set down the default position as to when interest began to run, subject to the power of the court to vary that date but did not provide a power to disallow all interest. (Mr Cooper drew the court’s attention to Rule 47.8 which was an example of a specific rule which enabled the court to disallow interest, where detailed assessment was commenced late and also to the related rule 47.14(5) where a late request for a hearing of detailed assessment was made). Mr Chawatama argued that those were specific narrow rules limited to their particular context and effectively highlighted the absence of specific rules permitting the disallowance of Judgments Act interest in other situations.</span>

I accept that if particular circumstances render it unjust to allow interest for the whole period post-judgment then the court does have the power to adjust the start date or the end date.

Referring to the definition of ‘win’ this was the standard expression “your claim for damages is finally decided in your favour whether by a court decision or an agreement to pay your damages or in any way that you derive benefit from pursuing the claim”. “Finally” meant ‘your opponent is not allowed to appeal against the court decision or has not appealed in time or has lost any appeal’.</span>

Whether or not the driver could pay was a different matter (and I interpose to add that it was fairly obvious he could not pay). The definition of ‘win’ he said arguably had been triggered. There had been a decision of the court for payment of damages by the first defendant. The definition did not require damages actually to be paid.  In the absence of other wording in the CFA to clarify the trigger point for a ‘win’ or whether the decision triggering a win had to be one as against one or both defendants, there had arguably been a win by the time of the solicitor’s CFA.</span>

The MIB liability was contingent on a judgment against the first defendant (subject to issues such as eligibility which might afford the MIB a defence).

Yet rather than wait until their Part 36 offer expired they entered into the CFA. Moreover at the time of the CFA the solicitors (notwithstanding what Mr Cooper called the ‘official line’) had had a clear indication that there was at a potential for the matter being resolved at somewhere between the Defendant’s lapsed offer and the Claimant’s live 75% vs 25% offer. Ultimately agreement was reached as to a 70% vs 30% split of liability not long after the date of the CFA.</span>

Under heading “E” there was further mention of the fact that negligence liability had been admitted and that an early part 36 offer was likely (in fact there had already been an expired Defendant’s offer and the Claimant had had made one of his own which was ‘live’). There were references to potential issues of causation of loss (in the context of prior drug use and medical history). There were no issues as to limitation (he was a patient). In relation to quantum there was he said nothing to indicate exaggeration risks.

There were three deductions namely 5% because the client’s recall of facts was poor (as it undoubtedly was: he was not competent to give evidence), 10% for risks arising due to passage of time since the accident, and 25% for risks arising from causation of loss. Deducting those percentages from the 75% prospects of success left an effective prospect of success of just 35% implying a maximum success fee of 100%.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Arial">Mr Cooper argued that the methodology adopted was flawed. The factors in Part 3 which had been used as deductions from the success fee had surely already been taken into account as part of the very long list of factors which had been listed and considered in Parts 1 and 2 of the form which had led to the assessment of the case as ‘high risk’ in the first place. There was in that sense double counting which lowered the prospects of success. A specific example of double counting was that the client’s memory and recall had on that basis been taken into account twice. Having used the risk scores in Part 2 to reach the prospects of success they then deducted from that prospect of success the risk factors in Part 3 which had already been considered when initially coming to the 75% prospect of success in the first place.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Arial">Accordingly he argued that all three factors in the table in Part 3 had been taken into account already. Those were factors relating to the client’s recall, causation and a 10% figure which related to the number of years since the accident and he said appeared to be in effect postponement of charges. The risk had accordingly been overstated by 40% so as to reach the 35% over all prospect of success (even before deducting Part 36 risks, which as Mr Cooper mentioned had also been a factor appearing in Part 2 of the form).</span>

Hence if the various factors added up to a “R x L” figure totalling 41 or more then the case was of very high risk and essentially unacceptable to the firm. Her evidence was that if the case had fallen into that category the firm would not have proceeded to consider a CFA. Matters would have stopped at Part 2 of the form.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Arial">Having passed that vetting process, in effect, Part 3 of the form was the totality of the risk assessment for the CFA success fee, and matters started afresh. The first step was that a basic prospect of success was allocated based on the broad type of case. There were standard levels for typical cases such as routine RTA (85%) as a guide, but the solicitor had allocated 75% as the basic prospect of success because this was (as she had written on the form) a “non-standard success fee” arising due to “value and eligibility issues and causation and Sowden argument”. (The reference to the “Sowden” argument was a reference to risks arising from the outstanding issues over long term State care provision). Having taken those factors in particular into account she had set a basic prospect of success of 75%.  Thereafter further specific risk factors had been deducted which were the three matters in the table below the ready reckoner (amounting to a 40% deduction from prospects of success) and a further 15% added to the success fee arising from the Part 36 risks.</span>

However she was clear that the assessment process which had been undertaken in Part 2 of the form was a wholly separate matter from Part 3 an did not reflect a general double counting in the manner which Mr Cooper had argued had taken place.</span>

It was important to go through the risk assessments. As at 6/3/06 there was no live offer from the Defendants on the table and their previous offer had actually been rejected. There was no indication that the Claimant’s offer was likely to be accepted. There was to be an ‘all or nothing’ eligibility trial in about 2 weeks time as at the date of the solicitor’s CFA and I was invited to take that into account as to risk. It was not a side-skirmish but could have brought the whole case to an end if the issue had been lost. Eligibility was ‘all or nothing’.</span>

The only possible benefit which the Claimant could get by establishing liability against him was that he could then trigger the contingent liability of the MIB to pay (subject to eligibility being established).

The parties on each side could legitimately have reached very different conclusions as to what a judge might award. The outcome would be dependent on the very uncertain matter of whether a judge would find that Mr Hanley would remain in State care permanently. The Claimant’s case was always that care in the community was what he would need. Care in the community placed the valuation around £3m. The Defendant’s case by contrast had been was based on state funded care the value of which was of the order of £700,000. The parties were not running ‘like for like’ cases and their positions had depended centrally on uncertain findings which a court might or might not make and the parties were not therefore acting on the basis of common, known, facts. The Part 36 risks were very substantial. That was why leading counsel had been brought in. The complexity and risk were heightened further by the additional factor that Mr Hanley was sectioned under s.3 of the Mental Health Act 1983 and might never be released so as to need damages for his care (that was a distinct point from the issue of State funding of care).</span>

However having ultimately heard the conducting solicitor I am satisfied that the form did indeed in fact represent two separate processes namely the internal ‘vetting’ or allocation of the case in risk terms (Part 2) and quite separately the risk assessment for the purposes of the CFA (Part 3). Other than the 25% factor which was taken into account for the causation risk, which does appear to have been mentioned twice in Part 3, this is not a case of general double counting of the risk factors. If one re-works the calculations in the risk form leaving out of account that 25% factor that leads to a prospect of success which (on the solicitor’s own methodology) would have been assessed at 60%. That would predict a success fee of 67% to which 15% would then have been added in respect of remaining Part 36 risk making an 82% success fee (which would be equivalent, working back via the ready reckoner, to a 55% prospect of success.) </span>

	      <span style="font-family:Arial">On the issue as to whether on the construction of the CFA agreements there had been a “win” prior to entry into the solicitor’s (and indeed counsels’) CFA’s in my judgment one has to consider the facts and circumstances which would have been known to the reasonable person at the time the contract was entered into. The purpose of the CFA funding and indeed of the litigation was to secure damages for Mr Handley by way of compensation for his very grave injuries. The driver was plainly not a man capable of paying those damages and he was uninsured. In my judgment a reasonable person in possession of the relevant facts at the time the CFA’s were entered into would have understood that the central purpose of the litigation would not be satisfied merely by obtaining a worthless (but necessary) judgment against the driver. In my judgment “win” properly understood would in this context necessarily mean the final disposal of the case in the claimant’s favour as against both defendants. Only by succeeding against both and obtaining an order finally disposing of the claim could the fundamental objective of the litigation be achieved. I therefore do not accept that this case had been “won” merely because the issues of liability against the driver had been resolved by the date of the CFA at a time when there was every chance that the MIB could defend the case on the eligibility point.</span>

Whilst I do not think the risks of refusal of approval should weigh into the risk assessment, the basic point is a good one. That point also applies as much to the CFA used by the solicitors as it does by both counsel whose CFA’s adopted the definition of ‘win’ used in the solicitor’s CFA.</span>

That was an ‘all or nothing’ issue which would have led to effectively no damages recovery for Mr Hanley if it had been decided against him. The eligibility issue was whether Mr Hanley had known that the driver was uninsured and had allowed himself to be carried on an uninsured vehicle. Mr Hanley lacked capacity and could not give evidence of what he knew, and had no memory. In that context eligibility was a very significant risk because, if the MIB had been so minded, it might very well have established (at the then imminent preliminary issue hearing on eligibility) that Mr Hanley had known he was being carried by an uninsured driver, given what I had been told about his previous close association with Mr Smith the driver, and the contents of the statement served by the Defendants in which Mr Smith gave evidence adverse to Mr Hanley on the knowledge point.</span>

However bearing in mind the other matters to which I have referred and the acceptance of Part 36 risks in the representatives CFA’s, my decision is that the only appropriate adjustment to the solicitor’s success fee is that it should be reduced to 82% to represent an effective prospect of success (including beating any Part 36 offer) of 55%.</span>

Junior counsel took the view that negotiations had taken place but that it seemed there would be no further movement. The next steps in the case mentioned in the junior’s risk assessment were stated as “prepare bundle for trial of preliminary issue” and it is clear that he regarded the eligibility issue as significant.</span>

Liability had by that time been established such that the MIB would pay 70% of the Defendant’s loss. The real risk therefore was that Mr Martin QC (who had assumed Part 36 risks) would lose all or some of his fees as a result of a well judged Part 36 offer as to quantum. The earlier the offer the greater the risk that he would lose all his fees. His success fee was 82% based on his assessment of prospects of success of 55%.</span>

As result of the 70% liability settlement it had (at the date of leading counsel’s CFA) become certain that the risk-bearing task of factoring in that future State care would have to be undertaken and this factor had become of greater significance than it had been prior to that settlement.</span>

I must also I think bear in mind that even though there was a wide possible range of disagreement as to quantum of offers, experienced practitioners would still be able to judge whether an offer was within the range of possible decisions a court might make, albeit with a much wider margin of uncertainty than in a case such as </span>

The 35% chance of loss I derive by attributing equal weight to the factors (a) to (c) which I have summarised above.
