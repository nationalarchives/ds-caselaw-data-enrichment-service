	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">On 23 July 1998 there was a fire on board Eurasian Dream. As a result of the fire all the cargo owned by the claimants was either a total loss or was damaged due to fire, smoke, soot and/or heat. Initial investigations by the fire experts led to the conclusion that the vessel had been unseaworthy. The vessel’s firefighting systems were ineffective and/or had been improperly maintained and/or the crew had been improperly trained in their operation. The defendants denied liability and put the claimants to strict proof. The trial took place between 3 and 20 December 2001, subject to a short adjournment. Judgment was handed down by Cresswell J in the claimants’ favour on 7 February 2002 with a costs award in favour of the claimants. The order was drawn up finally on 6 March 2002.</span>

While Mr Sharma gave evidence in the second trial, there was no documentary evidence to support the rate claimed at £175 per hour. There was no evidence of any tariff of hourly rates or schedule of hourly rates for different fee earners. Although a draft did exist it was never produced to the court. As part of the time and trouble basis in December 1998, Websters had charged on an hourly rate multiplied on a time basis. The invoices provided no indication of the time on which the bill had been prepared. Cresswell J came to the conclusion that the going rates varied, dependent upon seniority, from £40 per hour to £175 per hour.</span>

Accordingly the basis of charging was changed from "time and trouble" to "no cure, no pay". Mr Sharma continued to handle the claim although it passed to the General Average Department. The fee for recovery above £6,000 was reduced to 5% in view of the size of the claim and in order to cement a relationship with Allianz. </span>

Some of the time is taken from the estimates provided by Mr Sharma at the trial hearing. The process adopted in preparing the bill of costs was that the costs draftsman prepared the initial draft bill and that was then sent to Mr Sharma for his consideration. The costs draftsman and Mr Sharma then considered the draft bill in detail together and the bill was amended to take account of Mr Sharma’s personal recollection of the work involved. For the record, this resulted in the time initially estimated by the costs draftsman being both reduced as well as increased, depending on the views of Mr Sharma. Mr Sharma also pointed out during this process that although he felt that the overall time claimed was a substantial underestimate of the time actually spent, he was unable to provide, with any real confidence, further specific examples of where the estimated time was too low to allow further time to be claimed. This is hardly surprising in view of the amount of time that has elapsed since the work was done. As the defendants have pointed out, there was no obvious record of the time spent by recovery agents at the time the work was under-taken; however, this is not a reasonable ground for disallowing the time claimed (see </span>

In fact, prior to the use of proper time recording methods now routinely employed by most solicitors, time was invariably estimated by the costs draftsman and was routinely allowed, even in the absence of proper attendance records. The recovery agent’s time should not be disallowed purely because of an absence of time records that do not exist because the keeping of detailed time records is not a usual requirement for claims for recovery agents at this time."</span>

She reported to Mr Joannou. Cases were allocated by them to claims handlers dependent upon experience and capacity. Mr Sharma was the case handler. He was uncertain who supervised him. Any supervision was minimal. Mr Bacon noted that only one fee earner had been claimed on page 10 of the bill at £175 apart from the cost draftsman. Mr Sharma was not the most senior person in Websters. He was third in rank and one of many claims handlers subject to some supervision. That was relevant to any comparison with solicitors. Mr Bacon noted that Mr Sharma had been unable to provide any table of rates and that any enquirer would merely be told that "our hourly rate for that particular case handler is whatever it is and that would be it, really …" (page 176). Mr Sharma accepted that he should have responded to Allianz’s letter dated 30 July […..] requesting a breakdown of Websters’ fees.

A discount might have been given if the claim was very small or did not merit a full fee. Mr Bacon put down a marker on the reference to no mark-up because a claim for such a mark-up at 100% appeared on page 18 of the bill. He submitted that this further uplift on £175 an hour was to bring Websters into line with the 5% fee that was charged. That was contrary to Mr Sharma’s evidence. There was more likely to be a discount than an uplift. Furthermore, at page 189 Mr Sharma said that it would be very unlikely that there would be a mark-up for work charged on a time and trouble basis on his £175 per hour.</span>

By analogy it may be thought appropriate that the fees of a claims consultant, whether charged on a fixed basis, or by the hour, or as a basic fee plus a percentage, should be taxed so as to produce a result which removes the de facto protection hitherto afforded to a paying party by the unspoken assumption in Order 62 that a solicitor’s reasonable charges (subject to taxation) represent the maximum amount of costs recoverable.

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">Mr Bacon submitted that Potter J was saying that Order 62, by virtue of the rules relating to the recoverability of costs by reference to a litigant in person, effectively recognised the de facto position that solicitors’ charges were the very most that fee earners could recover. At this stage I queried whether Potter J was really making that point because he used the words "it may be thought appropriate" rather than making the clear statement that such costs should not or must not exceed those of solicitors. Mr Bacon submitted that the previous and present rules provided that de facto protection. Under RSC Order 62 Rule 18 and CPR 48.6 there was a limit of two-thirds of the solicitor’s charges, provided the litigant in person could establish pecuniary loss. There was thus an unspoken assumption that the solicitors’ fees were the maximum sum which could be recovered under this de facto protection. Potter J was by analogy linking the recovery of other costs to the ceiling imposed on the costs of litigants in person. Mr Bacon conceded that Potter J did not make a finding. However, he understood the judgment to be interpreted in the manner set out in his submissions since the court had been mindful of the cap. He invited me to adopt the same approach.</span>

Potter J and this court were looking at a new breed of costs. Websters were not litigants in person. They were an agency employed by the claimants to bring recovery in respect of fire on the ship.

I put it to him that there was no ceiling on these costs. Mr Bacon speculated why non-solicitors might be entitled to recover more than solicitors. He submitted that claims handlers like Mr Sharma had no professional qualifications and were not subject to professional rules and controls and had no accreditation. They should not be entitled to charge the same fee as a solicitor entitled to appear in this court. Potter J appeared to be bracketing such people as claims managers as litigants in person. Accordingly, it was necessary to identify a fee referable to a fee earner in a solicitor’s firm and apply the one-third discount. There must be a separation or diminution between the fees of solicitors and the fees of unqualified individuals. This submission was reflective of what had been said by Potter J in the </span>

The rates allowable for a paralegal in 1998 and 1999 was about £80 per hour. Two-thirds of that would be £53, which fell within the bracket of £40 - £175 stated by Cresswell J. If the hourly rate for a solicitor fee earner has not been agreed with the client, recourse would be had to the appropriate rate applicable to the solicitor’s office by reference to the court guidelines. It was inappropriate for Websters to apply City of London rates.</span>

That could be ascertained from the amount of work carried out by Richards Butler’s fee earners as set out, for example in the documents schedule at page 11 for work undertaken in August 2000. It was undertaken by an assistant solicitor with minimal involvement by the partners. Much work was undertaken by the trainee solicitors. Mr Bacon referred to the summary at the end of the schedule of documents, which is also set out on pages 38 and 39 of the bill. For convenience I set it out in full:</span>

There were other professionals such as doctors, accountants and others whose charging methods were determined by the market and not by any other internal proof requirement. It was unfair to judge the fees of these people by the internal professional standards of the legal profession. The assumption for solicitors’ charging rates were different from the assumptions of others. There was a scientific basis before mark-up was added. Where that was applied to a profession where that did not happen, the inference was that something dodgy was going on. Solicitors exercised judgment when adding a mark-up based on the ‘seven pillars of wisdom’. It was inappropriate to apply the standards of one profession to another. The agreed statement of facts had produced a market range of £40 to £175. It has been accepted by Cresswell J because it had been agreed. The Expense of Time was a useful tool. It was not the only way to determine matters. The difficulty lay in determining how to apply it to a business where a varying but significant proportion of the work was carried out on a contingency fee basis, i.e. one not based on rates with a percentage mark-up as in a CFA.</span>

It reflected that Mr Sharma was highly experienced in some very tricky areas of law and practice. To equate his experience to a paralegal in the City of London or in Croydon was unreasonable.

Mr Morgan did not agree. The reference to Order 62, Rule 18 was probably of some assistance (and must have been based on the submissions before the judge) in reaching a conclusion that it should not be more expensive to instruct a claims consultant than a solicitor. Potter J did not refer to the deduction of one-third in that connection at all. He did not deal with a submission that claims consultants should be allowed at solicitors’ rates less one-third. That was clear from the paragraph on page 267 in the sentence ‘by analogy … costs recoverable’. Any such reduction would be discriminatory and unreasonable. The one-third reduction for litigants in person was aimed at the reduction of the profit costs in a solicitor’s bill. A litigant in person should not profit from the litigation. It would be surprising if others involved in litigation should not make a profit. They were involved on a fee-paying basis with a view to making a profit.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">It was inappropriate to treat Mr Sharma as a paralegal because he was not a qualified solicitor. His lack of qualifications in a profession to which he had no claim was irrelevant. His fee should reflect his experience and responsibility as a claims manager with minimal supervision or recourse to solicitors. It had been agreed between the parties that the majority of claims were settled without the need to instruct lawyers or commence litigation (see paragraph 2 of the agreed issues at page 638). In his evidence Mr Sharma said there was very little supervision of him by Miss George or Mr Joannou (see page 173A). If a comparison had to be made with fee earners in a solicitor’s office, Mr Morgan submitted that the rate should be at the upper end of the scale. </span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">Prior to Richards Butler’s participation Mr Sharma had negotiated security (with a partner) which was the alternative to taking proceedings against the charterers. It also involved dealing with jurisdiction. Bills of lading provided for jurisdiction in Korea or Japan. The port of destination was Mozambique. Mr Sharma achieved a settlement where English jurisdiction was accepted. It determined the court and the set of rules to be applied. That affected the amount of limitation sums. That was relevant to the type of vessel, the tonnage involved and package limitations, i.e. cargo and its size and nature. The choice of forum was important for package limitation. The security jurisdiction agreement made by Mr Sharma was, in the view of the claimants, very advantageous. Mr Sharma had negotiated the package with a senior partner with Hill Dickinson Taylor. That contrasted with the paralegal status argued for by Mr Bacon.</span>

If work was done by the Casualty Department it would be done on a time and trouble basis. If there was no casualty but a loss the work was done by the Recovery Department. A line had to be drawn between salvage and recovery work. Here Allianz agreed to a no cure, no pay arrangement. It was necessary for me to assess a notional charge on a basis on which it was not charged. There was a further submission which he would develop later on the percentage mark-up of 100%. This was a notional contract by the Casualty Management Department which Allianz had paid from the beginning on a fixed hourly rate without a success fee mark-up. It was necessary to exclude that it was contingent at this stage but an uplift should be brought into account at a later stage. Websters would be paid on an hourly basis (i.e. basic costs plus mark-up) to which a further mark-up should be added for the contingency fee element. Mr Bacon interposed to refer to paragraph 12 of Mr Sharma’s second statement where he accepted the fee should be dealt with on a time and trouble basis on a notional rate agreed from the beginning.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">In reply, Mr Bacon contrasted Mr Morgan’s submissions to the effect that the claimants were prepared to apply the comparison of the grades of fee earner used by solicitors but declined to accept the geographical basis of charging used by solicitors and the courts. The court was asked to determine an appropriate rate for Mr Sharma. Mr Sharma’s claim to £175 an hour had been unsupported by any evidence. In the absence of such evidence the court should have regard to other fee structures for charging, such as those in solicitors’ offices or by other professionals. Mr Bacon took issue with Mr Morgan’s submission on the test to be applied, namely that if it was not cheaper for the work to have been carried out by Richards Butler then Mr Sharma’s rates should be allowed. If it was cheaper to have used Mr Sharma, no difficulty arose. That submission ran counter to the express view of Cresswell J, who expected that the amounts that were going to be allowed would be lower than the amounts that would be charged by the solicitors. Mr Bacon again relied on paragraph 30(1) where Cresswell J had said:</span>

It was necessary for me to determine a rate for Mr Sharma in the absence of any documentary evidence of expense rates of Websters. Cresswell J held that the rates varied from £40 to £175 an hour and had made the point that, although the hours would vary, they would certainly be less than City of London solicitors’ fees for doing the same work. The only evidence was by Mr Sharma that he would have charged £175 on a time and trouble basis. He appeared to have picked the highest figure from the bracket of agreed rates. Mr Morgan at this stage noted that the point had not been put to Mr Sharma and it was inappropriate to draw an adverse inference.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">Mr Bacon responded to Mr Morgan’s point on the nature of the work carried out by Mr Sharma. Hourly rates only reflected in part the work undertaken. The other part reflected the overheads apportioned to that worker. The nature of the work was largely irrelevant to that issue. Salaries, the location of the firm and rents, lighting and technology were largely not dependent upon the nature of the work undertaken. A solicitor in Birmingham might undertake the same work as a City solicitor but his charging rate would not be the same. In the absence of any documentary evidence, consideration of the work done by Richards Butler revealed that the majority of work had been undertaken by assistant solicitors and trainee solicitors rather than partners. In the schedule of duplication of work, there was much work undertaken by trainees. If that was correct, Mr Bacon queried why Mr Sharma should be paid at £175 for such work. Richards Butler’s trainee solicitors were charging £130 per hour. On the location submission Mr Sharma’s rate for such work should reflect the Croydon rate. The court could not be assisted by the number of cases he handled. </span>

Cresswell J had clearly expressed the view that Mr Sharma should not recover more than City solicitors. A reduction could be achieved by the one-third reduction under the Piper judgment or where Mr Sharma’s rate exceeded the City rate. Mr Bacon reminded me that where doubt existed it must be exercised in favour of the paying party.</span>

He submitted that the reason why City solicitors’ rates were higher than, for example, Croydon or Manchester, was not because they employed solicitors at the top of their profession but because they were located in London where the rates and running costs were higher. Solicitors at the top of their profession were employed in other centres.</span>

That precluded them from claiming rates as if they were located in the City of London. Although there was not much recourse to them, Mr Sharma was subject to the supervision of two other members of the firm. Some of the work on security was the subject of the costs of Websters which were being assessed. It was a relatively straightforward matter. There was limited correspondence and exchanges over the telephone without protected negotiations. Some of Mr Sharma’s work was at a level undertaken by trainee solicitors. His work was basically getting information and sorting it out. </span>

All the other concessions concerned the partner and/or assistant solicitor with trainee solicitors. A further example appeared at item 85 (page 78) where Websters had claimed 1 hour 30 minutes. Against that a concession had been made by Richards Butler as to 6 hours 21 minutes trainee solicitor time but not the 5 hours 46 minutes claimed by the assistant solicitor.

Other professions such as Websters were not subject to similar practices laid down by professional bodies for the conduct of their business. At page 158E Mr Sharma explained in relation to time and trouble bills that it was necessary to take into account the commercial reality of raising fee notes. He had raised hundreds of them and had maybe two queries. That commercial practice was accepted by their clients. It was necessary to consider the papers one would expect to find in a claims recovery file rather than on a solicitors file. </span>

There had been a hearing lasting some 3½ days during which he heard from Mr Sharma in great detail. He heard what Mr Sharma had been doing and the role of marine recovery agents and had had the benefit of an agreed statement about recovery agents. If there was doubt as to recoverability, he would not have passed the issue to a Costs Judge. That would be disproportionate under CPR. The Claimants therefore proceeded on the basis that there would be recovery. Mr Morgan accepted that the claim was novel. It had not been contemplated when the work was done. It was easier to claim as damages rather than costs. The Judge had taken a contrary view and ordered the costs to be the subject of a detailed assessment.</span>

Before Master Wright it was accepted that there was a risk that the agreement with Grant Thornton might be found to be champertous. If that was so would it taint Thomas Cooper’s retainer. A critical point was that the agreement was directly between Grant Thornton and Thomas Cooper. The solicitors had written a letter confirming the instructions. The nature of the services rendered by Grant Thornton were found in the judgment at page 398 paragraph 28 which was an extract from Thomas Cooper’s bill. It reads as follows:</span>

Grant Thornton were also instrumental in the appointment of the independent experts instructed and again played a major part in the assisting and liaising with those experts and also with solicitors and counsel. Grant Thornton worked closely with the experts to create the original model for calculating the losses claimed. Grant Thornton made a considerable number of modifications for the model and created several different versions to accommodate the various contentions and arguments. Grant Thornton were engaged throughout in a supporting and advisory role to the [claimants] and their legal representatives. Grant Thornton’s involvement was also very cost effective, as overall their charging rates were significantly lower than Thomas Cooper and Stibbards rates and it will be appreciated that Thomas Cooper and Stibbard would have had to carry out all the work undertaken by Grant Thornton if Grant Thornton had not been involved.

Grant Thornton’s work consisted largely of important backup services for the two independent experts, Mr Banks and Mr Anton. Many of these services, such as the collection of documentary evidence and liaison with the clients in Spain could have formed part of the services provided by Thomas Cooper themselves. Most of the services would, however, more naturally formed part of a package of forensic accounting services which would have included the provision of the expert evidence itself. It was only the fact that they considered that they were precluded by their interest in recovering their outstanding accountancy fees from their clients damages that led Grant Thornton to engaged Mr Anton as an independent accountancy expert.

There was a group of Spanish fishermen forming part of the English fishing fleet for the purpose of the Merchant Shipping Act. Many were based physically in Spain. Grant Thornton took a van down, which was driven around the various offices in Northern Spain, to collect documents and bring them back. That was a service of benefit to the case generally and provided support to the solicitors. The documents included books of account which were also relevant to the solicitors for the damages claimed. That work was litigation support which does not fall conveniently into any of the categories referred to by Mr Bacon. The work led to a saving of cost.

The Government would, in any event, only be liable to pay reasonable costs, which would be likely to be assessed on an hourly rate basis. Thus, for the Government, the 8% would be likely to operate as a cap. "</span>

The location and nature (whether diesel or petrol) of vehicles was relevant to the cause of the fire, for example the refuelling of a car. That work was recoverable in principle. It might not be recoverable through the application of some artificial rule which bore no relation to modern practice. In paragraph 25 of his judgment Cresswell J set out work said to have been done by Websters.

A new regime came into play in which procedural cases were no longer of central relevance. The Court of Appeal was saying there should be a new start which reflected the overriding objective. Judge Thornton then took a quantum leap by saying in paragraph 113 (see para 74 above) that the previous cases of </span>

Different rules applied under CPR on practice and procedure. Part 44 of the Civil Procedure Rules (edited by the Senior Costs Judge) contained many CPR cases on reasonableness. Mr Bacon submitted that it was unwise and unreasonable to jettison at a stroke all the case law developed by judicial decision on the facts of real cases under the system of common law on which Costs Judges had relied for many years. He accepted that the old cases should be taken into account on the standard basis. The new rule introducing proportionality still had the reasonableness test. Proportionality applied to reduce rather than increase costs. There was no reason to depart from the common law to date. It was a matter for speculation why counsel in the </span>

Clearly, Websters did not appreciate and understand the Claimants disclosure obligations. This arrangement increased the time and therefore the costs of Richards Butler. It is wholly inappropriate for WK Webster to seek to recover any of this time in producing documents, where the Defendants have already suffered an increase in their costs liability for Richards Butler’s time as a direct result of WK Webster’s involvement.

The Defendants should not have to pay for Websters (or their client) corresponding with Richards Butler. That was not consistent with or conducive to saving costs. Allianz were sophisticated insurers who could understand advice given by Richards Butler without the need for an intermediary to explain it to them. Websters were not the client but were intermediaries between solicitors and client for the client’s benefit. They were described in Richards Butler’s bill on page 3 as agents. In Mr Sharma’s third witness statement at paragraph 16 (page 566) they were described as being agents.

There was nothing in the judgment or anything said by Cresswell J which indicated an uplift of 100% could be added. Mr Bacon submitted there was no proof that a 100% uplift had been agreed between Websters and Allianz. No evidence had been produced. He relied upon Mr Sharma’s evidence at page 196 where he said that it would be "very very rare that we would uplift the invoice but it is more likely we would discount the invoice for reasons I described before." On that basis he submitted it was all the more important to make the position clear to the client.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">Mr Bacon submitted that uplift can reflect the care and conduct element of an hourly rate. That was not the case here because Mr Morgan had invited me to find a composite rate, namely a figure which included the B figure. The uplift referred to here was not an uplift B figure but some other uplift. Uplift also arose in success fees in CFA cases. It reflected a percentage of the base cost to reflect the risk to the solicitor not being paid, that is to say not winning the case. A fully compliant CFA was required under Section 58 Courts &amp; Legal Services Act before the success fee was recoverable. The present fee was not such an agreement. This uplift was a third wholly unknown category of uplift. The Defendants understood it to be Websters greedy attempt to recover even more costs than they had claimed at an hourly rate in order to get them closer to their cap. In any event it was supporting a claim for the equivalent of a paralegal at £350 per hour which was a fee which exceeded the hourly rate of all the fee earners at Richards Butler. Mr Bacon referred to Mr Sharma’s evidence at pages 177-178, 189 &amp; 195 where he said his hourly rate was £175 per hour to which he would not expect to add any uplift or mark-up but rather might offer a discount if the claim was small (see para 104 above). At page 196 Mr Sharma had said it would be "very very rare" that there would be any mark-up on his £175 hourly rate for time and trouble work. At page 195 Mr Sharma agreed that uplift would be very rare and, at the top whack, especially at £175, was going to be the hourly rate. At page 197/98 he said the invoices were rendered on a time and trouble basis with, so far as he could recall, no uplift or up-push. In summary Mr Sharma’s evidence was that he would not expect to render an uplifted fee on the hourly rates for a bill such as the 14 December 1998 bill. Mr Bacon drew comfort from an exchange between Cresswell J and Mr Priday (counsel for the Claimant) in which the Judge declined to express a view as to whether or not the Costs Judge would be entitled to take into account the fact that services were rendered on a contingency fee basis. That was an issue included in the provisional draft order. The final order (excluding that reference) was the order dated 18 October 2002 giving rise to the detailed assessment.

I must notionally assess costs which were charged on a contingency percentage basis. In effect I was being invited to do so by analogy with solicitor’s costs. On that basis there was no reason why that analogy should not reflect what happened to solicitor’s costs when they acted on a contingency basis. The Claimants drew an analogy with a CFA under which a percentage addition was added to whatever hourly rate was determined. A solicitor on a contingency basis risked not being paid or under an </span>

In this case Websters undertook to perform a considerable amount of work for potentially little reward. They put in (and continued to put in) considerable work for a period of over 4 years under a percentage agreement. The more work they did, the less the return would be. Websters obtained a good return for Allianz particularly because the jurisdiction agreement gave them a very good limitation set of rules. Websters were taking a risk which was what contingency fees was about. They were entitled to recover an additional element to reflect the risk in the same way that solicitors could. </span>

On time and trouble (an old style contractual basis with mark-up) there was no contingency element. It was not a contract where Websters were allowed to charge at £175 per hour but on a contingency basis. That approach was supported by Mr Sharma’s replies in re-examination at page 365 where he dealt with the effect of an hourly rate when acting on a contingency basis. He said it would be necessary to increase the rates substantially to reflect the value of the risk Websters were taking. It was irrelevant that Websters contingency arrangement did not comply with the statutory scheme under the CFA Regulations since they applied to those with a right of audience and a right to conduct litigation.

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">Mr Bacon explained that Websters’ bill included the costs of the trial in September and October 2002. Paragraph 9of the order dated 18 October 2002 reserved those costs to Cresswell J because it was dependent on offers which had been made and the outcome of the detailed assessment. In addition to the claim for time in attending four days of trial there was also a claim for preparation time which Mr Bacon had not yet analysed. All this work should be excluded. The bill also claimed work on the limitation point which also fell outside the scope of the order. After the first trial the First Defendant commenced a limitation action in the English Admiralty Court which was necessitated as a consequence of the findings in the first trial. It was settled by order dated 8 November 2002. Under paragraph 1 the action was stayed upon the terms of the agreement (6 November 2002) a copy of which was annexed to the order. Under paragraph 6 there was no order as to costs subject to Clause 6 of the agreement. That clause provided that there should be no order for costs in the limitation action save for a contribution of £6,595 towards the costs of Hyundai Merchant Marine Co Ltd (see tabs 11 and 12, pages 743-755). Mr Bacon referred to page 11 of the bill and page 6 of the document schedule where there was a reference to the limitation action. The entry on page 6 read:</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">The focus was therefore on the agreement for Websters’ services and what should be allowed in respect of that agreement. It was not tied up to an entitlement to costs under particular orders which post dated the agreement. Paragraph 9 of the order dated 18 October 2002 reserved the costs of the legal representatives. The provision of Websters’ services under a single agreement which pre-dated any costs order distinguished them from, for example, an expert. The issue here was whether Allianz were entitled to anything in respect of Websters’ services. The Defendants had argued they were entitled to nothing. Allianz in reliance upon 14 September 1998 agreement maintained they were entitled to be remunerated in respect of work done under the agreement for the costs to which they had been put. In answer to that point the Judge was directing what should happen. That was distinguishable from looking at later work the charge for which varied in the course of litigation. If it was a one off they were entitled to their basic entitlement with their 5%. The issue was what compensation should be given to Allianz for that 5% which they had incurred. The response under which the contingency agreement dated 14 September 1998 was actioned was found in paragraph 18 of the judgment. In the fax dated 9 December 1998 Allianz acknowledged by conduct that Websters were acting on a no cure no pay basis. The Judge referred in paragraph 19 to an acknowledgement of acceptance rather than of the terms. </span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">Mr Bacon submitted that the second trial was the determination by the trial Judge as to whether Websters could recover, by way of damages or costs, their fees in respect of the work undertaken in recovery for the first trial. Cresswell J had found that if they were recoverable at all they were recoverable in principle as costs not damages and he ordered Websters to set out what those costs were so that a Costs Judge could work out what was payable. In addition to that Websters had included the costs of the second trial, namely the costs of working out whether or not the costs were recoverable. That was a quantum leap beyond what the Judge intended. He had not yet made an order for the costs of the second trial. The arguments about the September agreement might be relevant depending on the outcome of this detailed assessment. The point might be taken that Websters were not entitled to the costs of the second trial because the September agreement did not make provision for it. The fee agreement related to the costs of recovery not a hearing where Websters were trying to determine whether or not they could recover their own costs. Cresswell J had reserved the costs of the second trial until he knew the outcome of the quantum of Websters first trial costs. All costs after the first trial should be excluded. </span>

Accordingly, there was an unspoken assumption that the solicitors’ fees were the maximum sum which could be recovered under this de facto protection. Mr Bacon accepted that Potter J did not make a finding that the recovery of other costs was limited to those recoverable by solicitors. Websters were entitled to recover fees so long as they did not exceed those of a solicitor, irrespective of the factors applicable to evaluating fees. (Paragraphs 29, 30 and 32).</span>

Their offices are located in Sidcup. The experienced claims manager, Mr Sharma, has claimed a basic hourly rate at £175 per hour. However, Websters have not produced a shred of information to support that rate. Mr Sharma has provided three witness statements. As Mr Bacon rightly pointed out, the second statement was intended "to assist in the resolution of the outstanding issues between the parties in respect of quantum" and the third statements was made "in order to clarify certain issues which have arisen in relation to the claimant’s claim for the fees of W K Webster &amp; Co." Mr Sharma revealed the fact that there was in existence a sixth or seventh draft about charging rates. It was not produced in evidence. He also explained that those responsible for managing the company (Mr Joannou, the partner, and Miss George, the general manager) were aware of the need to provide information. They did not give evidence, nor did they apparently sanction the release of relevant information. Such lack of input from them is a matter for concern and is unhelpful in identifying an appropriate hourly rate for Mr Sharma. To the extent that doubt arises, it must be exercised in favour of the defendants.</span>

The provision of that information by the management of Websters would have been relatively straightforward.

It is necessary to take into account in this case the equivalent factors of CPR 44.5. Mr Bacon submitted that the undiscounted rate for an assistant solicitor in the Croydon area would be £120 for 1998/99 and £130 thereafter. Mr Morgan submitted that the rates should be between £142 and £189 for a Grade B fee earner. My understanding is that the rates used by Mr Bacon would have contained an in-built mark up of approximately 50%. Mr Morgan referred to rates of £150 for Grade 2 and £170 for Grade 1 with a mark-up.

Websters have declined to provide any information to support the rate of £175 claimed by Mr Sharma, which is the upper bracket of the range of rates. I find that it is no coincidence that Mr Sharma has elected to claim that rate in the absence of any internal documents to support his rate. I note Mr Morgan’s point that this issue was not put to Mr Sharma and that it was inappropriate to draw an adverse inference (paragraph 54). The reasonable rate for Mr Sharma, as an experienced claims manager, who is not a general manager or a partner, with offices in Sidcup, for the period September 1998 to May 2002 is above the Croydon rate of £120/£130 referred to by Mr Bacon. It is below the mid-point for an assistant solicitor at Richards Butler (£175). Websters had the opportunity to produce supporting information, but have failed to do so. In the absence of that information, and taking into account the respective submissions of Mr Bacon and Mr Morgan, I find that a reasonable hourly rate for Mr Sharma is £150 for the period during which Websters were instructed up to the date of the judgment in the first trial (September 1998 to May 2002). </span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">It is readily apparent that there was no discernible direction to staff on how to manage their files in order to charge fees on either a time and trouble basis or on a no cure no fee basis. Some of Mr Sharma’s colleagues recorded time, but it was not universal practice. Where fees are claimed on a percentage basis, for example, architects, surveyors or even law costs draftsmen, my experience is that time recording is a secondary consideration. In this case the work had been carried out before a decision was taken to attempt to recover the work of Websters as either damages or costs. The horse had bolted before the stable door could be shut. The management of Websters may well have decided that the time taken to record time accurately was not necessary, since so few bills were challenged. It is nevertheless curious that it was not company policy to record time where work was conducted on a time and trouble basis and that apart from the undisclosed fifth or sixth draft, no written record existed of the hourly rates to be charged. The inference which I draw is that the operation of market forces enables Websters to maintain sufficient profit without the need to operate on a precise recorded time, plus charging rate for individuals basis. The lack of records is not an insuperable problem. I accept Mr Morgan’s submission that the nature of the work and the basis of charging is clearly distinguishable from the custom of solicitors’ offices. Accordingly, I derive little assistance from the cases referred to by Mr Bacon. At the detailed assessment, the work claimed must be assessed by reference to Websters’ files, the points of dispute and any counter-proposals and the benefit of the doubt must be exercised in favour of the paying party. This issue must now be left to the detailed assessment.</span>

I reject Mr Bacon’s submission that no further uplift should be applied. In my judgment there are three constituent elements in Mr Sharma’s basis of charging, namely an element to cover running costs salaries and the like, a profit element and also a further factor to reflect the risk that Websters might not recover costs. I have dealt with the first two elements under Hourly Rates. I have not been persuaded that the exchange between Cresswell J and Mr Priday, the comments by Cresswell J referred to in paragraph 105 above, or the wording of the order, precludes any such enhancement or uplift. The arrangement was entered into between Websters and Allianz. I would expect the defendants to be aware of such an arrangement. It appears from Mr Sharma’s evidence that such arrangements are common place within the insurance industry. The additional enhancement is not dependant upon the CFA Regulations. It is permissible by analogy with those Regulations.</span>

The definition of costs is wide enough to embrace this additional risk factor element. The Court of Appeal in Factortame agreed that such an arrangement was permissible.

The second trial took place in order to determine whether or not Websters recover their fees by way of damages or costs. On that basis, costs at the hearings in September and October 2002 and the preparation time must be excluded. Any work relating to the limitation action should also be excluded. </span>
