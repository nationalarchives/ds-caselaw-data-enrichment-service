These bills total £592,983.40, and come before me pursuant to an order made by Master Moncaster in February 2002 in the course of administration proceedings brought by the residuary beneficiary of the estate Jemma Trust Co Ltd (effectively the deceased’s nephew Mr Hugh Butterfield). </span>

It is neither necessary nor desirable for me to go into any more detail about the background, but certain aspects of the matter will be referred to later in this judgment. </span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">A number of items which might normally be expected to be contained in some of the bills above, notably counsel’s fees, are excluded, because these were paid direct by the executors, and not put into the form of a bill. They therefore do not fall within the scope of this assessment. They may however fall to be assessed if Master Moncaster makes an order to that effect in the on-going Chancery proceedings. Since reserving judgment, I have been told that Master Moncaster has indeed made such an order, and I have seen it, and, so far as it may be appropriate, "approved" the same. However the assessment of those fees is for another occasion.</span>

I understand that Master Moncaster has now directed that those bills too should be assessed, and no doubt they will come before me in due course, but obviously do not form any part of the assessment I have to conduct on this occasion, though their relevance is considered later in this judgment. </span>

I have little knowledge of these proceedings, and indeed have deliberately not enquired too deeply into them, but only sufficiently to satisfy myself that there is no overlap between issues which are properly dealt with in those proceedings, and matters which I can properly deal with in the course of this assessment. I was told by Justin Fenwick QC, who appeared before me to make closing submissions on behalf of the Defendant, that there are two separate sets of proceedings, that they are consolidated, and are due to be heard in March 2004.</span>

As the estate has still not been wound up, ten years after the death of the deceased, further bills have been rendered by Brabners Chaffe Street to the executors, and those bills too are being challenged by the Claimant. However, those bills, as I understand it, are bills based on hourly rates only without any value element, unlike the bills which I have to consider in this case.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">In addition to that issue the question of the hourly rate which I have allowed was also challenged in the Court of Appeal. My reading of the Court of Appeal decision is that, if the hourly rate which I had assessed was to be considered to be inclusive of an element representing value, then it was too low, but, at the end of the day, what I had to do is to arrive at a figure that is fair and reasonable to both parties, bearing in mind the Court of Appeal’s decision that such business can now be charged for either on a time only basis, or a value only basis, or a combination of the two. If, therefore, I attribute in my final judgment a value element in addition to an hourly rate (as I do), there is no need for me to revisit the hourly rates already fixed.</span>

Understandably anxious that the matter should not be kept totally in abeyance pending the outcome of the Court of Appeal judgments, I was asked, earlier last year, to fix a date for the hearing of submissions in considering the individual bills in the light of the Court of Appeal judgments, which, it was hoped, might be available earlier than turned out to be the case.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">As I made clear when the closing submissions were made to me on 26 November, I was, and remain, somewhat concerned at the way this particular aspect of the matter was conducted. It seemed to me that all three witnesses, none of whom was sworn, were asked questions which were perfectly legitimate questions, because they arose out of matters which appeared on their respective files, but of which they had little, or no, advance notice, and, more importantly, had not previously been given the opportunity to deal with in the form of a witness statement.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">As I explained, and as I think all parties are well aware, cross examination of witnesses in the course of detailed assessment proceedings, is unusual, though it is by no means unprecedented. It is the practice within the Supreme Court Costs Office to seek to contain such cross examination to the absolute minimum necessary to decide disputed issues. The necessity for such evidence will normally arise in connection with the question of whether there is a retainer, and if so what that retainer is, in disputes between a solicitor and his client. I normally insist that such disputes are put into written form, in the form of a witness statement, and that the witness concerned is tendered for cross examination. In that way both the witness, and the cross examiner, know what to expect.</span>

Most of these questions were put by Mr Hiesman, and were based upon his very careful perusal of the files of Kippax Beaumont Lewis, which he had spent many days going through. My concern was that Mr Heisman might have selected, from the many examples which were open to him, those which he thought were most damaging to the Defendant and most helpful to the Claimant, and put those to the witness. </span>

This is contained in paragraphs 30 to 36 of Mr Bacon’s skeleton, but at the hearing on 26 November Mr Fenwick seemed to accept that perhaps the application of that objection in its full rigour would be unattractive to me, and unsatisfactory for all concerned. He therefore suggested a sort of middle course, namely that if, having completed the task given to me by the Court of Appeal, I came to the conclusion that the bills as delivered were reasonable, then I could, and should, say so, and there would be no need to go further. If, on the other hand, I considered they were too high, then again I could and should say so, but would make no final finding until I had heard and disposed of the outstanding bills, and the estate was wound up.</span>

If one considers what percentage uplift on the basis hourly rate would have been necessary to achieve an extra £30,300, without any separate charge based on a percentage of value, the answer also appears to be a little under 10%. All these points may of course suggest to the costs judge that some other bands or percentages or a different approach should be adopted in the circumstances of this case, but they do appear to undermine any general suggestion that charging on a dual basis offers any particular advantage to the client in terms of certainty."</span>

Originally, as indicated in paragraph 13 above, the detailed assessment proceeded on the basis that each bill was going to be considered in turn, but that approach was discarded as soon as it became apparent how long this exercise would take. The attempt to persuade me in the skeleton to disallow certain items from individual bills based on points put (without advance warning) to witnesses seems to me wrong, and I therefore do not think it appropriate so to do.</span>

Certainly the absence of any attendance notes will tell against the solicitor, but there can be other evidence. For instance, if the solicitor has failed to keep an attendance note of a conference with counsel, but counsel’s fee note indicates that there was a conference and that it lasted the same length of time as the solicitor claims, then that would normally be acceptable evidence that there was a conference of that duration. In this particular case there are of course time sheets, and the time incurred by both Mr Liptrott and Mr Marriott is recorded thereon. It has been objected that there is no detail as to why a particular meeting took say 5 hours rather than 2 hours, and that of course is true, but that does not seem to me to be justification for disallowing the time simply because there are no detailed attendance notes. </span>

In reaching these conclusions that, on a balance of probability, the meaning and effect of Article 29.2 was explained to Mr Pesskin both on 3 September 1997 and 22 September 1997, I have taken due account of the following further points. In the ordinary course, it would be surprising if a solicitor acting for Mr Pesskin, on such a transaction as the Innisfree investment in the Healthgate Group, did not write to Mr Pesskin recording important points on the draft documentation, including the meaning and effect of Article 29.2 and its potentially draconian consequences. In the present case, the written advice from the Defendants to Mr Pesskin was exiguous in the extreme. The letter of 26 August 1997 from Ms Gestetner, to which I have referred earlier, was extremely brief. There was no letter confirming the advice given at the meeting on 3 September 1997 or which in any way attempted comprehensively to advise Mr Pesskin on the alterations by the Defendants to the travelling draft which they sent to Lovells following that meeting. The absence of such written confirmation of advice was not best practice.

Ms Gestetner’s evidence was that Mr Pesskin preferred communications by telephone or in meetings rather than by letter, and that he did not like to receive detailed letters from the Defendants. She recalled that he said at a meeting that he did not want to be bothered with letters of advice, as he was a lawyer and could read legal documents, and letters only increased costs. Mr Gordon also gave evidence that Mr Pesskin’s preference was that he should ordinarily not receive written advice and correspondence. I accept that evidence. I further accept the evidence of Ms Gestetner that she and Mr Gordon were in the habit of taking Mr Pesskin carefully through each page of the draft documents in meetings, precisely because they were not in the habit of advising him extensively in writing.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">83. Mr Pesskin placed considerable reliance, as I have said, on the absence of any reference to Article 29.2 in the contemporaneous notes of Mr Gordon and Ms Gestetner, whether such notes recorded telephone conversations with Mr Pesskin or discussions at meetings with Mr Pesskin or otherwise. In a case in which, for whatever reason it is not the practice of the solicitor to confirm in writing advice on key points, it would seem, at the least, to be good practice for a solicitor to record such key points in his own notes for same reasons that were stated in 13.04 para 6 of the seventh edition of The Guide to the Professional Conduct of Solicitors which I have quoted above, and which are repeated in the current edition of the Guide. Surprisingly, neither the seventh nor the current edition of the Guide makes any such recommendation. Again, if key points had been recorded by Mr Gordon and Ms Gestetner in the present case, then, on my findings, these proceedings would almost certainly have been avoided."</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">Mr Post suggested that in a case of this nature there is certain routine work which could and should have been delegated to lower charging fee earners which would have reduced the amount of the bills. Mr Fenwick pointed out that delegation does not always achieve the objectives that it is intended to do. Firstly, the person delegating has to explain to the delegated person what is required of him or her, secondly the delegated person has to understand sufficient of the underlying facts to be able to do the job intelligently and economically, and thirdly the person delegating has to check the work done by the delegated person. Mr Fenwick suggested that in this particular case it would not have been cost effective to have delegated, and indeed took a specific example of where it would not have been so effective. This related to the difficulties over the funeral and the headstone raised by Mr Butterfield. Clearly it was not simply a question of ordering flowers for the funeral, it went deeper than that, and Mr Liptrott, with his knowledge of the estate, was probably in a better position to deal with it than to seek to delegate it. Therefore I do not think that the allegation of insufficient delegation can be sustained. </span>

It is a case clearly deserving of an exceptional "B" figure uplift (not that that would be required to justify the value elements charged) and is unquestionably a case deserving even on the most basic of analysis a 75% notional "B" figure.

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">Firstly, the estate was and remains, complex. Primarily consisting of land, there were numerous problems and difficulties which arose in connection with it. There were questions of planning permissions, of options to sell, to mention only two. These were not by any means susceptible to an early resolution, and in my judgment it would have been wrong for the executors to have rushed into winding-up this estate simply "to get if off their hands". They both felt, quite understandably, a great loyalty to Sir Geoffrey and wanted to carry out his wishes as they understood them to be, but, of course, in accordance with their duties as executors. </span>

The first is the "intervention" of Major Reynolds. This is touched on in paragraph 50 above. Major Reynolds of course became the guardian of Lady Hulton, and it is clear that he was zealous to protect her interests in general, and in particular to ensure there was a steady income stream to keep her in the manner to which she had become accustomed during her late husband’s life time. All that is entirely proper and perfectly commendable, but from my reading of the correspondence files it is quite clear that on several occasions Major Reynolds went much beyond that and sought to "interfere" in the administration of the estate. </span>

Two points need to be borne in mind concerning Mr Butterfield’s conduct. The first is that until Lady Hulton’s death he did not have a vested interest, but only a contingent interest in the residuary estate, though the correspondence from him seems to proceed on the basis that he will inevitably become, as indeed he did, entitled to a vested interest, and accordingly that he could behave as if he were already the ultimate beneficiary of that entitlement.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">"6. The relationship between Mr Butterfield and the two defendants has for some reason been very strained. Partly that may be because Mr Butterfield himself is an expert in trust administration, having devoted his whole career to it offshore and therefore he is not the ordinary client or beneficiary prepared to put himself in the hands of his trustees because he knows as much and I think he considers he knows more about the matters in question than they do. By the start of the story as far as I am concerned in September last year one can see the unhappy state of relations by a letter written by Mr Butterfield to Mr Stephen Marriott."</span>

Then, after that hearing, nothing of substance, as I have said, seems to be thought by the parties to be left, and I just have to decide the question of costs. On that history it seems to me that the trustees have not been unreasonable. They have been doing their best to deal with a very difficult beneficiary. They have not been guilty of misconduct. It is extremely unfortunate that the administration of the estate has proved so very difficult but in the period with which I have been concerned that difficulty has been increased many fold by the badgering of the defendants by the beneficiary. I can understand to some extent his frustration but his intervention has only made matters far worse and has not made them better and has caused quite disproportionate amounts in costs to be run up which I am afraid are going to fall upon his trust fund. I repeat I am not concerned with fixing the quantum of the costs, this is a matter for the Costs Judge.</span>

There are certainly an extremely lengthy, albeit draft, opinion of Mr Venables QC, and other important documents which had to be considered, so I place a high value on that aspect of the case.</span>

The estate was being wound up by solicitors local to the land and to the parties, and no great travel, either overseas or indeed in this country, was involved, and that should therefore not attract much by way of addition to the value element.</span>

Clearly if "the client" means Mr Butterfield, then it was extremely important to him, as he made very clear in correspondence from the outset. However, it was equally important in a sense to the executors and to Mr Marriott to ensure that the work was properly carried out, and this should be reflected in the value.</span>

The Court of Appeal in their judgment, in particular the general guidance to the profession given by Lord Justice Longmore, puts at the very head of their list of recommendations the strong advice that, in situations such as this, residuary beneficiaries should be consulted, and of course that was not done in this case. </span>
