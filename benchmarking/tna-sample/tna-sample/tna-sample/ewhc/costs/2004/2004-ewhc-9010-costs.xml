	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">I have before me the bills and supporting papers in eleven cases. All of them concern consent orders made in housing disrepair cases in the Bridgend County Court. Requests for detailed assessment were made to Bridgend County Court in September 2003 and all of these cases were later transferred to the Supreme Court Costs Office for assessment. Accordingly, these cases are now High Court cases and any appeal from my decisions lies to a High Court Judge. I am told that terms of settlement have been agreed in 50 similar cases, that three other cases have gone to trial and were unsuccessful, and that there are approximately 210 cases still pending. It is possible that these eleven cases may be treated as informal test cases which will help parties resolve some of the remaining cases. I heard argument on these cases over two days in January 2004 and then adjourned for another two day appointment commencing 17 May 2004. </span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">Short particulars of cases appear in the first two appendices to this judgment. All of them were funded by way of a CFA agreement claiming a 100% success fee supported by an after the event insurance policy issued by Fastrack Indemnity Ltd. The CFAs in these cases were signed by the Claimants in the months August, September or October 2001. The average period of delay from that date to the date of the letter before claim is just over 44 weeks. The period from the letter before claim to settlement is on average 28 weeks. One of the cases settled in December 2002. All of the other cases settled in the first half of 2003. In all cases the settlement terms included financial compensation varying between £750 to £3,000 (on average £1,631) plus certain repairs already done or agreed to be done, plus reasonable costs. The total of the costs claimed varies between £6,607 and £9,479 (the average being £8,012). That sum includes the success fee, the insurance premium and VAT. Excluding those matters, ie, the amount of base costs excluding VAT, varies between £3,261 and £4,590 (the average being £4,066). All of these cases were fought and concluded before the pre action protocol for housing disrepair cases was published in September 2003. </span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">Of the many points argued before me at the two day hearing this is my judgment on six points which are common to all cases: (i) the enforceability of the CFAs, (ii) the effect in these cases of the availability of legal aid, (iii) the amount of success fee on profit costs, (iv) questions of proportionality, (v) the recoverability of the fees paid to Fastrack Litigation Services Ltd for the housing reports, video evidence and risk assessment reports and, lastly, (vi) the fees paid for surveyors’ reports. </span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">At the hearing I gave judgment on a further point argued before me, the recoverability of VAT on invoices issued by a company or firm variously described as Street Legal UK, 4 Street Legal UK and Street Legal UK Ltd. Such fees appear in only three of the bills (Bowen, Simmons and Austin). Although all of the invoices claim VAT none of them state a VAT number. I took the view that the receiving parties should not be allowed to recover the VAT claimed on these fees. </span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">For the time being I shall not give a final ruling on points which relate to particular cases only. In Austin it appears that the CFA was signed by the client but was not signed by the solicitor. In Farrow the CFA was signed by a Mrs Speight, described as the Claimant’s daughter: it is unclear whether Mr Farrow also signed. In Baker it would appear that the CFA and other documents were not signed by the Claimant (Patricia Baker) but by a Mr Michael Baker who is described in a housing disrepair questionnaire as the husband or partner or the Claimant. The requirement for CFAs to be signed by the client and the legal representative is set out in Regulation 5 of the Conditional Fee Agreements Regulations 2000 ("the CFA Regulations"). Nevertheless the problem in Austin was only spotted during the hearing and the problems in Farrow and Baker were spotted by me after the hearing. Therefore, before making any final rulings on these points, I will give the receiving parties concerned an opportunity for further consideration and argument. </span>

Instructions came to that firm via another company, CMS Investigations Ltd, who had already interviewed the Claimants, all of whom reside in South Wales. CMS Investigations Ltd are said to employ a range of methods by which to contact potential claimants including cold calling and local advertising. As a result of a first interview with a potential claimant, a CMS Investigations representative sends to PD Associates a questionnaire completed in manuscript and a video recording of the items of disrepair relied on. PD Associates would then sift these cases into three categories, "yes", "no" and "further information required". The cases in the "no" category are simply returned to CMS Investigations Ltd with an indication that PD Associates are not prepared to take them on. Cases in the "further information required" would be resifted after the further information had been obtained. That information might be as to the date of commencement of a particular tenancy or as to the person or persons to whom the tenancy had been granted. </span>

The CMS representative makes a second call upon the intending claimant, checks that the questionnaire answers are correct, checks that the client wishes to proceed and gives the information said to be required by Regulation 4 of the CFA Regulations. For this latter purpose a two page document is read out to the intended claimant whereupon the form is dated and both the CMS representative and the intended claimant signs it. The intended claimant also signs the CFA agreement with PD Associates, an insurance proposal to Fastrack Indemnity Ltd and an application for a disbursement funding loan with First National Bank Ltd. </span>

A representative from PD Associates will then contact the intending client by telephone in order to repeat the Regulation 4 advice, to assess the risk involved and, no doubt deal with any other matters the intending client raises. In each of the cases before me the representative in question has been one or other of the two partners in the firm PD Associates, Mr Davis or Ms McGlinchey. </span>

Ms McGlinchey invites me to deduce from this that at the second interview by the CMS Investigation representative, the representative telephoned PD Associates and so the Regulation 4 information was given by the CMS representative and then by the solicitor, both on the same day. That explanation works if one further assumes that, when the solicitor later received the CFA signed by the client, she signed it and then backdated it to the same date as the date of the telephone conversation. </span>

However the solicitor’s date of signing is shown as 20 August 2001 a date which also appears on the two page document recording the telephone conversation between solicitor and client.

The true position is as Mr Goodbody described it. Ms McGlinchey’s witness statement is inaccurate to the extent that it disagrees with Mr Goodbody’s account. In cases in which the solicitor’s telephone interview takes place before the solicitor receives the CFA signed by the client, the costs of the telephone interview are not recoverable. There is nothing in the CFA to suggest that it can operate retrospectively. On a few occasions the solicitors have been willing to backdate documents incorrectly. On more occasions the costs draftsman has been willing to backdate the claim for costs incorrectly. On one occasion (in Bowen) Mr Davis has backdated a document to an impossible date. 20 August 2001 is more than two weeks before the date shown on the manuscript copy of the housing disrepair questionnaire which is said to have been prepared by the CMS Investigations representative on first interviewing Ms Bowen. </span>

The effect of the Policy is that if you lose your case, the Policy will cover our Disbursements to a maximum of £5000 and your Opponent’s costs and disbursements. The maximum cover is £50,000. We shall attempt to recover the premium from you opponent, if you win your case, but the Court may disallow it in whole or in part. In such circumstances your loan for the Policy premium, disbursements (if applicable) and any interest and charges due and payable by you in respect of your loan will be deducted from your damages (compensation). In any event, the Court will not allow you to recover interest on any loan taken out to purchase the Policy even if you win your case. Such interest will be deducted from your compensation if you win. If you lose your case then any loan (including interest) taken out to purchase the premium for the Policy and disbursements (if applicable) is covered by the Policy and you will not be called upon to pay the same; provided that you have complied with the terms and conditions of the Policy.</span>

The proposal to take out a policy is apparently made with Legal Direct Ltd. The policy is administered by Fastrack Indemnity Ltd. The representative who first shows this draft agreement and other documents to the intending claimant is employed by CMS Investigations Ltd. In all of the cases before me clause H of the CFA describes the premium as being for the sum of £729.75 in fact, a premium of this size was paid only in three cases (Jones, Austin and Wintle). In four other cases the insurance policy stipulated a higher premium all of which was paid (Simmons, Baker, Pritchard and Mellish). In the remaining four cases the insurance policy stipulated for a premium of £729.75 but only £519.75 was paid (Bowen, Owen, Farrow and Pace). </span>

It therefore seems appropriate to infer that, in the last four cases I mentioned, either the solicitor failed to obtain authority to issue proceedings or, if authority was obtained, the underwriters waived payment of the second instalment. In the four cases I mentioned as having a higher premium, the premium is payable (and was paid) in one instalment immediately upon completion of the CFA agreement. </span>

First the form of CFA used leaves space for a success fee percentage to be inserted in Schedule 1 even though Clause E, as printed, specifies it to be 100%. Secondly this part of the schedule was left blank in five of the cases (Bowen, Owen, Pritchard, Austin and Pace). In another five cases a figure has been inked in, using the same colour ink as the solicitor who countersigned the agreement (Jones, Simmons, Farrow, Baker and Wintle). In the remaining case (Mellish) the figure 90% has been typed into schedule 1 even though in that case, as in all the other cases, clause E shows a success fee percentage of 100%. </span>

Clause E of the agreement states that the client "cannot recover from your opponent the part of the success fee that relates to the cost to us of postponing receipt of our charges and disbursements (as set out at paragraphs (a) and (b) at schedule 1). This part of the success fee remains payable by you." However, it is not possible to tell from schedule 1 what part of the success fee is attributable to paragraphs (a) and (b). This aspect of schedule 1 contrasts substantially with schedule 1 to the Law Society model. The Law Society model is as follows:</span>

Beside each factor is a box in which either the answer yes or no can be given. If the answer yes is given there is another box into which may be recorded the percentage success fee appropriate because of this factor. On all forms the boxes beside the first three factors are pre printed with percentages totalling 40% (Bowen, Owen, Farrow and Pace) or 50% (Jones, Austin and Wintle). On all forms six or more of the other boxes are completed in manuscript with values bringing the total risk assessment value to 100% or more. That this was likely to happen appears to be indicated by a sentence pre printed towards the end of the form which states:</span>

However, he says that while publicly funded legal services are theoretically available to those who need them they are not in practice available. It is to my knowledge, as the Designated Civil Judge for South and West Wales that there are numbers of solicitor’s firms practising in the Welsh Valleys who undertake community funded work. Evidently these firms have not offered their services to the tenants. What seemed to me to be more significant is that the tenants have not felt the need to approach them for those services, even though these firms are close at hand and well known in their localities …"</span>

He confirms that the Regulation 4 advice was given to each Claimant on two occasions before the CFA was concluded, once by the CMS representative and then again by a solicitor. He warned me against treating the CMS oral advice and explanation form as if it were a script. However that document and the attendance record of the telephone interview were both good evidence that the Regulation 4 advice had been given and had been given properly. In his submission I should be slow to go behind these documents. On behalf of Ms McGlinchey, who was sitting next to him, he stated that she had on occasions advised intending claimants to use legal aid rather than this scheme. In fact of course most claimants had only become claimants because of the approach made by the CMS representative and, therefore, inertia often kept them within the Fastrack scheme. Once within the umbrella of its arrangements most clients were content to stay within it. </span>

He counselled me not to be over picky as to compliance with the requirement to give written advice if satisfied that proper oral advice had been given and accepted. He produced to me (but not to Mr Hogan) a document which I am told is used in the solicitors’ office by way of an aid memoire when conducting a telephone interview with a client. This document poses questions such as "do you have legal expenses insurance?" and "are you a member of a trade union". It also invites the fee earner to describe the "pay as you go" system and "legal aid". I shall save to the next point his detailed comments as to availability and suitability of legal aid.</span>

However, there were many other cases in which the solicitors had undertaken work and investigated claims without commencing them. Also it was likely that the solicitor’s base fees in the three failed cases would be very much larger than the base fees in any three successful cases. It was accepted that possession of a housing disrepair questionnaire which had been checked was of advantage and that, in some cases, the possession of video evidence might also be of help. However, in his submission, the primary risk for the solicitors in these cases was that the tenants may not have given prior notice of disrepair to their landlords. Other risks were the danger that the landlord might undertake repairs. Such repairs might derail a case which had not begun. Also they might cause a case to be allocated to the small claims track thereby preventing the client obtaining substantial recovery of costs from the landlord.

Allowing one hour for local travel, the other hour would represent time spent visiting the premises and then preparing and correcting the report later.

In Mr Goodbody’s submission the surveyor’s report was necessary at an early stage in order to assist the solicitors complete the allocation questionnaire.

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">In my judgment PD Associates and their agents have failed to comply with the obligations placed upon them by Regulation 4(2)(c) (whether the solicitor considers the client has existing insurance). Paragraph (d) of the oral advice and explanation (see para 37 above) wrongly places on the client the responsibility for considering the insurance questions. In the CFA, which is signed by the client on the same date that he signs the oral advice and explanation form, clause H falsely suggests that the client is already bound to take out insurance with Fastrack Indemnity Ltd. Because of that clause J(e) wrongly states that the solicitors or their agents are "unable to discuss … other legal expenses policies" and Schedule 2 of the CFA suggests the possibility of the client seeking "independent legal advice in this regard". Mr Goodbody is correct to say that I should consider what oral advice was given to the client and, if I find that sufficient, I should pay little heed to the incorrect written advice that was supplied. However, the Claimants put before me no evidence which suggests that the oral advice given is likely to have been any better than the written information supplied. Indeed, the fact that a record of the oral advice given by the CMS representative is, in each case, signed and dated indicates to me the importance which I should attach to it. </span>

The mistakes and failings in the written documents which I have already described in relation to Regulation 4(2)(c) also apply here. The Claimants give me no reason to think that the CMS representative would have given a tolerable explanation of the availability of legal aid to these Claimants. It is, theoretically, possible that the solicitor may have given such an explanation in the telephone interview despite the mistakes made in the CFA and in the thank you letter reference to legal aid. The requirement to give impartial advice on legal expenses insurance and on legal aid where relevant is or ought to be obvious to every solicitor given its inclusion in the Solicitor’s Costs Information and Client Care Code.

However, the interview records produced in these cases are far too brief and too generalised to be of any real assistance to me. In these eleven cases, there is nothing in the attendance records of the telephone interviews which assists PD Associates to prove that proper advice was given. The words "legal aid" nowhere appear in those records. In nine of the cases no matters arising are recorded. In the remaining two cases brief notes are recorded concerning health problems (Jones) or concerning the client’s desire to speak to a relative (Farrow).</span>

It has brought them into the Fastrack scheme which, in ways I shall explain hereafter, has exposed them to unreasonably high and disproportionate expenses the costs of which are not covered by the insurance obtained. That cost has been arranged by means of a loan account charging interest at 13.9% per annum. The unrecovered expenses and the interest payable under the loan are likely to consume most if not all the monetary compensation these Claimants obtained.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">The proper test for me to apply here is whether the Claimants acted reasonably in instructing a solicitor on CFA terms with insurance rather than instructing a legal aid solicitor. If their choice of funding was reasonable, the reasonable costs they incur would be recoverable even if it would lead to extra expense for the Defendant. I should not approach this topic by considering whether a legally aided solicitor could reasonably have conducted these cases (</span>

	      <span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt"> (1990) 154 J.P.654, DC). In my judgment the choice made by these Claimants to participate in the Fastrack scheme was not reasonable. The advantages which Mr Goodbody claimed for the scheme are not made out. PD Associates have not shown themselves to be adept at conducting housing disrepair cases. The Claimants have not obtained a swifter solution to their disrepair problems than the legal aid system would have permitted. The form filling and reporting requirements under the Fastrack scheme are similar to those in the legal aid scheme. I have in mind here various parts of the ATE policy including item VII, the definition of approved settlements, exclusion H and conditions 1 and 2. The avoidance of having to make legal aid contributions is academic given the financial resources of these Claimants. The last advantage suggested, insurance protection of use particularly where a claimant fails to beat a payment into court, is negated by the fact that unrecovered items of costs and unrecovered interest on the disbursement loan will dissipate most if not all of any monetary compensation even if no payments into court are made. For these and other reasons I have already stated that these Claimants should have been advised to rely upon legal aid. </span>

One of the circumstances which may cut it down is the consideration that the cost of instructing a solicitor of the client’s choice (and protecting the client from the risk of paying the other side’s costs) is disproportionate to the value of the proposed claim when an alternative, reasonable, method of advancing the client’s interests with the help of an appropriately qualified lawyer is available."</span>

In my judgment that risk must be minimised in these cases given that, on two occasions, a CMS representative has called upon the Claimant and compiled or reviewed a housing disrepair questionnaire which specifically deals with this point. Nevertheless, in the absence of any other information which is particular to these cases, my expectation is they are likely to be more risky than RTA cases.

I am also of the view that it was unreasonable to incur base costs exceeding £1,000 excluding VAT before sending off a letter before claim. In valuing the benefit gained I would take into account the costs of repairs including notional VAT thereon. Had proportionality been the only preliminary decision I had to make I would now proceed to assess the bills applying the dual test of necessity as well as reasonableness to all items. In fact of course this is not the only preliminary decision I must make. On the basis of the other decisions included in this judgment the question of proportionality has become academic. I have already disallowed all profit costs and unpaid disbursements (eg counsel’s fees and costs draftsman’s fees). I am about to disallow certain paid disbursements (see below). According to my arithmetic the costs which may be allowed in any of the eleven bills before me cannot now exceed £1,000 plus the costs of the detailed assessment. The largest remaining bill is in Bowen (£853.75 including court fees of £430, Street Legal’s fee of £130 and a surveyor’s fee). The smallest bill is in Jones (£323.75 including a court fee of £30 and a surveyor’s fee).

In my judgment the Claimants are not contractually bound to pay these fees. This work would have been done whether or not the Claimants had decided to proceed with their claims. There is not the glimmer of a suggestion in any of the documents that I have seen that the Claimants were ever told of these expenses or ever agreed that their liability to pay fees would be retrospective. In his arguments in support of these fees Mr Goodbody dwelt upon their value in the progress of the claims. In doing so he failed to address what is always the preliminary issue in any detailed assessment, the indemnity principle. I must first look at the cost of this work to the Claimants.

The arguments in relation to those fees are set out in paragraphs [341 to 373]. I would particularly draw attention to paragraph [367]. In that case Master Hurst disallowed the fees claimed because the clients had never expressly or impliedly authorised the solicitor to incur them (para [379]). For completeness I should add, although this is not relevant in the cases before me, that Master Hurst also ruled the payments to AIL to be illegal referral fees and therefore irrecoverable for that reason.</span>

It certainly cannot be said that, in cases such as these no reasonable claimant properly advised would have commissioned a surveyor’s report so early. Although they are experts’ reports the strictures on expert evidence in the Practice Direction on Protocols do not apply to them: had any of these cases gone to trial I am sure that further expert evidence would have been obtained then and that evidence might well have been from a single joint expert. I accept that PD Associates’ letter style and actions were aggressive and war-like throughout. However, I do not think that is, by itself, sufficient to render unreasonable an item of costs which is otherwise reasonable. (For the avoidance of doubt, I should make clear that I express no opinion on the reasonableness of early surveyors’ reports in cases which are governed by the pre action protocol for housing disrepair.) </span>
