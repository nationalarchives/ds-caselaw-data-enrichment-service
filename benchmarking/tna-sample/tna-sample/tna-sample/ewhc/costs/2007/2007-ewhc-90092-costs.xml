	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The issue in both these cases is whether the Claimant, who was represented by Thompsons under a CCFA, is entitled to recover the full ATE insurance premium of £7,297.50 (inclusive of IHT), as claimed in the respective bills of costs, or some lower figure as contended for by the respective Defendants.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">For convenience, in the rest of this judgment the first case will be referred to as “the Winmill case”, and the second case as “the Pearson case”.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In the Winmill case a District Judge in Sheffield has assessed the Claimant’s bill, sought in the sum of some £86,000 odd, but reduced substantially (because the District Judge applied the necessity test), save only for this one item, which he sent to the SCCO for determination.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Whilst I can well understand the wish of the District Judge that this issue should be heard in the SCCO, I am unconvinced that it is entirely appropriate for a detailed assessment to be carried out partly in one court, and partly in another. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">For instance, in this case the District Judge decided that, on the face of it, the bill for £86,000 was disproportionate, and applied the necessity test.   In the event the Defendant, through Mr Brown, does not contest the Claimant’s right to payment of a sum for the ATE premium, but, if that concession had not been made, I would have been faced with the unenviable task of deciding whether such a payment was “necessary”, or, whether indeed I was bound by the District Judge’s ruling, that the bill as a whole was disproportionate.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It seems to me that where a point of principle is identified, even as late as the start of the detailed assessment proceedings in the County Court, the whole assessment should normally be transferred to the SCCO, if that is what the parties wish, as indeed happened in the Pearson case. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In that case I was told that the parties have reached agreement on everything, save for this insurance premium point.   It is perhaps interesting to note that the Claimant’s bill in that case was claimed at some £38,000 less than in the Winmill case.   Apart from the issue of the ATE premium, the costs have been agreed at £26,200.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In the Winmill case the Claimant had been employed by the Defendant since 5 August 1974.   From that date, until about 1991, he was employed as a gardener, working in the Defendant’s amenities and leisure department.   In about 1991 he was appointed a charge hand.    In the course of his employment with the Defendant, since 1974 the Claimant had undertaken general gardening duties, including cutting grass and hedges.   In order to undertake those tasks the Claimant was required to use petrol hedge trimmers, stoic rotary mowers, Hayter Condor grass cutters, strimmers, half moon edgers and mount filled petrol mowers.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Additionally, his duties included inserting stakes for trees, which required the use of a pod hammer, as well as digging, which required the use of jack hammers.   All those tools vibrated, or imparted vibration, to the Claimant’s hands.    One or more of these tools were used on most days.    The Claimant would use the tools for up to eight hours per day. </p>

One major insurer in particular offering a potentially competitive package, made it clear that the advertised premium structure would not be made available for union cases.  They would quote specific premiums but required extensive information before doing so.   This is an important point as I am aware that Defendants have sought to persuade courts on assessments that cheaper alternatives were available but have not produced the full scheme documentation for analysis by the court and the Claimant’s representatives.   Certainly, no alternative can be properly considered by the courts without detailed consideration of all of this documentation.    One thing I learned quite quickly was that, in respect of ATE insurance, it is crucial to cut through the headlines and advertising gloss and focus on the small print details.</p>

They had negotiated with UIA an insurance product specifically for trade union supported cases.   They had been able to negotiate an impressive insurance product as it was potentially an attractive option for insurers to have the opportunity to provide insurance in many thousands of trade union cases.    In the same way that a trade union can negotiate a collective agreement with an employer far more effectively than an individual union member can negotiate individually, likewise ULSAAS could negotiate appropriate policies on a collective basis.    Having said that, the market for after the event (ATE) insurance has been ‘hard’ for some time such that block purchasing is not necessarily an advantage in such circumstances.   In this respect I was aware of the Judgment of the Court of Appeal in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Callery</span> and the reference at paragraph 68 to Master O’Hare’s investigation of the market and his finding that results had been universally poor over several years leading to major premium increases over those years.</p>

Additionally, it was of very significant importance that UIA were prepared to quote a premium structure in line with Accident Line Protect and yet which covered existing cases as well as new cases.

Accordingly, I was in the position of trying to find insurance for cases which had not been insured at the outset.   This was not at all an attractive proposition for insurers.  Indeed, as Lord Woolf had outlined, it was not at all clear that cover would be available for such cases.   It is important to note that some such case would be very advanced indeed.    There may, for example, be multiple parties, money in court, liability and quantum in issue, conflicting evidence and a hearing listed for several days or weeks with potential liability for costs up to or exceeding £100,000.   Clearly, there would be more straightforward cases but the basket of cases would be high risk and potentially uninsurable as highlighted by Lord Woolf. </p>

For example, in one scheme providing for insurance of ongoing cases, the premium was to be quoted by the insurer but the solicitor was contractually bound to accept that quote whatever it might be.   This was because the scheme required exclusivity from the solicitor, ie the solicitor had to insure all cases with that insurer.   Consequently, even if the insurer quoted an astronomical premium in an ongoing case, the solicitor would be in breach of contract if he sought a quote elsewhere.   He would have contracted to act unprofessionally in that he would be bound to take up a policy for his client at whatever premium the insurer quoted whether reasonable, unreasonable, excessive or otherwise.</p>

The £800 and £950 premiums where cases settle before allocation equated to the Law Society premiums of £775 and £975 respectively.    The UIA premiums applied to both new and ongoing cases.   The Law Society premiums applied only to cases insured at the outset. </p>

Again the figures are almost identical, ie the total premium is then £5,800 and £6,950 under the UIA scheme and £5,775 and £6,975 under the Law Society scheme.    Again, the UIA scheme is a considerable improvement on the Law Society scheme in that the UIA premiums apply to ongoing cases but the Law Society premiums are limited to cases insured at the outset. </p>

This remains the case and is entirely consistent with the comments of Lord Woolf summarising the evidence in Callery.   Not only did UIA uniquely offer such a structure, they did so at rates which in practice were the same as the Law Society quoted for new cases.   I considered that to be very impressive indeed and had no hesitation in recommending the UIA scheme.”</p>

This lead him to conclude that a starting point the premium was reasonable.   We do not consider it correct start with Master O Hares presumption.  When considering whether a premium is reasonable, the Court must have regard to such evidence as there is or knowledge that experience has provided of the relationship between premium and risk and also the cost of alternative cover available.   As time progresses this task should become easier.  In the present case it is not easy as both data and experience are sparce.”   In the masters case at Paragraph 17 “this case it points out that four years have passed since Callery v Gray and that the task has become easier as experience grows and District Judge Spencer is an experienced District Judge.

A number of policies would have been available but I specifically refer to the IOMA Insurance Company policy that at that time charged a premium of £1,000 plus IPT for £50,000 of cover for industrial disease cases and if the case required the cover to be increased to £100,000 the additional premium charged was £1,500 to £2,000.

It should be noted that whilst some cases may need substantial cover of £100,000 when assigned to the multi-track this is by no means always the case and no assessment of the individual needs relative to insurance appears to have been undertaken for this case.    The option of having initial cover of up to £50,000 and only adding to this should the specific case warrant it appears not have been considered or if it was considered no detailed reasons have been provided as to why this specific case warranted the level of cover obtained at the premium of £6,950 plus IPT. </p>

Whilst this may well be true, to suggest that only Thompsons fulfilled the professional duty to clients as against the work done by the many thousands of other firms of solicitors handling personal injury cases and using ATE insurance from the insurers and schemes available at that time at much reduced cost is not reasonable. </p>

District judges and costs judges do not, as Lord Hoffmann observed in <span style="font-style:italic">Callery v Gray (Nos 1 and 2)</span> [2002] UKHL 28 at [44]; [2002] 1 WLR 2000, have the expertise to judge the reasonableness of a premium except in very broad brush terms, and the viability of the ATE market will be imperilled if they regard themselves (without the assistance of expert evidence) as better qualified than the underwriter to rate the financial risk the insurer faces.  Although the claimant very often does not have to pay the premium himself, this does not mean that there are no competitive or other pressures at all in the market.  As the evidence before this court shows, it is not in an insurer’s interest to fix a premium at a level which will attract frequent challenges.”</p>

However, I can see no basis upon which the Court can realistically be expected to conduct an enquiry into whether the negotiations conducted by ULSAAS were properly conducted and did result in a fair level of premiums generally.

He decided that the evidence before him clearly indicated that products were available from a range of companies for cheaper premiums providing the same amount of cover, including the self-insurance aspects of it.

In the case considered by the Court of Appeal the third staging took place sixty days before trial and would only be triggered in 5% of cases.  At that stage the premium was assessed by reference to the specific risks involved in the case.   This contrasts sharply with the staging in the present case which escalates dramatically at the allocation stage without any reference to the risks in the individual case.  The initial premium of £950 was not of itself, it is submitted, exceptionally low, and whereas the Defendants in <span style="font-weight:bold">Rogers</span> had the benefit of low premiums (£450 plus £900) up to sixty days before trial, such benefit from staging did not accrue to the Defendants in this case.

Was it appropriate that the Claimant entered into this particular agreement.   Did the Claimant’s solicitors asses his needs, did they consider whether he had any pre-existing BTE and where the full checks carried out.   Did indeed the Claimant get offered alternatives.   If not why not or is it the case that there is a financial or mutually beneficial relationship between the claimant’s solicitors and or union and the insurers.  Within the statement it is shown clearly that there were alternatives and while the Claimant say that they have not utilised a block rate, how is the premium calculated if it is not on a block of risk.   There has been no individual rating of the Claimant nor the Claimant’s needs and while this premium might suit one Claimant it might not suit another. </p>

If his claim is successful the fees, including the amount of the uplift, will be payable by the defendant’s liability insurers.   If his claim is unsuccessful, nothing will be due from him to his solicitor under the agreement.   Likewise with the premium payable for the after the event insurance:   if the claim is successful, the premium will be payable by the other side’s liable to the insurers.

District judges and costs judges do not, as Lord Hoffmann observed in <span style="font-style:italic">Callery v Gray (Nos 1 and 2)</span> [2002] UKHL 28 at [44]; [2002] 1 WLR 2000, have the expertise to judge the reasonableness of a premium except in very broad brush terms, and the viability of the ATE market will be imperilled if they regard themselves (without the assistance of expert evidence) as better qualified than the underwriter to rate the financial risk the insurer faces.  Although the claimant very often does not have to pay the premium himself, this does not mean that there are no competitive or other pressures at all in the market.  As the evidence before this court shows, it is not in an insurer’s interest to fix a premium at a level which will attract frequent challenges.”</p>

But we do not think that is right.  If the court concludes that it was <span style="font-style:italic">necessary </span>to incur the staged premium, then as this court’s judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Lownds </span>shows, it should be adjudged a proportionate expense.  Necessity here is, we think, not some absolute litmus test.  It may be demonstrated by the application of strategic considerations which travel beyond the dictates of the particular case.  Thus it may include, as we are persuaded it does, the unavoidable characteristics of the market in insurance of this kind.  It does so because this very market is integral to the means of providing access to justice in civil disputes in what may be called the post-legal aid world.</p>

The very recognition that justice requires a use of resources that is proportionate to what is at stake implies the rightness of a strategic approach.  There can be no touchstone of a proportionate use of resources so understood, without an eye to the context in which any such resources are expended.  Once it is concluded that the ATE staged premium here was necessarily incurred, principle and pragmatism together compel the conclusion that it was a proportionate expense.  We turn therefore to the question whether the ATE staged premium was necessarily incurred.”</p>

If it had been, then clearly more enquiries would probably have had to have been carried out.</p>
