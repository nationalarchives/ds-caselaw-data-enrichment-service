Naturally she had to find alternative employment and it would appear from the evidence which she gave, that her prospects of successfully obtaining such a post with Irwin Mitchell were enhanced by the prospect that she would bring with her a basket of cases which could no longer be handled by KSB after they wound up that arm of their business.</p>

She believes that most of these were “sold” to an organisation in the North of England.  Whether or not that is right it is quite clear from her evidence, and this is accepted on behalf of the Defendant, that just under 50 cases (probably 47) were, as it were, offered to Ms Craig to take with her to her new employer.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Accordingly Ms Craig was offered and accepted employment with Irwin Mitchell which started early in July 2004.  It began with three days’ induction, I believe at Irwin Mitchell’s Sheffield office, at which Ms Craig was introduced into the ethos of the firm’s practice.  She does not recollect during the course of that induction course being taken through the form of CFA which Irwin Mitchell used and which as Mr Mallalieu demonstrated during his cross-examination of Ms Craig, differs somewhat from what might perhaps be called the standard form of CFA then in general use.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">However Ms Craig believes that it was made clear to her in general terms that where a CFA was brought into force to cover a claimant in a personal injury case’s costs it would be emphasised that the client should be told that in practice, whatever the documents might say, that client would not be charged any shortfall on costs not recovered from the other side.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">What unfortunately did not happen during the period between November 2003 and July 2004 was any communication between KSB and Irwin Mitchell as to the transfer of the benefit of any BTE insurance which clients such as the Claimant in this case had.  This is clearly a contributory cause of the problem that has arisen in this case.</p>

Firstly it warned the Claimant that, unless he co-operated by giving Ms Modha the relevant information, there was a very real danger that Motor Law would withdraw their indemnity and indeed the letter says in its pre-penultimate paragraph that unless a reply is received by 31 March 20043 (clearly that is a mis-type for 2004) the writer would advise Motor Law to withdraw their indemnity.</p>

Motor Law had also agreed to indemnify, that is to discharge any liability you ay have had in respect of your opponent’s costs.  What this means is should the unlikely event arise where you were not able to recover your legal costs from the other side you are ordered to pay the other side’s legal costs, under the agreement with Motor Law you would have been entitled to ask them to pay them, unless you had breached your policy terms.  I have not seen the original policy so I am not able to advise you in this regard (please see KSB Claim’s letter dated 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2001).  I do however know that Motor Law were subsequently taken over by the Accident Group who are now in liquidation.  I am concerned therefore that you will be left without cover from this date forward in respect of your legal costs.  If you would like to query this further please liaise direct with KSB Claims as I have no further information.

She is possibly not going to want to take the risk of being exposed to costs whatsoever, even though the risk is small and then if at the end of the day she was exposed to the Defendant’s costs, and/or Irwin Mitchell’s costs then it would be her that has to cover them and then she could seek to obtain them from Motor Law Limited and KSB Claims.  In the circumstances, it is important to find out what exactly was agreed to and what exactly the client was entitled to previously and as a practical way forward it would not be unethical to offer the Claimant an alternative method of fund that was ‘more certain’.  Is it possible for KSB Claims to contract out of the Claimant’s right to the benefit of an insurance policy even if they paid for it?  It appears in any event that the Claimant has agreed to be bound by Motor Law Limited’s policies by implication as set out in the client care letter.</p>

The court did not say ‘has the departure had a materially adverse effect on the client’.  The focus on the adverse effect was on the <span style="font-style:italic">protection</span> afforded to the client, not whether, as a matter of fact, the client had actually suffered any prejudice.  In his skeleton argument, Mr Morgan illustrates the difference by reference to burglar alarms.  A person is protected against burglaries if he installs a burglar alarm, whether or not anyone attempts to burgle his home.  If a burglary does take place, then an inquiry into the protection he had will focus on the quality of the burglar alarm, the fact of the burglary merely being evidence that the protection was not as good as it might have been.  By analogy, he is protected against buying a poor insurance policy if measures which are intended to help him avoid doing so are implemented.  He might buy the policy despite these measures, and he might avoid buying it even if such measures are not taken.  Neither of these facts is relevant to whether he had ‘protection’.</p>

The starting point must be the language of section 58(1) and (3) of the 1990 Act.  It is clear and uncompromising:  if one or more of the applicable conditions is not satisfied, then the CFA is unenforceable.  Parliament could have adopted a different model.  It could, for example have provided that where an applicable condition is not satisfied, the CFA will only be enforceable with the permission of the court or upon such terms as the court thinks fit.  There is nothing inherently improbable in a statutory scheme which provides that, if the applicable conditions are not satisfied, the CFA shall be unenforceable with the consequence that the solicitor will not be entitled to payment for his services.  Such a scheme can yield harsh results in certain circumstances, especially if the client has not suffered any actual loss as a result of the breach.  It can also produce results which, at first sight, may seem odd:  see the point made by Mr Bacon mentioned at para 26 above.  But the scheme is designed to protect clients and to encourage solicitors to comply with detailed statutory requirements which are clearly intended to achieve that purpose.  The fact that it may produce harsh or surprising results in individual cases is not necessarily a good reason for construing the statutory provisions in such a way as will avoid such results.</p>

Thus, in <span style="font-style:italic">Wilson v First County Trust Ltd (No.2) </span>[2003] UKHL 40, [2004] 1 AC 816, the House of Lords was concerned with a claim based on a loan agreement between a pawnbroker and a borrower.  The pawnbroker sought repayment of the loan.  Relying on section 127(3) of the Consumer Credit Act 1974, the borrower claimed that the loan was unenforceable because the agreement did not contain all the prescribed terms.  This was a harsh result for the pawnbroker, since the borrower could not point to any prejudice suffered by her as a result of the failure to include all the prescribed terms in the agreement.  Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead said:</p>

He loses all his rights under the agreement, including his rights to any security which has been lodged.  Conversely, the borrower acquires what can only be described as a windfall.  He keeps the money and recovers his security.  These consequences apply just as much were the lender was acting in good faith throughout and the error was due to a mistaken reading of the complex statutory requirements as in cases of deliberate non-compliance.  These consequences also apply where, as in the present case, the borrower suffered no prejudice as a result of the non-compliance as they do where the borrower was misled.  Parliament was painting here with a broad brush.</p>

The Moneylenders Act 1927 adopted a similarly severe approach.  Infringement of statutory requirements rendered the loan and any security unenforceable.  So did the Hire Purchase Act 1965, although to a lesser extent.  This approach was roundly condemned in the Crowther report (Report of the Committee on Consumer Credit, under the presidency of Lord Crowther, March 1971) (Cmnd 4596) vol I, p311, para 6.11.4:</p>

This course is open to Parliament even though this will sometimes yield a seemingly unreasonable result in a particular case.  Considered overall, this course may well be a proportionate response in practice to a perceived social problem.  Parliament may consider the response should be a uniform solution across the board.  A tailor-made response, fitting the facts of each case as decided in an application to the court, may not be appropriate.  This may be considered an insufficient incentive and insufficient deterrent.  And it may fail to protect consumers adequately …’</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:0.79in">30.<marker name="tab"/>In our view, this is the approach which should be adopted in relation to section 58(1) and (3) of the 1990 Act.  To use the words of Lord Nicholls, Parliament was painting with a broad brush.  It must be taken to have deliberately decided not to distinguish between cases of non-compliance which are innocent and those which are negligent or committed in bath faith, nor between those which cause prejudice (in the sense of actual loss) and those which do not.  It would have been open to Parliament to distinguish between such cases, but it chose not to do so.  The conditions stated in section 58(3)(c) and in particular the requirements prescribed in the Regulations are for the protection of solicitors’ clients.  Parliament considered that the need to safeguard the interests of clients was so important that it should be secured by providing that, if any of the conditions were not satisfied, the CFA would not be enforceable and the solicitor would not be paid.  To use the words of Lord Nicholls again, this is an approach of punishing solicitors pour encourager les autres.  Such a policy is tough, but it is not irrational.  The public interest in protecting solicitors’ clients required that the satisfaction of the statutory conditions was an essential prerequisite to the enforcement of CFAs.  It is to be noted that in September 2000, the Lord Chancellor issued a consultation paper entitled ‘Conditional fees:  Sharing the Risks of Litigation’.  The Law Society and the Senior Costs Judge responded that the Law Society’s new Client Care Code adequately covered the need to provide additional information about CFAs.  But in the view of Government such was the need to ensure client protection that this response was not accepted.</p>

Thus, literal but trivial and immaterial departures from the statutory requirements did not amount to a failure to satisfy the statutory conditions.  It is unnecessary to decide whether the test stated at para 107 was no more than an application of the principle that the law is not concerned with very small things.”</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Equally I think it is reasonable to infer that Irwin Mitchell would expect her to either settle or put the cases which she brought with her, so to speak, on to a clear financial footing at the earliest possible time and such pressure could easily cause her to overlook certain points such as, for instance, advising the client about the client’s right to rely on Regulation 6 of the Insurance Companies (Legal Expenses and Insurance) Regulations 1990 by insisting that the insurers allowed Irwin Mitchell to conduct the case under the BTE policy.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As the amounts claimed under Parts 1 and 2 of the bill are much less than that claimed in Part 3 it is to be hoped that the parties can agree on a figure in respect of those costs so that perhaps when this judgment is formally handed down the matter can be resolved without the further expense which would be involved if the matter has to be remitted to Costs Officer Martin to deal with the assessment of these relatively small parts of the bill.</p>
