	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I would summarise general point 3 in these terms.  The Claimant says that he instructed the Defendant to act on condition that costs were kept within a cap of £20,000, that the Defendant accepted instructions on that basis, expressly confirming that total costs would not exceed that amount, and that there was never any agreement to vary that figure.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Alternatively, the Claimant having provided the Defendant with “clear and precise instructions” that costs should be kept to the maximum of £20,000, the Defendant confirmed in writing that it would be able to take the matters to the end of trial well within that figure.  In doing so, the Defendant provided an estimate of costs upon which the Claimant relied.  Subsequent increased estimates were simply attempts to justify an increase over the original and no adequate explanation for the very substantial increase in costs has been given.  Accordingly, the Claimant submits that any costs incurred above the original estimate are unreasonable and irrecoverable.  The Claimant refers to <span style="font-style:italic">Mastercigars Direct Ltd v Withers LLP</span> [2007] EWHC 2733 (Ch), <span style="font-style:italic">Reynolds v Stone Rowe Brewer (a firm) </span>[2008] EWHC 497 (QB), <span style="font-style:italic">Leigh v Michelin Tyre plc </span>[2003] EWCA Civ 1766 and <span style="font-style:italic">Wong v Vizards</span> [1997] No 2 Costs LR 46.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Points of Dispute also argue that, in failing to comply with the Solicitor’s Code of Conduct 2007 (in particular its requirements for the provision of costs information) the Defendant leaves itself open to the argument that “a breach of the … code can render a retainer unenforceable and/or illegal”.  By reference to <span style="font-style:italic">Garbutt v Edwards</span> [2005] EWCA Civ 1206) the Defendant argues that the Court has a discretion to disallow costs on the basis of “a complete breach of the indemnity principle”.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In its Replies to the Points of Dispute the Defendant says that this point is misconceived; this is not the forum within which to raise regulatory matters, and the reference to <span style="font-style:italic">Garbutt</span> is misconceived. I do not (as I have been invited to do) read into that Reply any implicit admission that there has actually been any breach of professional standards.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The suggestion that the contract of retainer is unenforceable was not actively pursued in submissions.  I am unaware of any sound basis for reaching that conclusion: <span style="font-style:italic">Garbutt </span>does not support it. In <span style="font-style:italic">Mastercigars</span> (at paragraphs 107-111) Mr Justice Morgan expressly rejected a submission to the effect that there should be implied into a contract of retainer any requirement for a solicitor to comply with the professional regulatory provisions applicable at the time. I see no basis upon which to distinguish this case. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It does not follow that the requirements of the Code of Conduct have no bearing whatsoever upon what a client should reasonably pay, if only because a solicitor can be expected to comply with the professional obligations imposed by the code.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Before I continue I must address an argument raised by Mr Glassbrook in his submissions for the Defendant.  He submitted that, as the Points of Dispute state only that the Defendant’s entitlement to costs must be limited to the sum of £20,000, it is not open to me - at least on the Points of Dispute as currently drafted – to make any finding other than that the Claimant’s liability to pay is or is not so limited.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I am unable to accept that submission.  The authorities expressly referred to and relied upon by the Defendant (in particular <span style="font-style:italic">Mastercigars</span>) leave it open to me to conclude that it is reasonable for the Claimant to pay only the amount for which the Claimant contends, or that it is reasonable for the Claimant to pay some larger amount.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Defendant is not prejudiced by my taking that approach. The Defendant’s own case is that the figure upon which the Claimant relies was an estimate. The evidence and submissions heard by me addressed the fees and disbursements which accrued as the Defendant managed the defence of the loan claim, the costs information supplied by the Defendant to the Claimant from time to time, and the way in which the parties understood and dealt with that information. Mr Storar, the witness for the Defendant, came to the hearing armed with a detailed breakdown of costs as they accrued, designed to show exactly how and why costs accrued from time to time. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In any event, if I were to accept this argument the only effect would be to force the Claimant to make minor amendments to the Points of Dispute so that I could then address issues about which I have already heard evidence and submissions.  I would not regard that as correct in principle or as compliant with the overriding objective. </p>

The Claimant’s daughter’s partner claimed that money lent by him to the Claimant was to be repaid, with interest, from the proceeds of sale of a property and that the period for payment had expired.  The Claimant contended that the loan agreements had not been validly executed, that the parties to the agreements never intended to be bound by them and that monies were in any event owed to him through other financial arrangements made in relation to the relevant property.</p>

His opponent, who was represented by Counsel, was successful and the Claimant felt at a disadvantage.  Accordingly he decided that he should seek legal representation to take the case to trial.  On 25 July 2008 he met Mr Storar, a consultant with the Defendant, at the “Red House” in Reigate (the Claimant’s home at the time) to discuss that.</p>

Permission to reply upon the amended Defence and Counterclaim was given on 2 September 2008.

That application, initially resisted, was eventually conceded and trial relisted for 3 to 8 April 2009.  The time estimate remained at three and a half days. </p>

The budget therefore should be £23,500 … At the time of giving that estimate it was not envisaged that we would be making an application for a further adjournment as a consequence of your surgery.  Nor, in fairness, was it envisaged that we would have to make an application in respect of Hallows … The Hallows application is therefore another additional cost … It is also the case that you indicated to me that the matter was ready for trial and, indeed, my letter of 30 July sets out that assumption.  In fact we still had to prepare the appeal, and further witness statements in addition to the further applications … With regard to a representative from Downs attending at the trial, if you require me to attend for 3½ days, I expect to spend approximately 25 hours, ie a total of £5,000 … if you would prefer that a trainee sits in on the trial … you will be charged at £150 per hour.  His costs will be £4,500 excluding VAT … I must disagree that costs have simply run away.  The costs that have been incurred have been properly incurred.  I believe that you misunderstood the position of your case in July last year in representing the case as being ready for trial.  Had the matter been heard in September last year then I would certainly agree that costs would not have reached £20,000.  Due to the fact that this matter was not ready for trial in September time has moved on and, as a consequence, costs have increased”.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">My first conclusion is that the figure of £20,000 discussed on 28 July 2008 and referred to in Mr Storar’s letter of 30 July 2008 excluded VAT. Mr Storar’s letter of 30 July 2008 refers to a request to cap “fees” at £20,000, immediately after stating that his fees are subject to VAT. That is clear enough, and the equally clear implication is that the figure discussed five days earlier excluded VAT. If there had been some inconsistency between the letter of 30 July and the discussion of 25 July I would have expected the Claimant, who had experience of instructing solicitors in litigation and who would always have known that legal fees are subject to VAT, to raise it at the time.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The subsequent correspondence passing between the parties (at least until the outcome of the loan claim was known to the Claimant) is consistent with that. In particular the Claimant’s own letters show a clear acceptance that the £20,000 discussed on 25 July excluded VAT. I am unable to accept his claim, under cross-examination, that he was in correspondence conceding a point which he believed to be incorrect. He was quite prepared to express his dissatisfaction about any costs in excess of the originally discussed maximum. It is not credible that he would have accepted that figure to be £23,500 if he believed that it was in fact £20,000.</p>

Mr Storar says that the Claimant only indicated that he had a budget of £20,000 (excluding VAT), that he would not be happy if costs exceeded that amount and that he might be in financial difficulty if they did. On this point I again prefer the evidence of Mr Storar.  If the Claimant had said at the outset that he would not instruct the Defendant if costs might exceed £20,000, he would surely have reminded Mr Storar of that fact as soon as it became clear that costs would exceed that figure. He did not.</p>

He recorded the Claimant’s request to cap fees, but he did not agree to do so and his letter is inconsistent with any previous agreement to do so.  What he said in his letter was that “…I believe that we will be able to take this matter to the end of the trial well within the £20,000 budget”. The words “I believe” clearly indicate that the figure is an estimate, not an agreed cap. The obvious implication was that it would not be necessary to consider any such cap because costs could not in any event be expected to exceed a maximum estimate of £20,000.</p>

As with the VAT issue, the Claimant’s attempt to disavow his own words is not convincing. From 10 February to about mid-March 2008 he was unfit to attend and give evidence at trial, but I have seen nothing to substantiate the suggestion that he was at any time not competent to understand what he was writing.</p>

He did so on the express understanding, communicated by the Claimant in the meeting of 25 July, that that was what the Claimant could afford to commit to the case, but not on the alleged understanding that the Claimant would not instruct the Defendant if the estimate might be exceeded. Mr Storar did not on 30 July 2008 have detailed knowledge of the orders made by the court on 24 July 2008. He did have such knowledge by 7 August 2008. </p>

If there is a modest difference between the estimate and the final bill, because an estimate is not a fixed price for the work, one may be very little surprised by the modest difference. The greater the difference the more it calls for an explanation. If there is a satisfactory explanation for the difference then the estimate may cease to be useful as a yardstick with which to measure reasonableness.

Further, in some cases (but perhaps not all cases) a client may have difficulty in showing that he may have acted differently if the estimate had been for the amount of the final bill. What should the court do where the client does not, or is not able to, contend that there is an estoppel but he is able nonetheless to satisfy the court that he took the estimate completely seriously and it is possible he might have approached the litigation differently if he had been given a figure nearer to the figure in the final bill?…</p>

The judge in that case did not approach the matter on the basis of an alleged estoppel. Instead, he indicated that ‘regard should be had’ to the level of costs the client had been led to believe he would have to pay. The question was then expressed as to whether it was reasonable for the client to pay much more than the estimated costs. In my judgment, the proper response to this decision is to hold that the court in that case was finding that, for the purpose of assessing reasonable remuneration payable to the solicitor, it is relevant as a matter of law to ask: ‘what in all the circumstances it is reasonable for the client to be expected to pay?’ Thus, even if the solicitor has spent a reasonable time on reasonable items of work and the charging rate is reasonable, the resulting figure may exceed what it is reasonable in all the circumstances to expect the client to pay, and to the extent that the figure does exceed what is reasonable to expect the client to pay, the excess is not recoverable.”</p>

The court should determine whether the client did rely on the estimate. The court should determine how the client relied on the estimate. The court should try to determine the above without conducting an elaborate and detailed investigation. The court should decide whether the costs claimed should be reduced by reason of its findings as to reliance and, if so, in what way and by how much. Whether there should be a reduction, and if so to what extent, is a matter of judgment. Specific deductions can be made from the costs otherwise recoverable to reflect the impact which an erroneous and uncorrected estimate had on the conduct of the client. Such an approach requires the court to form an assessment of the impact of the estimate on the conduct of the client. The court should consider the deductions which are needed in order to do justice between the parties. It is not the proper function of the court to punish the solicitor for providing a wrong estimate or for failing to keep it up to date as events unfolded. In terms of the sequence of the decisions to be made by the court, it has been suggested that the court should determine whether, and if so how, it will reflect the estimate in the detailed assessment before carrying out the detailed assessment. The suggestion as to the sequence of decision making may not always be appropriate. The suggestion is put forward as practical guidance rather than as a legal imperative. The ultimate question is as to the sum which it is reasonable for the client to pay, having regard to the estimate and any other relevant matter."</p>

However in <span style="font-style:italic">Reynolds v Stone Rowe Brewer</span> the solicitor’s initial estimate was expressly qualified, with some emphasis, by the possibility of revision. In this case, while not being (in the words of Morgan J) a “maximum or fixed price”, the figure of £20,000 was not (other than by the words “I believe”) so qualified. Further, it was not the Defendant’s estimate of likely cost (which was £13-£14,000) but of maximum cost, covering any contingencies that might arise.</p>

That assurance was clearly of decisive importance in the Claimant’s decision to instruct the Defendant. Whether or not, as the Defendant asserts, the Claimant actually had more than £20,000 available to him appears to me to be irrelevant. That was the figure the Claimant was prepared to, and considered that he could afford to, invest in legal representation.</p>

I do not entirely agree. A detailed assessment hearing will, in the absence of some agreement between the parties, be necessary in due course, but in the meantime it is possible for me to identify the extent to which, given the estimates offered by the Defendant, and the Claimant’s response to them, the Defendant should be held to the figure of £20,000 plus VAT and for me to identify particular categories of cost which it will (subject to detailed assessment) or will not be reasonable for the Claimant to pay.  Before I do so I should consider the Claimant’s response to the Defendant’s estimates as supplied from time to time.</p>

If he had thought them outside the scope of the contingencies covered by his maximum estimate of a week earlier he would no doubt (in accordance with his obligations under what was then rule 2.03 of the Code of Conduct) have revised his estimate. He, not the Claimant, had the expertise to assess the work needed to take the case to trial and the likely cost. He made no revision to his figures until February 2009, and no really substantial revision until the eve of trial. In the circumstances I have to conclude that his subsequent references to the Claimant’s assurances that the case was ready for trial were attempts, with the benefit of hindsight, to justify an inaccurate initial maximum estimate.</p>

It does not follow that the Claimant would have instructed the Defendant if he had at the outset been given a more realistic estimate. Given his budget figure, faced with a VAT-inclusive outlay in the region of £40,000 it is more likely than not that the Claimant would have gone elsewhere, or just carried on representing himself. In any event, having (as I find he did) instructed the Defendant in reliance on an assurance that he would not have to account for more than £20,000 plus VAT, at the very least the Claimant lost the opportunity to explore alternatives to instructing the Defendant on the Defendant’s terms.</p>

The Claimant had a legitimate expectation, subject to genuinely unforeseeable contingencies, that the Defendant would complete the task undertaken for him within a maximum estimate which, as he had clearly indicated, represented the most he could afford. Sacking his solicitors or refusing to provide security would have put him in a very difficult position. </p>

This does not seem to me to be a good ground for exceeding the original maximum estimate.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The change from trial estimate from two days to three and a half days occurred at an early stage – in about September 2008 - and for that reason, does not in my view offer a sound basis for exceeding the original maximum estimate. If it had not fallen within the sort of contingency foreseen by him, Mr Storar would no doubt have revised his costs estimate as soon as the time estimate changed.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I take a different view in respect of the fact that the trial period exceeded the three and a half day estimate by another full day. No-one seems to have thought the time estimate of three and a half days to be unrealistic and Mr Storar cannot be criticised for that. The Claimant attempts to do so by blaming counsel and the Defendant for failing to foresee a submission made by his opponent at trial. Mr Storar simply says that this is not raised in the Points of Dispute. In any event I can attach little weight to it. Such problems often arise at trial and it would take a great deal more than a bare assertion that they should have done better to disentitle solicitors and counsel from payment of their proper fees. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Trial costs were also increased by Mr Storar’s personal attendance at trial on the instructions of the Claimant, in the full knowledge that costs would exceed the original maximum estimate.  There is no good reason why Mr Storar should not recover the additional cost incurred by his attending trial instead of the trainee offered. Giving evidence, the Claimant accepted that he had given such instructions but attempted to distinguish between the trial itself and attendance at the final day of submissions. As I have no basis for concluding that his instructions drew any such distinction, there is nothing in that point. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Some of this “general” time may be accounted for by reference to matters expressly excluded from Mr Storar’s original maximum estimate. An obvious example would be his advice on appeal, which by definition would not be covered by an estimate to the end of trial.  I am unable to accept the Claimant’s argument that he should not have to pay for such advice. He was warned from the moment that appeal was discussed that counsel thought the prospects of success very poor, and he required further advice notwithstanding that.  Similarly, it is evident from the correspondence that Mr Storar had to spend time chasing agreed, unpaid fees so that the Defendant could carry on working for the Claimant. That is a cost that must be borne by the Claimant.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Otherwise, these additional costs would seem to arise from the fact that more time and energy was needed to prepare for trial than Mr Storar had anticipated.  He says that the Claimant was a “demanding” client and it is clear that much work had to be done in the run up to trial, but faced with a claim of in the region of £300,000, turning on fiercely disputed issues of fact, most clients would be demanding.  If a client’s demands go beyond what is reasonable in the circumstances a solicitor can refuse to meet them, or specifically warn the client that what is being asked is beyond what was reasonably contemplated and will cost more. Otherwise, the amount of general preparation which will reasonably have to be undertaken for trial is something that a solicitor is expected to able to assess when he offers an estimate of costs.  He cannot pass responsibility for that to his client.</p>
