At the hearing, Mr Holland QC and Mr Joseph appeared for MWP and Mr Bacon QC and Mr McDonald represented the Claimants. Both sides lodged skeleton arguments.

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">"Michael Wilson contend that they are legal advisers. In that capacity, Michael Wilson advised<span style="color:#FF0000"> </span>all seven Claimants in significant disputes with various entities including OJSC Polyus Gold, Polygus International, Jenington International Inc, Kazakhgold Group Ltd and their various subsidiaries, related companies and affiliates. The Claimants are all residents in Kazakhstan and all were parties to an engagement letter dated 2 July 2010 which set out the terms on which Michael Wilson would be retained on their behalf. According to Mr Patrick Beale, Mr Bacon's instructing solicitor, Michael Wilson handled "a very major piece of commercial litigation" on the Claimants' behalf (see his first witness statement dated 15 August 2009), in respect of which the firm issued 26 invoices amounting to $8,605,030.03 for its work. The Claimants have objected to the invoices. In their view, the engagement letter (and a further separate letter of engagement dated 24 August 2010 between Michael Wilson and the Fourth Claimant) are unfair, unreasonable and should be set aside. The Claimants further assert that the fees charged by Michael Wilson are excessive and they wish to exercise their statutory rights under Section 61(1) and Section 61(2) Solicitors Act 1974, before they pay Michael Wilson any more money."</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Court has yet to decide whether the relief sought under the Act should be granted and it is important to stress at the outset of this judgment what the application it addresses is not. Although Mr Bacon has invited the court in paragraph 66 of his skeleton to make orders  reflecting the relief sought in paragraph 4 (ii) above, it is only MWP's application for a stay with which the court was seised on 21 and 24 June 2012. Indeed, thus far, the parties' attention has  been directed only at (i)  whether these proceedings should be transferred to the Commercial Court (in Campbell 1, I ruled that they should not) and (ii), this application. For that reason, whether there should or should not be an assessment under the Act is not within the scope of this judgment. Instead, it is limited to the relief sought in the application notice, namely    MWP's case that the proceedings under the Act should be stayed and that the arbitration should continue on the basis that there was a valid arbitration agreement incorporated into the retainer which existed between MWP and the Claimants.</p>

Given its importance, the letter will be considered in some detail. In addition, there is a separate letter of engagement ("the second engagement letter") signed by Aidar bearing the date 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2010  (bundle 2 pages 567-579).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The engagement letter was signed by Kanat, Baurzhan, Marusya, Sanzhar and Aidar Assaubeyev (see exhibit PB4 pages 441 to 447). JSC and GLH were also signatories but nothing turns on that.   It was also signed on behalf of Hawkinson, although the validity of the signature is in dispute. At paragraph 51 of his skeleton, Mr Bacon submits that although Aidar's signature appears in the box marked  for Hawkinson, he had no actual or apparent authority to agree to the arbitration clause. As such, he contends that Hawkinson is not bound by the arbitration clause or, indeed, the engagement letter. That is also the thrust of Mr Kablan's evidence. He says that Aidar is not a director of Hawkinson and he had no authority to sign. Moreover, there is no record of MWP ever explaining discussing or negotiating the terms of the engagement letter. As for the others, the Family agrees for the purpose of MWP's application for a stay, that the engagement letter was signed (see Sanzhar 1 paragraph 5, adopted in their witness statements by Kanat, Maruysa, Baurzhan  and Aidar ), albeit that "...this is without prejudice to (and I reserve) my [Sanzhar's] position as to whether or not I did sign the engagement letter". </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Holland's case on signature is set out at paragraph 23 of his skeleton. He submits that were it to be correct that Aidar had no authority to sign on behalf of Hawkinson,  then it follows that he, Aidar "... is the sort of man who is quite prepared to sign formal documents on behalf of companies on whose behalf he has no authority to act; he has clearly been guilty of what under English law would be a breach of warranty of authority (although Kazakh law may technically apply); if (as appears to be the case) both GLH and Hawkinson are creatures of the family, then it is clear that, when it suits them, the family are quite prepared to stand behind legal technicality which obscures reality." Moreover, it is Mr Wilson's evidence that Aidar signed the second engagement in his presence on 12 July 2010, both on his own behalf and on behalf of Hawkinson and GLH (Wilson 3 paragraph 48- bundle 2 page 624).</p>

In my opinion the construction of an arbitration clause should start from the assumption that the parties, as rational businessmen, are likely to have intended any dispute arising out of the relationship into which they have entered or purported to enter to be decided by the same tribunal. The clause should be construed in accordance with this presumption unless the language makes it clear that certain questions were intended to be excluded from the arbitrator's jurisdiction. As Longmore LJ remarked at paragraph 17 "if any business man did want to exclude disputes about the validity of a contract, it would be comparatively easy to say so."</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Next, Mr. Holland points out that the fact that  whilst this court may have the jurisdiction and  expertise to deal with detailed assessments of solicitors' bills and to administer  statutory remedies,  that does not preclude  parties from agreeing themselves that an issue may be arbitrated -see <span style="font-style:italic">Fulham Football Club [1987] Limited v</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">Richards </span>[2011] EWCA Civ 855.  In Mr Holland's submission, whilst a lot has been made by the Claimants about the deprivation of statutory remedies they would suffer if a stay is granted, in fact the only remedies that can be given by this Court are under the Act.  It follows that merely because the Act gives the Court power to apply statutory remedies,   does not mean<span style="color:#FF0000"> </span>that any issue arising between the parties should not or cannot be referred to arbitration simply because the arbitrator does not have the same powers as the court to give statutory remedies. Moreover, even if the Claimants were not to be entitled to the relief sought under the  Act, they are nonetheless able to seek remedies under the common law. Thus in <span style="font-style:italic">Turner v Palomo</span> [1999] 4 AER 353, the fact the client was out of time in applying for detailed assessment under the Act did not prevent an assessment of his costs proceeding under the common law as a quantum meruit, nor would it prevent an argument over reasonableness being raised (<span style="font-style:italic">Thomas Watts v Smith </span>(1998) 2 Costs LR 59). </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Next and in so far as  MWP had come on the court record for Aidar and Baurzhan in the Jenington litigation is concerned, Mr Holland submits  that MWP is not and never has been an entity authorised to conduct litigation in England and Wales and  the act of doing so cannot confer on the court a statutory jurisdiction which otherwise it would not have.   This is because it  is trite law that a party cannot estop himself into a statutory jurisdiction which the court does not possess- (see <span style="font-style:italic">J &amp; F Stone Lighting and Radio Limited v</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">Levitt </span>(1947)) AC 209.  Nor is  it possible by agreement  or estoppel to confer upon a court or tribunal a jurisdiction it does not have (see <span style="font-style:italic">Contour Homes  v Rowan</span> (2007) EWCA CIV 842). Therefore, if, in going on the court record, MWP was seen to be holding  itself out as having a right to conduct litigation and even if all the other elements of estoppel were made out (eg reliance, acting to  detriment etc),  that could not give the Senior Courts Costs Office  a jurisdiction under the  Act which it did not otherwise possess: see  <span style="font-style:italic">Daejan Properties v Mahoney</span> (1996) 28 HLR 498 in which Lord Bingham said this at page 7:-</p>

Here, in fact, the Family had actually  complained there had been  <span style="font-style:italic">no</span> discussion or explanation about the existence of the Act when the engagement letter was signed.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Holland further places emphasis on the fact that MWP is not a solicitor of the Senior Courts as defined in the Act (see s.1 <span style="font-style:italic">supra </span>paragraph 26) and could never be,  given that MWP is a BVI registered company. For the same reason, MWP cannot ever have been a firm of solicitors or a partnership of which at least one partner was a solicitor. Nor could MWP be said to be a recognised body under s.9 Administration of Justice Act 1985 ("AJA"), which permits the Law Society to make rules regulating the conduct of the affairs of incorporated practices of solicitors. Nor indeed, being neither incorporated in England and Wales and without a practising address therein, could MWP comply with Rule 14.03 of the Code which provides under (2) (a) that a recognised body which is a partnership may be formed under the law of any country and may be a legal person: (b) a recognised body which is an LLP must be incorporated and registered in England and Wales or in Scotland under the Limited Liability Partnerships Act 2000: (c) a recognised body which is a company must be (i) incorporated and registered in England and Wales or in Scotland  or in Scotland under part 1 of the Companies Act 1985 (ii) incorporated in an Establishment Directive state and registered as an overseas company under Part 1 of the Companies Act 1985; or (ii)incorporated and registered in an Establishment Directive state as <span style="font-style:italic">societas Europaea</span>: and under (2) "Practising address in England and Wales", a recognised body must have at least one practising address in England and Wales. None of these could nor did apply to MWP.</p>

So far as having qualified in England, both Mr Wilson and Mr Chudzynski had simply maintained their practising certificates, out of convenience "just in case one day we decide to return to live and work in England".  </p>

In these circumstances MWP was not and could not have been a solicitor within the meaning of the  Act, nor was it nor could it have been regulated either by the Law Society or the Solicitors Regulation Authority ("SRA"). Given that MWP is a BVI registered company which carries on business in Kazakhstan, that is entirely to be expected. Nothing in the terms of the engagement letter could possibly have led  anyone to suppose that MWP was so regulated. </p>

Quite simply, English law was chosen to govern the interpretation and validity of the contract, the mode of performance and the consequences of any breaches. There is a difference between the substance of the obligation to perform (governed by English law) and the mode and manner of performance (governed by the law and the place of performance- Kazakhstan). The fact that because the parties chose English law as the proper law does not mean that the retainer thereby became a contract by a solicitor within the definition of the Act for the provision of legal services in England. It remained a contract by a BVI company to provide both legal and business services to the Claimants in Kazakhstan.  As to the Code, even  if it applied  (for the reasons given Mr   Holland submits that it does not), it could only do so in respect of  the two English qualified solicitors,  Mr Wilson and Mr Chudzynksi.  Whilst a breach of the Code might have consequences for them  personally (were they to be English solicitors), it could not bring the terms of the engagement letter and the invoices within the terms of the Act ( see judgment of Arden LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Garbutt v Edwards</span> [2006] 1 WLR 2907 at paragraph 37).</p>

The Act exists to protect clients against solicitors creating unfair retainers. Here, MWP were solicitors going on the court record to enable MWP  to conduct litigation in London, whilst based in Kazakhstan, in order to avoid the application of the Act. That it is not possible to contract out of statutory regulation, is plain, Mr Bacon submits, from the speech of Lord Simon in <span style="font-style:italic">Johnson v Morton</span> (1980) A.C. 37.

MWP has complete control over and the Claimants cannot choose, whether a dispute can be referred to mediation or settled through legal proceedings or arbitration or, indeed, where any such legal proceedings are to be  commenced. As such, the arbitration clause prevents the Claimants from instigating any proceedings to pursue their legal rights. If a dispute arises, the wording of the arbitration clause precludes the Claimants from taking any legal action against MWP if  MWP  does not itself elect a mediator or bring proceedings (whether via arbitration or litigation). In these circumstances,  the arbitration clause, if permitted to operate, would do so as an exclusion of liability and/or an ouster of the court's and the arbitrator's jurisdiction. This the law does not permit (see <span style="font-style:italic">Johnson v Morton</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">re Wynn</span> supra). </p>

Here, Mr Wilson, a solicitor, contends that he is not bound by the Act in respect of his or MWP's remuneration. If he be right, this means that Mr Wilson can be on the roll as required by the Act, carry on as a solicitor through MWP, but not be bound by Part III of the Act which concerns his remuneration and what he can charge. Thus he can avoid the Act's supervisory jurisdiction by contracting out of it under the arbitration clause, thereby  leaving him untouchable. In Mr Bacon's submission, that cannot not right. He argues that  Mr. Wilson, as a solicitor, is bound by the Act like anybody else. He cannot escape  the Act or his obligations under the Code by "setting up shop" in an offshore haven and  hiding behind a corporate veil. "Acting as a solicitor" has a special meaning. It does not mean just doing things as a qualified solicitor. It also covers such things that only a solicitor can do, for example   coming onto the court record in English litigation just as MWP had done.     Thus in the Jenington<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>action, having  represented Aidar and Baurzhan, in doing so, both MWP and Mr Wilson thereby made themselves subject to the inherent jurisdiction of the court and to the provisions of the Act.</p>

Under section 12 of schedule 2 of the Legal Services Act 2007, "conduct of litigation", is a "reserved legal activity." In order to perform a reserved legal activity such as going on the court record, MWP needed to be a person authorised to do so by an approved regulator such as the Law Society. Under section 20 of the Act, no unqualified person is to act as a solicitor and any person who does so is guilty of an offence and liable to imprisonment upon conviction on indictment. Here MWP  held itself out as a solicitor/recognised body under section 24 of the Act by acknowledging service (PB4 page 456) and doing  acts such as   issuing an application notice  (PB4 page 458) and signing consent orders (PB4 page 563). <marker name="tab"/> MWP also gave an address for service (which must be the business address of the solicitor on the record as required by CPR 6.23) at Michael Wilson and Partners 25 Grove Road, London NW13. In doing so, MWP held itself out as a solicitor/recognised body with an office in England and Wales which was conducting litigation on behalf of Aidar and Baurzhan. As such MWP was and  is subject to the  Act (and other regulatory requirements such as the Code) and to  the court's inherent jurisdiction over the solicitors. In these circumstances the court can assess MWP's fees under Part III of the Act.</p>

Mr  Wilson is described on MWP's  website as the "Director and Managing partner" of MWP but he is also a solicitor of the Senior Courts of England and Wales with SRA number 129848, having been admitted on 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> November 1984. Consequently and  notwithstanding that MWP and Mr Wilson practice overseas, pursuant to Rule 15.01(2)(a) of the Code, he is also subject to the rules of the Code which are specified in rule 15 as being applicable to overseas practices- they apply in relation to practice from an office outside the UK "(i) to a solicitor as an individual whether or not the solicitor's firm or employer is subject to these rules". Furthermore, pursuant to section 50 of the Act, Mr Wilson as a solicitor of the Senior Courts is subject to the provisions of the Act and  the jurisdiction of the English High Court over solicitors.</p>

Yet the reality is that far from not conducting any business as a solicitor in England, by going on the court record in a High Court action in the Chancery Division involving millions of pounds on behalf of two of the Defendants in that claim, MWP and Mr Wilson had done just that.

On the contrary, both Mr Wilson and MWP fall within the Act  in terms of their conduct, either under section 20 or section 24.

He contends that the terms of the engagement letter and in particular the arbitration clause, would  be unenforceable under the Unfair Terms Consumer Contract Regulations 1999 ("UTTCR") and the Unfair Contract Terms Act ("UCTA") 1977. But he submits that it is not necessary for the court to go that far.   MWP cannot establish that there is a valid concluded applicable arbitration agreement pursuant to section 9 (1) of the Arbitration Act because the arbitration clause is unenforceable and/or otherwise illegal. That being so, it follows automatically that the Claimants satisfy section 9 (4) since if the clause is unenforceable and/or otherwise illegal, it must also be devoid of legal effect for the purpose of section 9 (4). For these reasons the application for a stay should be dismissed.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">To reach a concluded view on these issues, it will be necessary to examine the engagement letter in more detail.  First, the common ground.  The Claimants <span style="font-style:italic">in toto</span> accept that MWP provided legal services and advice pursuant to the engagement letter (Beale 1 paragraph 8). On their case, the retainer continued until Baurzhan wrote on 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2011 that  "MWP are no longer representing any of the Assaubayev family or their interests in this matter." (PB1 pages 61-63). Those instructions were challenged by MWP. Mr Wilson's response (PB1 page 62) also dated 9 April 2011 said this : "MWP confirms it continues to be engaged by and acts for all of the five individual family members CAB, AGK and all of the other relevant entities involved in these transactions...". However, it is now agreed that the retainer was terminated even if the date of termination is not.  The Claimants also accept that they were responsible for the payment of MWP's fees under the engagement letter (Beale 1 paragraph 13), it making no difference that  the  charges paid so far,   have been   met by the Trustees of various family trusts through  loans to the Family for that purpose.</p>

Mr Holland submits that the Claimants cannot have it both ways and say that the argument was signed when it helps their case, but reserving the right to argue it was not signed when it does not. I agree. First, and given that in order to obtain the order for service  out of the jurisdiction, the Claimants were required to depose that there was a contract governed by English law, in my view it would be inconsistent for those same Claimants now to assert  that the engagement letter may be invalid for want of properly given  signatures.  Second, a contentious business agreement must be in writing (Act s.59(1). Since the Claimants are seeking an order pursuant to s.61(2) that "the letter of engagement (which they consider to be a contentious business agreement)  dated 2 July 2010 be set aside as being unfair and unreasonable…", it is difficult to see how the court could grant this relief if there was no signed agreement  to  set aside.  Third, it is accepted that the Family <span style="font-style:italic">did</span> sign; the only issues are the circumstances in which those signatures were given and the authority of Aidar  to sign on behalf of Hawkinson. In my view, the issues on signature <span style="font-style:italic">per se</span> do not render the engagement letter unenforceable for these three reasons.</p>

For the Family, it is said that the terms of the engagement letter, including the arbitration clause, were not negotiated, nor did MWP provide advice on its contents (Sanzhar paragraphs 4-5). For that reason, on Mr Bacon's case, the Family was not given adequate notice of what he has described as "this onerous and unfair clause". </p>

He  gives his reasons (Wilson 3 paragraphs 46-49). He submits that meetings were held at which the engagement letter was negotiated, drafted and finally signed. Essentially, the Family was fully advised so that, even if the clause was "onerous and unfair" as Mr Bacon has submitted, its contents were  explained in detail so the point goes nowhere.</p>

What I am able to say is that on the untested material deployed before me, I prefer Mr Wilson's evidence on this point.  This was not a situation in which the Claimants were simply given a pen and told "sign here". One reason for that is that Kanat, Masusya and Sanzhar were stranded, passport-less, in England. But Baurzhan and Aidar were not and I am satisfied on Mr Wilson's evidence  which is  backed by  a detailed chronology at pages 623 to 626,   that they, together with other advisers to the Family, were looking after their interests in terms of obtaining representation and in addressing the problems thrown up by the disputes in which the Family had become embroiled. In particular, it is said  that there were 5 face to face meetings and a number of telephone conferences before the letter was signed.

The clause is drafted in terms that are wide and in my judgment, broad enough to encompass a dispute between the parties about fees. Moreover it is plain that the points raised in these proceedings under the Act bear striking similarities to those that appear in the Statement of Defence and Counterclaim  in the arbitration proceedings (bundle 3 pages 231-257).  I am also satisfied that I should lean towards a purposive interpretation by following <span style="font-style:italic">Fili Shipping</span> as Mr Holland urges me that I should do.

Under their terms, the parties have agreed that the law of England and Wales is to apply. They could instead have made the agreements subject to the law of Kazakhstan if, as Mr Holland has put MWP's case, the disputes principally concerned issues arising not in England and Wales but in Kazakhstan. But that was not what was done. On the contrary, in order to avail itself of the ability to enforce an arbitration award in Kazakhstan (because that country is a signatory to the 1958 New York convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbital Awards (Wilson 1 paragraphs 27- 28)), MWP made a reasoned decision to make the engagement letter subject to English law. In  Mr Wilson's mind was  the fact that an arbitration award would be enforceable in Kazakhstan whereas  "any judgment or order made in MWP's favour in these proceedings [under the  Act] would be of almost no practical benefit to MWP <span style="font-style:italic">vis a vis</span> all but the 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> Claimant, which I believe to be an empty-shell BVI company.

How that remuneration was earned will depend upon the type of work which MWP was undertaking on the Claimants' behalf.  On Mr Wilson's case, MWP was not and has never been an English firm of solicitors, either practising in England and Wales or with an office within the jurisdiction. From that, taken at face value, it must follow that MWP could not and did not undertake any work on behalf of the Family which only an English firm of solicitors could do and therefore that only such a firm could charge for.  If Mr Wilson is right, it would not be expected, therefore, that there would be any reference in the invoices to charges made for work that only an English solicitor could undertake, or, indeed for legal services provided in England. </p>

For example, at the time that MWP went onto the court record on 31 August 2010, invoice APD001/02 addressed to the Family, GLC, Hawkinson and JSC, makes a charge on that date for work undertaken by Mr Chudzynski  with regard to  "preparation of Acknowledgment of Service-Conference with Michael regarding the same-discussion with Michael regarding witness statement". The next day he has an entry "Meeting with M. Wilson and Mr A K Assaubayev as to his affidavit to High Court. Review files received from Allen and Overy [A&amp;O] re the hearing…," which can only  be a reference to an application MWP issued on 3 September 2010 on Aidar's behalf for relief from sanctions under CPR 3.9 (bundle 2 page 458).

On the contrary, in my opinion, these narrative entries indicate that MWP was acting as a principal and that they support Mr Bacon's submission that MWP was undertaking work for reward that only an English solicitor is permitted to do. As such and, in doing so, it appears to me,  firstly that MWP was holding  itself out as being a firm of solicitors authorised to conduct litigation in England and Wales,  secondly   that it has charged  the Claimants for carrying out  work in that capacity and thirdly, on the face of it, <span style="font-style:italic">all</span> the Claimants are liable to pay those charges because the obligations they have under the engagement letter are joint and several.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">CPR 3.2 defines "legal representative" as (a) a barrister (b) a  solicitor, (b) a solicitor's employee (c) a manager of a body recognised under section 9 of the Administration of Justice Act 1985 or (e) a person, who for the purposes of the Legal Services Act 2007 is an authorised person in relation to an activity which constitutes the conduct of litigation (within the meaning of that Act) who has been instructed to act for a party in relation to proceedings. It follows that where, as here, an acknowledgement of service was signed on behalf of Aidar, the signatory was required to be a legal representative as defined under CPR 3.2 and the address for  service,  a business address of that representative. <span style="color:#FF0000"> </span>Putting this in<span style="color:#FF0000"> </span>more common parlance, this means that where a defendant does not act in person, but instead appoints a solicitor to act on his behalf, that solicitor must be a legal representative within CPR 3.2 with a business address for service in England and Wales. </p>

It is to be noted  that<span style="color:#FF0000"> </span>MWP also came onto the court record  on behalf of  Baurzhan.  He, Baurzhan,  was not a party  to the second engagement letter.  Unquestionably, therefore, MWP can only have done so under the engagement letter. Yet nowhere in Mr Wilson's extensive witness statements have I been able to trace the explanation for this. For there to have been compliance with CPR 3.2, MWP needed to be a legal representative and to have a business address within the jurisdiction. Yet Mr Wilson has deposed repeatedly that MWP is not an English solicitor, has no office in England and provides no legal services here. Clearly one of these propositions cannot be correct.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgment, Mr Wilson's evidence to this court belittles the work he considered MWP was instructed to undertake in late August 2010, when he described Jenington's application to Peter Smith J as "most extraordinary", that there were "very difficult applications" involved which justified  the case being treated as vacation business and that there were  "very serious legal issues as to its subject matter" which required the instruction of both Junior and Leading counsel. The ensuing correspondence does not bear out the assertions now advanced in his witness statements, nor is it consistent with Mr. Wilson's claim that MWP does not practice English law or have a London office. The reality is that  PB4 is replete with emails and documents which indicate  the type of work that MWP was undertaking for Aidar and Baurzhan when on the court record.  In addition to the email exchange with Jenington's solicitors in this period, Mr James Drake of counsel appeared before Mr. Justice Vos on 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2010 instructed by MWP (PB4 p.539) on behalf of Aidar. A copy of an order Vos J  made on 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2010 has MWP's name on it (p.543): likewise an order of Mr Justice Floyd date 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2010 (pp.547-548): likewise an order of Master Bowles dated 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> October 2010, albeit MWP is there expressed to be "Legal Advisers for the Third Defendant" (pp. 449-450): likewise a consent  order  of the Chancery Division dated 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2010 with MWP expressed to be "legal advisers of the Third and Fifth Defendants" : likewise  an order of Chancery Chambers of 11 November 2010 providing for service on Baurzhan at "Michael Wilson &amp; Partners Limited at 25 Grove Road Barnes" (pp. 559-561):  likewise an order of Master Bowles dated 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2011 with MWP described as "Solicitors for the fifth Defendant" (pp. 563-564).

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgment, none of this evidence supports Mr Wilson's claim  that MWP was acting "nominally" in a side-show, still less that MWP was  not acting as a firm of solicitors at all and did  not provide legal services in England.  The documents simply do not bear that out. First, as I have said, the narratives to the bills charge for work that a firm of English solicitors conducting High Court litigation would do and, in this case MWP did do  in the Jenington litigation. Second, the fact and circumstances of MWP going on the court record can lead to no other conclusion in my view that in doing so, MWP was holding itself as a firm of English solicitors with a place of business within the jurisdiction. Third, there are  the variations MWP introduced to its standard engagement letter by the removal of the clause stating that MWP was not a firm of solicitors to which either the Act or the Code applied, and the addition of material informing the Claimants that Mr Wilson was a member of the Law Society and that Mr Chudzynski was admitted as an English Solicitor. They  lead to the  obvious inference being drawn  that MWP was qualified to handle the Jenington litigation in the English Courts and that it was willing to do so.  If that was not the case, why did MWP remove from the standard form of engagement letter the very term upon which Mr Wilson is now relying  to assert that MWP was not an English solicitor with a business presence in England? </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">If I am right, what is the consequence of these findings upon the agreement to arbitrate?  In my judgment it is to render the agreement null and void, inoperative and incapable of being performed  because were it to be otherwise, MWP would be benefiting from its own default. That default is that having submitted to a retainer letter that was subject to English law,  MWP  pretended to be a firm of English solicitors by doing things that only English Solicitors can do, such as going on the court record, corresponding with Jenington's solicitors on behalf of clients, issuing applications in the High Court, briefing counsel, signing orders and generally doing as an English solicitor would do, and then rendering bills to the Claimants for the work involved.  Yet in contrast to the English solicitor, when it has come to the checking of those bills to ensure that they are fair and reasonable, it is MWP's contention that it should not be subject to the same statutory scrutiny as the English solicitor, even though the charges relate to work done as if MWP was an English solicitor and  indeed was done when MWP was pretending to be an English solicitor. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in"> MWP's  justification for this,  when confronted by a complaint about fees, is that the Act has no application because MWP is an off-shore BVI   and  is immune from its operation. That is an unattractive submission.  Were it to prevail, I would agree with Mr Bacon that it would enable any foreign lawyer to masquerade as an English solicitor, do work as an English solicitor but then to argue in the event of a dispute about fees, that the clients could not  make use  the statutory rights they would be able to exercise, had the work  been done by a legal representative falling within  the category of "solicitor" set out in  CPR 3.2.    For that reason, I am satisfied that MWP should not be permitted to benefit from such a masquerade. To do so would be to flout the  principle set out in <span style="font-style:italic">Alghussein v Eton College</span> and the long line of authorities recited therein, succinctly encapsulated by Lord Jauncey on page 594 at D that "no man can take advantage of his own wrong" . It would  enable MWP to have arbitrated, sums it has charged the Claimants  for acting as an English solicitor when it says it has not, and at the same time, to deprive those same Claimants of the opportunity to  argue before  this court, that the fees claimed for work done when MWP  purported to be an English solicitor, should be assessed under the Act. Were a stay to be granted, such an outcome would be manifestly unjust to the Claimants. For that reason, I consider that MWP, being in breach of the terms of the engagement letter for the reasons given here and  in paragraph 103,  cannot rely on the agreement to arbitrate for its own advantage and that, accordingly, the agreement  is null, void  and inoperative.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">If I be wrong in my finding that MWP held itself out as  English solicitors, the position for MWP is no better. Suppose that Mr Wilson is right and that  MWP never  acted in this capacity and did not carry on or have a business address within the jurisdiction, indeed that the address that he  inserted in the Form N 9 was just "a correspondence address" (Wilson 4 paragraph19). The upshot, in my judgment, is that identified by Mr Bacon: a reserved activity will have been carried out in breach of section 20 of the Act, possibly a criminal offence will have been committed under s.20(2),  an address for service will have been given that is not a business address and the High Court in the Jenington litigation will have been misled into believing that MWP was a legal representative as defined in CPR 3.2 when it was not. To permit MWP to rely on the arbitration agreement in these circumstances would again, in my view, enable MWP to take advantage of its own wrong doings. For that reason,  the agreement to arbitrate would be null and void even if  Mr Wilson were  to be correct in his assertion that MWP is not and never has been a firm of English solicitors.</p>

That is an argument for another day. It is, rather, a decision that the Family's ability to advance  that argument should  not be stopped in its tracks now by granting a stay, thereby permitting MWP to proceed with its arbitration without the bother of a Solicitors Act assessment hanging over it.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">All of this ties in with Mr Holland's final argument concerning the court's inherent jurisdiction to grant a stay. He submits that the arbitration is likely to take place much more quickly than any determination by court proceedings and, for his part,  Mr Wilson contends that MWP has perfectly valid, legitimate and proper commercial reasons for including the arbitration clause in the engagement letter (Wilson 3 paragraph 56). The reason for that is that  judgments of the English courts cannot be enforced in Kazakhstan where the bulk of the Family's assets lie (paragraph 54). I infer that Mr Wilson  suspects that any adjudication on costs in MWP's favour will be ignored unless it is in the form of an arbitration award. All that is unjust, he says, so a stay should be granted on those grounds too. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In so far as these submissions go to the exercise of any residual power to order a stay under the inherent jurisdiction of the court, they do not carry much weight with me. It is plain from Mr Wilson's own evidence that he had concerns about the Family's willingness to pay legal fees even before MWP agreed to take on their case. An "engagement fee" referred to under paragraph 2 of the engagement letter concerned a balance of $ 162,509.53  said to be due under a prior arbitration in respect of which the Family had defaulted. For that reason, MWP would not start work until it was paid - (Wilson 3 paragraph 44.4).  This leads to an  inference  being drawn  that unless there is a stay and the arbitration goes ahead, MWP will go unpaid, because the Family will refuse to honour any certificate issued by this court. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgment, these are not matters which should bear upon whether or not there should be a stay. If Mr Wilson considers that permitting these proceedings to continue will be a bar to MWP's legitimate claims in the arbitration, or indeed, that the only purpose of these proceedings is so that the Family can "delay payment of MWP's outstanding bills and cause unnecessary costs to be unreasonably incurred" (Wilson 3 paragraph 51),  he could usefully reflect that any financial difficulties in this respect would have been avoided had money on account  been taken before MWP did the work in the first place.  In any case, considerations about MWP's cash flow must be subordinate to the Family's legitimate opportunity  to seek an order for the assessment of the very substantial bills that  MWP has rendered. For these reasons, the application for a stay must fail.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I would add that in rejecting MWP's application, I am not saying that MWP is an English solicitor when it is not, in the sense that I am exercising a jurisdiction which cannot be conferred on the court by agreement or estoppel. The limit of the decision is that, for the purposes of this judgment, I do not need to make a finding about whether he/MWP was a solicitor and/or is subject to the Act. It is sufficient to find that in MWP  holding itself out as and having behaved as a solicitor, it would be unjust for it  to benefit from the arbitration clause, in relation to deciding how much MWP should be paid for work done when it was  pretending it was an English solicitor. Moreover, it would be a further injustice to the Family, in my judgment, if MWP  were  able to have an arbitration award enforced  for  work done during that pretence, before those responsible for satisfying that award (the Claimants) have had an opportunity in these proceedings to decide whether the fees are at least capable of  being assessed by this court under the Act.  For that reason, Mr Holland's argument on estoppel either does not arise or, if it does, is misplaced.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">  In conclusion, I need to emphasise that the parties' submissions have been wide ranging. In particular (and by way of examples only), much emphasis has been placed upon whether MWP is subject to the Act, whether Mr Wilson is a solicitor of the courts of England and Wales, whether, if so, he/MWP are subject to the Code, whether or not there is a contentious business agreement and whether the arbitration clause falls foul of UCTA and/or UTTCR.  I  have thought long and hard about whether  these points    needed   to be resolved before I could  answer the discrete question posed in the application notice- should there be a stay?  In the end,  I concluded that reaching final views on any of them was unnecessary in order to do so. First, and most obviously, the application before the court is about whether there should be a stay. Whether or not the engagement letter is a contentious business agreement and/ or whether the court should be making orders against MWP for delivery of bills under s.68 of the Act, are arguments for another day. The court is not seised of them on this application. Second, it is agreed that the invoices rendered to Aidar  are excluded from the request for the stay because they do not form  part of the arbitration. Accordingly, a further hearing will be required to decide whether they are eligible to be and if so, should be the subject of an order for assessment under s.70 of the Act. The invoices rendered under the engagement letter will be  part of that same argument. Third, I do not need to make any finding about whether MWP is or is not a regulated body and is, or is not, subject to the Code, in order to decide whether there should be a stay.  For the reasons I have given, I consider the argument advanced by Mr Bacon in relation to MWP's breach and the rule that a party cannot benefit from his own   wrongdoing, by itself gets the Claimants home.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The application dated 27 January 2012 is dismissed. To save costs, there is no need for the parties to attend when this judgment is handed down. Any application for permission to appeal will be dealt with on paper with brief submissions to be lodged in writing within 14 days of the date of this judgment if permission is sought.  So far as costs are concerned, it would appear irresistible that MWP must pay the Claimants' costs, to be assessed if not agreed. If MWP disagree, I will accept written submissions why this should not be the case, also within 14 days of the date of handing down. The Claimants, if so advised, may lodge counter- submissions within 14 days thereafter and I will decide the point on paper. There will also need to be a further hearing to decide whether the invoices rendered by MWP to the Claimants and those to Aidar alone, should be assessed under s.70 of the Act. As to that, the parties will need to liaise about a hearing date and a  time estimate and, in particular, the level and extent of any further material to be deployed.   If a brief directions hearing is required, this can be convened on short notice  on a date convenient to all.</p>
