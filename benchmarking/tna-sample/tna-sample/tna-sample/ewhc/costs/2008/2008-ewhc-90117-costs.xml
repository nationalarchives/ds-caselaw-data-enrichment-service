The first Defendant was driving a stolen vehicle which collided with that of the Claimant, and the second Defendant was the insurer of the vehicle driven by the first Defendant. Ultimately the case settled for some £675,000 plus standard basis costs by a consent order of 25 May 2007.</span>

No ATE insurance policy was recommended or taken out. The bill is in the total sum of £146,094.10 inclusive of VAT, success fee and disbursements, and the base costs for the CFA part of the bill are claimed at £73,715.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">The essence of the concern of public policy with maintenance was said to be about behaviour which might ‘inflame or stir up litigation’, whereas champerty was an aggravated form of maintenance where the maintainer might not only inflame litigation but may also be tempted, by his interest in the litigation, to suborn justice.  The ‘key’ to champerty was a financial stake in the outcome of the litigation, and it was that stake which increased the temptations which might exist to secure an outcome which was of ‘financial comfort’ to the solicitor.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Thus whilst the older cases used expressions such as ‘division of the spoils’, the public policy against champerty did not depend on that specific type of financial interest but was aimed generally against arrangements which might cause the temptation to interfere with justice as a result of the solicitor’s financial interest. It was said that it would be irrational for the law to condemn a solicitor for taking, for example a 1% interest in litigation which might be a very small interest in winning, whilst not also condemning an agreement whereby the solicitor was taking the risk of being liable for a potentially very large sum by agreeing to indemnify the client against an opponent’s costs in the event of loss in the litigation conducted by him, and therefore had a large potential financial interest in the outcome. Avoidance of a loss under the indemnity clause was equivalent to personal gain.</span>

What one had here was a transaction exposing the solicitor to the temptations against which the modern policy was directed. The solicitor provided conditional fee terms and an indemnity against costs, which were an integral part of the retainer and were the sorts of things clients were most worried about, as part of the financial arrangement. There were two types of direct interest in the outcome namely the conventional ‘division of the spoils’ under a CFA and also the open ended liability taken on by the solicitor for adverse costs. That was the basis on which the solicitor acted and the court was to be concerned with the question whether this was a transaction which might have led to the temptation to act contrary to the interests of justice. It was also not a type of agreement specifically authorised by s.58 of the CLSA, and there was nothing in that section which prevented the court from finding that the agreement was unenforceable for reasons related to the nature of the solicitor’s financial interest in the case.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">That distinction between champerty and maintenance, Mr Morgan said, was crucial. The essence of champerty was a division of the spoils, and conducting litigation for person gain from the results. It was not correct to equate the notion of personal gain with the notion of avoiding personal loss under the indemnity as the defendant did.  The distinction had always been between cases where the spoils were shared and those where the spoils were not shared. A maintainer, as distinguished from a champertous maintainer, had always suffered the expense of maintaining the litigation and in most cases paying some or all of the costs in the event of a loss, and in that way had always had some interest in the outcome. In the case of champerty the public policy had been reflected in two ways namely that a solicitor could not take a percentage share of the spoils and the rule that a success fee could not exceed 100%. Both were essentially client protection concerns. CFA’s had led to a relaxation of the old rule that solicitors could not stipulate for a share of the spoils, but the extent permitted was limited for client protection reasons.</span>

The quotation relied on did not equate champerty and maintenance. The use of the two words together was because champerty and maintenance were a class of which champerty was a subspecies of maintenance, hence the two words used together in the extract relied on by the second Defendant did not imply that there was a special rule for solicitors in relation to all types of maintenance.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">The law did not treat champerty by solicitors in the same way as maintenance by solicitors. Former solicitors’ practice rule 8 had barred contingency fees (payable only in the event of success). But there had been no hint in Rule 8 of a ban on maintenance by a solicitor in the form of agreeing to an indemnity against inter partes costs. The focus, for champerty, was on the fee received, and that was why in the history of common law champerty and maintenance had been treated differently for solicitors. That distinction could not be elided now. The importance of that distinction went to whether or not the CLSA s.58 should be seen as ‘an island of legality’ in sea of illegality legitimising otherwise unlawful champertous maintenance in the form of a CFA, or whether it was seen as regulating entire gamut of maintenance. It was the Claimant’s case that the former was correct and that s.58 related to champerty only and did not govern other species of maintenance.</span>

The key was to address the particular mischiefs against which public policy was directed.  Was there an interest which might ‘tempt one to tamper’? The promise to pay inter partes costs was all part of the process of making profit by gaining the instructions as a commercial activity. Financial gain was the point of the transaction as a whole. Avoidance of a loss should be seen as a gain and the court should not ignore an open ended liability to pay costs since that was more of a temptation to tamper than a modest percentage would have been.</span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">“If there is a controversy about the scope of a legal rule, or of a head of public policy, a good starting point is to inquire into the historical origin of it. Legal history can help to illuminate the present law. In modern idiom maintenance is the support of litigation by a stranger without just cause. Champerty is an aggravated form of maintenance. The distinguishing feature of champerty is the support of litigation by a stranger in return for a share of the proceeds. The evolution of maintenance is rooted in mediaeval history. In Martell v Consett Iron Ltd [1955] 1 All ER 481, [1955] Ch 363 Danckwerts J stated that the English law of maintenance was the product of particular abuses which arose in the conditions of English mediaeval society. The judgment of Danckwerts J, which has long been regarded as the locus classicus in the field, contains a valuable review of the early reported case law. But it is in an article by Professor Winfield, the great Cambridge legal scholar, that a detailed explanation of the origin of maintenance and champerty is given: see 'The history of maintenance and champerty' (1919) 35 LQR 50. At the risk of oversimplifying the results of Professor Winfield's research, it seems that one of the abuses which afflicted the administration of justice was the practice of assigning doubtful or fraudulent claims to royal officials, nobles or other persons of wealth and influence, who could in those times be expected to receive a very sympathetic hearing in the court proceedings. The agreement often was that the assignee would maintain the action at his own expense, and share the proceeds of a favourable outcome with the assignor. Often these disputes involved a claim to the possession of land, and the subsequent sharing of land if the action was successful. Two factors contributed to the growth of these abuses. First, detachment and disinterestedness was not the hallmark of the mediaeval judiciary. There was in truth no independent judiciary. Secondly, the civil justice system was not yet developed, and it was not capable of exposing abuses of legal procedure and giving effective redress. In these conditions a patchwork of statutes created the offences of maintenance and champerty as well as the torts of maintenance and champerty. And there was apparently a parallel common law development in respect of maintenance and champerty.</span>

Modern public policy condemns champerty in a lawyer whenever he seeks to recover - not only his proper costs - but also a portion of the damages for himself: or when he conducts a case on the basis that he is to be paid if he wins but not if he loses.”</span>

It follows that the agreement in this case has to be considered in that light on its own terms, weighing against it the countervailing public policy favouring access to justice and any other relevant matters. I will return to carry out that exercise in due course but will first deal with the alternative limb of Mr Williams’ submissions which was that (whether or not champertous and contrary to public policy) this was an unlawful, unauthorised form of maintenance.</span>

That is the main concern of the specific public policy against ‘wanton and officious’ unjustified maintenance (a concern different from the concerns discussed in the previous paragraphs of this judgment in relation to champerty and having its own historic roots). However it is also quite clear that maintenance is frequently a perfectly acceptable practice which can facilitate access to justice and actively prevent injustice, by enabling a litigant to pursue a case or defend a claim which might otherwise be inadequately presented.</span>

Their client had suffered real injuries, had a real basis for his claim, and was rated (admittedly by the solicitors themselves) as standing a high prospect of success for the purposes of the CFA success fee (25% success fee, which, referring to the ‘ready reckoner’ in Cook on Costs translates into an 80% prospect of success). Both in general and on the facts of this case this is not an instance of ‘wanton and officious intermeddling’ which would be capable of rendering the fee agreement unenforceable simply on the grounds of the public policy relating to maintenance.</span>

It can, I think, be summarised in two statements. First, in litigation a professional lawyer's role is to advise his client with a clear eye and an unbiased judgment. Secondly, a solicitor retained to conduct litigation is not merely the agent and adviser to his client, but also an officer of the court with a duty to the court to ensure that his client's case, which he must, of course, present and conduct with the utmost care of his client's interests, is also presented and conducted with scrupulous fairness and integrity. A barrister owes similar obligations. A legal adviser who acquires a personal financial interest in the outcome of the litigation may obviously find himself in a situation in which that interest conflicts with those obligations …" </span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">I must consider the public policy set out above, applied to this particular agreement with this particular indemnity clause and consider in the process any other relevant competing factors. The following are aspects which I consider are of most relevance, bearing in mind that the object of the public policy is to protect the due administration of justice having particular regard to the interests of the defendant (the party faced with the litigation funded under the fee agreement):</span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">(1) The indemnity provision in this agreement was uncapped (whether by reference to a fixed sum or a percentage of costs). The solicitors faced the potential for liability for the whole of the opponent’s costs if the case was lost. Their exposure in the event of failure potentially far exceeded the value to them in the event of success (success would bring normal fees plus a 25% success fee, failure would bring zero fees plus, probably, full liability to pay the opposing party’s costs). In a significant case such as this that could have been a large sum to lose, by any standards, if the case was lost at a late stage or after a trial, and that could have placed pressure on solicitors to pursue litigation by improper means to avoid such a loss. Some firms would be put out of business by a loss of the size which one might incur from litigation of this sort, and virtually any firm would regard the potential exposure, if the litigation became prolonged, as significant. The court must concern itself with whether there is a material risk that a solicitor, perhaps late on in the litigation and faced with a duty to disclose a document likely to cause the loss of the case (under an order for standard disclosure creating the duty of disclosure of adverse documents) might be tempted to fail to discharge that duty rather than incur a – by that stage large - liability under the clause.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">(2) The case was assessed as having a high chance of success (as noted before, 25% success fee connoting an 80% chance of success), which does go to mitigate the pressure which a solicitor would feel at the start. But of course the prospects of success are assessed at the outset and risks change in the course of litigation.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">(3) I have been presented with no evidence that the potential loss was either underwritten, or otherwise provided for in advance. A solicitor who has either insured himself with some external policy, or has set aside a fund to risk for a given case or class of cases might be in a considerably less difficult position than a solicitor who risks money without having made advance provision to cover the loss.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">(4) On the other hand, a claimant’s solicitor having a stake of the sort imposed by the indemnity clause could, up to a point, benefit a defendant and the interests of justice in that a solicitor who is risking his own money may be less likely to fight a bad case from the outset and may be less likely to pursue a case in an extravagant or overblown manner.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">(5) A further benefit to the defendant is that in the event of success, the provision of the indemnity by the solicitor is an additional source of funds from which the defendant may ultimately obtain satisfaction of his costs. He is not worse off, and may be better off in respect of recovering his costs in the event of a ‘win’ than he would be if the claimant had represented himself.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">(6) Still further on the positive side, the provision of an indemnity clause could facilitate access to justice in a commercial environment where the availability of insurance cover is not necessarily guaranteed and where ‘legal aid’ funding is for most purposes now limited to those with very restricted means in specific areas of litigation.</span>

There was a regulatory body, the Financial Services Authority, which regulated insurers, vetted them and policed them. Their solvency was monitored and there were requirements as to asset holdings. Insurers were not permitted to perform other types of business in the UK so as to avoid conflicts of interest and prevent excessive asset risk. Mr Williams contrasted those protections with the protections to the Claimant in this case – he had none of them and the scope of the indemnity clause was limited inasmuch as it appeared to cover only a costs liability in the event of loss, not other costs liabilities such as interlocutory costs or the costs of losing a particular issue, which might be incurred and which might be covered by a commercial ATE policy.</span>

The first was that this court could not make such an order unless some other court as between the solicitors and the Claimant made an order rendering the contract enforceable. The Claimant came before the court with an unenforceable contract and this court did not have the power under s.28 to make such an order. Further, if the court was considering making such an order it would be impossible for the same counsel to represent both the solicitor and client. If this court refused to allow the contract to be enforced in respect of the costs proceedings it would be unthinkable that a later court would think it just and equitable to allow it to be enforced as against Mr Dix by the solicitors. The second reason was that there was simply a lack of evidence which could show there was any reason to suppose the solicitor reasonably believed she was not contravening the ‘general prohibition’ in s.19. The statutory criterion in s.28(5) concerning reasonable belief was not merely directed to ignorance of the law, not knowing that carrying out or effecting unauthorised insurance was unlawful, but was intended to deal with the scenario where someone embarked on a transaction giving it thought, and reasonably believed that it was not caught by the general prohibition. </span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Mr Morgan accepted that the notion of ‘a premium’ did not necessarily mean a money payment (Channell J at 663 had said only that the consideration was ‘usually’ for payments called premiums) but submitted that there was nonetheless a requirement for something that could properly be called a premium. There was in this case no premium, and the sums payable to the solicitors were not related to the risk of the indemnity becoming payable or to the sums payable if the indemnity was triggered. Instead the sums payable to the solicitors were related to the amount of work done by the solicitors and the risk that they would not earn the base costs for their work (he cited para. 1-2). Para. 1-8 of the same text was cited in support of the view that separate consideration referable to the risk which the indemnity represents was an essential ingredient of insurance which was missing in this case. There was no premium.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">He accepted that there was a contractual obligation to pay in the event of the case being lost, but argued that care was needed not to apply the common law definition of contract insurance, in a regulatory context, in such a broad way that a range of activities which would not otherwise be regulated fell within the scope of regulation. Not every contract of indemnity, even for consideration, was a contract of insurance. He gave examples such as a contract for the sale of a business which included warranties that certain things have been done, backed by indemnities against the things warranted turning out in fact not to have been done. Such contracts were for consideration and contained indemnities but had never been said to be unregulated contracts of insurance. There could be situations where insurance benefits linked to a credit card were separately provided in a contract of insurance, but there were also occasions where insurance linked to a credit card was but a small part of a wider contract with the card provider, which he said would not a ‘contract of insurance’ for the FSMA. He also referred to the practice whereby a solicitor who has made a mistake in the course of litigation tells the client that he has made a mistake and that an application can be made to try to rectify the problem, and that he will not charge the client for making the application, and will pay the costs if the application fails. That was a common arrangement – there was consideration in the form of forbearance by the client from taking his instructions elsewhere, there was an indemnity, and that was a contractual arrangement.</span>

Accordingly, the court is left with the question whether the activities described above (so far as not disputed), of themselves, constituted the carrying on of business in the United Kingdom.

I was nonetheless he argued not prevented from exercising that discretion. The submission was that the court was being asked to declare the agreement enforceable only after the litigation was over and the indemnity was not to be called upon and where the solicitor only sought entitlement to be paid costs on success. It was not just and equitable to disallow such costs.</p>

It was disputed that the discretion provided by that section was applicable in a case such as this where the matter to which s.28 was directed related to the contractual relationship within an insurance contract between the solicitor and his client and not to the relationship between the opposing parties in the context of a costs matter. It was accepted that in general a Master could exercise the powers of the High Court albeit that it would be improbable that a dispute over the contractual enforceability of an insurance contract as between the client and solicitor would ever come before a costs court for a decision under s.28. In CFA cases for example the costs courts had not previously made use of general powers such as the power to rectify a contract, so as to enable an otherwise invalid CFA to be relied on in costs proceedings.</p>

This was a case where a solicitor had agreed to stand in the position of an insurer instead of the client taking out ATE insurance and the agreement should be seen as insurance. Insurance was said to be something which one recognised when one saw it despite being difficult to describe in advance.</p>

The concept of ‘principal object’ set out in 1-8 of <span style="font-style:italic">MacGillivray</span> was on the second Defendant’s case derived from a VAT case and the passage went on to accept that the principal object test was not always applicable. It would he said be surprising if one could defeat the regulations on the basis that the insurance was not a significant part of the contract.  It was not in any event the case that the provision of an indemnity was a merely minor matter. One of the main concerns of a client would be what happened if there were adverse costs.</p>

By “circular” I mean that the definition of a contract of insurance in Art. 3 is in terms that it is a contract of either of two types of insurance, and legal expenses insurance is defined as one such type of contract of insurance.

The point was not decided in either case. It is certainly necessary to distinguish an insurance contract from the express or implied undertaking of a contracting party to pay damages, or to perform some other secondary obligation, such as the repair of a defective article, in the event of his own failure to perform a primary obligation. To admit that a person may offer insurance against the possibility that he himself may commit some voluntary act would be to risk confusing this necessary distinction. It is therefore submitted that the event upon which a contract of insurance depends must be an event outside the control of the insurer.”</span>

One point which Mr Morgan made was that this case was considered by the solicitor to be so strong that, effectively, losing it would have amounted to conceding a claim in damages for negligence. I follow his point but, events beyond a solicitor’s control – pure fortuities - can cause a lost case just as surely as negligence.</span>

That is not a matter under the control of the solicitor. A case can be lost through misfortune – such as the death of a witness, also not a matter properly under the solicitor’s control. On the other hand a case can be lost through negligent performance of the retainer which is a matter caused by the solicitor’s performance of the retainer or similarly by non-negligent acts which with the benefit of hindsight are misjudged. Again, that is within the control of the solicitor.</span>

In that respect he differs from an ATE provider in the marketplace, which contracts at relative arm’s length and does not exert the level of (incomplete) control which a solicitor can exert over the outcome. If such a clause as encountered in this case stood alone in a contract, the contract would be for the provision of cover which had elements of insurance and elements of conventional contractual indemnity in respect of matters under the solicitor’s control.</span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic">“… The inclusion of indemnity provisions within a contract for the supply of services neither makes the indemnifier an insurer nor justifies describing the contract as wholly or partly one of insurance. When a contract of sale or for services contains elements of insurance it will be regarded as a contract of insurance only if, taking the contract as a whole, it has as its principal object the provision of insurance. So where a ‘card protection plan’ offered insurance and other facilities to subscribers, it was held to be a contract for the provision of insurance, and so exempt from value added tax, because the dominant objective of the plan was to offer insurance against financial loss and the non-insurance services provided were viewed as minor and ancillary to that aim. The ‘principal object’ test is not, however appropriate where the contract in question does not have distinct insurance and non-insurance elements, and the question at issue is whether it is properly to be characterised as insurance. In Fuji Finance Inc v Aetna Life Insurance Co.[…] the Court of Appeal held that the correct approach was to characterise the contract as a whole and then see if it came within the definition of life assurance, which it did.”</span>

Instead when we look at the provision rendering agreements unenforceable we see at s.26(3) the words that an “Agreement” is an agreement “the making or performance of which<span style="text-decoration:underline"> constitutes</span>, <span style="text-decoration:underline">or is part of</span>, the regulated activity in question”,  which does not include provision that “Agreement” is an agreement the making of <span style="text-decoration:underline">any part of which</span> constitutes the regulated activity.</p>

It is sufficient that there is consideration consistent with the creation of a contract (and that would in my judgment be satisfied by the Claimant’s agreement to be liable for fees in the event of success).</span>

Accordingly the contract was not “a contract of insurance” and would not have been rendered unenforceable under s.26 of FSMA. The second Defendant accordingly fails on preliminary point II.</span>
