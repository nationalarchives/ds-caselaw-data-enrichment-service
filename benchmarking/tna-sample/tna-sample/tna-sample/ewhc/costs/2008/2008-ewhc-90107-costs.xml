	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The issue in this reserved judgment relates to the appropriate hourly rates recoverable by the receiving parties.

This includes ensuring that the parties are on an equal footing and saving expense so far as possible.  Cases must also be dealt with in a way which is proportionate to the amount of money at stake, the importance and complexity of the case and the parties’ financial positions.  These factors will therefore affect the proportion of your costs you are likely to recover from other parties, even if successful.</p>

I believe that Denton Wilde Sapte invoiced on this basis.  The hourly rates were apparent from the invoices.  The invoices were all accepted by Medivent and at no time did I ever query those hourly rates with Denton Wilde Sapte;  I regarded these hourly rates as the agreed rates from time to time.  I had many discussions with the partner responsible for the matter, John Hull.  We often discussed costs with him.  I did not query with him the basis on which Denton Wilde Sapte billed Medivent.</p>

The answer is that, for all practical purposes, Dr Hayek was Medivent Limited.  He was its principal director and its principal shareholder.  Medivent was a one man company and that one man was Dr Hayek.  Nothing would have been served by my sending a separate client care letter to Medivent since, as its director and main shareholder, it would have come to Dr Hayek’s attention and he would have dealt with it.  Given the reality of the position, which was that Medivent Limited was Dr Hayek in a corporate form, I looked at the reality of the position.</p>

Dranez Anstalt, a Liechtenstein company, did in a separate action which has been called the Patent Action.  I give more details of this below.  In the Patent Action Particulars of Claim, it was alleged that Medivent had infringed a patent and that Dr Hayek had induced it to do so.  The Particulars of Claim asserted that, as Medivent’s main director and shareholder and hence its directing mind and will, Dr Hayek’s knowledge became that of his company.  They were, in effect, one and the same.  That was an argument adopted by Dranez Anstalt in the Patent Action and I am content to rely on it also for these purposes.</p>

The claimant was Dranez Anstalt and the defendants were Dr Hayek and Medivent Limited.  The action alleged infringement of a UK patent for respiratory technology, the inventor of which was Dr Hayek himself.  He had assigned the patent several years previously to Dranez Anstalt.  In fact, Dranez Anstalt was not the owner of the patent since it had assigned it to another Liechtenstein company called Dranez Holdings.  Dranez Anstalt’s then solicitors, Mischon de Reya, either did not know about this, or did not consider it particularly important.  The result however was that the action was struck out and recommenced in the name of the correct claimant, i.e. the owner of the patent concerned, Dranez Holdings.</p>

The Possession Action was a claim that Dr Hayek held his house in trust for Samuel Hayek.  Relatively little was done on that case.

The letter provided for monthly billing and to bills to be paid within 30 days and cautioned against allowing costs to build up.  It set out the hourly rate for the partner (£350) and the assistant solicitor (£150).  In the event of a change in or addition to the team the First Defendant would be informed.  There was no indication that hourly rates would be reviewed and increased.  Mr Grant explained that errors had crept into the original bill in that Mr Hull had agreed to continue work at the existing rate of £350 until the end of November 2000 instead of the increase taking effect on 1 September 2000.  The necessary amendments had been made and an amended bill had been served.  That explanation did not cover a subsequent period identified by Mr Bowden.  It was conceded by Mr Grant and Mr Hull that the increase was deferred from 1 September to 31 November 2000.</p>

Our approach to try and persuade clients who have not paid to settle matters by negotiation and this is usually done best by the partner responsible for the clients’ individual matter or matters.  This matter was first reported to me after John Hull, in conjunction with another partner, Simon Levine (John Hull’s head of department) had attempted to recover costs from Dr Hayek.  They had a meeting with Dr Hayek in April 2003.  I have spoken to John Hull about that meeting and have also seen correspondence relating to it.   The thrust of that meeting was that John Hull was expecting Dr Hayek to make substantial payments on account of costs in consideration of which we would proceed further with recovery of costs from Mr Berber who was thought to be (as appears to be the case) the only one of the Claimants who is in a position to settle the costs ordered.  At about that time, Dr Hayek told my firm that he expected to obtain substantial funding from external investors to his company.  Further, he represented that his company was in the process of obtaining substantial orders for his RTX machine.</p>

Suffice it to say that in my opinion and on the basis of what I have seen of this matter, the allegations are unwarranted and ill considered.

He is the sole proprietor of a substantial house in Hendon (10 Downage, London NW4) which, I am told by John Hull, was purchased by Dr Hayek in April 1992 for around £500,000.  No professional valuation of this property has been undertaken and John Hull believes it is probably worth in excess of £1m and I note that Dr Hayek completed a witness statement in the action (in March 2002) in which he said the same thing.</p>

There are, of course, no guarantees but I am of the view that proceeding to recover costs from Dr Hayek would be anything but a lost cause.”</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.39in;text-indent:-0.39in">“8.<marker name="tab"/>Turning to my own role I have had initially to define the nature of my review, aided by helpful submissions of Mr Mark Turner QC for the Applicants and Mr Brian Leveson QC for the solicitors.  My first conclusion is that what I am concerned with is not just the charging rate sought by the solicitors, but that charging rate as applied uniformly to the hours of Mr Barron: 806 as claimed, some 700 as taxed, with some 596 having accrued by the meeting of the 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 1992.  As it seems to me, if there was client approval of that rate as uniformly applied to those hours then a presumption is raised for the purposes of r.15(2) sufficient to displace indemnity taxation of that item – whether that is a presumption under 15(2)(a) or (b) may be difficult to say but matters not.  My further conclusion is that the quality of the approval has to be such as to raise a presumption.  In the course of argument I talked of ‘informed’ approval and even with reflection I adhere to that concept.  To rely on the Applicants’ approval the solicitor must satisfy me that it was secured following a full and fair exposition of the factors relevant to it so that the Applicants, lay persons as they are, can reasonably be bound by it.  What if I uphold Master Pollard’s finding in favour of a presumption?  I have no doubt but that then his taxation of this item has to be upheld.  True, I accept the submission that the 1986 change from the terms of Order 62 r.29 to the already cited Order 62 r.15(2) served to leave any such presumption rebuttable, but I can conceive of no basis for rebuttal when and if I am satisfied of informed approval.  What if I reject the finding of Master Pollard?  The answer has to be taxation of this item on an indemnity basis as assisted by my assessors.  Finally, before turning to the facts, I remind myself that I am bound by the findings of primary fact made by Master Pollard, all as set out earlier in this judgment;  the inferences to be drawn from such as susceptible to my review.  I should add that at the outset of the hearing Mr Turner indicated that there was no appeal against those findings of fact.”</p>

Otherwise, its enforceability may change during the lifetime of the contract, thus making the contractual position between solicitor and client uncertain from day to day, according to whether, at the point in time when the issue is being considered, it can be shown that the client has or has not suffered detriment as a result of the breach.”</p>

For this reason, it is argued, they are not on strong ground in seeking to overturn the Master’s ruling so as to claim the right to more than one increase in hourly rates (and indeed percentages said to range from 11% to 23%).  It would be necessary to show that such significant, unheralded and retrospective changes were consistent with the relevant Regulation.</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">78.<marker name="tab"/>The ‘procedural formality’ formulation rather suggests that it is permissible in a CFA case effectively to by-pass the contractual process of agreeing fees between solicitor and client for the reason that the other side is likely to be paying.  On the present law, however, that would clearly not be correct.  The fees are required to be agreed with the client in the conventional way.  What that involves is a need for the client’s informed approval:  see e.g. <span style="font-style:italic">MacDougall v Boote Edgar Esterkin</span> [2001] 1 Costs LR 118.</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">79.<marker name="tab"/>What was said on Schillings’ behalf  was broadly as follows.  The contract conferred on them an express right to review their charges.  Moreover, that right extends to multiple reviews and the revised rates, following each and every such review, would be binding on the client even when notified after the event.  The words ‘review date’ should not be construed as signifying only one date, but are sufficiently broad to embrace periodic reviews.  It would be up to the solicitor to decide how many reviews there should be and at what intervals.  The natural reading of the words (it is said) would be that notification to the clients ‘must inevitably be retrospective because the solicitor has to make the decision before there is anything to tell the client’.  There would be no need for a ‘discursive exchange between solicitor and client’, and it would not be unusual for a solicitor to be entitled to make a unilateral decision about rates.</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">80.<marker name="tab"/>In other words, the clients must pay what they are told without any chance to be consulted or to object.  It thus appears to be the Schillings stance that the unilateral decision by the solicitor to charge the clients what he likes, and to keep them in the dark for months about what they are being charged, should be regarded as a ‘procedural formality’.  So much for transparency.  I do not see how this could be consistent with the wording of the regulation cited above.</p>

The absence of an express ‘reasonableness’ test would only be critical if the clients were materially prejudiced by its omission: <span style="font-style:italic">Hollins v Russell </span>[2003] EWCA Civ 718, <span style="text-decoration:underline">[2003] 4 All ER 590</span>.

Much of their argument, which I have attempted to summarise above, is predicated upon the proposition that charges in a CFA case are arrived at on a contractual basis like in any other case, but this is shown to be something of a fiction at the final hurdle because the analogy breaks down.  An extraneous element is introduced in judging ‘prejudice’ or ‘detriment’ to the client; namely, that some third party is going to pay – not the client.”</p>

That did not amount to a variation of the terms of the lease, but it did mean that the landlords were, in legal electable terms, estopped from insisting that the tenant should revert to strict compliance with the lease unless they gave reasonable notice to that effect.  It followed that the defendants as assignees of the landlords’ interest were subject to the same restraint.  The relevant enquiry was, therefore, whether the defendants through new agents had given such notice and whether the tenants’ conduct could be described as ‘persistent’ disregard of the rent obligation after that notice was given …”</p>

He reminded me of the sort of rates that were being allowed for that sort of work in cases such as in<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold"> re a Company and KPG Peat Marwick </span>in 2000 and submitted that the cap apart the rates claimed for work done by the Receiving Parties up to 2001 would not have been allowed at the rates claimed on the basis of the then accepted going rates in assessments.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In his submissions Mr Fairbairn drew my attention to the case of <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Higgs v Camden &amp; Islington Health Authority </span>[2003] 2 Costs LR 211, [2003]EWHC 15 (QB).  I am fairly familiar with that case because it was an appeal from a decision of mine to Fulford J.  In that case I had decided that for a very difficult clinical negligence case a senior partner in a firm in Central London was entitled to charge at the rate of £350 per hour work done at approximately the same period as the work done in this case.   I also, by way of check only, applied the old A + B test and came to the conclusion that my initial feeling that the rate was appropriate was confirmed.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I was then taken by Mr Fairbairn to the so-called “seven pillars of wisdom” (though there are now only six), set out in paragraph CPR 45.5, and sought to establish that on all, or at any rate, most of those heads, this was indeed a very serious and important case from the point of view of Dr Hayek, perhaps more serious and important than it was to the claimants and therefore that had to be put into the balance and was very much in his favour for allowing higher rates.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Finally, Mr Fairbairn sought to deploy an argument which involved producing some very detailed figures in respect of his firm’s overheads and profitability, both in the London office and in the Milton Keynes office.  It appears that this was an attempt to come within the parameters of the decision of Buckley J in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Jones v Secretary of State for Wales </span>[1997] 2 All ER 507, which coincidentally is another case in which I was involved because I was sitting as the Master Assessor with the Judge on that occasion.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It would be quite improper for me to set out any of these figures in this judgment in any event because they are to an extent confidential.   Although apparently previously disclosed to Mr Bowden (but not to the court) they were updated during the course of the hearing and an explanation of the figures was only given on the second day of the hearing.   I had much sympathy with Mr Bowden’s submission that these figures and calculations raised as many questions as answers. </p>

WHERE A PROVINCIAL FIRM OF SOLICITORS </span>carried out specialised work which could not reasonably have been handled by local firms, a taxation of costs made in relation to its work could be calculated at a higher hourly rate than the local average and in such circumstances costs would be reasonably incurred and therefore allowable under RSC Order 62 Rule 12.  Moreover, where a solicitor wished to challenge the fixed rate applied in any area, or to make it a special case for a higher rate he should be required to produce evidence of overheads incurred and matters relating to his solicitor’s skill and expertise could properly be considered in the percentage mark up and not in the hourly rate.”</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Bowden’s simple point was that DWS never has been, nor claimed to be, a provincial firm and therefore the figures which Mr Fairbairn deployed on their behalf are irrelevant.</p>

Although he was based in Milton Keynes the work which he was doing in connection with the S.51 proceedings was highly complex and would easily have justified a Central London firm dealing with it, as indeed happened with Messrs MDR on behalf of his opponents.</p>

I would have allowed £375 for the partner in the Patent proceedings from 1 June 2001 – 31 August 2001.   For the appeal proceedings I would have allowed £375 for a partner throughout.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">However, my decision on the operation of the cap means that the Receiving Party is restricted to £350 for all work done by the partners in the matter and to £150 to all work done by other fee earners.</p>

That mistake will have been caused by Mr Hull deciding to reduce the liability of the client, not by reference to writing off time, but by reducing the hourly rate.   However, whatever the reason that is the rate claimed and the receiving parties are bound by it.</p>
