	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This judgment concerns further preliminary issues about costs which have arisen during the course of housing repair litigation between Birmingham City Council (“the Council”) and its tenants.  Although the Claimant in the present case is Miss Rose Forde  (“Miss Forde”), in reality the dispute is between the Council and her solicitors, McGrath, about what sums, if any, are payable by the Council to McGrath  for costs under the terms of a consent order sealed on 7 June 2006 (“the order”).  The reason for this is that the litigation was funded by two Conditional Fee Agreements (“CFAs”) made between Miss Forde and McGrath on, respectively, 16 March 2005 (“CFA I”) and 5 April 2006 (“CFA II”).  For its part, the Council contends that each CFA is unenforceable and that by operation of the indemnity principle, under which costs recoverable by a receiving party are limited to those which he is liable to pay his own solicitor, there are no costs for the Council to indemnify and accordingly its liability for any costs arising under the terms of the order is nil (see <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Gundry v Sainsbury</span> [1910] KB 645).</p>

Miss Bretherton relied on a skeleton argument lodged by Mr Friston on 17 June 2007, together with her own skeleton dated 4 January 2008, which raised further issues.  On behalf of Miss Forde, Mr Mallalieu lodged a skeleton argument on 17 June 2007 and additionally served a supplemental skeleton on 11 February 2008 in reply to Ms Bretherton’s skeleton, to which she responded the following day.  In total, the five skeleton arguments ran to 90 pages, in addition to which the parties relied on the following witness statements:-</p>

Mr Mallalieu had no questions for either Miss Homfray or Miss Morgan, but evidence was given by Anthony David Bennett Cox, a Senior Legal Adviser employed by the Legal Services Commission (“LSC”) in a witness statement dated 15 February 2008 about which he was questioned by both counsel.  I also heard from Ian Heathcock, a senior case worker employed by the LSC, in compliance with a witness summons served on him by the Council on 14 January 2008.  The parties had also agreed a paginated bundle of documents, (“the bundle”) to which I shall refer.  Having heard argument I reserved judgment.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Birmingham City Council has a very large housing stock which it rents to tenants of modest means.  Historically, the Council has acknowledged that it has had a poor record in housing disrepair and that in many cases, tenants have been compelled to bring claims in order to relieve continuing disrepair.  Many tenants have instructed McGrath, an established legal practice which specialises in housing disrepair claims.  Litigation between the Council and its tenants can arise if breaches of the terms of the landlords’ repairing covenants occur. In this event, it is open to the tenant to claim damages and/or specific performance in the County Court under s.11 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985. The tenant can also bring a statutory claim under s.82 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 in the Magistrates Court.  If proved or admitted, the magistrates must make an order requiring the landlord to carry out works to put the property in a fit state and to specify a timetable for doing so.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In the present case, Miss Forde suffered the effects of disrepair at 120 Quinton Road, Harborne, Birmingham, where she resided under a tenancy commenced in 1996.  Between August 2001 and February 2002 she complained, inter alia, about problems with her specially adapted shower unit which had led to penetrating damp affecting the floor and walls in her kitchen and on the ceiling underneath her bathroom.  She consulted McGrath Environmental Partnership (an entity in the McGrath group of solicitors) which advised her to issue s.82 proceedings.  On 19 June 2004 a nuisance order was made by the Magistrates Court which required Miss Forde to vacate the premises whilst repairs were carried out.  Subsequently, she notified the Council of a civil claim pursuant to s.11 and proceedings were issued on 22 February 2006.  Terms of settlement were agreed on 8 June 2006 under which the Council would pay Miss Forde £5000 in full and final settlement of her s.11 claim together with her costs of the action to be assessed if not agreed.  On 21 September 2006 McGrath served Notice of Commencement of detailed assessment under Civil Procedure Rule (“CPR”) 47.6. The firm’s bill sought profit costs of £12,671.84 (inclusive of a success fee of £5,430.79), disbursements of £285 and vat of £2217.57, total £15,174.41. It is common ground that the damages have been paid but, pending the assessment, the costs have not.</p>

We believe that the risk of the court making such an order is minimal and that therefore we do not believe that a contract of insurance to cover those risks would be appropriate in these circumstances.  We have also advised you that we do not consider that it would be appropriate to insure against your costs and disbursements as the premium is likely to be expensive and would not likely be recoverable if the case is referred to the Small Claims Track.  We have further advised that if the case is allocated to the Fast Track or the Multi-track it will be appropriate at that stage to consider either an application for a Legal Services Commission Public Funding Certificate, or, alternatively, After the Expenses insurance, depending upon your financial circumstances at that time.”</p>

The availability of public funding was also raised in order to challenge the recovery of ATE insurance premiums. Having heard argument, the Master held that the claimants ought to have been told to seek public funding. The claimants’ legal representatives had failed to give a tolerable explanation as to the availability of public funding. Accordingly, the CFAs did not comply with regulation 4 of the 2000 Regulations and were unenforceable save in respect of any disbursements paid.</p>

The “belt” has been to make an application for public funding in any event (Mr Mallalieu’s first skeleton, paragraph 9 and McGrath 1 paragraph 108 and 2 at 154).  The “braces” has been to ask  tenant/clients such as Miss Forde who  signed CFAs in broadly the same form as CFA I, whether they would sign CFA II. This was to be a retrospective CFA entered into in order to counter the Council’s assertion that CFA I is unenforceable (see McGrath 2 paragraphs 55 and 72-77 ).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">For the Council, Miss Bretherton adopted Mr Friston’s submission that it was against Miss Forde’s rational self interest to have terminated CFA I in order to enter into CFA II.  The Council did not suggest there had been any deliberate wrongdoing on McGrath’s part, but the transaction from CFA I to CFA II was an unfavourable bargain which, from Miss Forde’s point of view, could not be explained by ordinary motives.  On the contrary, the altered provisions of CFA II benefited no one except McGrath.  This was plain from a number of factors.  First, CFA I provided a mechanism for “ring fencing” the client’s damages;  CFA II did not.  Second, no success fee was payable under CFA I, whereas CFA II placed Miss Forde under a liability to pay a minimum retrospective success fee of 50 per cent, which would rise to 100 per cent if the claim went to trial. Third, CFA II imposed a liability, (albeit nil), to pay an irrecoverable postponement element in the success fee. Fourth, CFA II contained a mechanism for costs recovery under “Billing Arrangements” whereby Miss Forde could be required to settle any costs ordered to be paid by the Council in the event that her opponent failed to do so.</p>

If a party enters into a transaction which calls for explanation, the law will investigate the manner in which the intention to enter the transaction was secured.  If the intention was induced by unacceptable means, the law will not permit the transaction to stand (see <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Hugueinin v Baseley </span>[1807] 14 VES 273, 3000).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Undue influence can be actual or presumed.  The latter arises out of the relationship between two persons where one has acquired over another a measure of influence or ascendancy in which the ascendant person then takes unfair advantage (see <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Royal Bank of Scotland v Etridge (No.2) </span>[2002] 2 AC 773 at paragraphs 8 to 18).  Miss Bretherton contended that a solicitor and client relationship is a prime example (see <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Willis v Baron </span>[1902] AC 271, H-L) and a client does not have to prove that he reposed trust in his solicitor because an irrebuttable presumption of influence will apply (<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Etridge </span>at 18).  Unlike actual undue influence, where something has to be done to twist the mind of the donor, presumed undue influence is more a case of what has not been done, namely ensuring that independent advice was available to the client (see <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Daniel v Drew </span>[2005] EWCA 507).  For all practical purposes, where, as here, the transaction is between solicitor and client, the solicitor’s burden to prove that the transaction was entered into freely, is discharged only if the client has received adequate independent advice (see judgment of Mummery LJ in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Pesticcio v Huet </span>[2004] EWCA Civ 372 at paragraphs 1 and 23).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In the present case, the reason Miss Forde had been given for exchanging CFA I for CFA II was to be found in the March letter (see paragraph 13 ante).  Miss Bretherton drew attention to the fact that at the date of the letter, Miss Forde had been on benefits and it was reasonable to assume that if she recovered damages in the region of £5000, for her such a sum would represent a significant amount.  However, the inference to be drawn from the March letter was that if she declined to sign CFA II, there would be a delay in receiving her compensation, (a matter that was incorrect as Mr McGrath had accepted in cross examination) and McGrath would refuse to act for her further.  On the material before the court, there was no evidence to rebut the presumption of undue influence; in particular no evidence had been adduced about the nature of the advice Mr Khan had given Miss Forde on his visit on 5 April 2006.  At the least, Miss Forde should have been told that the transaction was an unfavourable one, that she was under no duty or obligation to assist McGrath by entering into CFA II, that even if she had been willing to help McGrath, she was entitled to insist on the ring fencing of her damages and that she should not be put at risk of assuming any liability for payment of the success fee.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Miss Bretherton also  drew attention to the timing of CFA II, given that on the date Mr Khan had asked Miss Forde to sign the document (5 April 2006), the Council had already offered to pay her a total of £4,500.  In a situation such as this where a relationship of trust existed between solicitor and client, a transaction under which the client was to sign a new CFA on more onerous terms than the original CFA, called for an explanation.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Miss Bretherton accepted that if the Court were to find that CFA II had been procured by undue influence, the effect would be to make the contract voidable rather than void.  That said, the equitable doctrine of undue influence existed not only to protect Miss Forde but also to prevent the ascendant person from being able to retain the benefit of a wrongful act (see <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Allcard v Skinner</span> [1887] 36 ChD 145 at 190).  Accordingly, Miss Bretherton submitted that where, as here, the CFA had been procured by undue influence, McGrath should not be permitted to recover any benefit and in so far as Miss Forde had affirmed the agreement, any such affirmation was equally tainted by undue influence.  In any event, where a contract is prohibited by the Solicitors Practice Rules (1990), (a contract procured by undue influence would fall into this category by virtue of Rule 1(c)), the law will not allow such a contract to stand (see <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Mohammed v Alaga &amp; Co (a firm) </span>[2001] 1 WLR 1815. It followed that CFA II was void or, at the very least, unenforceable and by operation of the indemnity principle, the Council was absolved from any responsibility for Miss Forde’s costs under the terms of the order.</p>

She drew attention to the definition of “basic charges” (see paragraph 11 above) with particular reference to “our continuing to act”.  In her submission, the fact of McGrath “continuing to act” under CFA II was a failure of consideration if, as she contended, CFA I had ended on the signing of CFA II;  certainly, there was no consideration at all if McGrath was obliged, as a matter of contract, to continue to act under CFA I.  Indeed, the adverse effect of CFA II on Miss Forde (the key element being the success fee) if CFA I was replaced, far outweighed the value of the worthless promise of “continuing to act” so that even nominal consideration was absent (see <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Re Selective Move Ltd</span> [1995] 1 WLR 474 at 480 – 481).</p>

In the present case, the recoverability of the success fee impacted upon the agreement as a whole because a central feature of CFA II was the retrospective success fee.  In Miss Bretherton’s submission, CFA II was an entire contract and it was not possible to hive off central a element such as the success fee.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In the present case, the Council did not know that there was any potential liability for payment of a success fee until 21 September 2006, when notice of commencement was received with the bill of costs and it had become apparent that there were, in fact, two CFAs in place (see Homfray paragraph 14).   McGrath had contended that Notice of Funding had been served in respect of CFA I using Form N251 on 15 February 2005 (bundle page 281) but it was common ground that that CFA did not claim a success fee. In any case, on the issue of proceedings, CPR 44.15 places the duty to serve the Court and other parties on the receiving party.    That had not happened here.   No evidence had been served that the Court had served the Notice of Funding.    Miss Homfray’s evidence was that the Council had first learned of the success fee upon receipt of the bill.    This evidence had not been rebutted.   In any event, it would have been impossible for Miss Forde to have notified the Council in February 2006 that a success fee would be claimed because, on that date, no CFA with a success fee existed.    In Miss Bretherton’s submission, McGrath could not rely on its error in omitting to delete the words “which provide for a success fee” in the Notice of Funding in relation to CFA I, in order to justify the firm’s claim for an additional liability in respect of CFA II.     Having failed to serve Notice of Funding, the success fee was irrecoverable, but the consequences were not limited to the recovery of the success fee alone and additionally impacted upon the validity of CFA II as a whole.</p>

If that be right, McGrath had thereby purported to contract with Miss Forde in relation to the same subject matter over an identical period of time. In Miss Bretherton’s submission, it was not possible to enforce both CFAs without a double charge arising to the client.  Accordingly the claim for retrospective fees must fail.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">If, contrary to Miss Bretherton’s primary submission, the success fee claimed in CFA II was recoverable, it was the Council’s contention that the level was excessive and ought to be nil.    Miss Bretherton drew attention to the fact that the Council had made a firm and realistic offer before CFA II had been signed (and the risk assessment completed) and the nature of the ongoing negotiations were such that it was obvious that a settlement would be reached.   The litigation in which Miss Forde was involved was free of risk.    Historically, the Council had settled every housing disrepair case in which McGrath had acted on behalf of tenants and the litigation was, in any event, extremely simple.   Miss Forde’s case was particularly straightforward because she had already obtained a Section 82 conviction against the Council and the only argument left in her case was about the level of compensation she would receive.    In <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Begum v Klari</span> (Times Law Reports 18 March 2005) Brooke LJ had expressed concern about the inflated level of the success fee claimed at 70% in a case where success was a near certainty.    The Court of Appeal had reduced the fee to 15%.    In the present case, Miss Bretherton submitted that the factors to which she had drawn my attention were compelling, in particular with regard to the settlement negotiations and the proper level of success fee to allow was nil.</p>

Whilst she accepted that the March letter stated that the legal costs to date would be dealt with under CFA II rather than under CFA I:   “… unless by some chance the court ruled that this one [CFA II] was not valid – in which case we will rely on the original agreement …”, this was simply an expression of intent which had no contractual force.    The truth of the matter was that the only reason that McGrath had insisted on Miss Forde signing CFA II was to avoid the consequences that would follow had CFA I fallen foul of the 2000 Regulations.    Accordingly, CFA II was a replacement contract on different terms to those embodied in CFA I and there could be no recourse to it if CFA II failed.   </p>

The terms for payment of McGrath’s fees in the event of termination by them were to be found in Clause 9 and/or 11 of CFA I.   The contract of retainer evidenced by CFA I was an entire contract and as such, terms for payment could not be enforced until all the obligations which arose under it had been performed.

The correct box to have ticked was B because favourable  expert evidence had been obtained and a conviction against the Council  secured.  Moreover, Miss Forde was a tenant with no rent arrears whose credibility had not been challenged during the Section 82 proceedings to which the Council had pleaded guilty.   The cost benefit ratio, (that is to say the ratio of costs to settlement), was expressed to be 1.32.  That was very low.   The application form had actually asked for the figure to settlement ie, the sum of £2,500 rather than the £7,500 provided;  this would have given a ratio of 1 to 3.98, and made the grant of public funding more likely (first skeleton, paragraph 60).

This had been made plain to Miss Forde in the March letter and she had received further advice from Mr Khan on this point at their meeting on 5 April 2006.

He submitted that in a solicitor/client context, undue influence usually concerns cases where, by way of example, a solicitor has received a substantial gift from a client and subsequently a dispute arises as to the circumstances in which the gift was made.  The present case was different.  McGrath had completed the work that the firm had contracted to undertake under the retainer and Miss Forde had raised no complaint about the competence with which McGrath had handled her affairs, still less had she ever suggested that her agreement to CFA II was the product of undue influence. </p>

In other words, the first part of the test was satisfied.  That said, Mr Mallalieu submitted (as Lord Clyde had expressed the position in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Etridge</span><span style="font-weight:bold"> - </span>see paragraphs 21 and 22) that whilst there was a presumption that trust and confidence had been reposed, there was no presumption that the confidence had been abused.  Accordingly, the way in which CFA II had come into being did not call for an explanation.  The terms of the retainer were set out in a written contract, the contents of which McGrath (through Mr Khan) had explained to Miss Forde before she signed the document.  In these circumstances no further explanation was necessary.</p>

This was not a situation in which the presumption of undue influence (if it had arisen) needed to be rebutted;  on the contrary, the issue was whether CFA II “could readily be accounted for by the ordinary motives of ordinary persons in the relationship” (see speech of Lord <marker name="tab"/>Nichols at paragraph 13).  In the present case, the Council had made repeated attacks on the validity of CFA 1 (see <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Crook</span>, paragraphs 10 to 14).  CFA 1 was in broadly similar terms to the CFAs used in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Crook</span> and the related cases.  Miss Forde wished McGrath to continue to act for her.  In view of this and in the light of the challenges, McGrath and Miss Forde had agreed to put their relationship on a firmer footing through the implementation of CFA II.  Accordingly, the circumstances in which this had been done were explicable by entirely ordinary motives.</p>

She did not want her case to be extended on account of a dispute with the Council as had happened in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Crook.</span>  On the facts of the case, McGrath’s suggestion that Miss Forde should seek independent legal advice was more than sufficient to rebut the presumption.</p>

In his submission, where, as here, McGrath’s retainer was embodied in CFA 1 and was under challenge, the firm had been entitled to take proper steps to put the retainer on a sure footing. Indeed, the willingness of McGrath to continue to act in circumstances where the firm’s entitlement to past and future fees under CFA 1 had been put in doubt, provided ample consideration.  In the light of the Council’s assertions about CFA I, McGrath would, in any event, have been entitled to terminate that agreement had Miss Forde rejected their advice to sign CFA II.

The reason for this was that CFA 1 had not been terminated and replaced by CFA II.  On the contrary, CFA 1 had remained as the original agreement until it had been joined by CFA II. This was a re-shaped agreement that did not terminate CFA 1 and contained (in the March letter) an express statement that CFA 1 would survive if CFA II proved to be invalid.</p>

If the e-mail agreement were illegal, as Mr Bacon submitted, then it would be void and unenforceable.   That would not, however, discharge the prior agreement between Mr Connolly and the liquidator (or his predecessor).   If the e-mail agreement is good, it varies the original agreement in accordance with its terms,   if it is bad it leaves the original agreement unaffected.   There seems to me to be no basis for saying it discharges that earlier agreement and fails to replace it with anything else.   Accordingly, even if the e-mail agreement were void as being an illegal contingency fee agreement, the former arrangement survives, and the liquidator is still liable for the fees.  Those fees can therefore be the subject of the current inter parties assessment.”</p>

This did not state that the only circumstance in which McGrath would advise Miss Forde to apply for public funding would be in the event of case allocation to the Fast or Multi track.  Such advice could only ever have related to a further application because on the date the CFA was signed, 16 March 2005, Miss Forde had already completed a public funding application.  Accordingly, it was clear that, contrary to the case now advanced by the Council, Miss Forde had never been told that public funding should not be applied for until case allocation, still less that it was unavailable before allocation. Had the position been otherwise, Miss Forde would not have signed the application forms on 16 March 2005.</p>

The obligation placed upon the solicitor under the 2000 Regulations was to give advice before the client signed.  Thus, the enforceability of the CFA fell to be determined at the date of signature.  Expressed differently, the way in which a public funding application was completed was not a compliance issue capable of giving rise to a material breach of the CFA Regulations.  Even if that were to be incorrect, Mr Mallalieu disputed that there had been anything improper in the way in which McGrath had completed the public funding forms on Miss Forde’s behalf.  Indeed, what was striking about the forms was the detail into which each had gone.  Having ticked both boxes C and D, McGraths had additionally provided a full explanation about why this had been done.</p>

This information had been given to Mr Stephen Lissett, a solicitor at the Birmingham Regional Office of the LSC in McGrath’s letter to him of 18 May 2004  (Bundle page 637).  That letter had been  written against the background of<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold"> Bowen</span> and had warned Mr Lissett that the LSC would be receiving a substantial number of public funding applications, albeit that in many cases, due to the costs benefit ratio, many were likely to be refused.  For its part, McGrath had expressed concern that the submission of forms in cases where public funding was unlikely to be granted could harm the firm’s good name with the LSC.  In these circumstances, McGrath had been at pains to make clear to Mr Lissett that the purpose of the applications was not to put the LSC to trouble and expense in hopeless cases, but had been driven by the decision in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Bowen</span> and by the technical challenges taken by the Council in<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold"> Crook</span>.  In Mr Mallalieu’s submission, none of these matters could have any bearing on whether there had been compliance with Regulation 4, since it was trite law that enforceability must be determined at the date of the CFA and not by reference to what happened thereafter (see <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Myatt v National Coal Board </span>[2006] EWCA Civ 1017).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Thus it is the Council’s case that had Miss Forde (and presumably other tenant/clients of McGrath) been given correct advice about the availability of public funding, the Council would not now be faced with bills of costs for work done under CFAs providing for success fees, but would, instead, be paying much more modest claims funded by the Legal Services Commission.   For my part, it is not clear why this should be so, since the hours spent and rates charged whether under public funding or CFA would be identical (or virtually identical) save for the success fee.    If, as Miss Priest has submitted, McGrath’s bills are exaggerated owing to the use of CFAs, in my opinion this is a matter which will be resolved by the District Judge on detailed assessment rather than as a preliminary issue.  That said, in the event that Miss Bretherton’s submissions prevail, by operation of the indemnity principle, McGrath will not recover anything even the amount that would have been payable had the case been publicly funded.    Accordingly, it is all or nothing. </p>

That said, Mr Mallalieu did not alert me either to a case which forbade a third party from relying on undue influence and, with the reservation I have expressed, it seems to me that I should address the matter from the point of the view that the Council does have locus standi to advance it, a fortiori where, as here, the Council is being called upon to discharge a burden for which Miss Forde has primary liability.   </p>

In particular, it is made clear in the letter that Miss Forde would not be any worse off should she sign CFA II “because “the cap” we put on your costs in the original agreement still applies”.    Since CFA II was entered into under the Revocation Regulations, it was not necessary for Miss Forde to have signed the March letter in order for this to have contractual effect; contrast the position in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Utting v McBain</span> [2007] EWCA 3293 (QB), in which Blake J held that an unsigned letter could not form part of  a CFA entered into under the 2000 Regulations in the absence of the client’s signature.

For these reasons I disagree with Miss Bretherton’s closing submissions at paragraph 10 that if McGrath had intended the March letter to form part of the retainer contract, it would have been signed.

In my opinion, there was nothing improper in McGrath, with Miss Forde’s agreement, reshaping the firm’s retainer following the revocation of the 2000 Regulations and in order to defeat the challenges in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Crook</span> and,/or the problems raised in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Bowen,</span> provided that none of the  alterations were  the product of undue influence.    In this respect, I agree with Mr Mallalieu that in McGrath agreeing to continue to represent Miss Forde under CFA II, adequate consideration was given.

Had CFA I provided for a success fee, I would have agreed with Mr Mallalieu that notice of funding would not have been required for this to be recoverable during any protocol period or pre-issue.   The reason for this is that CPR 44.15(1) does not require a party to provide information about a funding arrangement until the issue of proceedings.   However, it is common ground that no success fee was sought under CFA I, so the point does not arise in respect of that agreement, notwithstanding that notice of funding was served on 15 February 2006.    </p>

That leaves open the question of what would have happened had CFA II been signed before issue and had the litigation been settled without proceedings. Section 19.2 Costs Practice Direction states at (3) that there is no requirement in the PD for the provision of information about funding arrangements before the commencement of proceedings. No one suggested that the pre-action protocol required this to be done in the present case.  It follows that a curious situation would have arisen  had McGrath settled the case after  signing CFA II  but before  issue because the time for serving Form N251 would not have been reached. It would seem that in those circumstances a retrospective success fee would have been recoverable, but because, in the event, proceedings were issued  and no notice  under CPR 44.15 was given, McGrath’s claim for a success fee has been lost.</p>

In these circumstances the fact that the success fee cannot be recovered is not fatal to the validity and enforceability of CFA II as a whole and the agreement can thus run from 16 March 2005.</p>

That said, in Miss Bretherton’s submission, the prospect of Miss Forde not recovering costs was so remote as to be discounted;  the case was risk free and the success fee should be assessed at nil.   In riposte, Mr Mallalieu has drawn attention to matters which concerned McGrath prior to concluding the risk assessment (see paragraph 17 of McGrath 1), which in his submission, justified the figures claimed.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Having given due weight to these submissions, I consider that there is much in the argument advanced by Miss Bretherton that at the date of signature of CFA II, the litigation was relatively free of risk.   It will be remembered that by 5 April 2006, not only had Miss Forde obtained a conviction under Section 82 against the Council but also a firm offer of £4,500 was on the table.   In <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Begum </span>Brooke LJ stated no claim is entirely without risk but that where success was a near certainty, a 15% success fee was appropriate.    In contrast to <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Begum</span>, in the present case, the success fee has been staged.    Using the ready reckoner, I consider that a fair assessment of the risks if the claim had concluded before the issue of proceedings, were that there was a 90% chance of winning, giving a success fee of 10%.    I am not persuaded that a significantly higher sum is warranted just because proceedings were issued. Having failed to settle during the protocol period, limited grounds might be advanced for saying that the Council must have considered that the prospects of a successful defence were much higher than 43%, (a 57% chance of winning would reflect a 75% success fee under the ready reckoner). In my judgment, however, the likelihood of  Miss Forde losing would still have been slim. Left to me, I would assess prospects of winning up to trial at 83% giving a success fee of 20%.  Had the matter actually concluded at trial, the position would have been different as McGrath could then have argued with justification that the Council had  clearly considered it would win, so the success fee should be 100% reflecting 50/50 prospects of success.</p>

Both documents continued to exist side by side but CFA I would only be relied upon in the event that CFA II failed for any reason.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgment, regard must again be given to the circumstances in which CFA II came into existence, with particular reference to the March letter.    Whilst it is correct that McGrath <span style="text-decoration:underline">did</span> state that the firm would rely on the original agreement if the court “by some chance” ruled that CFA I was invalid, in my opinion that did not, of itself, adequately explain to Miss Forde that CFA I was not being terminated and replaced but, on the contrary, was to continue alongside CFA II. In my view, the only reasonable inference that can be drawn from the March letter is that McGrath was taking the opportunity to replace CFA I with CFA II in order to make use of the advantageous changes to the CFA Regulations.     Had that not been the case, it would be difficult to explain why McGrath had referred in the March letter to “an alternative agreement”.   Had the position been as contended for by Mr Mallalieu, in my opinion wording such as “a co-existing agreement” or “concurrent agreement” would have been used.    It follows and expressed in common parlance, that the “have your cake and eat it” argument fails.    I agree with Miss Bretherton’s submissions that CFA I was terminated and replaced by CFA II and in these circumstances there can be no fallback position to CFA I in the event of the failure of CFA II.    </p>

On the contrary, in my judgment, it is the Council’s case that Miss Forde and McGrath terminated the first agreement and replaced it with the second.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The difficulties with that submission are, in my judgment, two-fold.   Firstly, I do not accept, irrespective of whether there were shortcomings in the judgments in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Crook</span>, that McGrath <span style="text-decoration:underline">did</span> advise Miss Forde that public funding would not be granted until allocation.    I agree with Mr Mallalieu’s submission that McGrath had weighed up the merits and de-merits of her case and had advised Miss Forde that a CFA represented a better option than public funding.    In my view, the words complained of by the Council in paragraph 18(f) of CFA I (“we have further advised that if the claim is allocated to the Fast Track or the Multi track it will be appropriate at that stage to consider either an application for a Legal Services Commission public funding certificate or alternatively After the Event insurance”) – are insufficient to constitute “incorrect advice” for the purposes of Regulation 4.   The paragraph must be read as a whole and with paragraph 18(e).   When that is done, it is evident that the client is given advice in the round, not only that public funding might be a method of paying for the case but also that ATE (for example) could be a candidate.   It follows that I do not consider that incorrect advice was given in relation to public funding.   Moreover, it is plain from the evidence of Mr Heathcock and Mr Cox that if public funding had been granted before allocation, it would have been withdrawn and the certificate discharged had the claim been allocated to the small claims track at the allocation stage.     That would have generated its own problems for the client in terms of the statutory charge if damages had been recovered, whereas under the CFA, these would be ring-fenced.    In these circumstances, I consider McGrath’s view that the most suitable funding option was to commence the claim under a CFA using CFA I and, if appropriate, to review funding options (including public funding and ATE) at the allocation stage was balanced and measured advice:  as such, it does not merit the level of obloquy levelled upon it by the Council in the witness statements of Miss Priest (see in particular Priest 3 paragraphs 20 to 24), still less does it conflict with the requirements of Regulation 4.    For these reasons I disagree with Miss Bretherton’s submissions.    </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly, in contrast to Mr Crook in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Crook</span>, Miss Forde applied for public funding and was rejected.    That, to my mind, must limit to a very considerable extent the effectiveness of the Council’s contention in this respect;   after all, having signed and submitted the application form, Miss Forde must plainly have received advice about public funding which was sufficient to persuade her that it was worthwhile applying.    Miss Bretherton’s response  is that the application forms were completed in such a way as to doom them to failure and that a defective application cannot be used or relied upon to justify incorrect advice having been given in the first place.    I disagree.   What  Regulation 4 requires the legal representative to do is to inform the client whether other methods of funding are available and whether any particular method is appropriate.  In my opinion, no part of Regulation 4 requires the legal representative to complete public funding application forms to any particular standard.    Miss Bretherton and indeed Miss Priest were very careful to distance themselves from any suggest of impropriety on the part of McGrath, in particular that the forms had been deliberately completed in each case in a manner which made refusal certain.   On the contrary, their criticisms appeared to be directed at the level of detail into which McGraths had gone, with particular reference to the fact that two boxes had been ticked about merits.    </p>

What both said in terms was that the application for public funding in each case would be determined by reference to the Code and the criteria.   It followed that if a legal representative “over-egged” the merits on an application form (to adopt the description used by Mr Cox in cross examination) that would be no guarantee of success because the case worker would apply the Code and the criteria.    I infer from that that if an application form was unintentionally “under egged” by ticking box D as appears to the Council’s suggestion in this case, then that would not guarantee that the application would be unsuccessful either because the case worker, again, would base his decision not on what the form said but by reference to the Code and criteria.

In any event, the skill and competence (or lack of it) and the manner in which the application forms were completed could not have any bearing on whether McGrath complied with Regulation 4.

In these circumstances I would hold that telling Miss Forde that the appropriate stage at which to apply for a public funding certificate would be upon allocation to the fast track, was wrong advice, incapable of being saved by the materiality test.    Public funding is available before allocation and will not be refused in a housing disrepair case under Section 10 of the Code on the grounds that a CFA would be suitable (see paragraph 60 ante).   Accordingly, had erroneous advice been given  in the nature contended for by Miss Bretherton, I agree that Miss Forde might well have been denied costs protection for the period before allocation with potentially adverse costs consequences for her.
