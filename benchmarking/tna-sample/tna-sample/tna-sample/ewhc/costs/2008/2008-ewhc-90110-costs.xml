	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“The Claimant’s Solicitor refutes entirely the idea that the figures given for profit costs, Counsel and Experts were anything other than some very rough figure provided at the Defendant’s insistence.  The figures (sic) given was not an Estimate provided under Section 6 of the Costs Practice Direction.  It was not an Estimate in the required form of precedent H and the Defendant’s advisors knew that the figure could not be relied upon as the Claimant’s Solicitor had advised them that he did not have an accurate figure of the costs to date nor could he be expected to do so as he was simply asked to provide some rough figures whilst at Court and it would have been impossible to have accurately costed the file.  The Defendant’s advisors were well aware of this.</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“Had the parties intended that the figures reluctantly provided by the Claimant’s Solicitor should be binding and form part of the settlement then the figures would have been incorporated in the Consent Order.  It is noteworthy that the Consent Order provides for the costs to be assessed if not agreed.  At the doors of the Court if the Defendants had genuinely sought to place reliance upon the figures provided by the Claimant’s Solicitor which they knew to be figures provided in the absence of the file being costed, then they would have asked for those costs figures to be incorporated into the Consent Order.  They did not, they consented to an Order for Costs to be assessed if not agreed.  Reference to Section 6 of the Costs Practice Direction by the Defendants is meaningless given the circumstances in which the costs figures were given to them during negotiations at the door of the Court.  The directions given in Section 6 and the Judgment of Master Gordon-Saker in <span style="font-style:italic">Tribe –v- Southdown Gilding Club &amp;Others </span>relate to proper Estimates of Costs given at allocation, listing or at any other stage as ordered by the Court and have no relevance to some handwritten figures for costs given at the doors of the Court when both parties to the negotiations knew that the figures provided were at best guesswork.</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">Further and in the alternative if the Court is minded to accept the Defendant’s position that the costs figure given by the Claimant’s Solicitor amounted to an Estimate under Section 6 of the Practice Direction the Defendant is put to proof as to precisely how it relied upon the Estimate and how the litigation would have been conducted differently had the Claimant’s Solicitor been in a position to be able to provide accurate costs details.</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">The figure given for costs as the door of the Court was, as has been previously stated, a rough hand-written figure given without the benefit of having the file professionally costed and all parties were aware of this.  This amounts to a satisfactory explanation of the discrepancy between the figure given and the figure in the Bill even if the Court concludes that the Estimate given was one which the Defendants were entitled to rely upon and that they did indeed rely upon it.”</p>

It was also for this very precise reason that the Claimant was not prepared to accept, in respect of costs, a fixed sum.  I recall that the application was an acrimonious one and costs had become very relevant to the Claimant due to the actions taken by the Defendant throughout the case.  I felt that as I was dealing with fellow professionals in contrast to lay clients they would appreciate the impossibility of providing split information in relation [sic] costs incurred in respect of a matter which lasted for three and a half years.  In fact this is one of the reasons why I provided the handwritten note in the first place but marked the note “without prejudice [rough estimate]”.</p>

It was agreed that we needed a rough idea of the Claimant’s costs since January 2007.  It was decided that if we were to reach a settlement it would be worth making an offer in respect of a portion of the claimant’s costs.  It may be worth making a payment in order to secure the break clause.

The professional team would also have to be delayed which would also incur further costs.  AR estimated that the costs of the delay would ultimately be a few hundred thousand pounds.  It would therefore potentially be worth paying the Claimant £40K in costs as this would be a commercial decision.  It was suggested that we could agree to pay the Claimant’s cost up to 31 January 2007 subject to a detailed cost assessment hearing.  The Claimant, however, wanted costs to date.

GP suggested that we meet them in the middle.  AR suggested that in that case we could offer costs to 1 March in order to get the costs aspect down.  [HH commented that an additional £2,500 on rent would result in £4,500 in our pocket].  AR explained that if we pay them £31,000 for costs we will be £7,000 down on costs but £4,000 up on rent resulting in a difference of £3,000.  A midway point on the costs would be £31,250.  AR advised that the other side might move if we go back with something else.  He also advised that each side was very close as to what they want so we could hopefully meet in the middle.</p>

I anticipated that this figure may vary by a small degree but would be subject of assessment in any event.  I envisaged that any potential increase in the figure for costs would be small or moderate and would be subject to reductions on assessment in any event.  I therefore treated the sum of £38,250 as the maximum figure that would be payable.  I cannot accept that a claim for costs for approximately double the estimate given can be either proportionate or reasonable.</p>

It is that parties should be encouraged so far as possible to settle their disputes without resort to litigation and should not be discouraged by the knowledge that anything that is said in the course of such negotiations (and that includes, of course, as much the failure to reply to an offer as an actual reply) may be used to their prejudice in the course of the proceedings.

First, the public policy of encouraging parties to negotiate and settle their disputes out of court and, secondly, an implied agreement arising out of what is commonly understood to be the consequences of offering or agreeing to negotiate without prejudice.  In some cases both of these justifications are present; in others, only one or the other.  So, in <span style="font-style:italic">Cutts v Head</span> the rule that one could not rely upon a without prejudice offer on the question of costs after judgment was held not to be based upon any public policy.

The public policy aspect of the rule is not in my judgment concerned with the admissibility of statements which are relevant otherwise than as admissions, ie independently of the truth of the facts alleged to have been admitted.</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">Many of the alleged exceptions to the rule will be found on analysis to be cases in which the relevance of the communication lies not in the truth of any fact which it asserts or admits, but simply in the fact that it was made.  Thus, when the issue is whether without prejudice letters have resulted in an agreed settlement, the correspondence is admissible because the relevance of the letters has nothing to do with the truth of any facts which the writers may have expressly or impliedly admitted.  They are relevant because they contain the offer and acceptance forming a contract which has replaced the cause of action previously in dispute.  Likewise, a without prejudice letter containing a threat is admissible to prove that the threat was made.  A without prejudice letter containing a statement which amounted to an act of bankruptcy is admissible to prove that the statement was made;  see <span style="font-style:italic">Re Daintry </span>[1893] 2 QB 116.  Without prejudice correspondence is always admissible to explain delay in commencing or prosecuting litigation.  Here again, the relevance lies in the fact that the communications took place and not the truth of their contents.  Indeed, I think that the only case in which the rule has been held to preclude the use of without prejudice communications, otherwise than as admissions, is in the rule that an offer may not be used on the question of costs;  a rule which, as I have said, has been held to rest purely upon convention and not upon public policy.</p>

But the public policy rationale is, in my judgment, directed solely to admissions.

As a matter of principle, it seems to me that, even where a party can in principle rely upon correspondence being ‘without prejudice’ on contractual as well as public policy grounds, the court will not allow him to do so if it is satisfied that it would be unconscionable.  So far as the public policy grounds is concerned, it seems to me self-evident that, just as much as it is in the public interest that parties should feel completely free to negotiate under the cloak of ‘without prejudice’, so it is in the public interest that they should not be able to use the protection of ‘without prejudice’ for the purpose of ‘unambiguous impropriety’ (an expression to be found in two unreported decisions of the Court of Appeal, Forster v Friedland and Fazil-Alizadeh v Nikbin both helpfully summarised in Foskett and Hodge on The Law and the Practice of Compromise (4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> ed., at 154-56).  Equally, so far as the contractual ground is concerned, a contractual right to ‘without prejudice’ privilege should not be upheld or enforced where it is invoked for an improper purpose.  However, mere inconsistency, in the absence of dishonesty will not do – see Independent Research Services Ltd v Catterall [1993] I.C.R. 1.</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">By analogy with this line of authority, there is, to my mind, a powerful argument for saying that if a clear and unambiguous statement is made by one party in ‘without prejudice’ correspondence, and the statement is acted on, and reasonably acted on, by the other party, an objection by the first party to the correspondence being put in evidence by the second party in order to justify the step taken by the second party would be plainly unconscionable and would not be upheld by the court.  There is another reason for reaching that conclusion.  In Tomlin v Standard Telephones &amp; Cables Ltd [1969] 1 W.L.R. 1378, it was held that ‘without prejudice’ correspondence could be looked at by the court to see if the negotiations therein contained resulted in a settlement.  Although, of course, contract and estoppel are quite separate concepts, it appears to me logical and consistent that, if ‘without prejudice’ correspondence can be looked at to see if it gives rise to a contract, then such correspondence can also be looked at to see if it gives rise to an estoppel.  However, I do not suggest that there is an absolute rule to that effect …</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In short, Mr Mallalieu suggested that the authorities demonstrated that the exceptions to the without prejudice cloak were not closed and that it was open to me, even at Costs Judge level, to create a new exception and that on what he contended were the very unusual facts of this case I should do that in this particular case, thereby permitting the document in question to be placed before the Costs Judge conducting the detailed assessment.</p>

It seems to me that from the authorities it is quite clear that the general rule is that documents which are marked “without prejudice” should not be referred to subsequently for the reasons set out in those authorities and the quotations therefrom which I have given.</p>

These are very limited in extent and, indeed, Mr Mallalieu conceded that the first exception is not relevant and the second exception cannot be applicable on the facts of this case.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">However, I am not convinced that on the facts and evidence of this case it would be right even to begin to think that such an exception could exist.  Although I am inclined to feel that in the light of what Briggs J held in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Newall v Lewis</span>, I ought not to take any account of the attendance note exhibited in Ms Waine’s witness statement, even if I do take it into account I do not believe that Mr Patel and the Defendants would not have struck a deal if the estimate of costs given to them by Mr Elliott had been considerably higher.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I conclude that the document marked “rough figures and without prejudice” by Mr Elliott is a document to which the Costs Judge who conducts the detailed assessment (who will not, of course, be me) should not pay any regard and I therefore grant the order sought by Miss Ayling, namely that such document cannot be referred to during the course of that assessment for any purpose.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in"> I am conscious that preliminary issues nearly always generate additional costs.  Therefore I am quite prepared to deal with the question of costs of this issue and any application for permission to appeal based on written submissions made by the parties when they receive the draft of this judgment.  This will not preclude them from attending before me to address those or any other issues that may appear to them to be necessary.</p>
