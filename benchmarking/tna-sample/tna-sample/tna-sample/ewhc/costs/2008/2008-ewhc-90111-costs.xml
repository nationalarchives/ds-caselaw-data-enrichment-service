If there is no substantial difference between the two figures, then para 6.6 will have no significance.  But, if there is a substantial difference as there was in the present case, the practice direction gives no guidance as to <span style="font-style:italic">how</span> that difference should be taken into account in determining the reasonableness of the costs claimed.

	      <span style="font-style:italic">‘Cost estimates, like building estimates, have a potential to make costs more predictable and controllable.  In project management proper estimating is crucial, contingencies are built in and if the estimate is exceeded the contractor must explain.  In cost assessment terms estimation, in effect, should shift the burden of proof onto the potentially receiving party to estimate correctly (always bearing in mind the litigators duty to the court) and to re-estimate.  The author was very exercised in the run up to the Civil Procedural Rules about this idea and thought that it would be of great value.  In fact it appears to have been a damp squib.  Anecdotal evidence suggests that litigators are uncertain as to how the information disclosed is used, judges suspect that the estimating process is not rigorous and there seems little evidence of judges revisiting estimates on assessment.’</span>

First, the estimates made by solicitors of the overall likely costs of the litigation should usually provide a useful yardstick by which the reasonableness of the costs finally claimed may be measured.  If there is a substantial difference between the estimated costs and the costs claimed, that difference calls for an explanation.  In the absence of a satisfactory explanation, the court may conclude that the difference itself is evidence from which it can conclude that the costs claimed are unreasonable.</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.18in">27.<marker name="tab"/>Secondly, the court may take the estimated costs into account if the other party shows that it relied on the estimate in a certain way.  An obvious example would be where A shows that he relied on the relatively low estimate given by B not to make an offer of settlement, but carried on with the litigation on the basis that his potential liability for costs was likely to be of the order indicated in B’s estimate.  In our judgment, it would be a proper use of para 6.6 of the practice direction to take such a factor into account in deciding what costs it was reasonable to require A to pay B on an assessment.</p>

To take a rather crude example:  suppose that at the allocation questionnaire stage the claimant provides an estimate of overall costs in the sum of £20,000, and claims £50,000 at the assessment.  The court might conclude that, if it had known that the claimant’s costs were likely to be of the order of £50,000, rather than £20,000, it would probably have given different directions from the ones it gave, and that these would have had the effect of reducing the claimant’s costs.  It might, for example, have trimmed the number of experts who could be called, and taken other steps to slim down the complexity of the litigation in the interests of controlling costs in a reasonable and proportionate manner.</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.18in">29.<marker name="tab"/>In our view, para 6.6 of the practice direction gives the court the power to take matters such as these into account in deciding whether, and if so how far, to reflect them in determining what costs it is reasonable to order the paying party to pay on an assessment.  We do not, however, consider that it would be a correct use of the power conferred by para 6.6 to hold a party to his estimate simply in order to penalise him for providing an inadequate estimate.  Thus, if (a) the paying party did not rely on the estimate in any way, (b) the court concludes that, even if the estimate had been close to the figure ultimately claimed, its case management directions would not have been affected, and (c) the costs claimed are otherwise reasonable and proportionate, then in our view it would be wrong to reduce the costs claimed <span style="font-style:italic">simply </span>because they exceed the amount of the estimate.  That would be tantamount to treating a costs estimate as a costs cap, in circumstances where the estimate does not purport to be a cap.</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.18in">30.<marker name="tab"/>Nor is there any justification for interpreting the provisions in the CPR as equating costs estimates with costs budgets or caps.  There is, however, much to be said for costs budgeting and the capping of costs.  Some judges have made prospective costs cap orders exercising the general power conferred by section 51(1) of the Supreme Court Act 1981:  see, for example, Gage J in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">AB v Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust (in the matter of the Nationwide Organ Group Litigation) </span>[2003] EWHC 1034.  This is not the place to review these decisions.  Suffice it to say that, whatever the scope of the jurisdiction to make such orders, it is quite different from the jurisdiction that is exercised retrospectively at the stage of costs assessment, and when the court is required to decide the amount of reasonable and proportionate costs.  Costs estimates can also alert the judge responsible for case management to the need to take appropriate action to prevent disproportionate costs from being incurred.</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.18in">31.<marker name="tab"/>We acknowledge the concerns about the danger of satellite litigation.  It might be said that the guidance that we have sought to give will foster disputes.  Did the paying party who alleges that he relied on the estimate in fact rely on it, and to what extent?  Would the court in fact have made different case management decisions if it had been provided with a realistic costs estimate, and what effect would that have had on the litigation and the parties’ costs?  What is the explanation for the difference between the costs estimate and the costs claimed at the assessment stage, and does the explanation satisfactorily account for the difference?  These are all valid questions to ask.  But these concerns do not justify setting at nought the important CPR provisions relating to the making of costs estimates.  If costs estimates are not taken into account at the assessment stage, then they will be entirely nugatory.  It should not be difficult for the court to determine whether, and if so how, the paying party has relied on the costs estimate given by the receiving party without conducting an elaborate and detailed investigation.  Likewise, in most cases the court should be able without prolonged investigation to form a judgment as to whether, and if so how, the case would have been managed differently if a realistic costs estimate had been given.”</p>

She has informed me that if an estimate to trial had been served by the claimant’s solicitors in the sum/or in excess of the sum claimed for base costs in the bill of costs, namely £102,563.29, she would have referred the matter to her supervising partner, Nicholas Pargeter.</p>

It would then have been open to the Master to consider whether to exercise his case management powers in limiting any future costs.</p>

I have conducted 98 mesothelioma costs cases within the same period against numerous firms of solicitors.  My colleague, Gavin Beardsell (the previous head of the department), had conduct of 4 Irwin Mitchell cases (not including this case) all of which were asbestos related diseases and 2 of which related to mesothelioma.  Overall the London costs department has conducted 140 mesothelioma costs cases in the past 2 years.</p>

The costs in this case exceed any other Irwin Mitchell mesothelioma case dealt with by the London costs department by £125, 030.07 (this sum includes a success fee of 100% and ATE insurance of £1,608.23 with Amicus).  Of the 140 mesothelioma cases the second highest bill of costs totals £147,759.64 (this sum includes a 100% success fee but no ATE premium) and was conducted by Field Fisher Waterhouse.  The estimate of overall base costs contained in the allocation questionnaire was exceeded by 30% in that bill of costs.  In this case the estimate is exceeded by 270%.  In my submission a bill of costs of £244,220.53 could not have been reasonably contemplated in a case of this type.</p>

The costs consequences to these defendants of the death of Mr Philips and the logistical difficulties of arranging a meeting with Mr Darlington cannot have been anything other than modest.  The cost of investigating Mr Tribe’s condition is claimed at £750 (£300 in attending the neurologist and £450 for the neurologist’s fee).  While £2,042 is claimed for attending on the metallurgist and about £11,500 claimed for his fees, these figures cannot explain the difference and do appear to be somewhat high themselves.</p>

As the estimate cannot be a cap, it seems to me that the appropriate starting position should be the costs which one would expect to see incurred in this case by these parties.  I would have expected the First and Third Defendant’s reasonable costs of defending this claim to trial, including the assessment of damages, to have been no more than about £100,000 - £150,000.

Morgan J referred to the judgment of Dyson LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Leigh v Michelin Tyres plc [2003] EWCA Civ 1799 </span>at paragraph 31 where it was stated that the paying party had to show “how” he relied on the estimate.  That case related to an inter parties assessment where the paying party was relying on an estimate given to the court by way of an allocation questionnaire.  The estimate in this case was given by the solicitor to his client at the client’s request and in my judgment the question of reliance is more obvious than in an inter parties context where a paying party may well have to show that it has acted to its detriment.</p>

Where there is only a small divergence between an estimate given by the solicitor to his client and the invoice, then there may be a greater burden on the client to show how he relied on the estimate and acting to his detriment may be a relevant factor.  In this case the difference between the estimate and the invoices was so substantial that it is, in my judgment, not as relevant to show that the Claimant has acted to its detriment.  The Claimant must show “how” it relied on the estimate and it has done so to my satisfaction.</p>

The solicitor is an expert in these matters; the client is not and has no alternative other than to rely on an estimate.  The position is different in an inter parties assessment when the party alleging reliance on an estimate provided to the court will usually have the benefit of advice from a solicitor.”</p>

However, the “coordinator” then put his own figure of £50,000 on the likely overall costs of the Claimant as of 20 September 2006 and this was some fourteen months after the estimate was given, and no doubt in light of the way that the litigation had proceeded both in relation to causation and the introduction of additional claimants.

With the best of intentions; there must be a risk that in certain cases without some kind of control by the court, there may be an unreasonable or disproportionate expenditure of limited resources.  It is significant, in my view, that in this case both sides are publicly funded.

However, since the case did not require such a solicitor in order to bring it to a satisfactory conclusion but only a solicitor with experience of bringing claims against the police, the correct question is whether the Deputy Costs Judge was right to find that such a solicitor could be found in Sheffield in 1999.  It is to be noted that in the ‘Points of Dispute to the Claimant’s Bill of Costs’ the Claimant submitted that ‘the claim could have been handled by a large number of solicitors in the Sheffield area, several of whom specialise in exactly this type of case, amongst others Irwin Mitchell Solicitors and Howells LLP.’  The Claimant, in his reply, said ‘it was not accepted that this case could have been dealt with by most Grade A fee earners specialising in personal injury matters and the contention reflects a complete lack of understanding of the specialist nature of proceedings against the Police and in this particular case the psychiatric as well as physical injury sustained by the Claimant.’  No specific point was made in relation to the firms named by the Defendant.</p>

Indeed, Counsel for the Claimant appeared to accept that on an assessment of costs I was entitled to have regard to my own view and that of my assessors on such a matter.  It was common ground that Irwin Mitchell had offices in Sheffield in 1999.  It is my view, and that of my assessors, that that firm was likely to have had experience of bringing claims against the police.  Moreover, that view is supported by the evidence adduced on this appeal from Simon Hills, who has dealt with Irwin Mitchell for over 15 years.  He describes them as employing ‘extremely competent police law lawyers’.  Mr Oppenheim expressed the opinion that Irwin Mitchell would not have been ‘an appropriate referral because of the combination of skills required.’  However, he did not say that Irwin Mitchell had no experience of bringing claims against the police.”</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.57in">“34.<marker name="tab"/>Finally, one comes to the question of fees and what the claimant might reasonably be expected to know of the fees likely to be charged by Bhatt Murphy compared with a firm in Sheffield.  The Deputy Costs Judge does not specifically address the knowledge that the claimant could reasonably be expected to have of the comparative fees in London and Sheffield.  It was submitted that it was unreasonable to expect the claimant to have an awareness of such matters.  In assessing whether the reasonable litigant might reasonably have been expected to be aware of the comparative level of fees it seems to me that one must put to one side the fact that this particular claimant was legally aided and assume that the reasonable litigant is funding his legal representation himself.  Otherwise the question of cost would not feature in the analysis of what a reasonable litigant would have done.  Such a litigant would clearly inquire into the level of fees charged by Bhatt Murphy before instructing that firm.  He would also compare that level of fees with the level of fees charged by a Sheffield firm with experience of bringing actions against the police.  Indeed, the attendance notes manifest the claimant’s concern with the comparable charges because he was anxious to know how much his contribution to his legal expenses would be.  The reasonable litigant would make himself aware of the comparative charges by consulting the Sheffield firm and the London firm.  He would have appreciated that there was a substantial difference in rates.  The rates approved by the Deputy Costs Judge were £190 per hour and the rates claimed by Bhatt Murphy were £265 per hour.  It is agreed that the choice of Bhatt Murphy has led to a difference in the final bill of £50,000 (£195,000 compared with £145,000).”</p>

I do not accept that advising on quantum issues is straightforward in such a case.  Particularly when they are several factors, as here, which may ultimately affect the final award, advising is very far from straightforward.  As is illustrated by what happened.  The payment in, much later, was £165,000.  Irwin Mitchell advised non-acceptance.  The damages agreed were £180,000.  Such advice requires good judgment.”</p>
