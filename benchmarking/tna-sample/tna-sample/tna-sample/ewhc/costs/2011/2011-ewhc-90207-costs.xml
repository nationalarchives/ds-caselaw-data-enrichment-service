He also sets out the origins of the Pursuit Insurance Scheme, and states that he has been responsible for the development of First Assist ATE business at all times from its origins in 1999.    The purpose of this policy was to support the use of CFAs in areas outside the mass personal injury market.   The premium for such a policy would have to be much larger than in run of the mill personal injury cases.    First Assist devised a policy with a deferred premium, which was conditional upon success.   Thus, those who won their cases would have the means to pay the premium, those who lost would not need to do so.   Payment of the premium in won cases would be deferred until the case was won.  The policy was intended to provide unlimited adverse costs cover.  The Pursuit Scheme was launched in March 1999. </p>

It followed that the premium needed to be calculated in proportion to the level of insured risk at any given time.    In effect, it needed to be infinitely staged with the premium for each risk reflecting the merits of the specific case (risk factor) and the costs of the case (exposure factor).</p>

They, therefore, decided that the exposure factor of the premium should be calculated by reference to own solicitors’ costs, as with a success fee under a CFA.    This produced a sliding scale premium calculated by reference to own solicitors’ fees.   Each case was rated on the estimated costs of that particular case.    In order to calculate how the policy should be rated in terms of risk factor, ie, the multiplier to be applied to the solicitors’ fees:   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This method of calculating the premium was challenged in 2004 by a number of defendant liability insurers, leading to the <span style="font-style:italic">RSA Pursuit Test Cases</span> in 2005, which was argued before me.    I found (Order dated 27 May 2005) that the contract of insurance was not void for uncertainty, nor was the arrangement between the client and/or the solicitors and the insurer unlawful on the grounds of champerty.    In my judgment I found certain flaws in the way in which the premium had been calculated in the <span style="font-style:italic">Test Cases</span>, largely because the estimated costs which formed the basis of the premium calculation were extremely inaccurate.    As a result of this, the policy wording was amended by First Assist, thus allowing the premium rate to be applied directly to the actual exposure faced by the company, ie, the actual costs of the opponent at the time the case was settled in favour of the insured (plus the own disbursements to the extent that they were insured).    It is this methodology which has been adopted in the present case. </p>

After the policy documentation was issued two typographical errors on the schedule were corrected in May 2008.   It is, therefore, incorrect to suggest that the wording was not finalised between April and October.”</p>

Following the collapse of The Accident Group, Lloyds syndicates and NIG withdrew from new business and ran off their existing business at very substantial underwriting losses.   He suggests that other insurers who avoided case management companies such as Claims Direct and TAG quickly learned how to underwrite successfully, and in his opinion ATE insurers have been making reasonable underwriting profits since the middle of the past decade.   He suggests that “this is now a competitive and saturated market”.    </p>

It might have been possible to persuade QBE and Templeton to co-insure the risk, and increase the level of cover to an absolute maximum of £3 or £4 million.    They would have insisted on their own policy wording terms and conditions, so that the solicitors could have ended up with two very different contracts, with all the difficulties that that might have entailed.   The most obvious problem being an offer of settlement, which the solicitor and one insurer wish to reject, but the other insurer wishes to accept.    Mr Myrtle stated that he has tried, from time to time during the last ten years, to persuade insurers to subscribe to a risk placement by way of co-insurance using a single policy wording, but has never succeeded.    He tried to do this in 2008 when First Assist asked him to investigate co-insurance or re-insurance, he was unable to do so. </p>

That pot involves several hundred thousand policies.   Premiums are being paid in and claims are being paid out all the time.   The premium in this case, albeit large, is simply one of those policies.  The insurer and we as agent do not calculate the profitability of any individual policy.    Indeed the very notion has no rationale within the insurance world.   Clearly any policy where there is no payout is a gain and any claim paid out is a loss.   What all insurers do is look at the spread of cover.    Our role, as agents, is to obtain business that across its range provides an overall profit for the insurer and for us.    In these terms it can be seen that there is no sense in selecting a single policy and arguing that its premium is somehow different from those on other policies.   It cannot be reasonable to ignore the risk that any policy introduces into the pool of insured risks and to contend that the premium on any specific policy is pure profit if that policy does not have a claim.”</p>

Secondly, the premium calculation:  where the Defendants argue that the premium rating formula set out in the schedule to the policy should be applied to the costs at risk, rather than to Leigh Day &amp; Co’s costs.   Thirdly, the question of “adverse costs”:  in respect of which it is argued that the premium should be calculated by applying the risk multiplier to the actual costs at risk, not to the sum that the Defendants had actually incurred by way of legal costs, but the sum that the Claimants would be liable to pay if Trafigura’s legal costs were to be subject to detailed assessment, which is now said to be £10,393,031.70. </p>

He makes the point that First Assist, whilst possessing the skills required to be an insurer, has chosen not to be the risk carrier, but has out-sourced this.   In his submission it is only the risk carrying element which has been passed to Great Lakes, and he suggests that it is this cost of out-sourcing the insurance element to Great Lakes that should be the starting point for the calculation of the premium.    He suggests that all other benefits and services offered by First Assist under the Pursuit product are provided by First Assist.   He suggests that First Assist is therefore acting as a “quasi insurer”.    He suggests that the Defendants’ obligation to pay an ATE premium should not be “contaminated or affected” by First Assist’s overall arrangements with Great Lakes.    </p>

In order to answer these questions he seeks further disclosure, particularly of the figure which best represents the risk carrying charge received by Great Lakes from the premium.   This, he says, is the starting point for building a reasonable premium.     Without that figure he says, the court is not in a position to assess whether the First Assist charges are reasonable and proportionate, as against the actual cost of providing the insurance.     </p>

I have quoted this at paragraph 15 above.    This appears to differ from the policy schedule, quoted at paragraph 5 above, in that the policy schedule requires the premium rate to be ascertained by dividing the sum of the opponent’s costs plus expenses by the normal fees of own solicitor.     The premium is calculated by taking the premium rate calculation, and multiplying it by the normal fees of own solicitors. </p>

He says that the policy is then incorrect to require that the 0.20 or 0.30 should be applied to own solicitor’s costs, since those costs are not the costs to which the insurer is exposed.    If the figure for own solicitor’s costs is utilised, the premium comes out at £9.2 million. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Bacon also argues that the prospects of success utilised by First Assist were too low, and he bases this on two factors:   firstly, that in my decision on success fee, in which I found that a 58% success fee was appropriate, I had taken too low a starting point, and thus arrived at an incorrect success fee.    Mr Bacon’s submission is that the appropriate success fee should have been 25%.    Secondly, he argues that, since I found that the risk had varied as the litigation progressed, so First Assist should have taken into account the varying risk when assessing the prospects of success.     In particular, he suggests that First Assist were aware, or ought to have been aware, of the settlement between Trafigura and the Ivory Coast Government, which, in my success fee decision, I had indicated improved the prospects of success by some 5%.    He therefore argues that First Assist should have used a 70% prospect of success rather than 65%.    He also suggests that instead of having one after the event insurance policy, a series of policies could have been entered into as more claimants joined the group, and thus the later premiums would have been lower than the earlier ones.    </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">With regard to the timing of the policy, the policy was incepted on 9 February 2007.    Leigh Day informed First Assist of rumours of settlement on 12 February 2007.  The settlement itself was signed on 13 February, and the BBC reported the settlement on 15 February.    He points out that in March 2007, the definition of “success” had still to be agreed.    Martin Day and First Assist were still discussing risk, and First Assist should therefore have reflected the change in risk in the policy, the schedule of which is dated 4 April 2007.    Since I had found that the Ivorian settlement had brought about a 5% change in risk, in Mr Bacon’s submission, First Assist’s assessment should also move up to a 70% prospect of success.    He suggests that since the wording of the policy was still being negotiated in March 2007, it may not have been necessary to cease the policy and issue a new one.   The policy does not include any contractual term enabling the insurer, or the insureds, to alter the risk.    Applying a test of reasonableness, he argues that this is what should have happened. </p>

His case is that the premium should be based on the insurer’s liability to pay adverse costs, ie, only those costs which the opponent could legitimately recover on detailed assessment.    In the example which he gave in his skeleton argument, he suggested that rather than the figure of £14,634,160 (£14,884,160 minus £250,000 expenses), a lower figure should be used, and he illustrated his argument utilising a figure of £10,243,912, which, together with the £250,000 expenses times 0.2, produced a premium figure of £2,098,782.</p>

The original figure of £14.6 million was the figure for the costs actually billed to Trafigura.   The client had been billed for other costs outside the events in Abidjan.     Macfarlanes and their costs draftsmen have gone through their bills to work out what could be claimed.   He suggested that the Defendants had been asked for the information about costs before they had seen the policy wording.    There is disagreement between the parties as to exactly when the policy wording was sent to the Defendants.    I do not have sufficient evidence to enable me to decide that issue.   Mr Bacon argues that if the £14.6 million figure is not reduced, the risk assessment must be altered, since the Claimants were never in danger of having to pay that figure. </p>

He submits that the court should only look at the contract of insurance, ie, the First Assist policy, part of which I have set out at paragraph 4 ff above.   The definitions make it clear that the insurer is Great Lakes, and that First Assist administers the insurance on the insurer’s behalf.    The policy also defines the premium.   This, Mr Butcher says, is what the insureds have promised to pay.    It does not mean part of it, nor any money paid to someone else.    It is a unitary promise to pay Great Lakes for indemnifying the insureds.   There is therefore, he says, no basis for saying this is not “the premium of the policy”.</p>

The first is the nature of the benefits to which the litigant is contractually entitled in exchange for the payment of the premium. This falls to be determined from the terms of the contract under which the premium is paid.  Section 29 permits the recovery of a premium where this is payment for insurance against the risk of liability for costs. If payment of a so-called premium buys a contractual entitlement to other benefits it is, to say the least, arguable that the premium cannot, to that extent, be recovered under section 29.  Thus the Court has to consider the terms of the contract under which the premium is paid to see whether it is simply a contract of insurance against liability for costs or whether it is something other than, or additional to, that.</p>

An insurer will necessarily look to premium income to meet the costs of the business. The primary costs are likely to be those of meeting claims, but the costs will also include matters such as commissions, advertising and, indeed, refurbishing the insurer’s premises.  The Court will not be directly concerned with how, or on what, the insurer spends the premium income.  The Court will, however, be concerned with the question of whether the premium is a reasonable price to pay for the benefits that it purchases. Ultimately, this should be a question to be considered having regard to experience, or evidence, of the market. If an insurer is conducting his business in a manner which incurs extravagant, extraneous or otherwise unnecessary expenditure, which has to be covered by the premiums, those premiums are likely to be uncompetitive.  To pay such a premium where other more reasonable premiums are available may disentitle the litigant from making a full recovery of the costs of the premium.”</p>

Great Lakes make use of all the premiums received to pay claims, and Great Lakes’ premium is the full amount.    Great Lakes receive a risk carrying charge, because First Assist carries out the various tasks required under the MGA.     If there is a profit, First Assist retains it.    Great Lakes receive the risk carrying charge.   None of these however, it is submitted, affect the reasonableness of the premium.    If all the services were provided by a unitary insurance company, the position would be no different than if the premium were split with an agent.    It is therefore not right to ask what part of the premium is retained by the insurer.    Great Lakes would not have taken on this risk on any other terms.

He suggests that First Assist’s assessment of 65% was within an acceptable bracket, but goes on to point out that the risks to First Assist were different from those facing the solicitors, who might have lost individual cases, and were faced with issues of breach of duty, medical causation and other causation.  The question for the court is, he says, was the insurer’s view of 65% reasonable?    It cannot be said that a 35% risk of losing is overstated, particularly in the light of Mr Nurney’s views expressed in his witness statement.    In any event, he suggests that my assessment of the prospects of success are not necessarily relevant to the insurer’s assessment of risk.  First Assist used a different method to that used by the solicitors, ie, by induction.    He argues that the starting point for the premium is a multiplier of 0.54, which is increased by 15% for administration and profit, giving an overall multiplier of 0.62.  This is, he suggests, well within market norms.</p>

Mr Williams submits that 15% is well within market norms, and may even be modest in a volatile market.   He points out that in the <span style="font-style:italic">RSA Pursuit Test Cases</span>, Mr Christopher Wait of Temple Legal Protection Ltd would have added, in the circumstances of that case, a percentage for profit and insurance administration costs of 60%.   In <span style="font-style:italic">Rogers v Merthyr Tydfil CBC</span>, DAS applied an uplift of 25% for overheads.    In the same case Temple and Keystone took the view that 25% was a minimum allowance for overheads, and that a more realistic allowance would be closer to 50%.

Mr Williams argues that the more an insurer has to use capital in one case, the less there is for another case.   Furthermore, it is not open to the court to say what an insurance company’s profit should be.    In his submission the premium and its calculation is reasonable, it was a transparent transaction with very high exposure.

In addition to this, in Mr Nurney’s witness statement it was contended that the Claimants had no arguable case.   First Assist’s view that the prospects were 65% were slightly higher than the view which I had taken, that the prospects were in the region of 63%, a figure which, if utilised, would produce a higher premium.</p>

In both the Claims Direct and Accident Group cases I was persuaded, exceptionally, to deconstruct the premiums, because it was clear from the evidence in each of those cases that the so called premium, whilst containing an element for insurance, contained numerous other elements which were clearly not insurance.   Thus, the only way to arrive at the figure for premium was to carry out a deconstruction, and make an allowance for that element which was truly premium.    In this case, as Mr Butcher has pointed out, there is one premium, one insurer and one agent.   There is no basis whatsoever upon which this court could or should deconstruct the premium.    The question for the court is whether the premium sought is reasonable and proportionate.   The two areas to be considered are the exposure and the risk multiplier.</p>

Since my decision has already been given, I do not propose to explain it further under this head.    I merely record the fact that it is Mr Bacon’s case that my risk assessment was flawed.     One of the matters which he put forward (which was not argued on the earlier occasion) was that the risk in any case can be no greater than the weakest risk factor.    His authority for this being “Risk Assessment in Litigation, Conditional Fee Agreements, Insurance and Funding” by David Chalk, who was at that time Principal Lecturer at Anglia Polytechnic University, published by Butterworths in 2001.   Mr Williams argues that this theory is itself based on a book by Dr Cohen in 1977, which was a hypothesis not made in relation to CFAs.    He goes on to argue that the proposition that all risks must be subsumed against the greatest risk is untenable, and gives the example of a policy covering fire, flood and theft, all of which are assessed as having a 10% risk.    He asks rhetorically if the overall risk is 10%?   Clearly the answer has to be that the risk must be higher than 10%.    I do not propose to comment further on risk assessment. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">With regard to Mr Bacon’s suggestion that the risk should have been adjusted as the case proceeded, this is, Mr Williams submits, not the way group insurance works.   I accept that submission.   Had there been no insurance policy in place, the Defendants would have applied for security.    First Assist regretted giving unlimited cover, and subsequently sought to ameliorate the position, but without success.    The risk to the insurer could, of course, have increased as well as decreased.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Bacon’s suggestion that the administration/profit element should be allowed at a fixed fee of no more than £100,000, or should be charged at a lower rate, for example 10%, is without foundation or evidence.  Save that £100,000 was quoted as a minimum premium at the outset.   The suggestion of a 10% administration/profit element is contrary to normal insurance practice, and is an attempt to reduce the premium to counteract the “extreme windfall profit element”.    There is, however, nothing to support this proposition as being appropriate, and I reject it.   Similarly, for the reasons which I have given, I reject his suggestion that First Assist should have used the 70% prospect of success, rather than 65%.    </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Whilst there is no denying that the premium claimed in this case is extremely high, it is not open to me to reduce that premium, purely on account of the fact that it is so large.    In order to reduce the premium I would need expert evidence of policies providing similar cover available in the market at lower premiums.  There is no such evidence in this case.    Mr Clegg, in his evidence, accepted that an additional 15% for administration and profit was not unreasonable.    He accepted that a minimum premium of £100,000 was reasonable.    He did not think that, at the time when the risk was first being placed, a broker could have achieved better than the anticipated premium of £465,000.  The likely brokerage charge would have been between 10% and 15%, and had the Defendants’ costs and disbursements remained within the initial estimate, the premium would have been commercially acceptable in all the circumstances.

Although these fees have been billed to the Defendants by Macfarlanes, it is submitted that they cannot be said to be recoverable on an inter partes basis, as they relate to matters beyond and separate from the Abidjan Personal Injury Group Litigation.   These reductions reduce the figure which the Defendants say would have been recoverable by them to approximately £11.5 million.  A further reduction of 15% is then made “to balance for unreasonableness”.    The figure deducted is £1.093 million, this appears to be a reduction of approximately 9.5%, rather than 15%.     The overall result is that the figure for Defendants’ costs is reduced from £14,634,160 to £10,393,031, to which must be added £250,000 Claimants’ disbursements.</p>

The original figure put forward, plus the Claimants’ expenses of £250,000, produces a premium of £9.23 million.   Using the Defendants’ amended figure for costs, produces a premium of £6.51 million.    In my judgment, however, there are difficulties with regard to the Defendants’ revised figures.    Given that the Defendants originally put forward a very much higher figure, there needs to be evidence to support the reductions, particularly in regard to ancillary, solicitor and client and other Trafigura lawyers.    I was told that the Defendants have extreme sensitivity about their files, and are accordingly unwilling to give disclosure, but when the court is faced with reductions of this magnitude (which are not accepted by the Claimants) it is not open to me to calculate the premium on the revised figure without some evidence to justify those figures.     </p>
