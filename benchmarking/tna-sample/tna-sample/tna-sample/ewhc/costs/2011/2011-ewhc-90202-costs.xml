It was explained to me that Mr Hare-Brown is a Director of QCC and he was included on the Claim Form simply because it was believed that the name of the person representing his Company needed to be stated; for that reason, QCC has applied for Mr Hare-Brown to be removed from as a party. Alison Trent is the landlord of premises at 149 Fleet Street, London EC4 and Alison Trent &amp; Co are solicitors that she instructed, albeit that Ms Trent is also the principal of that firm. On 1 November 2010, the Solicitors acknowledged service of the Claim Form on behalf of the Landlord opposing the relief claimed in the Claim Form.    The acknowledgment does not state in terms that it was also lodged on behalf of the Solicitors, but no point is taken on that.    </p>

Ms. Alison Trent appeared as a solicitor on behalf of herself as landlord and in her capacity as a solicitor for her own firm. Mr. Hare-Brown represented QCC as a Director of the Company. The documents before the Court included a witness statement made by Ms Trent on 1 November 2011 as Principal of the Solicitors, a skeleton argument she had prepared and a bundle lodged by QCC entitled “Response to Counter-Claim by Alison Trent”. As I did not have an opportunity to read this “Response” in advance of the hearing, I reserved judgment. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is common ground that during the time with which this matter is concerned, QCC was the tenant of Alison Trent in respect of part of the second floor, the third floor and fifth floor of offices at 149 Fleet Street London EC4. These premises were demised under the terms of three separate leases from Alison Trent to QCC, which, in order of time, related respectively, to the three floors I have described (see her witness statement paragraph 6). On 8 April 2009, it came to the Landlord’s notice that QCC had “swapped” names with another company that had been set up called “QCC Technologies Limited”. This had potentially adverse consequences for Alison Trent as landlord. First, as income had been directed by QCC to the new company, there was a risk that QCC would be unable to pay the rent. Second, the presence of the “new” company was likely to cause problems as it was a requirement of Alison Trent’s lender that the demised premises be contracted out of the Landlord and Tenant Act Part II (1954). Third, another company, QCC Interscan, had been permitted by QCC to use the premises in breach of covenant. Finally, there was a security issue about electronic security fobs that had been issued to named personnel of QCC which had then been distributed to other individuals who had no right to enter the demised premises.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In Alison Trent’s view (witness statement 11), these were all matters that breached the terms of the leases and between 8 April 2009 when she had found out about them, and 14 July 2009 when they were made good, she had been put to significant work and expense in her capacity both as landlord and solicitor in order to remedy the breaches. This had been achieved by granting licences to assign and/or variations of the leases. Following completion, Ms Trent looked, as she was entitled to do, to QCC for the costs due to her in her capacity as landlord (see skeleton 4 (c)), QCC’s liability having arisen under clause 17 of the leases which “ required the tenant to pay the landlord’s costs, inter alia, in relation to any breaches or applications” (witness statement 14). </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The claim form does not mention the Solicitors Act 1974, but in my view it is plain that the relief QCC is seeking is an order for detailed assessment of the Invoices under Section 70 or Section 71 of the Act (see paragraph 11 post).    The fact that the Claim Form is silent on this point does not prevent this Court from making an order for assessment (see <span style="font-style:italic">Szekeres v Alan Smeath &amp; Co</span> [2005] 4 Costs LR 707) (Pumfrey J).    I reach this conclusion because the factors which persuaded Pumfrey J at paragraph 7 to make such an order in that case are present here: </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I disagree. As it seems to me, Ms Trent cannot, as she has done, require the tenant to pay the costs to which she has been put as landlord arising from breaches of covenant and at the same time,   deny that her tenant has any entitlement to a detailed assessment of those costs under the Act (see <span style="font-style:italic">Pine v</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">Law Society</span> (2002) EWCA Civ 175). Moreover it is common ground that the sums sought in the Invoices have been claimed from and paid by QCC.  Whilst it is right to say that the Invoices were not printed on the Solicitor’s headed notepaper, nonetheless, Ms Trent has accepted in her witness statement that her firm acted for the Landlord.  In these circumstances, I am satisfied that there was a solicitor/client relationship between Alison Trent as landlord and Alison Trent &amp; Co as solicitor and that the firm rendered invoices to Alison Trent which, in her capacity as landlord and  party chargeable, she has passed on to the QCC for payment as tenant and third party.    It follows, in my judgment, that QCC is in principle entitled to an assessment under s.71 of the Act.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Second, in my view, the charges call for explanation since a number of items might be susceptible to reduction, for example the hours spent preparing the assignment of the lease, collating documents, considering and preparing emails, etc.  Third, the bills have been paid and an order for assessment would not create any adverse cash flow problem for the Solicitors which potentially would be the case were the charges to remain unpaid for a further significant period of time. Fourth, there is here the unusual situation that Ms Trent is both the landlord and solicitor, so she has, in effect, rendered bills to herself. Finally and most importantly, this is not a case in which the solicitor can contend that the making of such an order would cause unfairness and hardship as might arise, where, for example, the client has long since agreed and paid the bill and any responsibility for repayment of any overcharge would fall not upon the client , but upon  the solicitor. Such a situation might arise where the client is no longer a client of the firm or has ceased trading or where the third party has delayed unreasonably in making the application under the Act and the solicitor has already closed his file. They might be reasons for not ordering an assessment under section 71 since it would involve the solicitors in standing the loss in respect of any items disallowed but which the client had previously agreed and paid. But that is not the situation here. On the contrary, QCC applied promptly under section 71 and Alison Trent &amp; Co. can rely on its retainer with Alison Trent to reimburse it for any sums that cannot be passed on to QCC under clause 17, it being remembered in this respect that Alison Trent has not actually paid any costs to Alison Trent &amp; Co.; QCC has. For these reasons, I am satisfied there are special circumstances in this case which justify an order for assessment.</p>

The reason for this is that it will make a difference to the amount that QCC has to pay, since it is implicit that Alison Trent would not have done the work for which she has claimed an indemnity from QCC, had she not authorised it in her capacity as client. It follows that if, when making the application  as  the party chargeable,  QCC cannot object to items sought to be passed on to it because they have been approved by Ms Trent, no purpose will be served in having the assessment since  in that event, the Invoices will be assessed as drawn. In other words, if QCC is limited to making only the challenges to the Invoices that Alison Trent could make, the assessment will achieve nothing because Ms Trent as client can be taken as having authorised all the work that she did as solicitor and the costs will be allowed in full.  </p>

There is nothing in the Act of Parliament which warrants this notion and it is not so. The bill may be taxed at the instance of the mortgagor, who is liable to pay it; but it is the bill between the mortgagee and his solicitor and the mortgagor desiring to tax it must do it on the condition of paying what is due to the solicitor from his client the mortgagee, which possibly may be more then the mortgagee, if he had paid it, could have recovered from the mortgagor. <span style="font-style:italic">The mortgagor asking the taxation against the solicitor has merely the right to tax the bill as between the solicitor and his client the mortgagee</span>”   [Emphasis added]</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:0.50in">When a third party taxes a bill under Section 38 of the Act of 1843, it is clear, both from the wording of the Section itself and the authorities, that the taxation must be on the footing of a taxation between the solicitor and the client<span style="font-style:italic">.  But the third party is not for all purposes in connection with the taxation to be treated as if he were himself a client …</span> [emphasis added]. If the third party be only interested in and liable to pay the costs of one matter, it is clear in my opinion, as a matter of principle, that under Section 38 he can obtain taxation of the bill, so far as concerns that one matter only, and on the footing of being liable to pay only the taxed costs of that matter.  And that principle really decides this case and shews that the appeal should fail.  For in the present case the third party is a mortgagor and he is only interested in the relations between the solicitor and his client so far as they concern position of the client strictly in his character of mortgagee.  The mortgagor is therefore entitled under Section 38 to have taxation of the solicitor’s bill limited to the items of costs incurred by the client strictly in his position of mortgagee.  And it is on that principle that the Taxing Master has proceeded.  It may well be that the client as between himself and the solicitor, is liable for costs incurred in relation to the mortgaged property with which the mortgagor is not concerned, and for which the mortgagor is not liable.  Those will be costs incurred by the mortgagee in his personal capacity so far as concerns the mortgagor and not costs incurred by him in the capacity of mortgagee strictly and properly considered, and accordingly would not have to be taxed or considered by the Taxing Master in a taxation by the mortgagor as third party.  And I add, although it may not be necessary to do so for the purposes of the present case, that if the mortgagee chose to sanction a charge by his solicitor beyond what he and the solicitor knew, or must be taken to have known, could be properly charged as against the mortgagor, though the mortgagee might be bound for the excess by reason of his sanction, the mortgagor would not be bound, for the sanction by the mortgagee would be held as given by him in his personal capacity and not in his capacity as mortgagor .....The principle on which this judgment is based is not, in my opinion, contrary to any express decision that has been cited.  And that principle has been recognised, and I think rightly so, in re …. <span style="font-style:italic">Gray</span> …”</p>

To hold otherwise would be to prevent a third party from obtaining the benefit of Section 38.  Either he would have to forego taxation, or if he obtained it would find himself liable to pay sums which could not be anticipated by him, and for which as third party he was not liable.  Applying the general principle of <span style="font-style:italic">In re Longbothan &amp; Sons</span> (1) to this case, it is clear that the items disallowed by the Taxing Master were items for which Mr Edwards was not liable.  They were items for which the lady would not have been liable to her own solicitors but for the special arrangement between them.  Unless the solicitors had explained these items to Mrs Cotton, shown her that they could not be properly charged against her, and would not be allowed on a party and party taxation, and obtained her special authority, these items could not have been charged against her by them.  Therefore, the third party is not liable for these items under the agreement, and his liability is not increased because he has obtained an order under Section 38.”</p>

So issues arising under that question were not issues as between the Akin Gump and the bank; or between Akin Gump and TMIL (standing in the shoes of the bank). They were issues as between TMIL and the bank. The bank was not a party to the proceedings begun by TMIL.”</p>

For its part, QCC’s case is simple; it contends that Alison Trent &amp; Co’s charges are excessive and that the Court should check the level of the fees that it is reasonable to pass onto to the Company for payment, there being nothing presently outstanding since the Invoices have been settled, albeit “under protest”.</p>

Here the position is different.  Alison Trent is the client; she is also the solicitor.  In these circumstances where she has agreed by way of a “special arrangement”, costs with herself, (or, to use modern language, has given express approval to the costs), in my opinion, the consent given to such an agreement must be real.  Where, as here, both client and solicitor are the same person, I do not consider that such consent can   necessarily have been objectively provided and in these circumstances, it is appropriate to ask whether this is the sort of consent that should bind others and whether it has been affected by the knowledge that the costs would be passed on to a third party; if so, is the consent thereby  tainted?</p>

The Court held that the agreement between the trustees to pay the costs, could not prevent the estate from having the costs investigated (see judgment of Kay LJ at 425). On that basis, in my view, it cannot be an answer for Ms Trent to say (as appears to be her case –see paragraph 72 above) “I have agreed with myself that the Invoices are reasonable and that that agreement precludes any further investigation into them”. For that reason, I do not consider that the Court cannot simply tick through the costs because, as between client and solicitor, no objection has or can be taken to them. On the contrary, because of the closeness of the relationship of both which was not a feature in <span style="font-style:italic">Akin Gump</span>, I consider that further investigation is the just course to take.</p>

In these circumstances, it will not be possible to decide on a preliminary basis, what items need to be assessed since the level of detail in the gross sum bills is insufficient to permit this exercise to be carried out.

That factor was of concern to Lewison J, who considered that the bank should have been a party to the assessment of how much, as mortgagee, it was entitled to pass on to TMIL as mortgagor (see judgment at paragraph 41). Here the point does not arise because Alison Trent is already a party and there is no risk that as  the party chargeable, she  might object to  being joined or  might decline to take part in the proceedings on the grounds that (i) she  was satisfied with the work done by the solicitors,  (ii) the bills were accepted as being reasonable for that reason and (iii) any question of overcharge would be  a matter between the solicitor and the third party to sort out.  It follows that as the three entities involved are already parties, there can, in theory at least,  be simultaneous assessments under Section 71 and under CPR 48.3, albeit with due  recognition being given to the fact  that the two assessments are conceptually distinct (see judgment  at paragraph 42).

In <span style="font-style:italic">Akin Gump, </span>Lewison J did not consider that the Court had any power to order the solicitors to make any (re)payment to the third party under section 71 (see judgment at paragraph 44). That is not a point that arises here. As I have said, whilst QCC cannot interfere with terms that Ms Trent has agreed with herself, she is a party to these proceedings, both as the party chargeable and as the solicitor. In proceedings under 71 of the Act, it is usual for the Court also to make an order under section 70(7) whereby  the Costs Officer, after completing the assessment, must certify what sum “<span style="font-style:italic">is due</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">to or by the solicitor</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">in respect of the bill</span>...” (see Precedent M  to the Costs Practice Direction-White Book volume 1). For the reasons given in paragraph 84<span style="color:#FF0000">   </span>below, that is the order I shall make on this application, in which case there will repose in the Costs Officer, the ability to order the Solicitors make any repayment that is due; this will not be  an order under section 71 but under section 70(7), with an appropriate certificate being drawn up and sealed for that purpose. It follows that the concern that Lewison J expressed that section 71 did not permit   the Court to order Akin Gump to repay TMIL, will not arise here.</p>

That was not the situation in <span style="font-style:italic">Akin Gump</span> where Lewison J expressed the view that Akin Gump would be required to repay sums to TMIL only  if the firm had overcharged the bank and TMIL was subrogated to whatever overpayment it had paid to the solicitors on the bank’s behalf. For that reason, the order in <span style="font-style:italic">Akin Gump</span> requiring the firm to repay costs that the bank had approved, had been wrong in principle (see judgment paragraph 44).</p>

There, to my mind, would lie the hardship.  On the one hand, I see no hardship on the solicitors.  They have always the liability of their own client to fall back upon.  Every solicitor knows his liability to have his bill of costs taxed.  His bill is always liable to be taxed under the third-party section, and, if he puts into his bill items which cannot be charged against the third party, it is no hardship on him if they are not allowed, nor is it any hardship that he cannot be allowed extra items – items which can only be allowed by special agreement when the bill is taxed between solicitor and client.”</p>

I have already set out in paragraph 70 why an assessment as between client and solicitor would not serve any purpose because the outcome would be the assessment of the bill as drawn. In so far as there should be an assessment under CPR 48.3, either concurrently or consecutively, I do not believe that that would meet the justice of the situation, since it would only achieve repayment by the Landlord of any costs that should not have been passed on to the Tenant because they fell outside the terms of Clause 17; it would not permit any reduction to the quantum of items that Ms Trent had agreed with herself were reasonable. Nor do I consider that there should be a fresh action for an account, since in all likelihood,  this would result in the Chancery Division  ordering  an assessment of all the costs contained in the account (see <span style="font-style:italic">Gomba Holdings (Uk) Ltd v Minories Finance Ltd </span> [1992] 3 WLR 723, page 742 at G).  In that event, the dispute would simply return to the forum where QCC had first applied for assessment.

It simply means that as a stranger to that contract, QCC has no right to interfere with it.  What QCC can do is to contend that such items should not be allowed against it, because in making the application under section 71, the Company is not thereby assuming liability for charges that the client and solicitor have agreed are reasonable but which it could not have anticipated  before applying for the third party order. </p>
