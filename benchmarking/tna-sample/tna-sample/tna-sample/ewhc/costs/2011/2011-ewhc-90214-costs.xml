	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In this action the Claimant sought damages from the Defendant following a road traffic accident on 11 December 2002, in which the Claimant suffered cervical and lumbar injuries. On 1 April 2009, after a two day trial, HH Judge Richard Seymour QC (sitting as a Judge of the High Court) gave judgment for the Claimant on the issue of liability for damages to be assessed, the Defendant to pay the Claimant’s costs of the action to the date of judgement. A counterclaim by the Defendant was dismissed.</p>

This assessment is of two bills, the first representing the Claimant’s costs as claimed up to 1 April 2009 and the second the Claimant’s costs thereafter. They total £225,218.61 and £20,608.90 respectively.</p>

They wrote to CMGL enclosing a copy of the letter of 4 April 2006 with (unspecified) enclosures.  Irwin Mitchell offered 28 days for CMGL to instruct solicitors, failing which they warned that they would renew the application for judgment in default. That letter and several reminders were ignored.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In the meantime, on 31 July 2007, the Claimant served his witness statements.    These included a statement from one Mr Safarpour of 18 May 2007 (mis-dated 18 May 2008 by Mr Safarpour). This conflicted with a previous (albeit unsigned and undated) statement of Mr Safarpour provided on a standard form to Norwich Union in March 2003. In that document he had confirmed that he did not know the Claimant and that he had witnessed the accident, which was the fault of the Defendant. In his statement of 18 May 2007 he confirmed that he had known the Claimant for over 12 years, that they were close friends, and that he did not witness the accident.    </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This was significant because Mr Safarpour’s unsigned statement had been sent by Percy Hughes &amp; Roberts to Transportation Claims Ltd with a letter dated 9 May 2003, inviting an admission of liability in the light of what appeared to be independent eye - witness evidence.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">On 24 August 2007 Kennedys wrote to Irwin Mitchell referring to the discrepancies in Mr Safarpour’s evidence. Irwin Mitchell obtained a second witness statement from Mr Safarpour dated 7 October 2007. That statement clarified his position in that he confirmed that he had witnessed the accident and gave more detail of the circumstances, but did little to address previous discrepancies.  </p>

That document had not been seen by the Defendant at the time. I have not been able to identify it. It is not referred to in His Honour Judge Seymour QC’s judgement on liability, referred to below, which considered Mr Safarpour’s evidence in some detail. For those reasons, and because it would not evidently have been of much assistance in addressing concerns about discrepancies in key aspects of Mr Safarpour’s evidence, I do not treat it as material.</p>

However, it did not inevitably follow that a person who exaggerated his disabilities for the purpose of enhancing an award of damages was congenitally incapable of telling the truth, or that he must be telling lies about the circumstances of his accident. In consequence it was right to approach his evidence with caution and a healthy degree of scepticism (paragraphs 74 and 75).

I finally obtained a copy from Irwin Mitchell, who had obtained it from The Queens Bench Division, on 4 February 2011. On doing so I found that the actual, sealed consent order made no provision for costs other than that “…The Defendant do pay the Claimant’s reasonable cost of these proceedings, to be subject to a detailed assessment on the standard basis if not agreed”.</p>

If what is sought is a special order as to costs which a costs judge should follow that obviously should be sought from the trial judge. If it is clear that a costs judge would be assisted in the assessment of costs by some indication from the trial judge about the way in which a trial has been conducted, a request for that indication should be sought…In this case the question of exaggeration was raised before the trial judge. He was expressly enjoined to take the possibility of exaggeration into account under 44.3(5)(d)…That might have led to a special order for costs, e.g. that the claimant should only get 50% of his costs. But the fact that no special order has been made does not preclude the costs judge in assessing costs considering whether the conduct of a party should preclude an award of costs for some particular item. I can see no reason why the costs judge should not consider the effect of such conduct unless some specific finding of the trial judge binds him. Thus a view expressed that exaggeration was not such as to lead to a special order, ought not it seems to me to prevent a costs judge who must have regard to all the circumstances of the case, being entitled to assess what would have happened if a claimant had instructed his lawyers properly.”</p>

He had been left without counsel shortly before trial on the basis that his claim did not stand a reasonable chance of success. It might be thought that he did well to find suitable counsel willing to act. It was in my view reasonable for him to instruct leading counsel in those circumstances.</p>

Notice was given in the Replies that application would be made (as it was, without issuing a discrete application) at the assessment hearing if necessary.

In the alternative, no formal written application is required for relief to be granted.

The delay in serving was 3 months and although the point had been taken in Points of Dispute dated 16 September 2009 no application for relief had been made until 1 November 2010. Nonetheless (paragraphs 60 and 61) the Master did not consider those particular delays to amount to a serious failure to comply with the Costs Practice Direction and was satisfied that the Defendant had suffered no prejudice from them. He found that the sanction that would be imposed if relief were refused in relation to the failure to give statements of reasons – the complete loss of success fees - would be obviously disproportionate.

For example, in the present case I suspect that if the only failure had been in not serving statements of reasons with the bill, once the statements had been served the Defendant would not have pursued the argument that CPR 44.3B applied, the Claimants would not have applied for relief from sanctions, and the point would have withered away”.</p>

That would appear to be the effect of their addition in October 2009, which otherwise would have had no real purpose. The fact that (as Mr Gibbs points out) the failure to comply in this case occurred before they were added would not in my view be an obstacle to exercising that power once it had been given.</p>

There remain objections to both firms of solicitors’ success fees and to Mr Bell’s success fee. In accordance with paragraph 11.7 of the Costs Practice Direction, I will consider those objections in the light of the facts and circumstances as they reasonably appeared to solicitors and counsel at the time the relevant CFAs were signed. In accordance with paragraph 11.8 (1), a key factor will be the risk that the circumstances in which the costs, fees or expenses would be payable might or might not occur.</p>

The only real relevance of any professional negligence is that the possibility of an alternative remedy for the Claimant against his former solicitors might well have made it more difficult to satisfy the court to exercise its discretion under section 33.</p>
