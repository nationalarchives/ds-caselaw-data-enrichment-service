However, there is a second slow motion replay from a different angle which, when it is shown, Paddy Crerand comments that it was a nasty challenge, at one hour 17 minutes.  He also says it was a wild challenge slightly later at approximately one hour 17 minutes, 50 seconds, and refers to the fact that the opposition player, Gary Smith, should have been sent off.  The other commentator questions whether the referee saw it.  Paddy Crerand says that he obviously did see it because he gave a foul (which is later borne out when Chris Eagles takes the free kick for Manchester United) but says what he meant is that he obviously did not see how bad the challenge was.</p>

The points in our favour are that the ball was there to be won by both players………  The other thing that he does which suggests to me that it is not a good challenge is that he straightens his leg as he comes in and that is effectively the implement that caused the damage.  It does seem to make contact with the ball but looks as if it goes right through it, and then breaks Collett’s leg at a fairly low height above the ankle.”</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Claimant submitted that sporting injury cases are unique in the sense that injuries (even career ending ones) are part and parcel of the rough and tumble of competitive sport.  Consequently the threshold for establishing liability in sporting injury cases is a high one.  These cases are relatively rare and in many cases “volenti” can operate as a complete defence.  The fact that the Defendants fought the issue of liability tooth and nail until three weeks prior to the liability hearing, demonstrates that the Defendants believed they had a serious and sustainable defence to the claim and that therefore this was a high risk case.  It was argued that the determination of whether the challenge to Collett constituted a breach of duty was a sensitive issue requiring expert liability evidence.  The liability experts were themselves in conflict on this issue.  It was only after the Defendants’ liability expert appeared to change his opinion at the liability experts’ joint meeting, that the Defendants reconsidered their stance on liability. The Claimant also argued that the high value of the claim increased the risks in the case.  This was borne out by the fact that the matter proceeded to trial which of itself justified the success fee claimed and a subsequent appeal of the judgment which would have been far less likely in a lower value matter.  As such, quantum was highly contentious and could well have had an effect in terms of the order as to the costs obtained by the Claimant had the Defendants’ contentions been upheld.  </p>

The Second Defendants had gone into administration twice, once in 1985 and again in 1988.  Their insurance policy excluded an indemnity to individual players and there was a real risk that the Second Defendant would be unable to satisfy any judgment ordered by the Court.  The Claimant himself was not in a position to meet his own costs in the event that he was successful in recovering damages, but failed to secure a favourable order as to costs between the parties.</p>

It was submitted that it is anomalous that on the one hand the Defendants had offered a success fee of 80% in respect of Leading Counsel’s CFA which was, entered into after the solicitor’s CFA, when only 40% had been offered to the Claimant’s solicitors.  It was submitted that it was not unreasonable for the Claimant’s solicitors to draw a similar conclusion to Leading Counsel five months earlier, particularly given the increased risks assumed by their CFA, which covered any appeal.  The CFA entered into by the solicitors was taken out within six months before the expiry of limitation when proceedings in the case were inevitable.  The Defendants’ denial of liability made within one month of the expiry of the limitation demonstrated a clear intent to fight this case all the way, and thus it was reasonable to set the success fee of the solicitor’s CFA at 100%.</p>

In the event of success, the Claimant remained liable for his solicitors’ costs.  Accordingly it was submitted that the risk of enforceability of any judgment rested with the Claimant, and not with the Claimant’s solicitors.  In relation to the actual risks on liability, at the time the CFAs were entered into, Mr Gibbs referred me to the comments of District Judge Gosnall at the CMC in September 2006, and the subsequent correspondence between the Claimants and Defendants, which demonstrated that the Claimants considered he had a good case on liability.  Substantial work had been carried out prior to the CFA being entered into, a DVD had been obtained, witness statements had been taken from important lay witnesses, and that in the circumstances, the risks in relation to liability were low.  </p>

In this case, using the ready reckoner, it made a difference between the chances of success of 52/53% (90% success fee) and 50% (100% success fee).  </p>

At risk were simply their success fees.  He submitted that there was little, if any, prospect of the Defendants resiling from their admission of liability, bearing in mind the consent order that had been entered into in February 2007.  </p>

He submitted that there can be a legitimate legislative objective in facilitating the right of claimants to have access to the Court in circumstances where the need for that access had been negated by the very offers that quantum risk purports to take into account.

At the time of entering the CFA, Mr Levinson at the Claimant’s solicitors, had viewed the DVD of the incident.  His note in my judgment demonstrates that the DVD was inconclusive.  In addition, Mr Levinson had carried out a brief review of certain photographic stills.  Other than that he had a draft unsigned statement from Ricky Spragia, who, at that point, was sole eye witness, supporting the Claimant’s case.  He was the Claimant’s manager of the reserve team. In addition at the time of the entering of the CFA, the Claimant’s solicitors had statements from Sir Alex Ferguson and a draft statement from Brian McClair, supporting the Claimant’s case.  These statements were based on the DVD footage and as such amounted to inadmissible opinion evidence. I accept the submission of the Claimant that the key evidence in these types of cases is invariably the liability experts’ assessment of the tackle to be deduced from all the available evidence. All the evidence upon which the Claimant sought to rely had not been obtained at the time the CFA was entered into.

I remind myself that this was almost one year since the CFA was entered into in November 2005.  Nevertheless, despite the comments of District Judge Gosnall, the Defendants refused to admit liability until February 2007 when their liability expert altered his position.

This is to be judged primarily as at the date that the CFA is entered into.  The greater the prospects of success, the lower the reasonable and proportionate percentage will be.  It is difficult to be prescriptive about this, however, and there is no magic sliding scale.  Where the chances of success, judged objectively, at the time when the CFA is entered into, are about even or less, the greater the justification will be for a 100% mark-up.  Where the chances of success are great, there will almost invariably be a strong feeling that the CFA mark up should be significantly discounted.

In <span style="font-style:italic">Ku</span>, the Court of Appeal contemplated a low success fee and in <span style="font-style:italic">Peacock</span> “perhaps until the service of the defence”. In other words to have the benefit of a high success fee in the cases that do not settle early.  In this case, the staging affords the Defendants little discount for an early settlement.  A discount of 10% is applied to the period before the trial has commenced.  In my judgment, what Mr Levinson, the Claimant’s solicitor, was contemplating at the time that he entered into the CFA with the Claimant, accords with the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Designer Guild</span>.  In other words, if this case went to trial, a success fee of 100% is easily justified because both sides presumably believed that they had an arguable and winnable case.  At worst, what Mr Levinson was contemplating had the case settled before trial, was that the prospects of success were in the order of between 50% and 55%, which on the ready reckoner approach would equate to a success fee of somewhere in the order of 90%.</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“To add a further 20% success fee to reflect the size of the claim was, in my view, also wrong.  It is probably true in general that high value claims tend to be more complex and to involve a greater amount of work than claims of lower value, but that does not of itself increase the risk of losing.  If more work is done, the base fees are inevitably higher, but the application of a percentage success fee means that the amount recovered by the solicitor if the claim succeeds is correspondingly greater.  It may be the case that the more complex the litigation, the larger number of potential pitfalls, but the right way to allow for that is <span style="font-style:italic">to adjust the chance of success</span> and by that means the success fee [my italics].  To make a direct increase in the success fee itself, is likely to distort the calculation.”</p>

I have already referred to the high threshold test to be adopted in relation to the issue of liability which was clearly a factor in the mind of Mr Levinson when the success fee was set.  In addition a further factor is the “number of different experts required to be instructed”.  Mr Leveinson holds himself out to be an expert in specialist sports injuries with the technical expertise to match.  It is clear from his witness statement that he has had conduct of many winning and losing claims and was therefore fully aware when he entered into the CFA with the Claimant, the number of different experts and the disciplines required in connection with establishing liability, causation and quantum.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Having reviewed all the material that was available to Mr Levinson and his colleagues, at the time that the CFA was entered into, I am satisfied that in respect of the issues of liability, this was far from a straight forward case.  Equally, I am satisfied that Mr Levinson accurately assessed the risks of the Claimant’s case, at the time that the CFA was entered into as being no more than marginally above 50%.  Taking into account the discount of 10% referred to in the CFA, Mr Levinson, in my judgment, accurately assessed the risks in this case, for the reasons set out above, as no more than between 50% and 53%.  I adopt the reasoning of Master Campbell at paragraph 25(i) of <span style="font-style:italic">Peacock</span>, and entirely agree with his conclusion that a party who contends for a high success fee in a matter that has gone a long distance towards trial, (the situation here), stands a better prospect of having that fee approved if a lower success fee would have been payable had the claim settled earlier.  Admittedly the staging in this case was later than in the case of <span style="font-style:italic">Peacock</span>.  Furthermore, the discount for early settlement was relatively small, namely 10%.  Nonetheless, in my judgment, this accurately reflects the Claimant’s case on liability as it was known at the time that the CFA was entered into.  With hindsight, that assessment proved accurate, bearing in mind that the Defendants did not admit liability until very shortly before the trial.  Accordingly, in view of the fact that I have found that there was no quantum risk to the solicitors in relation to their fees, I find that the appropriate level of success fee, bearing in mind the admission of liability prior to the commencement of the liability trial is 90%.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">So far as the risks on liability were concerned, Mr Block has specialist sporting injury experience.  I accept that more evidence was available to him when he made his assessment of risk than was available to the Claimant’s solicitors.  Mr Morgan QC in his written submissions to me, argues that the statement of Mr Block that “the merits are finely balanced and there are also potentially significant potential issues about quantum” is a statement of expert professional opinion for which counsel would be liable for disciplinary action if it were made without foundation.  Accordingly, he submits it should be accorded considerable weight.  I accept that proposition.  Having reviewed the documentation available to leading counsel prior to the entry into the CFA by him, I am satisfied that his opinion was right.  The merits of this case at the time the CFA was entered into, bearing in mind the denial of liability were finely balanced.  The Defendants appear to recognise this fact, bearing in mind that they concede 80% in respect of Mr Block’s success fee, but only 40% for the Claimant’s solicitors.  This reinforces my view that the Defendants accept that the case, on the issue of liability, was finely balanced.  Accordingly, and allowing as I do a discount in respect of quantum risk, I allow 90% success fee in respect of Mr Block QC’s fees.  </p>

In my judgment, the definition of “win” in the solicitors’ CFA which is the same as “success” in counsel’s CFAs, had already been triggered at the time that counsel’s CFA’s had been entered into.  The consent order of 7 February 2007 dealt with the issue of liability with judgment being entered for the Claimant for an amount of damages to be assessed by the court. A consent order was signed by all the parties at least fourteen months before the CFA of Mr Richard Hartley QC was entered into, and that Order not been appealed.  Counsels’ statements of reasons for setting their success fees at 15% refer to the possibility of an application to resile, and the fact that the case was “likely to be risky on quantum”.  In my judgment, bearing in mind that counsel’s CFAs were not entered into until some 14-16 months after a judgment by consent had been entered, any application to resile from the admission from liability would have been unlikely to succeed. This must be the case even though the Claimant had offered to accept judgment for 95% of damages with the Defendants purporting to agree the Claimant’s proposal, but then conceding the issue of liability on a 100% basis.   I find it inconceivable that a court, some fourteen to sixteen months after a consent order admitting 100% liability in this claim, would reopen the entire issue of liability.  Even if an application to resile was successful to the extent of increasing contributory negligence on the part of the Claimant, it would, in my judgment still have been a “win” or “success” thus triggering a success fee. In my judgment paragraph 16 of the APIL/PIBA6 would never have been engaged in this case. The Claimant was successful on the issue of liability and accordingly in my judgment counsel was at no risk in relation to an application to resile.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">So far as quantum risk is concerned, the terms of APIL/PIBA6 make it clear that if the amount of damages awarded by the court is less than a Part 36 offer or payment into Court and that counsel has advised its rejection he will still recover his normal fees for any subsequent work.  If he advises on acceptance he is entitled to normal and success fees for all work done.  This was the case with both the CFA’s of Mr Hartley QC and Mr Boyle and therefore in my judgment, they carried no quantum risk.  Save to the extent that the claim is “lost” in accordance with paragraph 16 of the APIL/PIBA6 terms, counsel will always recover their normal fees.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Hartley and Mr Boyle in their note on success fees, refer me to a number of other risks at paragraph 12.  They crystallise these as the “ordinary risks of litigation”, and, for example, refer to the Claimant ceasing to co-operate or, alternatively, failing to provide instructions, leading to his claim being struck out. Or, by way of another example, some procedural breach or failure to comply with court orders.  Even in these eventualities, the ABIL/PIBA6 terms at paragraph 17 provide that counsel can recover their normal fees from their instructing solicitor for work carried out.  In those circumstances and in my judgment both Mr Richard Hartley QC and Mr Jonathan Boyle carried no risk in relation to the factors set out in their statement of reasons contained within their CFAs.  Accordingly, their success fees will be assessed at nil. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Dealing with the submissions of the parties in relation to the issues arising out of <span style="font-style:italic">MGN Ltd –v- The United Kingdom</span> [2011] ECTHR (Application No 39401/04) and the Defendants’ submissions that in assessing the success fee, the court should take into account, not only the reasonable needs of the Receiving Party, but also the guaranteed rights of the Paying Party. In particular, the right of access to the court and the effect that the success fee is likely to have on that right.  Mr Friston, in his written submissions to me, argues that the Defendants’ right of access to the court has been violated by the fact that a success fee is charged.  In the alternative, it is argued that the right of access has been violated by the fact that counsel’s success fee is calculated in an irrational and unfair way and that both success fees ought to be limited to what is necessary in a democratic society for the purpose of achieving access to justice.  The Defendants rely on Article 6 of the ECHR, namely the right to a fair trial, and submit that on the basis of the MGN decision; circumstances exist in which the Defendants’ human rights may be violated if the costs which are claimed against them are excessive.  To the extent that this is to be taken into account, it is a necessary implication of this decision that the court is able to take the party’s human rights into account.  He submits that the success fees claimed in the bill of costs amount to some £581,832 for the Claimant’s solicitors and £14,816 for counsel, giving a total of £596,648 exclusive of VAT.  He submits that the overall sums which are awarded ought not to be allowed to reach such a high level that it bars access to the court.  In that regard, he submits that I should look at absolute figures, and allow no more than is acceptable so as not to prevent access to justice, and that I should reduce globally the success fee to a level that is not a bar to access to the court.  A practical approach to deal with this issue would be under the guise of proportionality which, it was argued, was positively encouraged by Lord Hope in the <span style="font-style:italic">MGN </span>House of Lords decision, where at paragraph 47 he said this:</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“There remains the question of proportionality.  The direction does not attempt to identify any factors that may be relevant other than directing that the question whether the success fee is proportionate, is a separate question from that relating to the proportionality of the base costs.  On the other hand, it would be wrong to conclude that this an empty exercise.  It is, in the end, the ultimate controlling factor which the court must apply if it is to ensure in a case such as this which is for breach of confidence that the right of access to the court of the Receiving Party to vindicate her right of privacy under Article 8 of the Convention is properly balanced against the losing party’s Article 10 Right of Free Speech.  Account must, of course, be taken of the fact that it is to be the losing party that is being called upon to pay the success fee.  But any reduction in the amount of the percentage increase that is to be paid by the losing party will have to be borne by the client under her agreement with the solicitor.  So the rights and interests of both sides must be considered and weighed up against each other in deciding whether, having regard to the interests at stake, the amount was proportionate.”</p>

The case is not, therefore, remotely comparable to the present.  Second, because unless the liability to pay a success fee can be said to infringe the Defendant’s rights under the convention (which it is clearly not the case here) questions of proportionality and reasonableness do not arise.  It is for Parliament to decide what arrangements viewed overall will best serve the general requirement for access to justice.

The CPR on costs are concerned with whether expenditure on litigation was proportionate to the amount at stake, the interests of the parties, complexity of the issues and so forth.  But Article 10 is concerned with whether a rule which requires unsuccessful defendants, not only to pay the reasonable and proportionate costs of their adversary in the litigation, but also to contribute to the funding of other litigation, is a proportionate measure to provide those other litigants with access to justice, having regard to its effect on the Article 10 right to freedom of expression.
