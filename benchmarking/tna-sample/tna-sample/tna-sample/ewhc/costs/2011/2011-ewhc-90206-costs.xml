Although those decisions are persuasive only, I do recognise that both Judges are Designated Civil Judges of great experience, who are well versed in dealing with issues relating to costs.    It is clear from his judgment that HHJ Harris QC was not aware of the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Gray v Toner</span>, until after he had written his decision.   It is, however, necessary to bear in mind that the statutory background for both those cases is Section 74 of the County Courts Act 1984, whereas the statutory background for the issue before me is Section 17 of the Judgments Act 1838, as amended.   The relevant provisions of the CPR are, of course, the same in the High Court and the County Court.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Williams, having successfully argued before HHJ Stewart QC that no interest should be payable, now finds himself in the position of having to argue that the opposite is the case, and says that he overlooked a particular aspect (see paragraph 33ff below), which, had he brought it to the Judge’s attention, could well have resulted in a different decision. He explained that in <span style="font-style:italic">Gray v Toner</span> the incipitur question (i.e. the question of whether Hunt v Douglas had been reversed by the 1999 amendment to the Judgments Act) in fact emerged only on the day of the appeal, in oral argument.  It was not raised in the lower court or in his skeleton for the appeal. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Both parties agreed, that, whatever the outcome of this hearing, there would be bound to be an application for permission to appeal.    I accept that the issues raised are difficult, and any decision from a higher Court will have ramifications far beyond this particular case.    It is also clear that authoritative guidance needs to be given as to how interest on costs is to be treated in the future.   For those reasons I have set out in considerable detail, both the arguments relied on, and the authorities called in aid to support those arguments.   This has inevitably resulted in a lengthy judgment.   </p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">The Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">K v K</span> … misapprehended the nature of the amendment made to the new form by the Rules of the Supreme Court (Revision) 1965, for the reasons already stated.  The decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Pyman’s</span> case [1884] WN 100 as to the effect of the 1883 rules, as approved by the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Boswell’s</span> case 57 LJ Ch 101, was correct.  Accordingly the incipitur rule prevails. I respectfully agree with the observations of the Court of Appeal that a satisfactory result cannot be achieved in every case, but in my judgment the balance of justice favours the incipitur rule for the following reasons. (1) It is the unsuccessful party to the litigation who, ex hypothesi, has caused the costs unnecessarily to be incurred.   Hence the order made against him. Since interest is not awarded on costs incurred and paid by the successful party before judgment, why should he suffer the added loss of interest on costs incurred and paid after judgment but before the taxing master gives his certificate?  (2) Since, as the Court of Appeal rightly said in the <span style="font-style:italic">Erven Warnink</span> case [1982] 3 All ER 312, payments of costs are likely nowadays to be made to lawyers prior to taxation, then the application of the allocatur rule would generally speaking do greater injustice than the operation of the incipitur rule. Moreover, the incipitur rule provides a further necessary stimulus for payments to be made on account of costs and disbursements prior to taxation, for costs to be more readily agreed and for taxation, when necessary, to be expedited, all of which are desirable developments.  Barristers, solicitors and expert witnesses should not be expected to finance their clients’ litigation until it is completed and the taxing master’s certificate obtained. If interest is not payable on costs between judgment and the completion of taxation, then there is an incentive to delay payment, delay disbursements and taxation. (3) It is common ground between the parties that the unsatisfactory situation illustrated in <span style="font-style:italic">K v K</span> can be simply dealt with by an express agreement between the solicitor and his client that any interest recovered on costs and disbursements after judgment is pronounced but before the taxing master’s certificate is obtained, which costs and disbursements have not in fact been paid prior to taxation, shall as to the interest on the costs belong to the solicitor and as to the interest on disbursements be held by him for and on behalf of the person or persons to whom the disbursements are ultimately paid.”</p>

At first instance interest was awarded from the date of the interlocutory judgment, but on appeal the House of Lords held that Section 17 of the 1838 Act clearly contemplated a single final judgment for a quantified sum, rather than an interlocutory judgment or order, which merely established the defendant’s liability.     Lord Ackner again gave the leading opinion, in which he reviewed the law and the earlier cases, including <span style="font-style:italic">Hunt v Douglas Roofing</span>.    He stated (page 379H): </p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“Put shortly, the respondents argue that since it is accepted on all sides that <span style="font-style:italic">Hunt’s </span>case establishes, and rightly establishes, that the liability to pay interest on costs does not have to await the quantification of those costs, but dates back to the date of the judgment awarding those costs, the same principle should apply to damages.  If quantification is not necessary for the completion of the obligation to pay costs, the same principle should apply to damages. Sections 17 and 18 of the Judgments Act 1838 make no distinction between costs and damages, treating each as a judgment debt.  Since interest on costs runs from the date the judgment was pronounced, then logically interest on damages awarded by that judgment should run from the same date.  Further, the respondents contend that the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Borthwick’s</span> case [1905] 2 K.B. 516, as explained by Eve J. in <span style="font-style:italic">Ashover’s</span> case [1911] 2 Ch. 355, even though its application is limited, has stood the test of time and is good law.</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">In answer to these contentions the appellants argue that there is no logical reason why the same rules should apply to damages as apply to costs, the assessment of damages being a different exercise from the taxation of costs. All that the taxing master is required to do is from his own experience to decide whether costs, which have already been incurred, have been reasonably incurred and then to put a reasonable figure on such costs as at the date of the incipitur or earlier. The costs having all been incurred by the date of the incipitur, the amount at which they will be taxed will be the same whenever the taxation takes place. In contra-distinction, a judge in assessing damages has to assess, not merely the damages suffered before the date of the interlocutory order or interim judgment, but also the damages suffered between then and the date of assessment and the further damages to be suffered in the future. There is no warrant for the fine distinctions arising out of the <span style="font-style:italic">Borthwick</span> and the <span style="font-style:italic">Ashover</span> decisions.</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">I accept that it is an anomaly that an order for payment of costs to be taxed is construed for the purpose of section 17 as a judgment debt, even though, before taxation has been completed, there is no sum for which execution can be levied.  However the courts have accepted since its enactment that section 17 does apply to such an order and, for the reasons set out in my speech in <span style="font-style:italic">Hunt’s</span> case … the balance of justice favours continuing so to treat such an order. The short question is - was I right in concluding that this acceptance is because “a judgment for costs to be taxed is to be treated in the same way as a judgment for damages to be assessed, where the amount ultimately ascertained is treated as if it was mentioned in the judgment - no further order being required.”  The answer is in the negative.</p>

The language of the section does not envisage an interlocutory judgment, but only a final judgment.  This was clearly the view of <span style="font-style:italic">Kindersley V.-C. in Garner v. Briggs</span> (1858) 27 L.J. Ch. 483, which was not cited in the <span style="font-style:italic">Borthwick</span> case or the <span style="font-style:italic">Ashover</span> case. ...</p>

The judgment contemplated by that section is the judgment which quantifies the defendant’s liability, the judgment which has been referred to in the course of these appeals as “the damages judgment.” The artificial distinction drawn in the <span style="font-style:italic">Borthwick</span> case … based on the precise terms in which damages are ordered to be assessed can no longer stand.”</p>

In his submission, in the circumstances of this case, I simply do not have any of the powers set out under 44.3.    He suggests that whilst under the earlier version of the 1838 Act there might have been controversy about the meaning of the words “entering up the judgment”, there has never been any controversy about what the word “judgment” itself meant, so that the judgment in respect of costs did not refer to the costs certificate, but to the substantive judgment itself.   He submits that what carries interest is the judgment itself, not the costs certificate, and in spite of the amendment to Section 17 of the 1838 Act, the meaning of “judgment” has remained the same to this day.</p>

This is borne out by the wording of CPR 44.3, which clearly refers to a Judge making the final costs order, rather than carrying out an assessment.   Although CPR 47.8 and 48.14 give a Costs Judge powers to deal with interest for delay, this does not in his submission import any power to deal with the incidence of interest under CPR 44.3.    Even if the key issues had been heard by MacDuff J, Mr Williams argues that the position would be the same, since the Judge would be sitting as what he called a 44.5 Judge, ie, hearing a detailed assessment, rather than a 44.3 Judge, dealing with the substantive issues.    </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">With regard to the question of when interest should start to run, the Defendants’ case is that it should not start to run until the costs have been assessed, and the relevant interim or final costs certificate issued.   Mr Bacon goes further, and suggests that my jurisdiction is now unfettered, and that I am not bound by <span style="font-style:italic">Hunt v Douglas, </span>or<span style="font-style:italic"> Thomas v Bunn</span>.    Further, he submits there is no reason why the Claimants should receive interest on the costs, since they are not, and never will be, out of pocket.    He points out that the jurisdiction of the court to award interest on costs is essentially a statutory one, arising out of the 1838 Act, and that both <span style="font-style:italic">Hunt v Douglas </span>and<span style="font-style:italic"> Thomas v Bunn</span> were decided prior to the introduction of the CPR.    He argues that there is a critical difference between the wording of Section 17 of the 1838 Act as originally formulated, and the form of words now used by Rules of Court pursuant to the 1999 Amendment to Section 17, CPR 40.8(1), which provides that “the interest shall begin to run from the date that the judgment is given …”      Mr Bacon argues that this form of words needs to be given a modern interpretation, which essentially means that in respect of costs the date the judgment is given is the date of the certificate.    It is this modern approach which, he says, persuaded HHJ Stewart QC that awards for both damages and costs should be treated in the same way, so that interest should only run once the figure for damages or costs has been quantified. </p>

Such a final judgment is to carry interest from the time of entering up “the judgment,” i.e. the judgment which creates the judgment debt, i.e. the final judgment. This is made doubly clear by the provision that the interest shall run “until the same shall be satisfied.” Until there is a quantified sum which the judgment debtor is obliged by the terms of the judgment to pay, there is no judgment which he is able to satisfy.

Article 2(2) specifically excludes costs from the provision that where a judgment is for the payment of a judgment debt, the amount of which is to be determined at a later date, the judgment debt shall carry interest from that later date.     CPR 40.8, which came into force in 1998, and which applies in both the High Court and County Courts, provides that interest shall begin to run from the date that judgment is given unless the court orders otherwise.    He submits that, in that context, interest applies to both damages and costs, and if there is a perceived conflict between the provisions of the 1991 Order and the 1998 Rules, the later rules are to be preferred.    </p>

What Mr Burkill is asking me to do is really to address that anomaly.  If his arguments are good in this case, they are good in every case.  The real problem is that anomaly.  If the problem is to be addressed then it should be confronted head on and that anomaly addressed rather than trying to work around the edges and introduce temporary fixes by deploying provisions for the purposes of which they were almost certainly not intended with uncertain wider consequences.

There is nothing in the statute as amended or in the Rules, which indicates that a different order is only to be made in exceptional circumstances. No doubt there must be a good reason to make such an order, but the Court must not, in my judgment, need to be able to label the circumstances as exceptional. The Rules expressly indicate that the court may order interest to begin from the date before judgment and the circumstances in which it is likely to do so include cases where substantial sums have been paid in costs before the judgment is given - a not exceptional occurrence.</p>

If the receiving party has financed the costs from his own money or from money that he has borrowed at interest, the case for his receiving interest on his costs, at least from some date, is likely to be overwhelming. The position might be different if the finance had been advanced entirely voluntarily, interest free, from a sympathetic relative or institution, as Akenhead J contemplated in <span style="font-style:italic">Fosse Motor Engineers Limited v Conde Nast and National Magazine Distributors Limited</span> [2008] EWHC 2527 QB, or conceivably from a lender which mistakenly failed to call for interest.

In my judgment, it does not. The trustees had to finance the payment of the costs. It no doubt made sense for BS 2000, a company which was owned by the trustees as an asset of the trusts, to advance the necessary funds without interest. The effect of BS 2000 making that advance was to deprive it of the use of that money. As a result, the trusts have been deprived of the benefit which they would have received indirectly from the use of the money. In effect, they have, through BS 2000, borne ultimately and indirectly the expense of the litigation. The interest received by the trustees will enure to the benefit of the trusts. It represents compensation to the trust estate for a company owned by the trust being unable to use the money in question.”</p>

In this case, however, he argues that since the Claimants were represented on CFAs which limited the legal representatives’ costs to what they are able to recover from the paying party (so called CFA lites), so that the Claimants would not in any circumstances ever have to pay anything in respect of costs, there would be no injustice in counsel and solicitors receiving interest on their fees, rather than the Claimants receiving that interest when they have suffered no detriment during the time when costs have not been paid.    In circumstances where the Claimants have no interest in the recovery of profit costs or disbursements, he submits that it is obvious what terms should be implied into the CFAs to give those agreements business efficacy, and to enable the interest to be paid to the legal representatives.    He suggests that there is no difficulty in implying terms into a CFA, since they already have implied terms as to reasonable care and skill.    He also suggests that there are numerous other parts of the CFA where terms necessarily have to be implied.

In hundreds of thousands of CFA cases, until the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Gray v Toner</span>, the parties have assumed that interest would be payable from the date of the judgment.    That interest must belong to someone, and, in his submission, in the CFA the draftsman has not thought of this particular contingency.   Where the contract is silent as to interest, it does not work in relation to interest, it is incomplete, and accordingly it is necessary to imply a term as to interest.    If the interest is said to belong to the client, he submits that this requires an implied term, just as much as if interest is to belong to the solicitor.     The interest, he says, should belong to the party who is out of pocket, ie, the solicitors and legal representatives who have effectively funded the action.     He submits that such a term is necessary. Dealing with the category 2 CFAs, Mr Williams submits that Leigh Day have direct control over the litigation and the costs, and the client never has any interest in the costs because the form of the CFA is the so called CFA lite, which means that the legal representatives will charge the client only what they recover from the paying party. </p>

The court will be prepared to imply a term if there arises from the language of the contract itself, and the circumstances under which it is entered into, an inference that the parties must have intended the stipulation in question [<span style="font-style:italic">Hamlyn &amp; Co v Wood &amp; Co</span> [1891] 2 QB 488, 494].  An implication of this nature may be made in two situations: first, where it is necessary to give business efficacy to the contract, and, secondly, where the term implied represents the obvious, but unexpressed, intention of the parties. … Both, however, depend on the presumed common intention of the parties. Such intention is, in general, to be ascertained objectively and is not dependent on proof of the actual intention of the parties at the time of contracting.”</p>

The Solicitors Costs Information and Client Care Code, which was current when the CFAs were entered into, required solicitors to explain costs information in detail to their clients.   The 2007 Code has similar requirements.  There is no necessity for any term to be implied into the CFAs, some CFAs (not in this case) do contain terms as to interest, others do not.    Both operate satisfactorily however as conditional fee agreements.    He submits that there is no ambiguity in any of the CFAs which requires the court to imply a term into the agreement in order to make it work.    He suggests that Mr Williams is not seeking to construe the meaning of the CFAs, but is attempting to improve the agreement by the insertion of an implied term as to interest.   Furthermore, the improvement to the contract would be for the benefit of Leigh Day, and not for the Claimants themselves.    </p>

It furthermore seems to us that Mr Wilson is right that there is no reason why Blackburn should not have interest at the judgment rate as from 30 January 2002, that being the date of the order of the trial judge.

Section 17 of that Act used to provide that every judgment debt should carry interest from the time of entering up the judgment until the same should be satisfied. Section 18 makes an order for costs a judgment debt within the meaning of section 17 . In <span style="font-style:italic">Hunt v Douglas Roofing</span> [1990] 1 AC 398, the House of Lords decided that interest on costs runs from the date of the judgment or order, even though costs may have been paid years beforehand (the incipitur rule).

He argues that there is no question of a windfall, as it will be an implied term of the insurance arrangement that the insured will account to the insurer for the interest recovered.    In support of this proposition he refers to the judgment of Widgery LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">H Cousins &amp; Co Ltd v D &amp; C Carriers Ltd</span> [1971] 2 QB 230.    In that case the plaintiffs had imported goods from Hong Kong, which arrived at London Docks.

The insurers then decided to pursue the claim against the defendant carriers, and issued proceedings in the plaintiffs’ name.    The matter was settled, but the parties could not agree to what extent interest on the damages was payable.

In that case judgment was entered by consent for damages and costs in 1994. It was not until 2001 that judgment was given for the agreed measure of damages and costs. The Master, who had not had CPR 44.3(6)(g) referred to him, thought that he was bound to order interest to run from the judgment in 1994. The Court of Appeal drew attention to the latter provision and the parties [compromised] on a date from which interest should run, which must have been later than 1994. The Court of Appeal must have proceeded on the basis that the powers of “the court” under CPR 44.3(6) would be exercised by the Master and not only by whoever had given the original or the second judgment. It would be surprising in those circumstances if the powers of the court for the purposes of CPR 40.8(b) could in the present case only have been exercised by Hart J. </p>

The judge who gives judgment for damages to be assessed together with costs may be wholly unaware of the facts which would be relevant to any determination of the date from which interest on costs should run - for example what costs have already been incurred; what costs are likely to be incurred in the future and whether there is any reason why no interest should be recoverable. It would be inappropriate for the parties to have to canvas those issues before him and for the judge to have to enter upon an enquiry as to funding arrangements in advance of the assessment. Complications would arise if, as here, the judge who made the first order was no longer available, or if two orders as to costs had been made, one in relation to liability and one in relation to damages by different judges. In addition, there are circumstances, eg upon an acceptance of a Part 36 offer or a discontinuance, when the claimant would be entitled to his costs when there would have been no judge who made an order for costs. </p>

Mr Seymour submitted that the order made by Master O'Hare not only travelled outside the functions laid down by CPR 47 relating to detailed assessment, but also involved an impermissible retrospective variation of the order made by Hart J. </p>

In <span style="font-style:italic">D Pride &amp; Partners</span>, the Defendant asked for the Judgment Act rate of interest to run from the date of the hearing before Tugendhat J.   The Claimants argued that interest should run as from the date of payment, or, if earlier, 14 days from the dates that costs were agreed or assessed.    Mr Williams adopts the Defendants’ argument in that case, to the effect that this would be to allow the paying party to borrow a substantial sum of money at no interest.</p>

What distinguishes this case, in addition to the introduction of new Rules of Court, is that these proceedings were conducted under a so called CFA lite which ensured that the individual Claimant would never, in any circumstances, have to pay anything towards his or her costs.  Conditional and contingency fee agreements were, of course, not permitted at the time of the House of Lords decisions.  Thus, in my judgment, the incipitur rule still applies, but the court has the power to order that the date from which interest shall begin to run shall be a different date.</p>

With regard to the question whether compensation of the receiving party is the primary purpose of the legislation, Christopher Clarke J in <span style="font-style:italic">Fattal v Walbrook Trustees</span>, again, in my judgment, provides the answer (see paragraph 63 above).   Although Mr Williams argues that a number of important criteria are in play with regard to interest, I do not accept his submission that Christopher Clarke J was incorrect to state at [26] that the primary purpose of an award of interest on a debt, damages or costs is to compensate the recipient for the fact that he has been precluded from obtaining a return on the money which he has had to expend on costs and has therefore been out of pocket.</p>

That document contains a clause to the effect that the solicitors are allowed to keep any interest the opponent pays on the charges.    In the documents originally put before the court the Law Society document was not included.  What was produced was the explanatory document “Your Legal Costs and Charges for Clients being Advised under a Conditional Fee Agreement”.   That document was presumably drafted by, or on behalf of, Leigh Day, but it was not drafted specifically for these proceedings.    Mr Williams argues that the fact that the Law Society document was not produced, and may not have been shown to the clients when being signed up to the CFAs, was not a material consideration, since there are many instances of contracts of insurance being entered into which have not in fact been shown to the other contracting party, eg, motor insurance arranged over the telephone.   In this case, however, the conditional fee agreements are governed by the provisions of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 as amended.     In addition, as Mr Bacon points out, the Solicitors Costs Information and Client Care Code, required solicitors to explain costs information in detail to their clients;  clients who would be entirely ignorant of how a CFA works.    In the absence of any evidence that the contents of the Law Society document or its import was brought to the attention of the Claimants, I find on a balance of probabilities that the question of interest was never discussed in relation to the category 1 CFAs.   </p>

The court has no power to improve upon the instrument which it is called upon to construe, whether it be a contract, a statute or articles of association. It cannot introduce terms to make it fairer or more reasonable. It is concerned only to discover what the instrument means. However, that meaning is not necessarily or always what the authors or parties to the document would have intended. It is the meaning which the instrument would convey to a reasonable person having all the background knowledge which would reasonably be available to the audience to whom the instrument is addressed: see <span style="font-style:italic">Investors Compensation Scheme Ltd v West Bromwich Building Society</span> [1998] 1 WLR 896, 912–913.

The most usual inference in such a case is that nothing is to happen. If the parties had intended something to happen, the instrument would have said so. Otherwise, the express provisions of the instrument are to continue to operate undisturbed. If the event has caused loss to one or other of the parties, the loss lies where it falls.</p>

The event in question is to affect the rights of the parties. The instrument may not have expressly said so, but this is what it must mean. In such a case, it is said that the court implies a term as to what will happen if the event in question occurs. But the implication of the term is not an addition to the instrument. It only spells out what the instrument means.</p>

Take, for example, the question of whether the implied term is “necessary to give business efficacy” to the contract. That formulation serves to underline two important points. The first, conveyed by the use of the word “business”, is that in considering what the instrument would have meant to a reasonable person who had knowledge of the relevant background, one assumes the notional reader will take into account the practical consequences of deciding that it means one thing or the other. In the case of an instrument such as a commercial contract, he will consider whether a different construction would frustrate the apparent business purpose of the parties. That was the basis upon which <span style="font-style:italic">Equitable Life Assurance Society v Hyman</span> [2002] 1 AC 408 was decided. The second, conveyed by the use of the word “necessary”, is that it is not enough for a court to consider that the implied term expresses what it would have been reasonable for the parties to agree to. It must be satisfied that it is what the contract actually means. </p>

It is frequently the case that a contract may work perfectly well in the sense that both parties can perform their express obligations, but the consequences would contradict what a reasonable person would understand the contract to mean. Lord Steyn made this point in the Equitable Life case, at p 459, when he said that in that case an implication was necessary “to give effect to the reasonable expectations of the parties”.”</p>

Here the solicitors have taken a commercial decision to take on the litigation, and have chosen to do so using CFAs which are designed to recognise the risk involved in such litigation by means of the success fee.    In other words, Leigh Day’s investment in this litigation was made in the hope of making a profit from the conduct of it.   It has proved a successful investment.</p>

In those circumstances, as Lord Mustill found in <span style="font-style:italic">Giles v Thompson</span>, although there may be a superficial resemblance to a right to subrogation in an insurance contract, it is no more than superficial, because the subrogated insurer does have an interest in the insured’s cause of action and its fruits, of a kind which the legal representatives do not possess. </p>

I find that the incipitur rule still applies, and that the decisions of the House of Lords in <span style="font-style:italic">Hunt v Douglas </span>and<span style="font-style:italic"> Thomas v Bunn</span> are still binding.    CPR rule 40.8 gives the court the power to make an order that interest shall begin to run from a date other than the date that the judgment is given.    Any interest payable belongs to the Claimants.   It is not appropriate to imply into the CFAs any term that the Claimants should account to Leigh Day for any interest recovered.   Leigh Day therefore have no entitlement to recover interest on their own behalf, even though they may have effectively funded this litigation throughout.    </p>

As I have said there is no difficulty as between Leigh Day and counsel. The CFAs are clear that Leigh Day will use their best endeavours to recover interest on costs and will account to counsel for the appropriate share. To date those endeavours have failed, and, for the reasons I have given, there is no case for the defendants having to pay interest on counsels’ fees.  There was never any agreement between the Claimants and counsel.</p>
