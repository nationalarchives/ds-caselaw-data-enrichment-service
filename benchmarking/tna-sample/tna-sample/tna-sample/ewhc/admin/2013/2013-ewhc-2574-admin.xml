The second judgment (“the Cart judgment”) deals with his permission application in his fourth judicial review and with a disclosure application issued in the first judicial review claim. The third judgment (“the adjournment judgment”) gives my reasons for continuing with the applications despite DK’s non-appearance at the hearing on 24 May 2013 of all his outstanding applications.  It therefore deals with my decision not to adjourn the hearing, to reserve judgment in each of the applications save the recusal application that had not then been issued, to determine them on the basis of the large number of submissions and documents that DK had lodged with the court throughout the five-year history of the various applications for permission to apply for judicial review and then to hand down the resulting judgments.</p>

	      <marker name="tab"/>
	      <span style="font-size:10pt">DK’s litigation has had a remarkable 15-year history. It started as a relatively modest county court commercial claim brought by DK’s company to recover damages from a company called Aptech Ltd for its alleged failure to maintain the company’s automatic telephone system. The claim was struck out at an early stage and DK, having taken an assignment of the cause of action from the liquidator of the claimant company, spent the next six years unsuccessfully attempting to reinstate it and a further seven years in unsuccessfully pursuing satellite complaints arising out of the original proceedings. He is still pursuing the litigation which has become a one-man struggle against DK’s perceived injustices that he considers that he has suffered from those involved in the litigation. These many perpetrators include several members of the judiciary and the tribunal judiciary, many court and tribunal staff members, the legal representatives of the defendant in the county court claim, several police officers in Northumbria Police (“NP”), individual members of the Independent Police Complaints Commission (“IPCC”) and the Information Commissioner (“IC”). Indeed, the litigation appears to have become a personal crusade that has taken over the original claim and to have become a way of life for DG. </span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt">DK’s four judicial review claims relate to, and are a consequence of, that county court action.  His company started it on 12 August 1998 and was struck out by an order dated 25 May 2000 after the company went into liquidation. DK became the claimant by assignment on 24 April 2002. DK’s involvement in the claim from that moment until the action finally came to an end on 13 June 2008 was entirely devoted to repeated but forlorn attempts to reinstate the claim and to avoid having to pay the defendant’s costs. Those attempts have spawned several related complaints and disputes. </span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt">The satellite proceedings started with protracted police investigations by Northumbria Police (“NP”) into DK’s report of the alleged criminal tampering with a court tape by the district judge on which was recorded a costs assessment hearing that that judge had conducted. These investigations concluded that there was no evidence of any criminal conduct. DK then made allegations of misconduct against the officer in charge of those investigations which were rejected by NP. DK then sought unsuccessfully to appeal that rejection to the IPCC. Meanwhile, he had applied unsuccessfully to NP under both the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (“FOIA”) and the Data Protection Act 1998 (“DPA”) for disclosure of the district judge’s statement that he had provided to NP in the course of its investigations. He then engaged in prolonged, complex and unsuccessful appeal and review proceedings under both the FOIA and the DPA. Finally, DK has started four judicial review claims that challenge and seek judicial reviews of some of the critical county court, IPCC and IT decisions in the litigation. </span>

This stage started with DK’s original report of his suspicions in October 2004. That report initiated a series of four NP investigations that ended on 7 November 2007 and the IPCC appeals process that took place between December 2006 and March 2008.</span>

In the second, the IPCC had granted NP a dispensation from investigating a second complaint made by DK about NP’s FOIA delay on the grounds that it was a duplication of his first complaint that had been made in an attempt to circumvent the dismissal of his first complaint about delay. </span>

I discussed DK’s difficulties and, at his request, agreed to send him draft decisions to enable him to decide whether to accept these without the need for a further hearing.

He informed me that he anticipated that it would be heard in the near future. I declined to adjourn the applications but stated that I would reserve judgment and hand down my reserved judgment later. I gave DK permission to serve any further written submissions or documents he wished to rely on so long as these were served promptly. I did not receive any further documents and prepared a draft judgment dismissing the application to amend and the renewed permission applications. On receiving the draft judgment, DK applied for permission to make detailed submissions about the many objections he had about it and for an order that I should not finalise the draft judgment and hand it down until after his disclosure appeal had been heard by the UT. I granted his applications with the effect that the draft judgment was withdrawn. </span>

The UT only finally dismissed DK’s application for permission to appeal to the UT on 1 October 2012. I directed that DK should issue a formal application for permission to amend his relevant judicial review grounds and gave all other necessary directions for the hearing of all outstanding applications in the judicial reviews. As a result, DK issued his application to amend dated 18 February 2013. The proposed amendment is in substantially the same terms as the version served without a formal application on 9 January 2011. It was listed for hearing on 24May 2013. DK did not attend and, for the reasons set out in my extempore judgment, I did not adjourn the hearing of the amendment application or the other applications listed for hearing but reserved judgment.

	      <span style="font-size:10pt">It is now clear that DK decided sometime in March 2013 that he would cease participating in his judicial review proceedings and would instead attempt to disrupt them. He did this by bombarding the staff of the Administrative Court with an unprecedented number of emails and telephone calls. Most of these raised questions about insignificant procedural points and innumerable complaints. I have been informed that, in the period from March to June 2013, he sent the court in excess of 400 emails and made innumerable telephone calls. When it became clear that this tactic would not lead to the amendment hearing being adjourned, he notified the court that he would not attend the hearing on 24 May 2013. This led to my deciding that the applications would be decided on paper without a further hearing and to hand down reserved judgments when they were ready. This, in turn, led to DK’s recent application seeking my recusal and for orders whose effect would be to stay the judicial review claims pending the determination of his recusal application and any subsequent appeals he was minded to bring.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt">This campaign of disruptive emailing and telephoning the Administrative Court was clearly aimed at disrupting the hearing listed for 24 May 2013 of all outstanding applications and of procuring its adjournment. DK has shown by this behaviour that since March 2013, he has had no intention of appearing at, or preparing for, the six applications that were to be heard. It was therefore no surprise when he contacted the court on 23 May 2013 with the information that he was not going to attend the hearing the following day. This was the first occasion on which he had informed the court that he was not proposing to attend. He did not at that stage apply for an adjournment or mention anything about a possible recusal application. The hearing went ahead and I delivered a lengthy extempore judgment explaining why I was proceeding in his absence. I set out in that judgment more detail about the nature and extent of DK’s disruptive behaviour. Having failed to secure an adjournment of the hearing, DK issued a combined recusal, setting aside and adjournment application dated 26 June 2013 seeking my recusal, the setting aside of my earlier procedural orders and an adjournment of the consideration of all outstanding applications . These applications were clearly aimed at causing further delay and disruption. DK attended the hearing of this application on 18 July 2013 by video link to the Administrative Court sitting in London and I heard his submissions at that hearing. DK was, as on previous occasions, attending the hearing via a video link from the Newcastle Family court video centre.  This Part III of this judgment is the reserved judgment that arises from that hearing.</span>

However, DK has represented himself throughout the litigation at all hearings in every court and tribunal where hearings have taken place over the last 15 years. There have been at least 70 such hearings all told.  Throughout, DK has demonstrated a remarkable ability to represent himself adequately as I have myself observed in the approximately six hearings that I have held. It is apparent from a number of other judgments that I have seen, which have been delivered over the years in the course of this litigation by a number of other judges, that several other judges have commented favourably on DK’s ability to conduct his own case at court hearings. DK has therefore demonstrated that he does not require legal representation to present his case and, in any event, he does not appear to have taken any steps before or since 24 May 2013 to obtain legal representation.</span>

It is clear that DK is only applying to set aside these orders in a last-ditch attempt to further delay the handing down of the outstanding judgments. In seeking that further delay, he has acted in flagrant and repeated breach of the CPRs and of his duty to comply with the overriding objective and to co-operate with the court. These breaches include his repeated and unjustified avalanche of emails and telephone calls to the Administrative Court, his refusal to prepare for the hearing on 24 May 2013, his refusal without justification to attend that hearing, his deliberately late notification of his non-attendance coupled with his initial refusal to apply for an adjournment of the hearing on 24 May 2013 and his delay in seeking a recusal, a setting aside of procedural orders, a stay and a further adjournment until he had exhausted all his other tactical options for engineering further delay and disruption. </span>

The unfortunate events on 25 October 2011 that led to the appearance of a judgment being handed down are explained at length in the extempore judgment which should be referred to in relation to this matter.  It has been a matter of deep regret to me and to the Administrative Court that an order was issued that appeared to dismiss the applications by reference to a judgment handed down on 25 October 2011 when no judgment was in fact handed down. However, my earlier judgment explains why no judgment was in fact handed down and why the order was either not issued or issued in a defective form by mistake. DK has received an apology from me for what occurred and I repeat again that the Administrative Court and I apologise to him that he received an order which appears to show that his applications were dismissed when no order was made and no judgment explaining why that order was made was handed down. </span>

DK first learnt about the possible dismissal of his applications in early November 2011 when he received a copy of the order – albeit that that copy was defective in both form and content. He immediately issued a notice of appeal seeking to have the order set aside. DK did not inform the Administrative Court that he had issued that notice of appeal but he did write to the court making a lengthy and justifiable complaint that the order had been made and the judgment had been handed down without his knowledge. </span>

Since he had not received any judgment or draft judgment – because no judgment or draft judgment was issued or sent out at that time – the Administrative Court did not formally notify DK that the order was invalid. As has since been explained to DK, that was also unsatisfactory and it occurred because the Administrative Court had not retained a copy of the order on the court file in the form it was issued to DK, it only retained a copy of the order in draft form and it was assumed that the order had also been sent out in that form. </span>

DK has recently asserted that he never understood that the order had been set aside and had always assumed that it had been made and has remained a valid and effective order. Whether or not DK understood that the order had been set aside is now immaterial. He has acted in a way that is only consistent with it never having been made or, if made, having been set aside and in a way that has always demonstrated his belief that it had been set aside. </span>

DK is now seeking to go back on the procedural steps that he has taken since November 2011, all of which are inconsistent with the order which, if it was not set aside, left dismissed his renewed applications for permission to apply for judicial review in the first three judicial review claims. These steps include his applications for permission to amend, for disclosure and for permission to apply for judicial review being relisted for a hearing on 24 May 2013, none of which could have been issued or listed for a hearing if the judicial review claims had already been dismissed.</span>

The most serious of his allegations of bias or perceived bias is that I have interfered with his attempts to make complaints to the CSU and to the Parliamentary Ombudsman and have then lied to him by denying that I had done so after he had suggested to me in a letter that he wrote to me in March 2013 that I had interfered with the consideration of his complaints. In support of his allegation of interference and mendacity, he has relied on the fact that I had sent two emails which he has not seen but which he has been informed by the CSU that I sent to the CSU and which he has assumed provide clear evidence of my interference with his complaints and of my subsequent mendacity. </span>

I was not previously aware that he had raised a complaint with the CSU about this delay that he had previously alleged had been caused by judicial officers and staff members of the Administrative Court. I was however aware that he would  relying on this delay in a forthcoming judicial review challenge to the UT’s decision dated 3 September 2012 refusing him permission to appeal the IT’s appeal that he had already indicated that he would be making. DK’s email showed that there was a possible overlap between matters that DK was relying on in his forthcoming judicial review and the complaint he was raising with the CSU. I thought that it was desirable to draw that possible overlap to the attention of the CSU once I had been alerted to it by DK’s email since claims dealt with by a judge in court should dealt with wholly separately from and not be mixed up with identical complaints to the CSU about the service provided by the Courts Service in relation to those claims.</span>

The initial size of his claim was about £100,000 as he pleaded it but which in reality was very much smaller. The claim and its follow-up satellite litigation can be divided into five parts:</span>

This complaint was dismissed, reinstated and again dismissed and then the subject of two PCC complaints about inadequacies in the investigation and appeals before those complaints were also dismissed. </span>

The other two JR claims sought relief from the alleged inadequate investigations and two tiers of appeal within the PCC dealing with his complaint to the PCC.</span>

[DK], still convinced that the district judge had lied and falsified evidence and perverted justice, sought copies of all statements taken by the police, including the statement made (not under caution) by the district judge in question under the Freedom of Information Act. He was refused by the police, his appeal to the IC was allowed in part, his appeal to the Information Tribunal was dismissed and then, in the autumn of 2012, his application for permission to appeal was also dismissed by the UT. He is in the course of preparing a JR application to have that refusal set aside. All this for a copy of the DJ's statement which the UT judge told him (having read it privately) only contained one reference to [DK].</span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt;color:#000000">The present position is that I have been waiting since January 2012 to hand down judgment in his applications for permission in the three JRs which were heard together. He successfully spun these hearings out (in front of a succession of judges) by video link to the RCJ from Newcastle Family Court over a 4-year period. I had to labour for hours going through all his complaints and found each of them ill-founded (in a draft judgment still not handed down - see below) and, hence, no article 6 complaint or engagement. Because of the extent and ill-founded nature of his innumerable complaints about judges and court staff, I prepared in draft a very long judgment analysing and dismissing each of his complaints and his complaint in the round. I decided that I should send a copy of my draft judgment to him to give him a last opportunity to comment on the draft, (a sort of "Salmon letter" procedure). This produced 60-pages of irate attempted refutation and a request for a yet further adjournment pending the outcome of his IC appeals. This I granted. 14 months later, we are now trying to fix up a final hearing at which he will seek permission to JR the UT appeal refusal decision, apply for discovery from me in the JR proceedings of the same statements and have a short and final opportunity of seeking to refute my draft judgment as a supplement to his written comments. It is hoped that this hearing will take place in March and my judgment handed down in April - May.</span>

My "intervention" which you were told about was no more than an answer for a request for information by email from, I believe, your team or the PHSO team in which I merely suggested that since every step along the way has yielded a complaint which has always been investigated with remarkable thoroughness, any investigation by the PHSO might want to wait until the last subject-matter for a complaint has come in. But I believe I made it clear, and if I didn't I do now, that I am not concerned to stop any complaint procedure, it is for your team and the PHSO to decide what is appropriate and desirable.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt">  These three renewed applications for permission to apply for judicial review are brought by a tenacious litigant in person, Dr Peter Kelway. They were heard together and each application is closely related to the other two. Their factual background is the claim initially started on 12 August 1998 by Aptech Ltd (“Aptech”) in Gateshead County Court, which is one of the courts that make up the Newcastle-upon-Tyne Combined Court (“Newcastle Combined Court”). The claim was continued by DK, once the relevant causes of action had been assigned to him on 6 June 2001. The claim number is NE804908 and it is hereafter referred to as “the principal claim”. It was finally brought to an end by an order of Judge Walton in the Newcastle County Court dated 13 June 2008 but there still remain outstanding the assessment of some remaining elements of the costs that DK has been ordered to pay and the enforcement of DK’s extensive costs liabilities, all of which remain unpaid. The original defendant was NEP Group Ltd (“NEP”) but it assigned its rights and liabilities arising from this claim to Canon (UK) Ltd (“Canon”) on 25 April 2002 so that, from that date, the principal claim has been brought by DK against Canon. An associated claim seeking an order for the sale of DK’s house which had been charged with his costs liabilities was issued under Part 8 of the Civil Procedure Rules (“CPR”) by Canon on 10 November 2003. This claim (“the enforcement claim”) has a claim number NE311047</span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt">. Both claims involved innumerable applications, hearings and judgments and an excessive amount of court time in the Gateshead, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Carlisle and Preston County Courts, in the High Court sitting in Preston and in the Court of Appeal. This almost unprecedented number of hearings in a county court claim of limited value arose entirely because of the manner in which the principal and enforcement claims were conducted and defended by DK. </span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt">was started by Aptech, a one-man company then owned by DK. Aptech was the company through which DK undertook his consultancy business that advised on the use of speech technology in the provision of special needs education. In November 1993, NEP Group Ltd (“NEP”) entered into an agreement with Aptech to provide maintenance services for Aptech’s telephone system for a fee of £187.68 per annum.  NEP terminated this agreement in a letter dated 7 August 1997 with effect from 3 November 1997. Aptech was in severe financial difficulties when, on behalf of Aptech, DK gave notice dated 30 June 1998 to all of Aptech’s creditors, including NEP, that Aptech was unable to pay its debts and was, therefore insolvent. Aptech should have ceased trading at that point since it is unlawful for a company to continue to trade when it is insolvent. Instead, on 8 August 1998, five weeks after sending out its round-robin letter to its creditors and without first sending NEP a letter before action, Aptech issued the principal claim against NEP seeking damages totalling nearly £100,000. Since Aptech was insolvent at that point, it was unlawful for it to have issued this claim since it could only have done so by continuing to trade whilst it was insolvent.</span>

He drafted and signed the particulars of claim which alleged that the NEP’s breaches of contract in failing to maintain Aptech’s telephone system were the sole reason why Aptech had been forced out of business. These breaches had allegedly occurred during the entire four-year period of the contract between November 1993 and November 1997. NEP instructed its solicitors, Watson Burton (“WB”) to act for it and Mr Mark Heath, then a solicitor in that firm</span>

Aptech and NEP were each required to complete and return this questionnaire within 14 days of its being served on them (CPR 26.3(6). Once the court had received Aptech’s questionnaire, it had a duty promptly to fix the first CMC (“CMC”) hearing (CPR 29.8). This hearing before a district judge would have set a time-table down to the trial and would also have given all necessary procedural directions to enable the trial to take place (CPR 29.3). That trial could and should have taken place by the autumn of 1999 within 12 months of the claim being issued.

	      <span style="font-size:10pt">WB returned NEP’s questionnaire to the court and, as required by the CPR, stated what applications it would be making at the CMC. Its notification stated that NEP would be seeking security for costs from Aptech. Since Aptech, on its own admission, was insolvent, NEP would have been entitled to such an order. This would have required Aptech to provide as security for NEP’s costs by way of a payment into court or other appropriate means a sum of money that would have been sufficient to cover a reasonable estimate of NEP’s costs that Aptech would be ordered to pay to NEP if it succeeded in its defence. If a security for costs order had been made at that time, it would have been coupled with a further order imposing a stay on the principal claim until Aptech had paid into court the sum ordered to be paid as security.  It is obvious that Aptech could not have raised any sum ordered to be provided as security for NEP’s costs at that stage. In consequence, the principal claim would have been stayed and, most likely, would have been brought to an end in late 1998</span>

However, Judge Moir did not accept this evidence, particularly as DK produced no documentary evidence that this sale had taken place or that its proceeds of sale were available to fund the pursuit of the principal claim. In any event, DK made it clear that these funds would only be made available if Aptech’s causes of action were assigned to him. If that happened, a security for costs order could not have been made since only a corporate claimant can be required to provide security.   </p>

Aptech, however, never answered WB’s request and instead took no further part in the principal claim.

From that date, all Aptech’s assets and liabilities were under that liquidator’s sole control and only he could manage its affairs and act on its behalf. Soon after his appointment, the liquidator closed down Aptech’s business and arranged for its premises to be vacated and for it to be moved to his professional address in Chelmsford, Essex. The liquidator did not, either then or subsequently, serve on Gateshead County Court on Aptech’s behalf a notice of the change of its address for service. WB wrote chasing letters to the liquidator dated 12 May and 28 May 1999 that asked whether the principal claim was going to be pursued. The liquidator replied in a letter dated 17 June 1999 promising a response to these queries in the near future. WB never received that promised response and it sent a further chasing letter dated 6 September 1999 and that was also not responded to. It is now clear that the liquidator decided soon after his appointment, having taken legal advice, to abandon the principal claim altogether.

Having heard these submissions, the deputy district judge exercised his discretion to strike the principal claim out under CPR 3.4(1) because the principal claim disclosed no reasonable grounds for being brought and was an abuse of process and because Aptech had been guilty of inexcusable delay in progressing the principal claim and had failed to comply with material provisions of the CPR. Despite DK’s subsequent complaints about this order, the deputy district judge was fully entitled to strike out the principal claim on all these grounds in reliance upon the evidence that had been placed before him. </span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt">When WB received a copy of the deputy district judge’s order dated 26 April 2002, it issued an application notice dated 12 May 2000 applying for it to be set aside and for the principal claim to remain struck out.  This application identified the party to be served as Aptech and that the application should be dealt with at a hearing with a time estimate of ten minutes. That application was issued by being sent to the court with an accompanying witness statement sworn by Mr Heath which set out the background to the principal claim and described its vexatious nature and the inactivity of both Aptech and its liquidator. When the application was initially sent to the court, it was not accompanied by the necessary application fee. The court returned the application to WB who resubmitted it with the appropriate fee under cover of a letter dated 15 May 2000. </span>

In particular, the court had been misled into believing that Aptech’s trading address and its address for service was still its Ponteland address even though he knew that Aptech had vacated that address and that its address for service had been moved to the address of the liquidator. In consequence, the court had served the application and the resulting order by sending them to the Ponteland address so that these documents had never come to Aptech’s attention. DK went so far as to allege that Mr Heath had deliberately misled the court because he wanted the relevant documents to be sent to the wrong address so that they would not come to Aptech’s and the liquidator’s attention with the result that the principal claim would be struck out without any opposition from Aptech and NEP would unfairly be able to succeed in defeating a good claim.</span>

In those circumstances, Gateshead County Court was required to serve each of the documents in contention on Aptech’s address for service by posting them to Aptech’s vacated Ponteland address since that remained its notified address for service. It was not disputed in the reinstatement proceedings that that was the address that had been served with these documents since, as was also accepted, the court file showed that each of the five documents in contention had been served on Aptech at its address for service and had also been returned to the court by the Post Office marked “gone away”.</span>

However, the court was not permitted to respond to that information by unilaterally changing the address for the service of documents on Aptech and could only have done so once Aptech’s liquidator or solicitors acting on his behalf notified the court of a different address. Neither Keyspell nor DK nor WB had the authority of the liquidator to act on behalf of Aptech in relation to a notification of a change of the address for service so that any communication from any of them, however clearly expressed, could not constitute a valid notification of a change of the address for service on Aptech and its liquidator.  </span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt">None of DK’s submissions that the striking out order or any other order was irregular have any validity. District Judge Powell and Judge Moir in their respective judgments considered them at length and rejected them all out of hand and they have no substance. The orders of 12 April 2000, 26 April 2000 and 25 May 2000 and the application notices of 17 March 2000 and 12 May 2000 were regularly served on Aptech and no notice of non-service of the application of 12 May 2000 or of the order of 25 May 2000 was required to be served on WB. It follows that DK was not entitled to have the order treated as being an irregularity and it was not obtained unfairly, illegally or in breach of his article 6 rights. Furthermore, all his complaints and criticisms of the Gateshead County Court in relation to the various communications, applications, hearings and orders it dealt with in the period March – June 2000 were addressed to and rejected by Judge Moir found them all to be ill-founded. I find that Judge Moir was correct and entitled to find in this way.  </span>

DK did not provide the court with a copy of this letter and he did not explain what triggered it. However, it is of particular note that this letter, which initiated the discussions between DK and the liquidator that led to an assignment to him of Aptech’s causes of action against NEP, was dated six days after the striking out order had been made on 25 May 2000. This coincidence of dates suggests that DK had become aware that a striking out order had been made immediately after it had been made yet he did not issue his application to set it aside until 21 November 2001.</span>

Some months later, DK issued an application dated 21 November 2001 seeking an order to reinstate the action. I will refer to this application hereafter as the “reinstatement application”, to the hearing of that application as the “reinstatement hearing” and to the decision made by District Judge Howard as the “reinstatement decision”. DK was unable to proceed with that application since he had not yet been substituted as the claimant and he did issue his application to be substituted as the claimant until 15 April 2002 and was finally substituted as the claimant by an order dated 24 April 2002.  Meanwhile, following the transfer of its assets by NEP to Canon (North East) Business Solutions Ltd (“Canon”), Canon was substituted as the defendant to what had become DK’s action by a consent order dated 11 September 2002.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt">  DK’s application, therefore, could have been struck out on two grounds without there having been a full hearing as to its merits. The first ground was that it was irregular as having been issued by DK before he had been substituted as a claimant and the second that it was not issued in time. CPR 23.10 required Aptech, as the party who had not been served with a copy of the application notice dated 12 May 2000, to apply within seven days after the date that the order of 25 May 2000 was served on its address for service if it wished to apply to have the order set aside or varied. That was the critical date for service since DK was making his application as the assignee and successor of Aptech and, therefore, the relevant date for determining the date by which the application should have been made was defined by CPR 23.10(2) as being one that was within seven days of the service of the order on Aptech as “the person making the application” for the purposes of CPR 23.10(2). Even if DK was entitled to a fresh period of seven days from the date of the service of the order on him, that period would have started from the date he first knew or, or ought to have known of, the making of the order and that date was 31 May 2000 at the latest</span>

However, the court in its discretion was prepared to hear the application, once DK had been substituted as claimant and Canon as defendant, and to treat it as one to which CPR 3.9 was applicable. That enabled the court to consider all periods of delay in the round and to take those into account with all the other relevant circumstances in deciding whether or not to reinstate the principal claim. This was, however, a benign decision and one which was greatly to DK’s advantage in that it gave him a right to a hearing that he was not strictly entitled to.  </span>

He also stated that the Claimant’s claim was speculative in its nature and the Claimant would have great difficulty in succeeding with his action for damages. The Claimant he stated would have an uphill struggle to pursue his claim successfully and it would be very costly for Canon to defend with limited evidence.

They would be at a substantial disadvantage. They would need the support of many witnesses because I view the Claimant’s original claim as speculative and it would need detailed investigations by the Defendant as to all witnesses who might have been involved with Aptech/NEP. </span>

Unless the court directed otherwise, that second application for permission had to be dealt with on paper without a hearing.

	      <span style="font-size:10pt">Judge Moir had all these principles in mind in conducting the two-day hearing, in reaching her decision and in preparing her detailed written reserved judgment. In particular, she approached the application on the basis that any appeal would be a review of the district judge’s decision but that, given the factual background of this case, that approach would inevitably involve a consideration of whether the appeal if brought would have a good prospect of being successful. Moreover, she was particularly conscious that DK was a litigant in person who should be allowed to put forward all the arguments that he wished to advance. She therefore permitted DK to refer to matters and arguments that may not have been advanced before the district judge and she took into account the evidence contained in the further witness statements that had been filed in respect of the contempt of court application that he was also advancing. It is clear from a reading of the transcript of the argument that was made available to me that both DK and Canon’s counsel were, in consequence, able to reargue the entirety of the application to reinstate and did so by reference not only to the arguments put before the district judge but additionally relied on evidence and arguments that had not been referred to below. </span>

No letter before action detailing the principal claim was sent to NEP before the claim form was issued. The claim arose out of a small value annual maintenance contract of the telephone equipment of a small company specialising in the provision of advice and other services to users of special needs technology suffering from learning difficulties. The contract ran for four years for a payment of £187.68 per annum and it ceased when NEP served contractual notice of termination on Aptech. The particulars that Aptech provided of the relevant terms of the contract and of the alleged breaches, causal link between those breaches and the losses suffered and the loss itself were sparse. The principal claim was put forward solely on the basis that NEP had failed to identify, test and rectify faults in the equipment and to report them to BT, the manufacturer of the equipment and Aptech.  </span>

Nothing further happened for two years when, finally, DK took an assignment of NEP’s causes of action. DK issued the application to set aside the strike out after a further unexplained delay of seven months. DK never explained why the case was started by NEP two months after its public announcement that it could not pay its debts, how NEP had intended to fund the action, why he had not taken an assignment of the claim soon after NEP went into liquidation, why that assignment had not been taken much earlier than it was, why the application to set aside the strike out was not issued immediately after he had taken that assignment and why the application was not heard within weeks of it being issued.     </span>

Furthermore, neither DK nor Aptech had the resources to proceed with the claim and NEP had suffered extensive prejudice by that delay.

In those circumstances, both the appeal and the contempt application would, in fairness to all affected parties, have had to have been heard together.

	      <span style="font-size:10pt">DK subsequently expressed the view that the course adopted by Judge Moir was greatly prejudicial to him because, by treating the application solely as a permission application and then in refusing him permission to appeal, the judge had deprived him of the opportunity of applying to the Court of Appeal for permission to advance a second appeal in the Court of Appeal. He contended that, had Judge Moir granted him permission to appeal and then, in the same order, dismissed the appeal, he could have applied to the Court of Appeal for permission to bring a second appeal. However, DK was caused no unfairness or injustice by Judge Moir’s decision. This is because the judgment of Judge Moir showed that she had considered all aspects of the potential appeal and had reached the conclusion that the appeal was not merely one that had no real prospects of success but was hopeless. Thus, even if she had given a rolled up decision covering both the permission application and the appeal itself, she would have made the same order as she in fact made, and would have dismissed the permission application and would have made no order on the appeal. </span>

		<p class="FootnoteText" style="text-align:justify"><span> </span><marker name="tab"/>Judge Moir’s refusal decision was not appealable and no second appeal was possible (section 54(4) of the Access to Justice Act 1999). Had Judge Moir granted DK permission to appeal and had that appeal then been dismissed by her or by another circuit judge, there could have been a second appeal to the Court of Appeal with permission from the circuit judge hearing the appeal or from the Court of Appeal (Article 5 of the Access to Justice Act 1999 (Designation of Appeals) Order 2000). Having refused permission to appeal, Judge Moir made a case management decision relating to the costs of the permission hearing. That was a distinct decision that was not a “final decision” and so a first appeal was possible to a judge of the High Court with permission from Judge Moir, being the circuit judge making the decision, or a High Court judge (Paragraph 2A.3A [as it stood in 2003] of CPR PD 52 and Article 3(1) of the Designation of Appeals Order). </p>

He therefore decided, soon after he received Judge Moir’s handed down judgment, to seek judicial review of Judge Moir’s refusal decision. He was not legally advised and he believed that he could not apply for judicial review until Judge Moir’s order had been amended by the inclusion of a provision setting out Judge Moir’s decision that he should pay Canon’s assessed costs of the permission hearing. His reasoning appears to have been that he would not be allowed by the Administrative Court to seek judicial review of Judge Moir’s permission decision until the entirety of her decision, including the separate decision as to the costs of the permission hearing and the assessment of those costs, had been finalised and set out in a perfected order</span>

When addressing Judge Moir, DK had made no reference to his complaint that the costs that he might have to pay Canon were excessive due to procedural errors which had allowed what should have been a short simple hearing to have been a complex hearing that had taken two days. Moreover, even if he had taken the opportunity to present such an argument to Judge Moir before she reserved judgment, it would have been bound to fail. This is because the hearing had previously been ordered by Judge Walton to be a rolled up hearing and its length was almost entirely due to the way in which DK had chosen to argue it coupled with his having issued his contempt application which inevitably had to be heard with the permission application. During the hearing of what were, in reality, hopeless applications, DK took every conceivable point available to him and, in doing so, explored the documents at unnecessary length. He also pursued a repetitive series of ill-judged complaints of maladministration by the Gateshead County Court, all of which Judge Moir had dismissed. </span>

As soon as he had learnt that the court was not prepared to correct the order, instead of writing a series of inconclusive and vituperative letters to the court, he should have issued an application for a hearing before Judge Moir seeking a correction of the order with a request that the court should serve it on Canon to enable it to be represented at that hearing</span>

These complaints did not achieve his desired intention because an order could only have been amended after the court had issued and served an application seeking such an order, the application had been served on WB, a judge had then considered and approved the application and a formal order giving effect to that decision had then been issued.

District Judge Powell considered that the assessment of the costs that Judge Moir had ordered to be paid should be assessed at the same time as the assessment of the costs of the reinstatement application heard by District Judge Howard. However, that joint assessment of costs had to await the conclusion of DK’s permission application and that could not be made until the order of 18 June 2003 was amended. He therefore adjourned the assessment hearing to a date to be advised in due course when both costs orders could be assessed together. </span>

He has always subsequently contended that the district judge acted without jurisdiction in making this amendment order and that he was unfairly deprived of the opportunity of opposing it. His opposition to the amendment relating to the costs of the permission hearing was a complete volte face.  He has never explained why his adamant insistence, until 27 January 2004, that the permission order should be amended in the way that it was by District Judge Powell so as to include Judge Moir’s costs order was instantaneously transformed into vehement opposition to the order being amended in that way. The explanation seems to be that his change of stance occurred because he had concluded at the hearing on 27 January 2004 that he had no prospect of successfully appealing Judge Moir’s costs order. He therefore decided to change his tactics and, instead, to expand his intended judicial review so that it included Judge Moir’s costs decision within its scope. </span>

DK contended that the district judge had stated that the absence of a costs order prevented him from undertaking an assessment of the costs of the permission hearing and had then stated that he had no power to amend the order and that only Judge Moir could do that. However, to the anger of DK, the district judge after the hearing issued an order amending Judge Moir’s order by adding a costs order to it. He contended that the district judge lacked the jurisdiction to make such an order and that only Judge Moir could have been made it. Moreover, by stating that he would not make the order, and then in issuing it after the hearing, the district judge had deprived him of the opportunity of arguing that that course should not be followed. </span>

He replied that he wished to appeal that order but had been unable to proceed with that appeal because of the defect in Judge Moir’s order. He also raised with the district judge a further failure, as he saw it, of Judge Moir’s order in that it had not extended the temporary stay on the enforcement of the interim costs order that had been imposed by Judge Walton.</span>

This is because CPR 40.12 states that “the court” (and not “the judge making the order”) may at any time correct an accidental slip or omission in an order. In this context, “the court” means any circuit or district judge (or any deputy judge or deputy district judge) of the Newcastle Combined Court. It is normally good practice for the judge who made the order to be the judge who is asked to amend it when necessary under the slip rule but where there are, as here, good reasons for another judge of the court to make a slip rule order, that other judge has the power to make it instead. </span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt">In this case, the judge making the slip rule amendment of a circuit judge’s order was the district judge assigned to the costs assessment hearing that the circuit judge had ordered to take place. This assessment hearing could not proceed until the order was amended. The district judge had made it clear, when adjourning the assessment hearing to enable the order to be amended, that it would be the court that would be making the amendment and both parties appeared to agree that this course should be adopted. There were, therefore, very good reasons for the district judge to make the amending order himself immediately after he had adjourned the assessment hearing rather than for him to delay the assessment process (and DK’s proposed appeal of the costs order) by arranging for Judge Moir to make the order on a later date. This is what Judge Walton decided when hearing DK’s appeal from District Judge Powell’s order</span>

And to that extent he was exercising his judgment in a way in which he was entitled to do. While the Practice Direction in Part 40 suggests that on an opposed application to correct an order, the matter should be if practicable referred to the judge whose order it is, there is no other guidance in the Rules to suggest that circuit judge orders have always to go to a circuit judge and that does not seem to me to correctly reflect the position. I have considered whether in this particular case the District Judge was wrong to do what he did in terms of the Practice Direction, and whether he should have referred the matter to Judge Moir, but in the circumstances I do not think that it was necessary for him to do so. The slip was a clear one and in a court where a judge like Her Honour Judge Moir is extremely busy it can take many months to find time for the matter to be mentioned to her. Bearing in mind also the fact that DK had been pressing for the court to do precisely what the District Judge was proposing to do, it seems to me in those circumstances he was entitled to take the step which he did, and to not follow the procedure which the Practice Direction recommended.”  </span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt">On 26 August 2004, Deputy District Judge Smart made an order for sale. DK had filed an application both seeking an adjournment of and opposing the hearing shortly before the hearing. In it, he submitted that it was not proper to deal with the costs ordered on an interim basis, where detailed assessment of all costs was outstanding, that there was still a stay in force in relation to the enforcement of the interim costs order and that he was intending to seek a judicial review of Judge Moir’s costs order. The deputy district judge refused the application to adjourn the hearing and granted the order for sale. She ruled that there was no evidence that DK was on the point of issuing a judicial review application, that there was no stay still in force that precluded the making of an enforcement order in the form of an order for sale and that there was no basis for contending that it was premature to enforce an interim costs order when a detailed assessment of costs was to take place but had not yet taken place. This ruling of the deputy district judge was the subject of an appeal at a rolled up hearing that was heard by Judge Walton on 2 December 2004 when he granted permission to appeal but then dismissed the appeal</span>

The Walton order did not, however, reimpose a stay on enforcement since, even without paragraph 4, there was no stay in place since this had previously been automatically lifted once Judge Moir’s hearing had been concluded. Thus, the Walton order had no substance since it purported to impose a stay on the effect of the Powell order by reimposing the non-existent stay that the  Powell order had purported to lift.</span>

He first granted DK permission to appeal in relation to that part of the Powell order that had added paragraph 4 to the Moir order, he then allowed the appeal and he finally directed that the Moir order should be redrawn as amended by him. The effect of this second Walton order was to leave the position as it had been before District Judge Powell before issued the Powell order, namely that there was no stay on enforcement in place. This was the view of Judge Walton as can be seen from this passage in his judgment:</span>

It is clear that no injustice occurred when enforcement of the interim costs order was carried forward by the order for sale that was made on 28 August 2004. This extraordinary catalogue of adverse judgments and rulings provides a clear illustration of DK’s stubborn refusal to desist with what was and remains a hopeless argument pursued in an attempt to avoid the inevitable consequences of adverse costs orders imposed on him because of the vexatious claims that he insisted on pursuing.</span>

This anger was apparently caused by his erroneously thinking that the district judge’s slip rule order should have been made by Judge Moir or by another circuit judge in the Newcastle Combined Court if Judge Moir was unavailable or unwilling to make an order. He apparently considered that, had a circuit judge had corrected the order, he could then have appealed Judge Moir’s costs order to a “higher court”, which he appears to have thought was the Court of Appeal. Instead, so he also thought, he could only appeal the corrected costs order to a circuit judge since it had become a district judge’s order once it had been corrected by a district judge. He also thought that he would have a good prospect of succeeding in his costs appeal in the Court of Appeal but that the same appeal would fail if it was heard by a circuit judge in the Newcastle Combined Court because any judge hearing it would inevitably be biased against him. </span>

That chain of reasoning led him to conclude that the tampering that he considered had occurred was the result of District Judge Powell tampering with the tape so as to deliberately edit these exchanges out in a way that would not be detected subsequently. He finally convinced himself that this bizarre criminal conduct by a district judge had been motivated by that judge’s wish, on learning that the tape was to be transcribed, to cover up his error that would otherwise be revealed to anyone reading the transcript. The error that he wanted to cover up was his having assured the parties that he would not make a correcting order that he had no jurisdiction to make and then his issuing a correcting order that he had no jurisdiction to make without giving the parties the chance to argue against that course being taken. </span>

The principle evidence was that of three separate forensic experts who carried out separate technical examinations of the tape. There were at least two copies of the original tape that were examined and, possibly, the original tape was also examined. The first examination was undertaken by an expert commissioned by DK and the other two examinations were undertaken by an expert or experts commissioned by the police. Although these experts’ reports were not made available to me, all three were reported as having been unequivocal that there was no discernible evidence of any tape tampering and, moreover, all three reports made it clear that only a highly skilled and trained technician could have embarked on a process of editing out a passage from the middle of the tape without that being discernible subsequently. </span>

District Judge Powell’s informal statement was not made available to DK but the account of its contents made by the investigating police officer that was made available to him was very revealing of DK’s disillusion in maintaining his allegations about the district judge’s behaviour. This was because the district judge had been able to point out a significant error of transcription that had occurred to the interviewing police officer in that the word “effected” appeared several times in the transcript but that that word should have read “perfected” as in “perfecting a court order”. </span>

However, as the district judge made clear to the police officer interviewing him, he had the power to amend Judge Moir’s order and he exercised that power.

	      <span style="font-size:10pt">Overall, therefore, it was glaringly obvious from the start that District Judge Powell had no motive for tampering with the tape and that there was no evidence that any tape tampering had occurred. The police investigations, endorsed by the CPS review, and endorsed again by the IPCC investigations and report and finally endorsed by the appeal report all pointed inexorably to there being no evidence of any tampering.  There was no evidence that any of the steps in the chain of reasoning that had led DK to conclude that the tape had been tampered with had occurred and that reasoning was in truth literally unbelievable. Moreover, the district judge had left those at the hearing in no doubt that an amended order would be made which would be in the form that DK was seeking. The only difficulty, on DK’s case, with this order when it was issued was that it had been issued by a district judge rather than by Judge Moir who, according to him had been asked by him to amend her order and she had refused. At worst, therefore, the district judge had made a technical error in issuing an order which DK was seeking when it should have been issued by a circuit judge. Since WB informed DK after that firm was informed by DK that a serious procedural error had occurred that it had no objection to that error being corrected if such had occurred, the order could have been re-issued by a circuit judge with the consent of both parties.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt">DK’s adjournment application was listed for hearing on 5 August 2004. In July 2004, DK obtained the transcript of the critical hearing of District Judge Powell that had been held on 27 January 2004 to assist him in his preparations for his threatened judicial review application. He then developed his theory that the tape had been tampered with and this led him to the belief that it would be unfair and unjust for any further costs hearings to take place until the police investigation into that tape tampering had been concluded and any subsequent judicial review had also been completed. He therefore issued an adjournment application on 28 July 2004 seeking an adjournment of the earlier adjournment application hearing that was due for hearing on 5 August 2004. This second adjournment application was heard and dismissed by Judge Walton on 2 August 2004 and the first adjournment application was heard by District Judge Atherton on 5 August 2004. That hearing was itself adjourned because DK was still abroad and it was relisted to be heard on 31 August 2004. </span>

This application was made in Canon’s enforcement claim. DK applied for an adjournment of this application contending that the stay on enforcement originally imposed by Judge Walton on 13 December 2002 in relation to  the enforcement of this costs order remained in force and on the basis that he was about to start judicial review proceedings relating to the permission decision.  The deputy district judge refused the application on the dual basis that the stay had been automatically lifted by Judge Moir’s decision dated 18 June 2004 and had not been reimposed</span>

The transcript did not reproduce what had been said during the concluding part of the hearing and he obtained access to the tape which revealed that either the recording of that part of the hearing was badly distorted or the tape had not recorded it at all. DK immediately assumed that this tape had been tampered with although it became clear subsequently that all that had happened was that the tape had run out before the end of the hearing and the deputy district judge had inadvertently failed to replace the full tape with a fresh tape since that judge had inadvertently overlooked the need to check the tape machine and replace the tape when the current tape had run out. However, DK was not satisfied with this explanation and he reported this alleged further example of tape tampering to the police who soon afterwards declined to investigate this alleged criminal act because was no evidence that the tape had been tampered with. A further reason for the police taking this decision was that they had by then decided that the earlier alleged tape tampering incident had not occurred and that this new allegation was another example of spurious allegations of tape tampering. </span>

Although DK subsequently purported to reserve the right to reinstate this fresh complaint with the IPCC and in the judicial review he is not seeking of the IPCC’s decisions in relation to his complaints to that body, the reality is that no tape tampering occurred, the police reasonably refused to investigate the complaint about that alleged tape tampering and there is no outstanding complaint relating to this complaint before the IPCC or in these judicial review proceedings.  </span>

District Judge Atherton was prepared to grant an adjournment until February 2005 conditional upon DK initiating his judicial review before that date. It would appear that neither DK nor the solicitor representing Canon drew the district judge’s attention to the then recent decision of Deputy District Judge Smart of 26 August 2004 in the enforcement proceedings so that District Judge Atherton appears to have been unaware that he was about to make a decision to adjourn the assessment proceedings which was inconsistent with that recent decision of the deputy district judge</span>

DK responds that he has all this time been seeking tapes of the various hearings and encountering difficulties in obtaining them. While it might be correct that he has encountered problems, I am far from satisfied that they are relevant, given that he has not (save in one respect I will come to) identified what grounds for judicial review he has. He must know the grounds he has in mind, whatever is on the tapes, and, being pressed, he has not save in one respect revealed them.

DK applied to Judge Walton on 6 June 2005 for orders releasing the transcripts of six of these earlier hearings. He also applied for the transcript of one judgment which he claimed he had been wrongly refused. DK had not been refused access to these transcripts since any litigant is entitled to obtain copies of the transcripts of both the hearing and of any judgment delivered at the end of the hearing. His application sought a decision from Judge Walton as to whether he was entitled to these transcripts at public expense. Judge Walton, fairly and correctly, applied what he termed as the “appropriate merits test” in dealing with his application. This test was whether that there was some good reason why the court should provide these transcripts at public expense. If a good reason was shown, DK would be entitled to receive the relevant transcript at public expense since his financial means were such that he was entitled to a remission of the fees otherwise payable for the provision of these transcripts if it was reasonable to be provided with that transcript to assist in subsequent proceedings. </span>

The ruling carefully considered all DK’s arguments for each transcript and set out detailed and cogent reasons for refusing each request. This was a decision that was both reasonable and well within the margin of discretion permitted to him. Following the ruling, DK was no longer justified in seeking adjournments of the cost assessment hearing since he had now received all the documents that he would be able to obtain that he contended he needed to see before the judicial review proceedings were issued. </span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt"> At the conclusion of the hearing, the Court of Appeal imposed a limited CRO on DK which restrained him from making any further application in “these proceedings” without first obtaining the permission of Judge Walton or a deputy appointed by him. The proceedings referred to were the principal claim in which DK was the claimant, claim NE804908, and the enforcement claim that had been started by Canon and which sought an order for the sale of DK’s house, claim NE311047. It is clear that both these claims were being referred to by the words “these proceedings” that are found in the CRO. This is because the Court of Appeal had heard applications in both clams. In relation to principal claim, it had heard an application relating to DK’s application for the release of tapes of hearings in that claim that had taken place in front of Judge Moir on 18 June 2003, Deputy District Judge Smart on 18 September 2003, District Judge Powell on 27 January 2004, District Judge Atherton on 30 September 2004 and District Judge Bullock on 28 February 2005. Although the heading for the Court of Appeal application document only referred to the enforcement claim, NE311047, the part of the application relating to these particular tapes could only have taken place in claim NE804908. Thus the claim whose title number was referred to in the application document was not the only claim that the application document related to. It was merely the lead claim of an application for permission to appeal that was concerned with both the principal and enforcement claims.  </span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt">It followed that the CRO, in referring to “the proceedings” covered both the principal claim started by Aptech and the enforcement claim started by Canon. On 21 August 2007, at the hearing of DK’s application for permission to extend time for issuing a notice of appeal from the order of District Judge Park dated 18 January 2007, Judge Atherton was shown a copy of the Court of Appeal’s CRO and he was asked to dismiss the application because permission had not been obtained  from the judge designated in the CRO to issue the application as was required by the CRO. DK persuaded Judge Atherton that the CRO was not applicable to this application on the grounds that the CRO did not apply to applications made in the principal claim and that its effect was in abeyance since he had issued an application in the Court of Appeal seeking to reopen the appeal</span>

The CRO clearly related to applications in the principal claim and the re-opening application had already been dismissed by the Court of Appeal without a hearing.

It is inconceivable that any of the applications issued in that period would have been permitted had the CRO procedure been followed. Despite the CRO being in force, DK issued at least ten applications without obtaining the permission of Judge Walton, being one issued on 2 January 2007 seeking to set aside District Judge James’s order made on 17 November 2006, two issued on 13 and 30 April 2007 seeking to strike out orders made on 13 and 30 April 2007 and four issued on 23 May, 22 June, 6 November and 12 November 2007 and three issued on 22 February and 28 March and in April 2008</span>

There was no conceivable basis for an adjournment and the district judge had no jurisdiction to make the two mandatory orders that were sought since the application for them was not directed to Canon, the only other party to the principal claim, or even to named individuals concerned with that claim. These orders should have been sought, if they were to be sought at all, as new claims set out in a freshly issued claim form naming the individuals or bodies against whom the orders were sought. Instead, the application merely sought mandatory orders in the principal claim without naming the individuals who were to comply with them.

Moreover, the hearing had gone ahead after an earlier application to have the hearing adjourned had been struck out and the second successful but belated application was advanced on the ground that he was seeking to appeal the order dated 17 January 2007 which was a ground that had not previously been raised. The adjournment had been granted on terms that the costs thrown away should be paid by DK in any event and that these should be summarily assessed in the sum of £1,700 and paid forthwith.

Judge Appleton considered, and placed particular reliance upon, a letter that he was shown at the hearing that had recently been written by Northumbria Police. This stated that the police investigations had been completed and had concluded that there was no substance in any of DK’s complaints about tape tampering. Judge Appleton therefore concluded that there remained no outstanding objection to the assessment hearing taking place and that the proposed appeal had no prospect of success. In consequence, DK was not granted permission to file his notice of appeal out of time. Even if the proposed appeal had had some merit, it is unlikely that time would have been extended since DK had not provided any explanation or justification to excuse the four months’ delay that had occurred in his filing the notice of appeal from District Judge Park’s order.

DK did not appear at this hearing but he had sought an adjournment or dismissal of the charging order application in an application which had been served before the hearing. In support of that application, his written grounds contended that the costs order should never have been made on 24 May 2007 and that it was premature for the sum that he had been ordered to pay Canon its costs thrown away by the adjournment on that earlier occasion to be charged on his house even though these costs had not yet been paid. District Judge Smith considered those grounds and refused the application for an adjournment. He then dealt with the application and concluded that the costs order had been fairly and properly made and that the costs order should have been paid forthwith. He therefore made the interim charging order that Canon  was  seeking.  This was a wholly fair and appropriate order to have been made in those circumstances. </span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt">On 21 November 2007, the assessment of costs hearing finally took place in front of District Judge Park, nearly 4 years after the first hearing had been adjourned by District Judge Powell. DK did not attend this hearing but he submitted a written application for an adjournment by letter to the court dated 21 October 2007, the seventh adjournment application in the series.  The basis of the application was that the hearing was premature both because DK was seeking to appeal Judge Appleton’s order dated 21 August 2007 to the High Court and to the Court of Appeal and because his earlier outstanding application to the Court of Appeal that had originally been listed for hearing on 27 June 2007 had still not been heard</span>

He should take that possibility seriously to heart. DK has mentioned the possibility that he intends to apply for judicial review of these years of proceedings as a whole, or at any rate some part of them. That is an intention which he has been stating for some years before many judges. The outcome of any such application must lie in the future</span>

The first application sought to set aside the final charging order made by District Judge Smith on 31 October 2007 and the second to set aside the assessment order made on 21 November 2007, in both cases on the grounds that these orders had been obtained following an abuse of process. Neither application was one that the district judge had jurisdiction to grant. He held in a short judgment that the only way of setting aside both orders was by way of a successful appeal to a circuit judge. The same result could not also be achieved by way of an application to a district judge to set aside the orders.

In this case, NCC is undoubtedly a public authority and no objection has been taken by NCC that at least one of the orders challenged in the original claim was made by the Carlisle County Court so that it accepts responsibility for any HRA claim that may be brought in relation to the actions of that court as well.

Without expressing a final view, I am prepared to consider, for the purposes of this permission application, that time started to run for the entirety of the breaches giving rise to the article 6(1) claim or claims on 13 June 2008.

In truth, DK has only expanded his claim and pleaded it as a HRA claim on realising that his original claim was far too narrowly drafted and was doomed to fail. He has not, however, put that forward as an explanation but nor has he put forward any other explanation. I can find no basis for granting an extension of time from 13 June 2009 until 9 January 2011, particularly given the delays that had occurred prior to that date, almost all of which were of DK’s making or as a result of his decision to postpone steps or to seek adjournments to suit his own convenience or for reasons that have turned out to be bad or unwarranted.

	      <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:10pt"> </span>
	      <span style="font-size:10pt">his fault and was therefore excusable. Instead, his comments contend at length that the court failed to apply the overriding objective in failing to permit him to proceed with the action, being a failure to apply what he calls the “common sense clause” or “CSC”. However, DK ceased to have any legal entitlement to manage Aptech or to take any management decisions on behalf of that company the moment the winding up order was made. The only person with authority to act on behalf of the company or to receive and be served company documentation was the liquidator who had exclusive decision-making powers and was exclusively responsible for each step taken in the claim and each failure to take any step. In law, all documents had to be served on the last known address of the company unless and until the liquidator served notification of a change of address on the court. If DK wanted to take any step or action on behalf of the company before he had taken a legal assignment of the company’s causes of action, he first needed to have taken a completed assignment of those causes of action or obtained the formal authority of the liquidator to take that step on the liquidator’s behalf.. Any delay caused by the liquidator in not progressing the action was delay that DK inherited responsibility for on taking the assignment of its causes of action. Therefore, DK had no excuse for that lengthy period of delay and that delay alone was sufficient to ensure that the action could not proceed, whether previously struck out or not, once DK had taken the requisite assignment and had started actively to pursue the action in his own name. These were the reasons for the court declining to reinstate the claim and DK has failed to recognise or accept any of them.</span>

Furthermore, the claim as formulated does not rely on delay and no such basis of claim is contended for in the draft amendments.</span>

It is abundantly clear, and indeed always has been, that there is no substance in the allegations that that judge or anyone else tampered with the court tape recording the hearing on 27 October 2004, lied or intentionally sought to mislead those in his court on 27 October 2004, had any ill-disposed motive or malicious intentions about DK, lied to the police during the police investigations that took place or intended to act or actually acted contrary to the provisions of the CPR.</span>

He should also have explained why he contended that the district judge still harboured such malicious feelings about him. DK had not provided any significant evidence of malicious intent. All he provided was evidence that the district judge had conducted a short hearing in an unrelated case on 10 September 1997 that had led the agency solicitor acting for DK’s opposing party to conclude that “a more robust district judge may not have allowed DK such leniency” which is hardly evidence of the district judge any ill-feeling towards him but instead is evidence of the reverse. Finally, DK should also have provided an answer to each of the points set out in the draft judgment showing why the district judge had been completely exonerated.

In September 2006, NP informed DK that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute anyone for the offence that DK had reported the district judge for and it was therefore closing its file in relation to the district judge. Soon afterwards DK submitted a request to NP to record a complaint against Detective Inspector Buzzeo (“DIB”) who was the police officer who had directed the investigations into this reported criminality. The complaint related to alleged misconduct in carrying out those investigations. In November 2007, NP dismissed DK’s complaint against DIB and soon afterwards DK appealed to the IPCC on the basis that NP should not have dismissed that complaint and in December 2007, the IPCC dismissed that appeal. DK then filed a judicial review claim seeking to have that dismissal set aside.</span>

The complainant may then appeal that decision to the IPCC if he or she is dissatisfied with the police’s findings. The procedure that must be followed is explained in detail by the IPCC in statutory guidance that it has published. The relevant guidance governing DK’s recorded complaint and subsequent appeal is the edition of the guidance that preceded the edition that the IPCC published in April 2010. The court has not been provided with a copy of this edition of the guidance because the IPCC has, for understandable reasons of economy, decided not to be represented at the permission hearings, that edition of the guidance is no longer available on the IPCC website and DK has not provided the court with a copy of it. I will proceed on the basis that the April 2010 guidance which is available on the IPCC website is the applicable guidance for DK’s complaint.

DK then filed the claim form on 4 April 2008 and, somewhat unusually, followed this with a letter dated 6 April 2008 setting out specific objections to the specific findings of the IPCC and with a letter before claim dated 23 April 2008 which did no more than repeat the contents of his original letter of 10 November 2007 and the letter of 4 April 2008. </span>

The specific complaints he had originally made about DIB, NP’s responses to those complaints and the IPCC’s decisions in relation to each one of those responses are not addressed by DK’s claim form and grounds document. Instead, there is a long and general series of assertions about the district judge’s alleged tampering with the tape followed by a conclusion that the IPCC investigation lacked thoroughness, that it was heavily biased towards the reports of NP’s officers because these were uncritically accepted, that it was also biased in paying uncritical respect to the actions and attitude of DIB and that it contained many inaccuracies. The remedies that were sought that remain live were that the IPCC’s decision of 20 December 2007 dismissing his appeal should be quashed, that the IPCC should be ordered to re-interview the district judge under caution regarding the statements he made during the hearing he conducted in court on 27 January 2004 and that the IPCC should by ordered to carry out the investigation of his complaints about DIB again from scratch. The claim form does not make it clear whether the order that is sought is that the IPCC should review NP’s dismissal decision or, which is more likely, that NP should re-investigate his original complaints against the district judge.</span>

He also had explained that he had not interviewed the district judge under caution because there had been insufficient evidence to provide reasonable grounds to warrant such an approach. The second was provided by the IPCC appeal decision which stated that the complaint pertained to the methods employed within the investigation which were matters of direction and control and not matters of performance of duty or misconduct.

He asserted that DIB had ignored the fact that three witnesses (himself and the two legal representatives of the defendant) could testify to the fact that the district judge’s recollection of the circumstances of the hearing were at odds with their own written accounts. </span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt">The original complaint and the appeal on the grounds that NP’s decision as to the complaint was in error were both misconceived. The basis upon which the complaint should be decided was whether the practice or behaviour of the police officer being investigated as a result of the complaint was in line with accepted police practice and/or established practice provided by guidelines and other formal advice issued to the police. Since the investigation into the complaint was carried out by an experienced police officer, that officer’s views as to matters of practice and as to what falls within the rubric of direction and control must be given considerable weight since these views are those of an experienced practitioner of policing and police methods. There is clearly an acceptable operational practice, sanctioned by DIB’s Chief Officer under delegated authority that a witness or other person being interviewed in the course of an investigation of possible criminal conduct should not be interviewed under caution unless there is sufficient evidence to provide reasonable grounds for suspecting that individual of having committed a criminal offence. Here, DIB did not instruct the use of the caution because he, and the interviewing officer, did not believe that there was sufficient evidence to provide reasonable grounds for that approach. That belief is overwhelmingly supported by the evidence which does not reveal any criminal offence has having occurred. Moreover, DIB’s decision that the district judge should not be interviewed under caution is itself one taken as a result of the direction and control of his Chief Officer under delegated authority given the direction that a caution should only be used in conjunction with an interview when reasonable grounds exist for such a method of interviewing. Thus, DK’s original complaint about DIB and his appeal to the IPCC that that complaint was dismissed by NP were both misconceived.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt">Two complaints were considered by the IPCC to amount to an abuse of process. This was because the CPS, who had the responsibility for deciding whether the district judge should be charged on the basis of the evidence then available, had decided that he should not be charged because there was no evidence that the tape had been tampered with or that any crime had been committed. It was therefore reasonable for the IPCC to conclude that DK’s complaint that DIB had failed to arrange for appropriate forensic evidence to be obtained was an abuse of process. DK had contended that DIB should have arranged for a forensic examination of the tape recording machine but he failed to do so. However, whatever might have resulted from such an examination could not have influenced the CPS’s decision not to charge the district judge since there was no conceivable way that the results of a forensic examination of the tape recording machine could have turned the CPS’s decision not to charge into a decision to charge given the weight of all the available evidence which showed that no crime had been committed. Thus, there was no basis for contending that DIB had misconducted the investigation by not obtaining forensic evidence of the tape recording machine since the CPS had concluded that there was no evidence that any crime had been committed so that the results of such an examination would have been irrelevant and unnecessary whatever they might have revealed.</span>

On this second occasion, the tape in question had recorded the proceedings before a deputy district judge on 26 August 2004. The tape had, as soon became clear, not been tampered with. Instead, it had run out before the hearing had been concluded and had not been replaced due to oversight. It had also initially been thought that there had been a recording malfunction on part of the tape but what was heard as malfunctioning was subsequently found to be background noise that was found on the part of the tape that followed the point where the recording had cut out. The police recorded the complaint but soon afterwards refused to investigate it further since DK was unable to persuade the officers investigating it that it disclosed any evidence of potential criminal conduct. </span>

NP refused the request under the FOIA and its’ refusal notice stated that this refusal was based on the information being exempt under sections 30(1) and 30(2) of the FOIA and that the exemption would not be disapplied because the public interest in withholding the information outweighed the public interest in disclosing it. According to DK, he was subsequently informed by someone within the NP that NP had changed its mind on receipt of the second request for information and had decided that it could proceed under both the DPA and the FOIA and that DK was entitled to choose which regime to apply under. </span>

He asserts, with some justification, that it was necessary to name an officer involved in the alleged deception and delay in order to overcome the technical difficulty that the complaints procedure cannot be used to investigate a complaint against the police force as a body. If that was the defect in the first complaint, DK’s ploy would have successfully transformed an incompetent to a competent complaint. However, the fundamental difficulty about both complaints is that they are, or are said to be, direction and control complaints. Thus, the real purpose of the judicial review and the only purpose that it was brought to achieve, was to show that the complaint is not a direction and control matter. That issue arose in the first complaint and DK could and should have instituted judicial review proceedings seeking to quash the first decision dated 7 December 2007. By starting this judicial review claim on 15 May 2008, DK is over 2 months out of time. </span>

NP’s explanation is that the delay from 28 December 2006 until 30 January 2007 was due to administrative failures within the department. That reason is sufficient to show that the failing was not that of the individual cited but rather of the administrative procedures that had been put in place for the department to answer the somewhat difficult and technical questions arising out of FOIA and DPA requests and the answers to be given to those requests in general which were applied to answering DK’s requests in particular. That shortcoming or those shortcomings fall within the somewhat nebulous definition of direction and control so that the decision to dispense was wholly justified as was the decision that the complaint fell outside the statutory scheme and was not notifiable and was properly reclassified.</span>

He has been threatening judicial review since 2003 and by those threats succeeded in delaying the costs assessment and enforcement process for nearly five years. The present judicial review proceedings were started five years and five months after Judge Moir’s refusal of permission to appeal the reinstatement decision of the district judge. I can summarise when judicial review could be applicable to county court proceedings in this way:</span>

The original costs decision dated 21 November 2007 could have been, but was not, made the subject of an application for permission to appeal.

He has been subject to many previous findings of bringing applications that are totally without merit during the course of the proceedings in the NCC and was the subject of 2 civil restraint orders during the course of this litigation.
