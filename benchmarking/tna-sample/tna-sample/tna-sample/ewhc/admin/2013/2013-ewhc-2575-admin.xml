In those circumstances, it is incumbent on the Administrative Court considering the Cart application to consider what decision the UT judge should have reached.

The principal basis for claiming discovery is by way of an application under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (“FOIA”) or, if that is unsuccessful, by way of an application for disclosure of personal data under the Data Protection Act 1998 (“DPA”). Finally, they are claimed by way of disclosure by Northumbria Police (“NP”) in the relevant judicial review claim or by way of non-party disclosure in the same claim.

At that time, an appeal from the IT lay to the Administrative Court exercising appellate functions and it was necessary for him to apply to, and obtain from, the Administrative Court permission to appeal. Initially, DK mistakenly thought that his appeal from the IT lay to the Court of Appeal and he lodged a notice of appeal with the Court of Appeal within a month of the substantive decision, being the then applicable time limit for filing such an appeal in the Administrative Court. This notice of appeal was transferred to the Administrative Court and then filed with that Court on 4 March 2010. By then, the jurisdiction of the IT had been transferred to the FtT (General Regulatory Chamber) and outstanding applications for permission to appeal from the IT and the appeals themselves were also transferred automatically from the Administrative Court to the UT.  </span>

An oral hearing took place to consider whether time should be extended for both the substantive and costs appeals and permission to appeal should be granted. These documents were before the UT judge at the oral hearing that that judge had directed should take place. The UT has the power to deal with applications to extend time and for permission to appeal on paper and it is only in an exceptional case that these applications are dealt with orally. The UT judge assigned to the applications took the view that the exceptional features of this case arising from the lengthy delays that had occurred, the unusual and difficult issues of law that had to be considered and the fact that DK was a litigant in person warranted an oral hearing. </span>

DK was advised to give notice to the defendant and the interested party of that direction. The UT served an acknowledgement of service which indicated that it relied on the two refusal decisions of UTJ Jacobs and did not propose to take any part in the proceedings and the NP did not serve one.

When the applications were called on, and in the absence of DK at the pre-arranged video link which he has always been provided with in the many previous hearings in his judicial reviews, I formally refused to adjourn any of the applications and gave a lengthy extempore judgment setting out my reasons why I would decide each of them in reserved judgments which I would hand down at a later date. In relation to this Cart application, as an additional reason for taking that course, it would ordinarily have been decided on paper, all the necessary documents had been lodged with the court and I was, in reality, merely reverting to the ordinary procedure for deciding the application.</span>

This rule replaced, for Cart claims,  CPR 54.5(1) which provides that a judicial review claim should be filed promptly and, in any event, no later than 3 months after the grounds for making the claim (i.e. in this case when the UT refusal decision was promulgated and sent out) first arise.

DK relied on the ground that there had been a procedural irregularity in the UT permission application proceedings.

In other words, this provision, as with all other provisions of the CPR, is to be applied so as to ensure that the case is dealt with expeditiously and fairly so as to allot to the case an appropriate share of the court’s resources. Furthermore, the timescale within which a judicial review claim must be lodged is subject to an extension of time if applied for under CPR 3.1(2)(a) which must be considered by taking appropriate account of all relevant circumstances including the 9 factors listed in CPR 3.9(1).

The answer to that difficulty is that in the rare case where a valid setting aside application is made (as opposed to an invalid application that is made on grounds other than those prescribed by Rule 43 of the UT Rules), time for filing a judicial review claim should be postponed until the UT sends to the claimant the setting aside refusal decision. </span>

However, DK filed his claim form on 11 March 2013, being 20 weeks and 6 days after 17 October 2012. He did not apply for an extension of time in the claim for as required by CPR 54 nor did he serve a witness statement setting out the grounds relied on for seeking an extension of time. The court in a directions order dated 11 March 2013 pointed out the 16-day timescale for filing a Cart claim and the case lawyer subsequently pointed out to DK that he needed to apply for an extension of time and serve evidence in support of that application. DK, somewhat belatedly, served his sixth witness statement in the UT proceedings dated 27 April 2013 in which he contended that time had already been extended so that there was no issue for the Court to decide in respect of the claim being filed out of time. He has not, therefore, strictly speaking, applied for an extension of time but I will, nonetheless, treat his witness statement as containing an application even though it also contends that he does not need one.</span>

In addition to the Cart claim, DH has three other judicial reviews awaiting a decision on his renewed applications for permission. All these judicial reviews arose out of a protracted case that DK started in the 12 August 1998 in the Gateshead County Court and which was only finally brought to an end by an order dated 13 June 2008. In that lengthy period, 110 orders were issued by the various courts involved in interminable procedural wrangling initiated by DK. In all, there were 62 separate hearings each of which yielded a perfected order and a further 48 orders were issued without a hearing. These hearings were conducted by at least 30 different judges at different levels of the court hierarchy, namely the Court of appeal and High Court and the County Court at both circuit judge and district judge levels. Amongst many other complaints about many of the district judges and court staff involved in these hearings was a two-fold complaint that a district judge had reneged on an assurance that he would not issue a particular order which he had no jurisdiction to issue and had subsequently tampered with the tape recording his proceedings so as to erase from it the recording of him giving that assurance. That district judge’s statement and statements from two others who were present in the district judge’s court when the critical assurance was said to have been given formed the principal subject-matter of DK’s applications for disclosure under the FOIA to the Newcastle Police (“NP”) and his appeals to the Information Commissioner (“IC”), the IT and the UT. </span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">DK finally filed his first judicial review claim in the Administrative Court on 9 April 2008. This claim challenged a decision of the IPCC dated 20 December 2007 that confirmed its earlier decision dated 20 December 2007 not to investigate DK’s complaints about the conduct of  the investigating police officer into his complaint to the police that the district judge had criminally tampered with the tape of his hearing. DK stated in the claim form that although he considered that his claim arose on 14 March 2008 when he received answers from the IPCC to his complaints about the decision, he accepted that the claim may have arisen on 20 December 2007.  The refusing district judge’s decision was that an extension should not be granted since the latest date that the claim should have been filed was immediately following the receipt of the IPCC’s answers on 14 March 2008 but it was actually filed on 9 April some over 3 weeks later than it could and should have been and some 2 weeks later than the expiry of the 3-month long stop period. Permission was refused on the dual grounds that his claim was filed out of time and no extension should be granted and it lacked sufficient merit.  </span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> DK filed his second judicial review claim in the Administrative Court on 15 May 2008. This claim challenged decisions of the IPCC dated 7 December 2007 and 31 March 2008. The first decision dismissed his appeal from NP’s dismissal of a complaint involving the direction and control of a police officer which fell outside the complaints procedure. The second decision granted NP a dispensation from investigating a second complaint against NP because that complaint was a repetition of an earlier complaint. The substance of DK’s complaints was to be found in his first complaint and his judicial review was filed more than 2 months out of time. Permission was refused on the grounds of the claims intrinsic lack of merits but could as well have been refused on the grounds that the judicial review was filed out of time.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">DK filed his third judicial review in the Administrative Court on 7 November 2008. This claim was brought against Newcastle Combined Court (NCC) and, on analysis, it challenged two critical decisions of different circuit judges refusing permission to appeal in decisions dated 18 June 2003 and 13 June 2008. The principle decision being challenged was the first of these two decisions. DK had threatened various judges in the NCC on several occasions since 2004 that he would be filing a judicial review claim but the claim was only filed about 4½ years after the first decision and nearly 5 months after the second decision being challenged had been made. In an attempt to circumvent the delay that had occurred, DK alleged that his challenge was to the second decision dated 13 June 2008. Even if that contention was correct, the claim should have been filed within about 1 month of the decision but was in fact filed 4 months out of time or, if the 3-month longstop time limit was appropriate, over 2 months out of time. Permission was refused on the dual grounds of delayed filing and the lack of any merits.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> DK made renewed applications for permission in each of the three claims. If he was still under any misapprehension about the need to file judicial review claims promptly and in accordance with the provisions of CPR 54, he would have learnt that his views were mistaken on receiving an order dated 19 August 2010 which included a provisional decision that I had drafted in relation to DK’s renewed applications. This explained to DK the strict nature of the judicial review time limit provision that required a claim to be filed as soon as reasonably practicable after the decision complained of and in any event no later than 3 months later unless there are exceptional circumstances which should be spelt out in the accompanying application for an extension of time. On those grounds, the provisional decision was to the effect that all three judicial review claims were filed out of time. In consequence, the provision decision was to the effect that that permission should be refused in all three claims on the basis of delay as well as because none of the three claims had any prospect of success.</span>

The principle documents that he was seeking were copies of the statement the district judge made to the police officer investigating the complaint against him and the statements of two representatives of the defendant’s solicitors who had been present at the original hearing. DK also set to work to expand his judicial review claim against the NCC to include a general complaint that there had been systematic and general unfairness by the court system that had deprived him of fair hearings throughout the entirety of the ten-year period that his claim was being pursued. DK succeeded in having his renewed permission hearings in his three claims delayed until 10 March 2010. At that hearing, he sought an adjournment on the grounds that he should first be allowed to obtain a copy of the district judge’s statement from NP. He was allowed an adjournment and principally because the restored hearing was directed to await the conclusion of his FOIA disclosure proceedings, the hearing was not restored. </span>

Soon afterwards, DK informed the court that his applications for an extension of time and for permission to appeal would be heard on 3 September 2012. I responded by informing DK that I would until 30 September 2012 to conclude the renewed permission applications.  On 17 September 2012, DK informed me that the UT judge had refused him permission but he was about to apply for that decision to be set aside and that he had until 5 October 2012 to “appeal that order”. He also indicated that he would be applying for a disclosure order in the judicial review against the IPCC for disclosure of the documents he was also seeking in the FOIA proceedings. On 19 September 2012, the court informed DK that if he wanted a further adjournment, he should issue a formal application in the Administrative Court which, if issued, would deal with in a telephone hearing. </span>

In the email, DK informed the court that he had failed to persuade the UT to set aside its decision refusing him permission and invited the court “to revise my draft (sic) order in the light of this situation”. He also asked the court to order that a copy of the transcript of the hearing before the UT should be made available to him at public expense. DK did not issue an application seeking to vary the order dated 20 September 2012. The court issued a further order dated 21 January 2013 refusing DK’S request for a transcript at public expense. The order also directed that the relevant date in paragraphs 3 and 4 of the order of 20 September 2012 should be changed to Wednesday 13 February 2013, thus requiring the claim form to be issued by that new date. This direction did not constitute an extension of time within which to file the claim form. No extension of time had been applied for and, in any event, an extension of time can only be sought and granted once the judicial review claim has been issued. CPR 54 requires the claimant in a judicial review, if an extension of time is sought, to apply for the extension in section 7 of the claim form accompanied by reasons for the delay set out in a supporting witness statement.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">None of these reasons holds water. DK had received a clear direction on 20 September 2012 to issue and file a Cart claim with the Administrative Court by 19 October 2012 if he intended to proceed with it. He made no contact with the court until he sent an email to the court on 17 December 2012 which referred to a previous contact on 20 October 2012 which was never received by the court and which it appears from the chain of emails sent with the 17 December 2012 email was never sent. If DK had been granted an extension of time on 20 September 2012 for filing a Cart claim, that extension was only to 19 October 2012 and if he wanted a further extension, he should have made a formal application having obtained a fee remission before 19 October 2012 and he would only have been entitled to delay issuing the claim beyond that date if the court granted him a further extension beyond that date. It is clear from his failure to provide an explanation for the delay that he had no basis for obtaining an extension up to 17 December 2012. The order of 21 January 2013 did not, expressly or impliedly extend time for filing the as yet non-existent claim form. All it did was to grant a yet further extension for the culmination of the application for permission process in the three existing judicial review claims.  </span>

The claim form did not arrive in draft at the Administrative Court until about 3 March 2013 but it could not be filed because DK had neither applied for a fee remission nor enclosed the requisite fee. This was not a minor and excusable slip as DK subsequently asserted. From his previous long history of filing applications and claims, DK knew that the court could not and would not file his claim without a fee remission. Given the delays that had occurred, even on DK’s way of looking at this claim, the 13 February 2013 deadline was an absolute and final deadline which cannot be excused by postal delays or oversight with regard to the necessary fee remission. </span>

This conclusion is only provisional at this stage since, if I was to conclude that this case is so exceptional that DK would otherwise be granted permission to apply for a review the UT judge’s decision had there been no delay or need for an extension of time, I would need to consider whether to grant permission despite the lengthy delay</span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Before considering whether the UT decision refusing DK permission to appeal the decision of the IT, it is necessary to understand the relevant complex and arcane features of the FOIA and the DPA that deal with “personal data”. The DPA was enacted in 1998 to give effect in the UK to Directive 95/46/EC on personal data, one of whose principal objectives is to protect the fundamental rights of individuals. One of the principle ways that the Directive seeks to achieve that protection is by seeking to ensure that anyone, whether a public authority or a private company or individual, who holds or processes</span>

		</p>
	      </authorialNote>
	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> personal data of other individuals in electronic or manual form (“the data controller”) preserves its confidentiality, holds it in controlled, regulated and accessible conditions and allows access to it to the individual whose data it is (“the data subject”). In other words, personal data should be processed in controlled conditions, only made accessible in situations in which it is reasonably necessary to release it and readily accessible to the individual to enable the individual to know that the personal data were being stored and to enable them to be checked and corrected.  An individual who wishes to have access to his personal data should only be deprived of access for very good reason and in the overriding public interest. The FOIA was enacted two years later pursuant to the then Government’s political pledge to open up decision-making and the decision-making process of public authorities to the general public. </span>

A system of satellite location is set up by a taxi company which makes it possible to determine the position of available taxis in real time. The purpose of the processing is to provide better service and save fuel, by assigning to each client ordering a cab the car that is closest to the client’s address. Strictly speaking the data needed for that system is data relating to cars, not about the drivers. The purpose of the processing is not to evaluate the performance of taxi drivers, for instance through the optimization of their itineraries. Yet, the system does allow monitoring the performance of taxi drivers and checking whether they respect speed limits, seek appropriate itineraries, are at the steering wheel or are resting outside, etc. It can therefore have a considerable impact on these individuals, and as such the data may be considered to also relate to natural persons.

It follows from what I have said that not all information retrieved from a computer search against an individual's name or unique identifier is personal data within the Act. Mere mention of the data subject in a document held by a data controller does not necessarily amount to his personal data. Whether it does so in any particular instance depends on where it falls in a continuum of relevance or proximity to the data subject as distinct, say, from transactions or matters in which he may have been involved to a greater or lesser degree. It seems to me that there are two notions that may be of assistance. The first is whether the information is biographical in a significant sense, that is, going beyond the recording of the putative data subject's involvement in a matter or an event that has no personal connotations, a life event in respect of which his privacy could not be said to be compromised. The second is one of focus. The information should have the putative data subject as its focus rather than some other person with whom he may have been involved or some transaction or event in which he may have figured or have had an interest, for example, as in this case, an investigation into some other person's or body's conduct that he may have instigated. In short, it is information that affects his privacy, whether in his personal or family life, business or professional capacity. A recent example is that considered by the European Court in Criminal Proceedings against Lindquist, Case C-101/01 (6</span>

On the ordinary meaning of the expression, relating to him, Mr Durrant's letters of complaint to the FSA, and the FSA's investigation of that complaint, did not relate to Mr Durrant, but to his complaint. The 1998 Act would only be engaged if, in the course of investigating the complaint, the FSA expressed an opinion about Mr Durrant personally, as opposed to an opinion about his complaint; a contingency for which, nonetheless, the draftsman of the Act thought it necessary to make specific provision. And on the purposive construction of the expression, as investigated in paragraph 78 above, access to that material could not possibly be necessary for or even relevant to any protection by Mr. Durrant of his privacy. The excessive nature of his demands is perhaps best illustrated by the claim mentioned by my Lord in his paragraph 62, that Mr. Durrant should be told the identity of all those at the FSA who had handled his complaint. In the formal FSA complaints process in which Mr Durrant engaged before bringing the present proceedings (see paragraph 10 above) that information may or may not have been relevant, though there is no indication that Mr Durrant or those who may have been advising him then sought it. It has nothing whatsoever to do with Mr Durrant's privacy, and proceedings under the 1998 Act cannot be used now, or at all, to extract it.”</span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">The starting point of DK’s IT appeal was an assessment of costs hearing held on 27 January 2004 that was conducted by a district judge in Newcastle Combined Court (“the district judge”). The hearing had arisen out of a two-day hearing by a circuit district judge in 2003 who had, in a reserved judgment dated 11 June 2003, dismissed DK’s application for permission to appeal a previous order by a different district judge that had dismissed his application to reinstate the original action. The circuit district judge had stated in her reserved judgment that DK should pay the defendant’s costs of the permission application hearing. The order that the court subsequently drew up and issued did not contain a direction giving effect to the district judge’s decision relating to the payment of the defendant’s costs. At the subsequent costs assessment hearing which was heard by the district judge, DK alleged that that judge informed those present, being himself acting as litigant in person and two representatives of the defendant’s solicitors, that he could not assess the costs awarded in the defendant’s favour unless the circuit judge’s order was amended to add a direction that DK should pay the costs of the permission hearing and that he did not have the power to make the amendment himself although the circuit judge did have that power.  However, when the district judge, in conformity with the CPR and county court practice, subsequently drew up and arranged for the court to issue the order resulting from his hearing, the order included a direction that the defendant’s costs of the action should be paid by DK. The CPR permits a district judge to amend an order made by a circuit district judge if the amendment corrects an error in the order as it had been drawn up if the result of the amendment is that the order in its amended form reflects what the circuit judge had intended it should contain. The district judge’s action in correcting the order in this way was confirmed to have been correct by a different circuit judge when dismissing DK’s subsequent application for permission to appeal the district judge’s amendment order which DK had contended had been made by the district judge without jurisdiction. The circuit judge held that the amendment order had been made correctly and was within the jurisdiction of the district judge to make.</span>

He contended that these confirmed his recollection that the district judge had stated that he lacked the jurisdiction to amend the order. The solicitor representing the defendant informed him, when he asked that solicitor what his recollection was, that he also recollected that the district judge had stated that but he added that the district judge must have realised after the hearing that he did have the jurisdiction to amend the order. DK obtained a transcript of the hearing and then obtained an order permitting him to listen to the tape of the recording of the hearing. The transcript and what he heard when listening to the tape convinced him that the district judge had arranged for the tape to be tampered with so as to have the relevant passages of the district judge’s comments edited out of the tape. </span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">DK was convinced in his own mind that the district judge had deliberately interfered with, or caused the interference with, the tape. He began an obsessive campaign to expose what he considered to be the criminal behaviour of the district judge.  He considered that the district judge had lied at the hearing as to his intentions so as to curtail discussion about his powers, had subsequently unlawfully issued the correcting order that he had always intended to issue, had then arranged for the tape recording the proceedings to be tampered with so as to cover up his lies when he realised that DK had arranged for a transcript of the tape to be obtained which would show that he had lied during the hearing and finally lied to the police officer who interviewed him as part of NP’s investigations into DK’s complaint about what DK considered to have been his criminal conduct. DK considered that the district judge’s motivation to lie and then to issue the amendment order resulted from the district judge’s malicious and vindictive wish to harm and punish him as a result of the district judge’s animosity towards him arising from trying an unrelated case a few years previously in which DK was one of the litigants and, in the course of that trial, forming an extremely adverse view about him. He also considered that the district judge’s behaviour was a particularly glaring example of the systematic manipulation of his claim by the Newcastle and Gateshead courts on many occasions so as to deny him a fair hearing and to thwart his quest for justice. A further strand in his thinking was that he felt that he had been deprived of the windfall arising from the omission of provisions requiring him to pay the defendant’s costs in the order issued after the circuit judge’s permission hearing. DK considered that the district judge, by correcting that order, had led him having unnecessarily to pay the defendant’s costs of his unsuccessful reinstatement and permission applications which, as he informed the IT, totalled in excess of £90,000.   </span>

The district judge was interviewed during this investigation but was not asked to make a statement. It is not clear whether the interview notes made by the officer formed part of the compendious document dealt with by the IT as the district judge’s witness statement. DK challenged this finding and it was reviewed by the supervising Detective Inspector who, in September 2005, reached the same conclusion. DK then made what he described as “a strongly worded complaint to a senior officer at NP” and a third investigation followed. It was during this third investigation that the district judge was interviewed by the investigating officer as a witness and not under caution and a witness statement was taken from him dated 8 February 2006. </span>

The formal investigation included receiving a detailed statement from DK dated 25 June 2007, the service of a misconduct notice on the supervising investigating officer and his providing a written response under caution. The investigation was completed on 7 November 2007 and it concluded that there was no evidence of any police misconduct or of any failure of a performance duty so that all 14 complaints were unsubstantiated.

The renewed application is still to be determined, the five-year delay in the decision being taken has occurred because the court has ruled that DK should be permitted to adjourn it to await the conclusion of his attempts to obtain a copy of the district judge’s witness statement. </span>

NP refused the request under the FOIA and its’ refusal notice stated that this refusal was based on the information being exempt under sections 30(1) and 30(2) of the FOIA and that the exemption would not be disapplied because the public interest in withholding the information outweighed the public interest in disclosing it.

However [DK’s] letter on 24 November 2006 was treated as a new request and the public authority cited alternative exemptions, namely sections 30(1) and 32(1)(c).

In conformity with the IT and the FtT(GRC) procedure, the IT had before it at the hearing of the original appeal two folders of documents comprising the open folder of documents which all parties were entitled to see and refer to and a closed folder which only the IT and the representative of NP who held the documents and who was resisting their disclosure could see. The IT went into closed session and excluded DK in order to consider and hear submissions about these documents. Finally, the IT delivered a full open decision and also supplemented that with a closed decision, referred to by the IT as a confidential annex to the open decision, which was placed on the IT case file with a copy being sent to the NP. </span>

The confidential annex also explained that this personal data was not subject to the public interest exemption provided for in section 30(1) of the FOIA. DK would not have seen nor been provided with a copy of the closed decision nor would he have heard or been aware of the contents of the closed submissions and discussion. However, the UT judge would have been provided with the tribunal file containing the closed file and the confidential annex to the open decision and his decision refusing permission would have been based on what was set out in both the open judgment and the confidential annex I have not been provided with any of the closed material or of the confidential annex but I have not seen the need to refer to it or call for it from the Upper Tribunal since I consider that I can fairly decide DK’s application without seeing either of these sources.</span>

Since the IT, the UT and the Administrative Court have not been told why NP disclosed any of  the data under the FOIA and the DPA, it is not possible to ascertain why this disclosure was given even though NP’s refusal decision to withhold all the requested data had been upheld by the IC. DK contended at all three stages of the disclosure proceedings that none of the data was personal data and all of it should therefore be disclosed. Despite these changes of position, the IT considered and decided the appeal in the same way that the IT and NP had reached their respective decisions notwithstanding that its decision related to a small fraction of the data that the NP and the IC based their decisions on. </span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">DK lodged an appeal against the IC’s Decision Notice on 14 April 2008 seeking a substitution of the IC’s Decision Notice with a Decision Notice providing for the disclosure of all five witness statements. There followed a number of directions hearings and pre-hearing reviews by way of telephone conferences and three sets of directions were issued by the IT. A two-day hearing took place on 30 and 31 March at which DK represented himself and the IC, as the respondent, and NP, as an additional party, were separately represented by counsel. The  IT decision, promulgated on 14 April 2009,  was confined to the remaining disputes concerning the existence of certain documents and as to whether five statements taken during the third inquiry, including the district judge’s statement, should be disclosed. The IT decided that the three factual statements of the district judge and the two solicitors were DK’s personal data and were therefore absolutely exempt from disclosure (applying section 40(1)) whereas the two technical statements were not personal data and were in principle subject to exemption as forming part of the NP’s investigation into whether the district judge should be charged. However, this was a qualified exemption and should not be given effect to because the public interest in disclosure outweighed the public interest in maintaining the exemption (applying sections 30(1) and 2(2)((b)). The IT ordered their disclosure subject to certain redactions that were also ordered.</span>

That power is an adjunct to the power provided for in section 58(1)(b) that enables the IT to exercise any discretion exercised by the IC differently to the way that the IC exercised it if it considers it appropriate to do so. These powers provide the IT with significantly wider powers to decide cases involving a claim to inspect and be provided with copies of documents than are generally available to FtTs.

The IT could only have decided DK’s appeal under one or the other sections. Of course, the IT could have addressed the section 30 issue on a contingent alternative basis. That decision would have had to have been reached on the basis that: “if we are wrong in finding that the three factual witness statements are DK’s personal data, what would we then have decided by applying section 30?” Whatever the IT could have done, however, it is clear from its decision that it decided to confine itself to the section 40 issue.</span>

This would have required him to provide a summary of the evidence received by the IT that would be available to the UT that would support the conclusion that the exception was not displaced. This summary would, if necessary, have needed to have been provided in a confidential annex.  </span>

He also stated that the IT had referred to section 30 but only in connection with the two technical witness statements and had never assessed the three factual witness statements under section 30. He concluded by contending that the IT’s decision on the public interest test was confined to the two technical witness statements and was in his favour but that that decision was irrelevant in relation to the question of whether the decision regarding the undisclosed material was lawful.

DK resubmitted the same request and NP, without explanation, decided that the request should be dealt with under the FOIA but that it should not be disclosed because the section 30 exemption applied and that exemption should not be disapplied. The IC subsequently decided not to hear DK’s appeal under section 30 because the three witness statements constituted DK’s personal data and that, in consequence, DK’s request should be dealt with under the DPA. DK had also made a third request under the DPA. NP accepted the IC’s jurisdictional decision and answered the DPA data subject request by disclosing some of the requested documents in a redacted form. NP subsequently disclosed most of the remaining documents it had withheld under all three requests. The IT was therefore left, in an appeal from the IC’s decision, with being left to consider whether the five witness statements should be disclosed and decided that three were DK’s personal data and two were not, that all five were also the personal data of a third party and that the three factual witness statements should not be disclosed but the two technical statements should be disclosed in a redacted form.

The other two statements were provided by two representatives of the solicitors who acted for the defendant Canon (UK) Ltd at the hearing before the district judge and two technical reports concerned with forensic examinations of the tape that DK contended had been criminally interfered with. DK’s notice of appeal to the IT had also put further documents in issue but NP had disclosed all of them by the time of the IT hearing. The IT dismissed DK’s appeal in relation to the three factual witnesses’ statements and allowed it in relation to the two technical reports, albeit with some redactions first having been made to those reports. The IT dismissed the appeal on the basis that the absolute exemption from production provided for by section 40(1) was applicable to the three statements. This was also the first of the two bases for NP’s decision to refuse DK’s disclosure request and the basis relied on by the IC in dismissing his appeal from that refusal decision. Having decided the appeal on that ground, the IT did not consider DK’s second ground of appeal, namely whether the qualified exemption provided for by section 30(1) should be disapplied.</span>

The IT also considered all the requested documents relating to NP investigation of DK’s complaint of the district judge’s alleged criminal conduct including those that NP was at that time still resisting providing to DK. These documents were placed in two separate bundles, the first being the  open bundle of documents that had been disclosed by the NP prior to the hearing and the second being the closed bundle containing the documents that NP was still resisting disclosing to DK.

Given the nature of DK’s challenge to the IT’s decision, DK should have supplied the open bundle and such disclosed documents as were not in that bundle to the Administrative Court. It was also open to DK to apply to the Administrative Court to direct that it should be provided with all the open and closed documents held by the IT but he did not make any such application although it is clear that he was aware that he could make such an application. These apparent omissions are not as serious as it might appear because DK has supplied what amounts to a gist of the three relevant witness statements to the Administrative Court in connection with other applications in the three other judicial reviews and all outstanding applications in these claims are now being heard together. I have therefore been able to use material filed in these other claims when considering this Cart application and the related disclosure application that is also being considered by me.</span>

The second statement appears to have been a short formal statement which was signed or acknowledged by the district judge during or after being interviewed by a different investigating officer in the third investigation. The district judge is reported in the investigation report to have denied any wrong doing. The judge is also recorded as having made notes during or in advance of the interview and the interview was conducted by reference to the transcript of the hearing that had been typed out and was available to the district judge and the investigating officer whilst the interview proceeded. The investigating officer appears to have taken a detailed written note of the entire interview. The interviewing process and a summary of, or evidence of the contents of, what the district judge said and provided by way of a draft or final statement were described and provided in the respective case summaries prepared by the investigating officer. </span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">It is now known that the district judge’s principal statement and the notes taken by the investigating officer of what the district judge said during his interview explain how DK had made a fundamental error in formulating his complaint against the district judge. DK had contended consistently that the district judge had informed him during the critical hearing that the circuit judge’s order needed to be “effected” if any costs order was to be made against him which he took to mean that the order could only take effect if it was manipulated so that the district judge, in himself altering, or “effecting” the order must have done so with malicious intent since he had indicated that only a circuit judge could take this step. However, as the district judge apparently made clear in his statement, he would have stated that the order could only take effect when it was “perfected” and that the transcript recording him using the word “effected” was clearly in error. It is also known that the district judge expressed outrage at DK’s reporting him to the police on the basis that he had committed a criminal offence in arranging for the tape to be doctored so as to omit his assurance that he would not “effect” the order but he would not take defamation proceedings against DK. Furthermore, DK’s evidence in the judicial review proceedings was to the effect that he had reported the district judge because he wanted him to be interviewed under caution, charged, tried, convicted and punished and that he was aware that such a course of action would destroy the district judge’s judicial career and would probably lead to a custodial sentence. DK in his skeleton argument adds that he wishes to use the statements once they are disclosed to prove that the police have conspired with the court to prevent the exposure of a criminal act of a member of the judiciary and/or of court officials in altering evidential matter held by the court. </span>

The passage does not cover any aspect of one of the three potential ingredients of personal data identified in the WPO, namely data with a “result” element which is a significant ingredient of the information contained in the statements I am concerned with. Furthermore, the reasoning of Auld LJ is expressed in somewhat opaque language which is not easy to apply even to information containing a “content” or “purpose” element. The WPO and the TGN appear to provide a reasonable clear and sustainable explanation of the meaning of the phrase. This explains why the Directive, the WPO, the TGN and the </span>

DK then wrote to the Senior Civil Judge in the same court on 9 September 2005 informing that judge of the contents of his exchange with the district judge and repeating his request for the district judge’s comments. The letter informed the Senior Civil Judge that unless he got an answer, he would have no alternative than to raise a formal judicial complaint against the district judge. The Senior Civil Judge replied on 14 September 2005 who replied that he saw no evidence to suggest that the district judge had failed to cooperate with the police enquiries and declined to respond further to DK’s letter. These exchanges show that the district judge, if asked directly to agree explicitly to the disclosure of his statement would either not respond at all or would respond curtly that he was not prepared to give his explicit consent.   </span>

At that hearing, DK sought an adjournment to enable the renewed permission applications to be heard after, and in the light of, his attempts to obtain a copy of the district judge’s statement dated 6 February 2006 and other documents through his FOIA request to NP. This was the same statement that he had sought in his FOIA request that I have dealt with in this judgment. I granted an adjournment on those and other grounds and gave directions for the resumed hearing which was fixed for 6 October 2010. This was again adjourned because DK had not yet obtained documents he said that he needed for the hearing, prepared the necessary hearing bundle or served an application seeking an order for the disclosure of the district judge’s statement. DK then issued the first application for disclosure in claims CO/3391/2008 and CO/11166/2008 on 11 November 2010 seeking an order for the disclosure of that statement. </span>

However, the application was not finally determined by that order. An interim or procedural order is never final and may be reviewed or set aside by a later procedural order, particularly as here when there are changed circumstances. Moreover, in judicial review proceedings, it is clear that an order refusing disclosure prior to the grant of permission by way of a paper refusal may be the subject of a fresh application made at an oral hearing or subsequent consideration of the leave application. Finally, this application is being made in changed circumstances in that it is now allied, as it had not previously been, with applications under the SCA and the DPA. These applications may be made even if the procedural decision under CPR 54.16 stands. It would be unjust, therefore, not to permit the CPR 54.16 application to be reargued given those changed circumstances.  </span>

NP supplied all of the documents that were the subject of the subject access request save for the three statements I am concerned with and, meanwhile, the IC and the IT on appeal affirmed NP’s failure to supply them under the FOIA on the grounds that any request should be dealt with under the DPA. DK’s challenge to that approach has only finally been dismissed by the Cart decision in this judgment. It follows that DK is left with his unresolved attempts to obtain copies of these statements and that section 7(9) of the DPA provides a statutory means of seeking to overturn NP’s DPA refusal to supply them. This route is clearly open to DK in this court since his application to this court is wide enough in its terms to encompass a section 7(9) application which may be made to the High Court and which it is highly convenient for me to decide as an adjunct to the FOIA application that I have just decide with which it is closely connected.  </span>

The district judge has through the court manager and the senior civil circuit judge made it clear that he does not consent to his statement being supplied to DK and, in any event, would only have provided the statement to the police on receiving an assurance that the statement would only be used in court if it was necessary to refer to it there. Given DK’s adamant wish to have the district judge prosecuted and his blind refusal to accept that the other evidence he has seen leads to the inexorable conclusion that the tape was not tampered with and no crime has been committed by anyone in relation to such tampering, it would be wholly unreasonable for NP to disclose its contents to DK. </span>

The gist of DK’s complaint in the judicial review was that the shoddy manner in which his original complaint to NP was investigated led to a decision that no criminal conduct had occurred and no charges or prosecutions would result. This complaint is fleshed out by reference to 14 specific conduct complaints against the investigating officer. All these complaints were dismissed. DK appealed against that dismissal and the IPCC dismissed that appeal. In doing so, it is contended that the IPCC, who had been supplied by NP with its investigation file that contained copies of the statements in issue, dismissed the appeal in a </span>

Rule 14(6) GRC Rules empowers the tribunal to give a direction that certain documents or information be disclosed to the tribunal but not to the other parties to the appeal. The Information Commissioner and the public authority are normally under a duty to disclose to the tribunal all the material they hold which is relevant to the appeal. Should they wish any of that material to be withheld from the requester then one of them must apply to the district judge for a direction to that effect. </span>

It should include a draft of the requested direction and enclose a copy of material which the applicant seeks to withhold. The reasons for withholding the information must be given. In respect of the disputed information it will be sufficient to say that the tribunal needs to see it in order to evaluate the evidence properly. In the case of other material, greater explanation may be required. On receipt of the application, tribunal staff will, unless there is good reason not to do so, tell all the other parties that it has been made; but they will send a copy of the application only to the district judge. </span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">7. When considering the application, the district judge will first ask whether it is possible for a hearing to take place within the normal rules of disclosure. If yes, (s)he will give directions accordingly. If not, the district judge will make a direction under Rule 14(6) stating the information which is to be withheld. It is common to refer to the withheld information as “closed material”. </span>

That said, it may be possible, by providing an index to the documents, for example, to give an idea of what material has been withheld. The public authority and the Information Commissioner will be expected to assist the Tribunal in this respect. </span>

For example, it may be possible to edit a document so that at least some of it is disclosed even though some has to be withheld. If the district judge’s provisional view is that some but not all of the material should be withheld, tribunal staff will write to the requesting party with a new proposed draft. This is to give the applicant for the direction a chance to add further comments and to ensure that the later draft is clear and correct. </span>
