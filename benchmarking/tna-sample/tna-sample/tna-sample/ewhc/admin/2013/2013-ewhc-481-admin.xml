	      <span style="font-size:11.5pt">These five claims, which were heard together, concern High Speed Two, HS2.  This is the proposed new high speed rail network connecting London to Birmingham, and then on to Leeds and Manchester, in a second phase.  This would create what for obvious reasons is known as the Y Network.  It might later extend to Glasgow and Edinburgh.  It would terminate in London at Euston Station.  The first phase also includes, in addition to the Birmingham terminus, the junction north of Lichfield which is the fork of the Y network.  HS1 is the existing Channel Tunnel Rail link from St Pancras.  The first phase of HS2 would include a direct link through to HS1. The first phase of HS2 would also be  designed to permit the addition in Phase 2 of spurs to Heathrow, but its proposed alignment would not provide a line through Heathrow for all trains, and it could not be realigned in the future. </span>

	      <span style="font-size:11.5pt">By way of brief introduction, the Government set up a National Network Strategy Group in November 2008, and in January 2009, the Secretary of State for Transport, SST, incorporated HS2 Ltd and commissioned it to develop proposals for a new high speed railway between London and the West Midlands and potentially beyond.  HS2 Ltd (HS2L) is the vehicle used by SSTs to advise them on and eventually to promote HS2.  It reported to Government in December 2009.  The SST announced to Parliament in December 2009 that a White Paper would be published “setting out plans” which would include “route proposals, timescales and associated financial, economic and environmental assessments”.  This would be followed by “full public consultation”. </span>

	      <span style="font-size:11.5pt">The Command Paper “High Speed Rail” was published in March 2010, along with other reports.  It set out the Government’s “proposed strategy” for “the development of a core high speed rail network linking London to Manchester and Leeds via Birmingham” with northward high speed connections “from the outset”. Wide consultation, a national debate, with a view to legislation was to  follow. </span>

	      <span style="font-size:11.5pt">The Coalition Government affirmed its commitment to a high speed rail network in May 2010; but it was to be achieved in phases because of financial constraints.  During 2010 various route options were considered; the Government’s preference for the Y network was announced in October 2010.  In December 2010, the SST published the final preferred route for the London to Birmingham sections, and announced that full public consultation on the high speed rail strategy, and on the London to Birmingham route would start in February 2011. </span>

The Summary of Decisions announced that there was “a compelling case for delivering a step-change in the capacity and performance of Britain’s inter-city rail network”, the high speed Y network was the best means of achieving that, and a phased approach with a hybrid Bill for each phase was necessary.  There should be a direct link to the HS1 line to connect with the Channel Tunnel in Phase 1, and a direct spur to Heathrow Airport in Phase 2.  The route corridor for the London to Birmingham section proposed in the Consultation Document of February 2011 was the best option but certain alterations to the route itself should be made.  A package of measures was set out in another document, the “Review of Property Impacts”, to assist those affected by blight, but not covered by current statutory provisions; it did not include a bond-based property purchase scheme. </span>

It covered a Water Code which would set the framework for the use of nitrogen fertilisers and the storage of manure to protect waters from pollution from run-off from agricultural land.  It set a framework because it would be difficult for the authority to refuse an application for the relevant consent which complied with the criteria in the Code.  It was not any less a framework because its application permitted of some discretion.

The scheme was said to be invalid because the SEAD  applied and had not been complied with.  A regional transport strategy, MTS, had been published in 2003 by a non-statutory partnership, NESTRANS.  It described various road schemes, one of which, the WPR, a bypass for Aberdeen, was taken up and promoted by the Minister.  The Minister proposed to alter part of it, along with providing a new section of road, the Fastlink.  The question was whether this modification to the WPR was a modification to a plan or programme within the SEAD. This in turn depended on whether the MTS was a “plan or programme” “required by legislative, regulatory or administrative provision”.  The Court concluded that Fastlink was not within the Directive because it did not itself alter the framework for the future development consent of projects; rather it altered a specific project which continued to require development consent. </span>

However, it seems that some level  of formality is needed: the administrative provisions must be such as to identify both the competent authorities and the procedure for preparation and adoption.

It held that it was not a plan  or programme since it did not provide a framework.  However, the exclusion of “policy” from the scope of the Directive did not mean that anything that went by that name inevitably fell outside the Directive, since the issue was one of substance and not of nomenclature.  The Court also concluded that a particular policy in the PPS which dealt with a large existing shopping centre did not constitute a plan or programme within the Directive, since listing the considerations material to a development consent did not create a framework for development. </span>

A plan might set out how it was proposed to  carry out a policy, instancing land use plans; a programme might be a plan covering a set of projects.

If it is a plan within  the Directive, it is easier to see that the necessary purposive construction or application of “required by administrative provision”, would place that part also within the scope of the Directive.  Otherwise the sort of plan at which the Directive is aimed would be the more likely to escape assessment in circumstances to which the objectives of the Directive apply. It is also easier to construe or apply the whole of the second limb of Article 2 (a) as one phrase to one process, rather than splitting it up. It is easier to recognise the species when it is in sight than to define it in two stages. As I will come to, I have concluded that the DNS is not a “plan or programme” within the scope of the Directive.

Mr Elvin submitted that it was a “formal statement of government policy which goes beyond aspirations and sets out an intended course of future action for the promotion, construction and operation of HS2 which includes its future development consent process….”  It was the overall strategy for the Y network, to the whole of which the SST committed himself in Parliament on 10 January 2012 and, to achieve which, there might be some provision in the first phase hybrid Bill. The SST had described HS2, in the October 2009 Scoping Report for the Appraisal of Sustainability, as falling between transport policy and a development project, which Mr Elvin submitted fitted the scope of the SEAD admirably. </span>

Mr Elvin submitted that the sifting process, whereby the number of options had successively been reduced as detail increased, culminating in the finalisation of options, should be subject  to SEA, in order to meet the objective of SEAD. Once a policy began to pre-empt decisions on individual projects, it should be viewed as a plan or programme. In addition to setting both the National Strategy for high speed rail and its shape as a Y network, Phase 1 would also fix the location of the junctions for the lines to Leeds and Manchester.  The precise locations of these junctions were published in March 2012, and would have an effect on at least the initial routeing of those two lines.  </span>

The purpose of SEA is to ensure that the decision on development consent is not affected by earlier plans which through the framework, the rules or criteria or policies they contain, weigh one way or another against the application when the earlier plans have not themselves been assessed for likely significant environmental effects. The significant environmental effects have to be assessed at a time when they can play their full part in the decision; they cannot be left unassessed so that the development decision is made when the framework in the plan has sold the pass. A plan framework tilts the balance, creates presumptions, and urges weight to be given to various factors.

A decision that the Government will favour applications being made to it for high speed rail developments in sections to create a network shaped as a Y and starting at Euston would be a framework for the grant of development consents, and would be a plan for SEAD purposes. The weighting of the arguments in its favour would be clear; the way in which Government would approach the application of its own policy would be clear. The same would apply to a National Policy Statement on a nationally significant infrastructure project. In that sort of decision-making structure, the decision- maker is not entirely free to go which ever way it sees fit, but is constrained by the policy or framework to set the decision in the context of the plan, even if entitled ultimately to reject the proposal. A plan is not the less a plan because an application for development consent, though compliant with it, might be rejected if out weighed by other factors. </span>

Its decisions are legally and formally untrammelled by the statements of Government policy. It is entirely free to accept or reject them as it sees fit. If it agrees with the view expressed by Government, then it will of course give effect to that view; and if it disagrees with those views, it will decide otherwise. The fact that Parliament will consider the detailed work done by  Government, and will no doubt give consideration to the views it has expressed, is very different from Parliament having to set its decision within the framework of criteria or policies which Government pronounces.  Parliament’s views are not trammelled by those pronouncements; no proper justification for disagreeing is required of it: it can just disagree.  The policy and judgments in the DNS, which could be a framework for the decision-maker in some contexts, are not such a framework here. </span>

That confuses the basis upon which the promoter of the project made his decision as to which project to promote, how and why, with the framework or policy structure within which the separate decision-maker will make its decision.   The fact that the DNS is a statement of a national core strategy does not answer the question of its role in the decision-making process, which is the crucial aspect for the purposive approach to the Directive.

The SST was not prevented by the terms of the SEAD from applying it where it was not necessary in EU law - or under the domestic Regulations. But the passages in the documents relied on by the Claimants show no such undertaking; quite the reverse in my view.  A statement that the Appraisal of Sustainability would “broadly reflect the principles” of the SEAD contradicts the proposition for which it was cited. There is nothing in what was said which committed the SST to apply the SEAD, if it were not applicable. Indeed, the AoS itself said that although the SEAD was “key to determining the overall appraisal framework”, the scheme “would not qualify as either a plan or programme under the terms of the Directive….” This same point was repeated in the DNS and in the Review of the AoS published with the DNS. The DNS and the Review of the AoS show that the principles of the SEAD were applied to the degree thought  necessary for this stage in the project; see for example para 6.24 of the DNS. The AoS was intended to be fully compliant with the principles of the SEAD; para 3.1.5 of the Review.  Those passages do not show any voluntary assumption of a duty of compliance.  There is a different albeit related argument, to which I shall come, that the AoS was substantially compliant with the SEAD, although the SST disavowed any duty to comply with it.  </span>

Laws LJ pointed out that the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive and Regulations were replete with expressions requiring such judgments: what was a cumulative or a significant effect? What was sufficient information about those effects?  He also concluded, to the extent necessary, that the question of whether a project was a stand-alone scheme or part of a larger project which should have been included in the EIA was for the factual or other judgment of the decision-maker subject to review by the Court, rather than one for the Court itself to decide. By application of the same reasoning, the question of what alternatives were reasonable to consider was a reviewable decision for the decision-maker, and not one for the Court to decide for itself.  This line had been routinely applied in earlier authorities which had grappled with whether an environmental statement under EIAD was adequate. </span>

The relevant carbon emissions of rail, road and air were assessed. New motorways were environmentally disadvantageous compared to new rail lines, though new alignments were likely to be more disadvantageous than improvements to existing infrastructure.

The decision that there should be a new high speed rail network is not a plan within the SEAD but is a statement of high level policy which falls outside it. The only plan which can realistically be  assumed to fall within the scope of the SEA starts with the decision that there should be a new high speed rail network, albeit not necessarily at the same design speed as proposed.  </span>

Alternative objectives do not have to be explained nor, for these purposes, the reasons why the objectives are thought worth achieving. It is alternative ways of meeting the objectives which are the focus of the SEA. The Government concluded that alternative strategies for motorways or a new conventional or enhanced existing rail network were not capable of meeting the plan objectives set for high speed rail. It is obviously a contestable view as to whether those objectives should be met, or can be met to a large extent by means other than a new high speed rail network.  These alternative strategies could not, however, have constituted reasonable alternatives to the plan for assessment in the SEA, since they are incapable by their very nature of meeting all the objectives for a new high speed rail network.

They have not been explicitly rejected as being less than reasonable alternatives. The same applies to the adoption of a lower design speed. They may or may not have been considered as reasonable alternatives to be assessed if the promoters’ minds had been applied to the SEAD; they might have been rejected on the basis that they did not get past the economic case; and there was no obligation either to assess all reasonable alternatives. What is required in the SEA are the reasons for the selection of the reasonable alternatives chosen for assessment.  Neither the AoS nor Consultation Document contains any statement about alternatives to the Y network, since the Y network falls outside their scope.

And if so, why? And if not, why was that particular alternative selected? But the  explanation in paragraphs 61-63 of Annex B to the Consultation Document seems to me to do the minimum necessary in that respect.  They were regarded as having the same important effects on the route impacts. What was not considered was a comparison between the AoS version of the preferred route with the detail of the Phase 2 spurs, and any of the Iver options, since that detail was not available.  If the DNS does set a framework, the framework set appears to include the absence of a through route to Heathrow, and the provision of spurs at Phase 2. The later provision of spurs has not been assessed though becoming part of the framework, and the consideration of reasonable alternatives has not been carried out on properly comparable basis. Were I of the view that the DNS was in this respect a plan within the SEAD, setting a framework or guiding policy preferences for Parliament’s decision, I would have concluded that this was substantial noncompliance. The absence of information on the spurs is entirely the Government’s choice, and that is not an adequate basis for the absence of assessment.  </span>

It is in my view premature to reach a view on whether the anticipated exclusion of the Phase 2 spurs from assessment at the Phase 1 stage would involve a breach of the EIAD. Phase 1 would mean any direct HS2 connection to Heathrow had to be by spurs. Of course, as the DNS is not an SEAD plan, HHL is not trammelled in raising the issue again in the context of the consideration of reasonable alternatives in the EIA; they may or may not be successful in getting it considered with the benefit of further argument about the impact of the spurs. HS2L/DfT could decide that the impacts on non-airport passengers and the benefits to airport passengers have been sufficiently considered and evaluated for analysis of comparative environmental impacts, on what is already known, to be so unlikely to make a difference that HHL’s hub is not a reasonable alternative to the refined route and spurs at EIA stage.

Four principal route alignments were considered in sections, as well as six route options in and around Birmingham, and other variants and connectors. The route proposed for Phase 1 does not cross any European sites, and the screening assessment examined all such sites within 10 kms of the proposed route, as a precaution. Only in respect of the South-West London Water-bodies SPA, (Special Protection Area), and Ramsar Site was so much as a possible indirect effect identified.  </span>

	      <span style="font-size:11.5pt">Mr Elvin pointed out, however, that the concept of “plan” in the HD did not have to set the framework for development consent nor be required by legislative, regulatory or administrative provision. The prospect of an assessment under the HD at the stage of presentation of the hybrid Bill could not satisfy the HD. It might be that a plan would become a project requiring an assessment later under the HD, but that could not avoid an assessment while it was still a plan since the HD applied to both. The HD required two tiers of protection and to reduce it to a single one would reduce the ability of the competent authority to secure the necessary high degree of protection for European sites.  </span>

The SST had known, as a result of the December 2009 HS2L report, “High Speed Rail: London to the West Midlands and Beyond”, para 6.1.34, that “many more nationally designated sites affect potential routes beyond Birmingham” than between London and the West Midlands. These comments, however, covered the routes to Scotland, not just to   Leeds and Manchester, and were not confined to the Y network for that section either. Mr Elvin submitted that the decision to have a Phase 2 and that the Y network should be chosen over the reverse S or E or inverted A were made without regard to the potential impacts on any European sites which might be affected. The need to avoid significant impacts to such sites could rule out whole corridors or force changes which inhibited the objectives of high speed rail or increased its costs. </span>

Mr Elvin submitted that the SST had failed to consider the cumulative or in-combination effects of Phases 1 and 2 together, whether or not seen as part of the one project. The River Mease SAC north of Birmingham, for example, had not been considered, nor therefore the potential effect on the UK’s network of European sites. Consideration at the stage of Phase 2 would be too late, since the DNS fixed the principle of Phase 2, and would hinder or prevent consideration of whether there was any satisfactory alternative to Phase 2, should derogation from certain protections in the HD become necessary.  </span>

The way in which the outcome of  the screening process has been considered reinforces my view that the DNS does not need to be treated as a plan for the purposes of the HD to be satisfied.  The possibility of a significant effect which could require an appropriate assessment was identified.  If no more work had been done, an appropriate assessment would have been required at a later stage.  The later survey work, albeit not part of the screening process itself, shows that an appropriate assessment will not be required, at least not for that effect.  If objectors say that one is nonetheless required at a later stage that is a case that they will then have to make out.  A decision on whether an appropriate assessment is required will still be called for.  A negative decision would be open to challenge – albeit without much prospects on the present information because of the apparent reasonableness of the conclusion reached about the SWLW SPA.  </span>

It would be a breach of the HD at the project stage.  Likewise, if the London to Lichfield line and junction locations determined the line of the Y in such a way that the northern legs could affect a European site, an appropriate assessment of that may be called for at Phase 1. The same could apply in relation to the Heathrow spurs. Nothing done or omitted thus far enables any such deficiency to escape future scrutiny. If the issue has not been covered in the screening process, that would not obviate the need for an appropriate assessment if the application of the HD required it. I also accept Mr Mould’s submission about the need for, and absence at the moment of, credible evidence of a risk which should have been considered in relation to cumulative impact, at least at the present.  </span>

This is not a question of cumulative impacts but of alternatives. It could arise in the context of an adverse effect on the integrity of a site and the existence of alternative solutions. But the premise for that has not yet been shown to exist.

I regard it as obvious that the Natural England letters show that the test in the Dutch cockle-pickers case has been satisfied in relation to the SWLW SPA. Quashing the decision on that ground would produce no different a result on the absence of likely significant effects, even if the public have not been consulted on the letters.  Second, even if the other criticisms were right as to what the assessment should contain, all can be done as required before the Phase 1 project consent is granted, without any prejudice to the objectives of the HD or to the Claimants.  It could well be done on a more informed basis since the route for Phase 2 and more environmental material on it would be available. There is simply no advantage in holding up the process on this ground at this stage to any body.  With or without Bechstein’s bats, the breaches of the HD which this supposes, are so readily remediable at a stage which the HD itself envisages will occur, that judicial discretion should not lead to a quashing of this decision. </span>

But the definition of the “project” was not to be the means of circumventing the objectives of the EIAD.  The important question was whether the EIA of the specific project for which development consent was sought should take account of the larger project of which it formed part.  The purpose of the Directive meant that, with a project like a road, account had to be taken in the EIA of that specific link, of the significance of the planned links yet to be the subject of an application for development consent. He felt no need in that case to be more specific. </span>

But that is really only one way in which the Claimants put this point. The important issue is whether producing two EIAs for  two phases of the Y network rather than one EIA for  the whole network will mean that cumulative impacts of the whole fall out of assessment altogether or are considered only when it is too late for them to be given weight in the decision.  </span>

The second related ground was that the DNS decision rejecting the OA was based on a criterion or significant factor not raised in the Consultation Document, or in the others issued with it, as one of any significance: the importance of increasing commuting capacity into London.  </span>

This evaluated a number of different packages of upgrades to existing routes as possible alternatives to HS2. Mr Stokes regarded one of these, RP2, which involved enhancements to the West Coast Main Line, WCML, as the most promising alternative to HS2.  As Mr Graham said, RP2 had been known about and available for consideration since March 2010.  The OA was developed by Mr Stokes based on RP2, but although the Atkins  work provided useful information and validated certain assumptions, he did not regard their work as having optimised these alternatives, in particular by  lengthening trains and changing the balance between standard and first class accommodation to increase capacity.  </span>

One Appendix dealt largely with the OA. It was based on incremental changes: lengthening most of the WCML trains to 12 coaches, reconfiguration of one coach to standard class, and infrastructure improvements at particular locations. The benefits claimed for this included a capacity increase on standard class by 215%, well above the background growth forecast for the WCML, which could be put in place more quickly, flexibly and cheaply than HS2, while benefiting a large number of towns on the route. A service pattern for the north-bound evening peak was proposed, with an “illustrative” but “robust” timetable for long distance and commuter services. </span>

The summary identifies the key points against the OA: insufficient capacity to meet  forecast suburban commuter services at the southern end of the WCML, likelihood of remodelling at Euston Station, long periods of disruption while the infrastructure additions were constructed, high utilisation of lines impeding route performance, and the increase in long distance high speed connectivity on some flows at the expense of other intermediate flows which would worsen severely, leaving some stations without a service in some cases.

I do not accept Ms Lieven’s assertion in her written reply that Atkins relied on long distance traffic with no mention of commuter capacity, with the implication that it deals only with long distance traffic, and that commuter traffic was therefore irrelevant to the SST’s consideration.  Atkins used a long distance model but its conclusions referred to crowding on the approach to London, which would only arise from stops approaching London which permit longer distance commuting, and also referred to increases in local as well as in strategic demand. I accept that most of the “Economic Case” is directed to the benefits to long distance traffic from HS2, but the effect of released capacity is considered and is part of the Wider Economic Impact.  </span>

	      <span style="font-size:11.5pt">Mr Graham described commuter capacity as “an important factor” in the consultation process. From an early stage and in the 2010 Command Paper, it was said that the capacity released on existing lines by the provision of a new network would be used to expand commuter, regional and freight services.  The Foreword to the Consultation Document said that released capacity on existing lines would be used for additional commuter and regional services. The Document noted that commuter traffic was important and growing, especially over longer distances into London from Milton Keynes, Rugby, Northampton, Kettering, and Peterborough, for example. Significant enhancements for commuters had been adopted to improve the capacity of the existing network for all users, but these were unlikely to be adequate in the long term; Chapter 1 “The Fast Track to Prosperity”.  That chapter also specifically refers to growth not only in the long-distance market but also in the franchised operators’ services in London and the South East, and regionally. The growth in long distance travel was also increasingly underpinned by “significant increases in usage of these services by commuters from towns such as [those listed above]”.  </span>

	      <span style="font-size:11.5pt">Ms Lieven contended that each of these criticisms is capable of a full answer by 51M, if it had been given notice of the criticisms.  For example, in respect of the commuter services, the service pattern set out in the 51M consultation response was only intended to be illustrative and did not represent the maximum service which would be provided on the slow lines in commuter peak.  The level of disruption assumed by Network Rail in its report, and therefore by the Secretary of State, was both seriously exaggerated, and wholly failed to take into account the massive disruption at Euston from the HS2 works. The simple answer to commuter capacity would be to lengthen more trains and maximise the number of trains on the slow lines.  Mr Stokes had not dealt with this because he had focused on fast lines. This misunderstanding could easily have been overcome had the SST provided him with an opportunity for the answer to be given.   </span>

The SST in reality had judged incremental upgrades overall to be less effective in delivering the long term capacity and wider benefits sought.  51M were professionally advised by experienced railway consultants.  They must have expected the SST to look critically at the overall ability of the OA to achieve these objectives, if necessary with the assistance of experts such as Atkins, and Network Rail as the network operator.  Seeking such advice is consistent with the very purpose of consultation. The ability of an upgraded existing network to deliver those objectives could hardly be judged effectively without attention to its overall impacts, including on commuter and other services that would continue to share the lines.  Conversely, the improvements in such services which might be made possible through released capacity resulting from new high speed lines were identified as one of the potential benefits of HS2. </span>

It is plain that the need for commuter capacity, and the advantage which HS2 would provide in releasing capacity on the existing network for an increase in commuter and freight trains was sufficiently clearly raised. I do not think that it can properly be characterised as an unheralded new point, let alone one Government had promised would not be part of the decision.

	      <span style="font-size:11.5pt">Of course the principal case for HS2 was not that it would release capacity on the existing network, although that was an advantage of increasing rail capacity in that way. The principal case related to time savings, “connectivity” and other wider economic benefits. But among the benefits was the opportunity to use the released capacity on the existing network for slower trains which stopped more often: commuters and freight. Indeed, whatever may be the overall merits of HS2 that is one which is obvious enough. However, when an alternative enhancement case is considered, as with the OA, the fact that that release of capacity will not take place may legitimately have greater significance for the decision-maker in considering and rejecting the OA. The OA is obviously not a high speed rail network, and the absence  of released capacity in that way would obviously require addressing by OA proponents.  The important advantages for a proposal may not be the same as the important disadvantages of alternatives, and they may import a different perspective.  </span>

It was not referred to at all, one way or the other so far as I can see, in the OA Appendix to the 51M consultation response which focused instead on the disruption to Euston which HS2 would cause. Mr Stokes disagrees with the SST’s judgment that OA disruption at Euston would extend significantly outside the existing station envelope, albeit that it would be less than for HS2.

Taken in the context of the way in which the OA response was dealt with as a whole, I do not regard this as making the consultation so unfair as to be unlawful in the absence of a further round of consultation. In effect, even had I done so, I would have refused relief as a matter of discretion:  the litigation has produced that further round, and the outcome remains indecisive.

This was not a consultation which would lead to the concrete decision being made, which when acted on would be the effective decision implementing a concrete proposal, with all the advantages and disadvantages claimed and feared.  That is often the case with consultations, but not here. The decision being consulted on was whether to proceed to the next stage in the decision making process and if so with what proposal.  It was a consultation by the promoter of a project as to which project if any he should decide to promote.  The concrete decision, as to whether to grant development consent, has yet to be made. The  making of that decision, the Parliamentary process, will afford a variety of opportunities for the public to pursue the OA, even if by lobbying MPs, and indirectly through what MPs say in debate.

The forecasting had to look at what caused the significant changes in demand, and forecast how those relationships might change in the future. Long term data series had to be used, and the risk with short term data, say from 2008, was that short term issues would have distorted it, including for example short term slower economic growth.  </p>

The consultation responses on the route in local areas had led to the route being examined again, and subject to the alterations identified, it was the best route.

There would be a reduced impact on communities and on the landscape of the Chilterns AONB.

What is required for fairness depends on the subject matter of the consultation and the effect of the decision reached after it. The part of the consultation relevant here was about the proposed route; it was obvious that alternatives for certain sections would be proposed. The consultation would have had no point if the promoter were to set its face against making changes to the route in the light of what the responses revealed. So it was well within the contemplation of consultees as well as those who did not respond that there could be changes to the route.  It cannot have been supposed that such changes would all be beneficial for everyone; far more likely is that such changes would be at the expense of greater impacts  than before for others but in a way which was nonetheless judged overall to be worth accepting. </p>

If the upshot of the DNS was that HS2 would be built on the now proposed route, without further procedures, there would be real force in Mr Elvin’s submission. Where as here, the upshot of the decision in the DNS is that, subject to further work, the route in the hybrid Bill will be that which has emerged from the consultation process, I see no case for a further round of consultation at all. All that has been decided is the detail of the project which the promoter intends to place before another body for its decision: ie the detail to be in the hybrid Bill to be enacted or not by Parliament. I can see a considerable deterrent to accepting changes in a consultation process in a case such as this, if it is going to require a further round of consultation before a decision can be reached on the details of the project to be promoted. </p>

The modifications to the consultation route which are planned or programmed in the DNS, cannot be modifications to the plan: they are the plan on Mr Elvin’s case. The suggestion, if I understood it right, was that  the reasonable  alternatives to the changes ought to have been dealt with as part of an SEA leading up to the DNS. That rather reinforces my view that the DNS is not a plan within the SEAD.  That sort of detail can readily be dealt with in an EIA to the  extent necessary.  Nor does it seem to me that Mr Elvin can confine the argument to the changes which emerged from the consultation process: they must cover reasonable alternatives to all sections of the route, at quite a detailed level. That is what an EIA should cover to the extent necessary.  </p>

It identified what it termed “priority equality groups” and “the potential for significant adverse impacts” on them. Ethnic minorities were one such priority group, and those living in the top 20% most deprived wards were another. Both areas fitted that latter priority group as well. Appendix 4 described the background to an Equality Impact Assessment, EqIA, the methodology of the process, and the role of a screening process as its initial stage.  If this initial stage showed that there could be a differential impact with potentially adverse effects, or that further information was required to draw robust conclusions, a full assessment would follow. But the presence of a particular “equality group” in any given location would not necessarily constitute a differential impact; for that, there had to be a higher degree of sensitivity or vulnerability to the impact as compared with the general population. </p>

She said she relied on both subsections 1(a) and (c) of s149 but her focus was now for the first time on s19 of the 2010 Act. She alleged that there was potential indirect discrimination at Euston which required the SST to consider whether a “particular equality group” was affected, there ethnic minority residents, and whether it had a “higher degree of vulnerability”, for example because the area experienced socio-economic deprivation, as it did according to the AoS.  There was prima facie indirect discrimination therefore, within s19 of the 2010 Act, which the decision-maker had to consider through an EqIA, and then consider whether the decision was a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim.  That meant that the SST had to consider whether there were alternative means of meeting the policy aim which avoided or reduced the discrimination. This should have been done before the DNS. It would also have been relevant to the consideration of alternatives, especially the Bucks CC Group Optimised Alternative, since its case is that that would not have involved expansion outside the existing station envelope at Euston. (The latter is not accepted as demonstrated fact by the SST.) It added to the argument that it was unfair not to reconsult on the OA. </p>

He pointed out, rightly, that the case on potential or actual indirect discrimination was wholly new: in reality this was now a claim that s19 was breached, rather than s149(1)(a).  It was also without merit.  Assuming that the DNS was a “provision, criteria or practice” within s19, it would only be discriminatory in relation to the ethnicity of those in the vicinity of Euston Station, if “it puts, or would put, persons with whom B [the ethnic minority residents to the west of Euston] shares the characteristics at a particular disadvantage when compared with persons with whom B does not share it”.  If it is discriminatory, the SST has to show that it is a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim; s19(2)(d). It does not have to be the only means of doing so, nor does the Court have to decide whether it is the best one.   </p>

I also accept Mr Mould’s short analysis of the application of s19: the proposal does not put the ethnic minority residents west of Euston Station at a “particular disadvantage” compared to other ethnic groups.  The ethnic minority residents are disadvantaged compared to residents who are not affected, who could equally well be of the same or some other ethnicity, minority or majority by whatever calculation is appropriate in this case. They are disadvantaged simply because of where they happen to live. It is also difficult to see why this effect would have different legal consequences if the proportion of the ethnic minority were not larger but at or less than the borough average by ward, particularly in the context of a linear, national project. </p>

The risk that the solution might not be in place by the time that it was needed for HS2 passengers is pre-eminently a matter of political judgment, as is the weight to be given to the risk. </p>

I appreciate that the question of relief was one on which the SST pointed out that the House Authorities might wish to make submissions, but the issue does go to the heart of the justiciability of this ground.  So I mention it.  It could not be for the Court to hold that the Bill if enacted would be irrational; and I do not see how any invitation to Parliament to reach such a decision could be held unlawful either. This seems to me to be a bar to relief preventing the deposit of the Bill on any of the three grounds relied on here, and a probable strong point against even declaratory relief. This applies to all three aspects of the Claimants’ rationality challenge.  </p>

There is a difference of view between SST and TfL and the Claimants. This is not a case where the SST agrees that there is a problem to which a solution has to be found, but which has not been identified or resolved upon. Unlike the Euston underground capacity issue, there is a dispute about whether the problems raised by TfL and the Claimants would arise. It may be that further work will support what the Claimants say, that the works required for a sufficiently capacious link will be far greater and more damaging than at present accepted by the SST. It is not my task to resolve that. It is impossible for me to conclude that the Claimants have proved their case on capacity and impact on existing services. </p>

I have already set out the summary of that Decision. What HHL have termed the Heathrow hub station is the location at which HS2, on the direct route alignment favoured by HHL, would link to Heathrow and the GWML.  The first ground raised by HHL is that, in excluding such a route for HS2, in advance of the aviation strategy consultation, the SST unlawfully fettered her discretion, or pre-determined the outcome of that strategy or breached HHL’s legitimate expectation of full consultation at the relevant stage on the aviation strategy.  </p>

HHL had a legitimate expectation that “genuine consultation … on [all the options for maintaining the UK’s aviation hub status except a third runway at Heathrow] would take place in due course”.

The Government will publish a consultation on this strategy in spring 2012.  This will explore all the options for maintaining the UK’s aviation hub status, with the exception of a third runway at Heathrow. There will remain a strong strategic case for ensuring that Britain’s high speed rail and aviation hub strategies are effectively integrated.  The Government will, therefore, continue to review how HS2 can best support its plans for maintaining the UK’s hub status.  An important element of this will be the scope for third party funding contributions to the costs of linking HS2 to the country’s hub airports. </p>

The DNS, upon which Mr Warren is wholly dependant, has to be read as a whole in order to see whether any claimed expectation arose. The DNS decided on a route for HS2 which prevented such a direct through route for HS2 at Heathrow, or Heathrow hub as promoted by HHL, and provided instead for spurs. It is impossible to read the DNS as containing a promise of consultation on future aviation strategy which kept open the option of a direct through HS2 line at Heathrow for the purposes. The aviation strategy consultation, when it comes, is clearly going to take place against the backdrop of the rejection of that option in the DNS.  The legitimate expectation of consultation on aviation strategy is of consultation with no direct through route at Heathrow for HS2. The expectation asserted is no more than a complete misunderstanding of the DNS; the legitimate expectation claimed was breached in the very document which was said to create it.  </p>

True it is that such a rail line could not be the subject of discussion in the aviation strategy consultation, since the decision that it should not be provided would already have been taken. But that is not an unlawful fettering of discretion or pre-determination. It is simply taking a decision on rail strategy, even though it closes off a possible rail option which has some bearing on the arguments about future aviation strategy for Heathrow. The Government is entitled to make a decision on rail strategy at this stage, even though, as it is well aware, that decision will not be open for debate later, subject to any Parliamentary decision on the Bill.   </p>

One may debate the merits of waiting or not, as Mr Warren’s arguments tried to do, but that is not a legal issue. It cannot possibly be said that the only lawful way for the Government to proceed in its decisions on the HS2 route between London and Birmingham is to wait until the aviation strategy has been consulted on and resolved.  I suspect that had the HHL proposal been  adopted in the DNS, it would have resisted any suggestion that, since the through link was an unnecessarily expensive and damaging way of providing a link which could equally as well have been provided by spurs, HS2 should be delayed until the decisions on aviation strategy had been taken.  </p>

The Decision relates to guidelines for trans-European transport networks. Article 5 of the Decision requires the integration of rail and air transport, and rail access to airports to be a priority.  Mr Warren submitted that  the DNS jeopardised the attainment of this EU policy objective, and the fettering of the decision struck against “a core principle of EU law”. There was no elaboration of that striking assertion.  It is obvious that the integration of rail and air was an important consideration in the DNS; the concern was about the best way to do so when all factors were considered, including cost and level of usage of direct trains, the delay to the passengers who would not alight at Heathrow, and the journey from the station to the airport. The decision could not be regarded as irrational. I was referred, primarily in the context of the consultation ground to <span style="font-style:italic">R (Medway Council and Others) v SST</span> [2002] EWHC 2516 (Admin) and <span style="font-style:italic">R (Hillingdon LBC) v SST</span> [2010] EWHC 626 (Admin).

HS2L’s December 2009 Report, referred to above, assessed the merits of the various options, including the potential for an  HS2 interchange at Iver on the GWML, giving access to Heathrow, as Arup had proposed. It thought that the high speed market to Heathrow was likely to be small, which meant that the greater number of passengers would not be Heathrow bound, and would suffer delay if they were on trains which were routed via and stopped at Heathrow. The December 2009 report concluded that the most promising options for serving Heathrow by high speed rail were an interchange at Old Oak Common via Crossrail and the Heathrow Express, or a station at or near Heathrow on a loop from HS2, connecting to the airport and GWML.  </p>

It contrasted its interchange with HHL’s wider proposal and terminal facility.  Its main reasons for not adopting HHL’s proposals were: the significant time (7 minute) penalty for non-airport bound passengers, who would be in the great majority; for airline passengers, an on-airport location or one closer to the airport than Iver would be more attractive; the Old Oak Common interchange would be more attractive for passengers going to destinations in London, who would not transfer to Crossrail at Heathrow. </p>

HS2 Ltd has carefully looked at the case for  serving Heathrow in this way.  This is discussed in more detail in Chapter 5.  The outcome of this further consideration, coupled with the evidence presented in consultation responses, has not altered the Government’s conclusions.  Whilst a through-route may bring benefits to the relatively small proportion of passengers who would use HS2 to access Heathrow, these would come at the loss of much larger benefits to the majority of passengers travelling into central London.  HS2’s projected passenger mix shows that many more people would be using the service to access London than Heathrow. </p>

In addition, the extra costs associated with routing the main HS2 line close to Heathrow could be higher than the costs of a spur to the airport from the main line. For these reasons, the Government favours a spur rather than a through route as the best option for providing direct high speed access to Heathrow. </p>

Neither could easily be integrated with passenger facilities and other public transport connectivity of Heathrow Airport.

Since it allows services to travel directly to a passenger terminal at Heathrow, it gives the opportunity of services in codeshare form with integrated luggage and ticketing.  A spur route also allows dedicated airport services, which could be more suitable for such arrangements.  A spur could take passengers to a station fully integrated into the passenger facilities of the future Heathrow itself making a more attractive proposition for interlining passengers.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">One cannot exclude either the post-consultation meetings which HHL had with officials, seeking to put across its point, before the DNS and other decision documents were produced. The same applies to the debates which were carried on through the medium of or in responses to the Transport Select Committee. These were just as much endeavours to persuade officials as was the consultation response, which it cannot have supposed the SST would read personally, along with all the other consultation responses, and in its entirety. The very process of consultation and presentation in the formal and outside the formal consultation process was predicated on the ability of officials to convey the essence of the points to Ministers and advise on them. Accordingly, in seeing what was considered and not considered as a point in the consultation response, what officials knew from other sources is very relevant. </p>

But some of the most important arguments for and against it were common to all such proposals. Among drawbacks were the delays to HS2  passengers who were not bound for the airport caused by the stops at Iver, or the loss of capacity from a selectively stopping service, the low proportion of HS2 passengers who would benefit, and the need to travel 3 miles from Iver Station, terminal or not, to the airport. Among asserted advantages were the potentially greater modal shift to rail, greater interchange potential for Heathrow and support for Heathrow’s role, and improving rail access from the west and Wales.  </p>

I think that, thus reformulated, they go somewhat beyond, or are presented rather differently in emphasis, from what HHL had actually put forward.  However, it is clear that a comparison was done between the hub and spur, that the relation to Heathrow’s role as a hub was considered, but the SST was entitled to approach this on the basis she did. I have already dealt with this point in relation to the aviation strategy ground. The insufficiency of information about the link at Terminal 5 was not really a consultation response point. The SST was entitled to approach the decision on the basis of the information she had. The complaint that HHL did not have enough to make an informed response has to fail if the SST had enough on which to reach a decision on the merits of spur versus hub, which she did. There was also very little material from HHL to enable an environmental comparison of routes.  The main points of the comparison, as the SST was entitled to judge them, were dealt with in the submission to the SST.  </p>

The consultation route traverses the Golf Club’s course, the farm land of Mr Woodford and the farm land of Mr Jarvis as it passes close to the west of Aylesbury. At the closest at the south western and north western edges of Aylesbury, its centre line is 300ms and 250ms or so away; it is generally no more than 500ms away from the outskirts of Aylesbury. In the December 2009 Report by HS2L, “High Speed Rail: London to the West Midlands and Beyond” published in February 2010, the route had been shown 75 to 100ms further west. On that alignment, the golf course could have survived with adjustments, but on the consultation route, it could function at best as scarcely a short 9 hole course; in effect the Club would not survive, according to the Claimants’ evidence. The change to the route also would make farming Mr Jarvis’ land very much more difficult.

The associated garden is registered on the Register of Gardens. The owners of land affected by that change were not aware of the meeting nor were they consulted about the effect which the change would have before the consultation route was published. The change was referred to in the “High Speed Rail: London to the West Midlands and Beyond: Line of Route Mitigation: Supplementary Report” by HS2L to DfT published on 3 December 2010, which explained the change and the meeting which had led up to it. The March 2010 Command Paper had said that between then and the formal consultation process, there would be a process of “engagement” with “key stakeholders” and which would enable local and  other sensitivities to be factored in. The change was not picked up by the Claimants, however, until after the close of the subsequent consultation process in July 2011; the report referred to the route passing through the edge of the golf course.  The change and its significance were in fact not appreciated by them until shortly before service of amended grounds on 31 October 2012. </p>

All of this showed that the only real opportunity which the Claimants had to influence the route was before the consultation began, a process from which they were excluded by the decision of HS2L to consult the National Trust about Hartwell House and a change of route, but not to consult those affected by the change, notably the Claimants.  </p>

The changes would produce significant disadvantages without any net benefits. He identified four: population and other features affected by noise and landscape impacts such as Waddesdon Manor, a Grade 1 listed building, at least five named villages, open countryside and farmland; curves of relatively tight radii which would require trains to run much more slowly; two tunnelled sections; and earthworks to carry the track across the rather more undulating land of the proposed alternative.

The impact on Waddesdon Manor would be reduced by a box cover, and  other villages, if not  avoided, would be protected by short tunnels; and it would obviate the need for a greater length of tunnel at Wendover; the tightness of the curves would be reduced by detailed engineering and there would be no significant reduction in speed; the two tunnels and box cover would address the undulation in the ground.

The change which led to the consultation route was made in an unfair way, because the Claimants, adversely affected by the change, were not given any opportunity to comment on the change before it became part of the consultation route.  They could have pointed out how serious its impact was on them and how limited the gain to Hartwell House; as it was they had not appreciated that the change had been made at all till too late. This linked to the second submission that the consultation was not genuine; and that the line was effectively determined before the consultation process, with only the most minor changes being thereafter allowed. Question 5 in the consultation document asked: “Do you agree that the government’s proposed route, including the approach proposed for mitigating its impact, is the best option for a new highspeed rail line between London and the West Midlands?” Mr Fletcher submitted that this slanted  answers towards a choice between the consultation route and one other alternative which had been considered at an earlier stage; radical change could not be proposed in response to that question; but it was also not immediately apparent that Question 5 was about the precise route rather than the route corridor.  </p>

Fairness in this context, and in the light of the material Dr Eaglen had provided to HS2L, required a meeting between them so that Dr Eaglen had a fair chance to put his points across on behalf of the Claimants to HS2L. There should have been a Working Group and consultation with the local planning authorities and those adversely affected by the proposed alternative in order to reach a fair appraisal of it.  These points also linked to the fourth submission: HS2L/DfT had given no conscientious consideration to the proposed alternative; there was no substantial evidence as to how Mr Castle had approached this alternative, nor was there evidence of any systematic and documented approach, drawing for example on numbers affected to varying bands of degrees. A meeting with Dr Eaglen would have enabled a greater understanding to be achieved. </p>

I reject the argument that fairness in that respect required HS2L to meet with Dr Eaglen, or to set up a Working Group with others to develop it, or to optimise it, before rejecting it. The primary responsibility is on the respondent to a consultation exercise to put forward the case it wishes the consulting body to consider; and if it does not contain  the detail necessary to show how drawbacks  were to be overcome, and in its draft or incomplete state does not persuade the consulting body that it should be looked at further, their duty of conscientious consideration does not require the body to take it further. That would be to impose a very onerous duty on the consulting body, far beyond the scope of conscientious consideration, to pursue alternatives which as presented to it were not even persuasive that it should be considered further.

It was for Dr Eaglen to present the material in a way which persuaded HS2L to take it further; there was no duty on it to find the material.  I recognise that this can put objectors to a scheme of this nature at something of a disadvantage, where so much of the technical information, knowledge and skills are in the hands of the consulting body. But that does not mean that the absence of reaction by HS2L to the request for a meeting makes its response so unfair as to be unlawful. Mr Castle was entitled to recognise that Dr Eaglen described the “possible benefits” of his proposal, and was sufficiently tentative to suggest a Working Group; he had not done the work which would show that his alternative was actually better.  HS2L was not obliged, with that level of detail, to take the alternative further in discussion with Dr Eaglen in order for the alternative to receive conscientious consideration.    </p>

The crucial question is: how did HS2L actually consider Dr Eaglen’s alternative? The language of Ms Munro’s witness statement, cited above, could lead readily to the conclusion that the degree of change proposed was itself a reason for not considering the alternative further. If so, that would have been a statement, in the light of the breadth of the consultation exercise in relation to route, that the alternative had not been conscientiously considered, but rejected for </p>

I am satisfied from Mr Castle’s two statements that the alternative as presented was considered to a level which meets the standard required for a conscientious consideration. It may lack written record, and the application of a consistent framework for the comparative assessment of alternatives and the consultation route.  But those imperfections do not amount to a want of legally sufficient conscientious consideration. I do not doubt that Mr Castle’s experience and knowledge of the area and route permitted him to reach the judgment he did. As I have said, such consideration did not require a meeting or discussion with Dr Eaglen. I also accept that had Mr Castle and Dr Eaglen met, there would have been disagreement but it is not for me, nor would it be possible for me on the information I have, to resolve those issues.  But that does not preclude my conclusion that Mr Castle reached a rational view after conscientious consideration. Accordingly, this challenge is dismissed. </p>

It consulted on these proposals in the February 2011 HS2 consultation. 172000 people were contacted by the DfT in the consultation process for HS2 Phase 1: that is those within 1km of the line or within 250m of a tunnelled section. Those parameters were chosen, said Mr Graham, because of the significant interest among communities along the route; they were not chosen, as Mr Wolfe implied, to indicate what might be a lower limit on the numbers potentially affected by the construction or operation of HS2 Phase 1. </p>

It should pursue its argument for the introduction of a bond based property purchase scheme in a political forum.  It was illogical to seek to  compel  the SST by litigation to adopt a different form of voluntary code. The decision as to what, if any, discretionary compensation measures to introduce beyond the statutory scheme was for the Government, which had a wide margin of discretion in deciding what measures were appropriate, being best placed to assess how society’s needs and resources should be balanced. The consultation on compensation obviously related to the allocation of public resources, and involved a judgment about what should be done for those affected by blight but not covered by statutory provisions, balancing the various interests of those affected and the rest of the population. </p>

Although the Government was not obliged to add to the statutory provisions, it had made clear its intention to introduce discretionary arrangements “to support affected property owners”. Three options were set out, and “whichever option for a new scheme is chosen”, it was anticipated that the EHS would then close, as it had been a temporary scheme awaiting the final decisions on routes. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The first option was a hardship-based property purchase scheme akin to the EHS, enabling those whose property fell outside the safeguarded zones, but who were affected by generalised blight and suffered hardship as a result to have their property purchased. There would be criteria and valuation procedures. The Government was concerned that this “would inevitably lead” to it owning properties which were not required for the scheme, with a concerning effect on the local property market and community.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The second option was a bond-based scheme. The qualifying property owner would seek a Government guarantee that it would purchase the property at a later date in the evolution of the project at its unaffected value. The guarantee would be transferable, and the confidence which that would give to purchasers would enable the local property market to keep functioning. Since that “may still lead” to the Government owning significant numbers of properties, it explored a third option of a promise to pay compensation. Mr Wolfe noted the contrast between “would “and “may” in the light of the way in which the decision was later reasoned.  </p>

There would be a “streamlined advance purchase scheme” to simplify the statutory blight purchase process, enabling people to sell their house but to stay on in it, renting it back until it was required. For those affected by the impact of construction works, there would be an additional “streamlined small claims scheme”.

It would be like the EHS, itself summarised, and which could be reviewed, but it might have different criteria since the EHS dealt with the situation before the statutory scheme came into effect. This was the proposal for dealing with generalised blight, which of the three which it identified, the Government had decided to proceed with “for the reasons set out above”. I have set out the supposed reasons, and at scarcely any  shorter length. They are not reasons which compare the three options.

What eventually emerged from the Treasury Solicitor on 7 November 2012 was a 6 page document which was not HS2AA’s response at all, but was a draft of a briefing document prepared for its affiliate groups to consider when preparing their own responses. It was not a summary of the Question 7 response, though it contained many of the conclusions of its full response. This was the document, the Treasury Solicitor said, which was on the consultation website as the response, and was referred to in the Addendum report in the footnote as the response which DbD had already analysed from HS2AA. There is nothing in the Addendum Report to suggest that any further Question 7 response was considered in it; rather the response had already been considered.

I reject the suggestion that DbD ever considered the full response: its own documents and the 7 November 2012 letter from the Treasury Solicitor are inconsistent with it. Mr Graham cannot know what happened there; he assumed, reasonably enough, that DbD had the full response originally, and then assumed that having omitted it, it was what was considered in the Addendum.

Both before during and after the February 2011 Consultation period I was contacted frequently by people asking for advice and information on this issue.  I was personally involved with many deserving and tragic cases with people who had a pressing need to move for family or personal reasons (eg the need to move due to illness, bereavement, divorce, to be nearer to family) yet could not do so and were trapped by the blight of HS2.  The publication of materials on compensation as part of the February 2011 Consultation was therefore extremely important to many people.  It was asking the people who would be suffering personal financial loss through absolutely no fault of their own (totalling in many cases to tens of thousands of pounds) due to HS2, about their views on compensation options.  It is inescapable that they would need enough information so they could assess how they personally would be affected, before they could intelligently respond even at a principles level. The bare outlines provided even in Annex A failed to do this, and many individuals asked our organisation if we could provide basic information as to how the schemes would work.

HS2AA complained that it had not had sufficient information to make a properly informed response, even with its private discussions with DfT and HS2L officials.

The consultees’ preferences and reasons would inform that choice. The schemes were not differentiated on some other basis, for example that more might gain or lose under one or the other, or that qualifying persons or situations might be very different as between mechanisms, or that those who suffered significant loss would be more protected under one than under another, or that one might cost so much more that a scheme which achieved less could be chosen.

These points relate to differences in the way the Government must have envisaged the schemes would be operated by it in alleviating generalised blight. The implication of the reasons for the decision in ROPI is that the hardship scheme was to be operated on tighter qualifying criteria than the bond based property purchase or compensation scheme, or would do less for those who suffered serious financial loss as a result of generalised blight, otherwise the different costs and level of property purchase would not have been the issue.

It dealt with how, on this option, the Government could reduce the number of houses it would have to own or alternatively manage them effectively. So those two related issues were recognised to be in play and were addressed. A comparison was drawn with other property purchase bond schemes. It also included a comment from the SST reported in the press in December 2010, to the effect that while Government was obliged to treat those affected fairly, the taxpayers’ interests had to be taken into account as well. </p>

I have accepted that the views expressed by consultees were relevant, but that is obvious.  In particular, the cost and risk of cost increases were not mentioned.  Now, I acknowledge that the cost to the public purse of discretionary compensation is a highly relevant matter for Government to consider, as is the impact which a scheme here could have on the cost of other projects.  This is to be seen however against the background of the clear expression of concern by the SST to Parliament that the cost of public infrastructure would be unfairly borne by the happenstance of property ownership along its line, if there were not fair compensation for those who suffered significant loss: “It is right and proper that individuals who suffer serious financial loss in the national interest should be compensated”.   </p>

There was nothing in the consultation information from the Government to suggest that it would operate so as to affect the choice between the options or in what way. The description of the mechanisms does not draw such a distinction. There is nothing in the consultation information to show what effect cost could have on the answer to Question 7, or on the choice of options, or on the practical operation of the scheme or rather what features of the practical operation of the schemes would affect their relative costs. The reference to the cost to the public of owning properties goes nowhere as a point of distinction between the three options, unless there is something about the schemes which means that more would become Government owned in one than in another. There was no information as to why that should be so, rather than it being a point which went to how the qualifying criteria were set in all schemes.

Preventing the latter had been more an objective than a matter of concern. The precedents of other schemes of the same type were mentioned, not to discourage but to offer some point of reference. There must have been more than some vague notion which underlay what the Government decided; but the fact and nature of this concern, highly relevant to the ROPI decision as it turned out, was not mentioned, and could not have been anticipated. The Government’s line had appeared to be the opposite.  Caution, however, is required over this point. It only appears in Mr Graham’s evidence as a concern. It also appears from the responses of others that there was a concern about precedent, noted in ROPI, which it would have been legitimate for the SST to take on board.

Although HS2AA’s response to consultation did contain a reference to cost, it cannot have been that which led the SST to reach her decision on the basis of cost. It was also unfair for it to be turned into the driver of the decision. </p>

But, their reports, if their substance was conveyed to the SST as appears from the Ministerial Statement in July 2012, could have reinforced a misunderstanding about the extent and detail of HS2AA’s response. The SST told Parliament that reading the further DbD analysis of omitted responses would not have altered the decision; but that report too was defective.  It is impossible also to tell from Mr Graham’s evidence in paragraph 284 of his third Witness Statement what effect that omission had.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">First, the HS2AA consultation response was couched in terms of the five issues or objectives, and measured the three options against them. This was the structure of response dictated by the SST’s form of consultation. The decision simply does not grapple with that response or the structure of the thinking in Annex A to which it related. There is no coherent comparative analysis of the three options against the five objectives or against the more broadly expressed ambitions which underlay the Consultation Document, the Summary and Annex A.  There is no evidence that the structured response to the question was considered from the form of the decision, or its reasons. They point the other way.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Second, the introduction of further issues, notably cost and risk, and the part they played, reinforces my conclusion that the judgment was made on other issues, rather than following upon a conscientious consideration of the responses.  The reasons given by the SST in ROPI, which are said by the Treasury Solicitor to be the reasons for the decision, do not include all the reasons given by Mr Graham for her decision, which suggests that there was no  clear process of considering the consultation responses. ROPI does say that it became increasingly clear that the costs and risks of the bond based property purchase scheme could not be discounted, but that became a or the crucial issue.  Had the response been properly considered, the SST would have realised that she was making a decision based on a large new point of differentiation between the schemes.  She ought then at least to have recognised the cost points made in the response.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Third, the HS2AA consultation response made many specific points, including points about the way in which the anticipated drawbacks of its preferred scheme could be met, on past experience, and how significant were the views on the approaches of all respondents involved in the property and property finance market.  ROPI makes but a brief mention of the views of some who worked in those areas on the bond based property purchase scheme.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Finally, the reasons actually given are in part very odd.  The refreshed hardship scheme was the one of which it was said by Government that it would “inevitably” lead to it owning large numbers of properties, and that that “may” happen with the property bond scheme. In ROPI, with no reference to any material or consultation response, that had become ignored on the one and a point against the other. Evidence about how the latter risk could be countered was in HS2AA’s response. (It does also support my view that either the Government had information about how it intended to operate the schemes in detail which it did not share with consultees, or it changed the basis upon which it would compare the schemes, so that it was an advantage to one that it affected only a particular minority, and a drawback of the other that it applied more generally to those experiencing serious financial loss). </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The absence of support for the hardship purchase scheme was acknowledged but explained on the basis that it would only help a minority; the much greater support for the bond based purchase scheme was discounted on the basis that most people expressed no view. The ROPI does not deal with the problem of the lack of detail in this context, although that was a point made by HS2AA. Paragraph 21, ignoring its muddled thinking, cannot answer the problem of the effect of the lack of detail on the absence of responses expressing preferences, and the implications for the assessment of support.  Nor does it recognise that the language of its own Question 7 did not actually invite the expression of a preference between options, and the absence of such expression of preferences had to be judged against the question. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">HS2AA’s full response was careful and substantial; HS2AA was a “key stakeholder” on this topic. I have read this response; if the response was considered at all, it was not considered conscientiously.  It was in reality just brushed aside.  The evidence from ROPI itself shows that to be so.  The SST took a decision based on unheralded factors which seemed more important, and which, if Mr Graham is right and the Treasury Solicitor wrong, were not even fully expressed in ROPI. </p>
