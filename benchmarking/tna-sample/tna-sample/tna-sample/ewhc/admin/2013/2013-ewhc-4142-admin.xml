	    <p class="ParaLevel10" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Against the background of a need to make significant savings of expenditure in 2013-4 (in the region of £29.5 million) and 2014-5 (in the region of £35.5 million) in relation to the cost of the provision of fire and emergency services in London, decisions were taken in August and September this year which, if implemented, would have the following principal effects:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel10" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">If implemented, the impact of this decision <span style="text-decoration:underline">across the whole of London</span> will be to increase the average attendance time of the first fire engine at an incident to 5 minutes 33 seconds (an increase of 13 seconds from the current position) and the average attendance time of the second fire engine to 6 minutes 32 seconds (an increase of 10 seconds from the current position).  However, it is the specific effect upon the seven Claimant boroughs of increased attendance times generally that underlies the claim made in these proceedings.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel10" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">During the period from 2009/10 to 2012/13 budget savings of £52 million had been made across the London fire and rescue services necessitated by the Government’s 2010 ‘Comprehensive Spending Review’ which required the fire service <span style="text-decoration:underline">nationally</span> to save 25% over the 4-year period to April 2015. Savings totalling £71 million had been made over the five years prior to the consideration of the proposals under challenge in these proceedings. The savings thus made had not hitherto affected “front line” services in London, but the need to make yet further significant savings in the light of the provisional Local Government Finance Settlement for 2013-14 (which set out Government grant funding for every local authority), published for consultation on 19 December 2012, made this a necessary consideration for the first time.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel10" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The need to make the cuts in expenditure is not under challenge in these proceedings.  It is the manner in which the cuts are to have an impact that forms the backdrop to the issues before the court.</p>

People are, understandably, very concerned when they hear that their local fire station may be closed or that the number of fire engines and/or fire-fighters in or who serve their locality are to be reduced.  Their elected representatives have reflected these concerns during the debates and votes that have taken place.  The concerns have led to petitions, local demonstrations and strong opposition from some quarters.</p>

The hearing does not constitute a public inquiry into the fire safety proposals for London and it has not involved an evaluation of competing evidence about the proposals.  The case is also not about whether the court agrees or disagrees with the proposals.  What is the subject of legal challenge in these proceedings is primarily the <span style="text-decoration:underline">process</span> by which that decision was reached.  Whatever conclusion may be reached by the court in relation to this challenge, it is important to understand that the court’s focus is primarily upon the <span style="text-decoration:underline">process</span> leading to the making of the decision, <span style="text-decoration:underline">not</span> upon the merits of the decision itself or any individual aspect of it, or indeed upon how relevant factors were weighed in reaching the decision: those have always been matters of judgment for the elected decision-makers with the help of advice from those with expertise in the field.  The court is not the place where any such decision is made and, of course, any political issues that may arise are not matters for the court either.  The issue for the court in this case is primarily whether the <span style="text-decoration:underline">process</span> by which the decision was made has led to an <span style="text-decoration:underline">unlawful</span> decision, as is contended by the Claimants (and supported by the Fire Brigades Union - ‘the FBU’), or to a <span style="text-decoration:underline">lawful</span> decision, as is contended by the decision-makers.</p>

The Commissioner is employed by LFEPA and may only exercise the functions delegated to him by LFEPA: he does not have a statutory role as such.

In his witness statement, the Commissioner makes the point that the area within Category A constituted 2% of London in geographical terms, Category B comprised 43%, Category C comprised 54% and Category D constituted 17%.  Between these categories there were differing target attendance times. For example, an area within Category A demanded a fast response time (i.e. 5 minutes for the first two appliances and a third appliance within 8 minutes) whereas in Category C areas the required response rate was <span style="text-decoration:underline">one fire engine</span> in 8-10 minutes and in some Category D areas <span style="text-decoration:underline">one fire engine</span> in 20 minutes.

Since reliance is placed upon Guidance Note 1 by the Claimants, this is a convenient point at which to note those parts of it that are said to be potentially relevant.  I should, perhaps, record that Mr Moffett makes the point that this Guidance Note was produced in 2003 before any fire authority had actually produced an IRMP, that it is no longer generally available and is only available on National Archives website. That website does indeed indicate that “[following] the change of government we are reviewing all content on this website”.  In those circumstances he suggests that the Department for Communities and Local Government is unlikely to consider it to have much ongoing relevance.  It is, however, fair to say that the Commissioner, in Supporting Document 21, described the guidance documents issued as “old but … still regarded to be current.”  I will return to the implications of this later, but for present purposes will simply record those paragraphs that have formed the subject of some debate before me.</p>

They involve shifting the focus in planning to put people first, looking at the risks arising from the full range of fires and other emergency incidents, and at the options for their reduction and management. To be effective, IRMPs will need to provide a fully integrated, risk-managed approach to community safety, fire safety inspection and enforcement, and emergency response arrangements that will contribute to a safer environment. In order to provide a fair and equitable service it will be necessary for fire and rescue authorities to take into account in their IRMPs the diverse needs of the population they serve and to assess how best to meet these needs, particularly in relation to community safety provisions. Local authorities already have a duty to prepare strategies and plans for a number of other purposes, e.g. community strategies, Equality Action Plans, etc. IRMPs will need to be co-ordinated with these and the plans of other relevant agencies if they are to have maximum effect.</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">3.3.1 The first task in preparing an IRMP is to identify, characterise and prioritise the existing and potential risks within your fire authority’s area. You will need to look in some detail at what has happened in recent years, and what might reasonably be expected to happen. This will include examining the number, type, geographical location and time of day of all incidents attended in recent years (fires, RTAs, other special services e.g. flooding, co-responder, etc). While risk to property, the environment and heritage will continue to be of importance, risk to life will in future be given the highest priority.</p>

You may also identify in this part of the process data that it would be helpful to collect or improve, or research you would like to do into correlation between incidents and possible causal factors.

In evaluating risk to life, you will take into account where the priorities lie. For example the risk to life from fires is highest in residential premises, especially higher density, lower quality housing, while there is a lower risk of injury or death from fire in commercial premises, reflecting the massive investment in in-built detection, suppression and public protection measures. You will need to make adequate arrangements to ensure your plans are based on knowledge rather than assumptions.</p>

Because of the geographical variation in risks, it is expected that emergency response standards will vary throughout the authority area and be proportionate to the risks.

	    <p class="ParaLevel10" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">So far as the funding of the GLA is concerned, the witness statement of Martin Clarke, Executive Director of Resources, indicates that the “major sources of revenue are council tax, grants paid by the Secretary of State, retained business rates, fares, a business rate supplement levy, and other sources such as advertising and road user charging.”  He explains the way in which the GLA’s budget is determined in the following way:</p>

Under paragraph 1 of Schedule 6 the Mayor and Assembly are responsible for the preparation of (i) a component budget for each “constituent body”, that is, the Mayor, the Assembly, and each of the functional bodies, and (ii) a consolidated budget for the GLA. The Mayor must prepare a draft component budget for each constituent body, consulting the Assembly before preparing the draft component budgets for the Mayor and the Assembly, and the functional bodies before preparing their draft component budgets. (These component requirements are amounts to be raised from London’s council tax payers for these bodies and it is these that the London Assembly has the power to amend.) The Mayor must then prepare a consolidated budget for the GLA, consisting of the component budgets for each of the constituent bodies, which together constitute the consolidated budget for the GLA. This comprises the first stage, described as the ‘draft consolidated budget’, i.e. a statement of the amount of the component council tax requirement for each body and the calculations which give rise to this amount, and a statement of the aggregate of these component council tax requirements, called the consolidated council tax requirement.</p>

The Comprehensive Spending Review provided for an average total reduction in grant funding of 25% to fire authorities in England, but its distribution amongst individual authorities had not been determined.  This led to uncertainties about what would be available through this source for LFPEA which were, he says, “compounded by the impending impact of changes to the local government finance system for 2013-14.”  It was only when the Local Government Finance Settlement for 2013-14 was published for consultation on 19 December 2012 (which set out proposed government grant funding for every local authority) that the position became clearer.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel10" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Some pre-planning, however, had to be undertaken in view of the anticipated cuts in funding from central government for the fire services.  In June 2012 the Mayor issued budget guidance for 2013-14 and 2014-15 for LFEPA and the other “functional bodies” of the GLA.  For the purpose of preparing the budgets, the June 2012 guidance set out the Council Tax requirements for LFEPA and, according to Mr Clarke, “based on those requirements estimated savings to be made by LFEPA of £29.5 million in 2013/14 and £35.3 million in 2014/15.”  Because of the uncertainties over the level of central government funding for the future, no final budget for LFEPA could be set in accordance with the usual timetable and, accordingly, it was agreed that this should await the publication of the provisional Local Government Finance Settlement which was anticipated in December.  As indicated above (paragraphs 3 and 48), it was published on 19 December 2012 and following a period of consultation the final Local Government Finance Settlement was published on 4 February 2013 and the associated 2013/14 Local Government Finance Report was approved by Parliament on 13 February 2013.</p>

On 22 November 2012 he presented his preliminary proposals for LSP5 to LFEPA which at that stage did not contain any reductions in the number of fire stations or fire appliances.  In his witness statement, the Commissioner says that he “advised Members that officers [had] been working on potential changes to the numbers of fire stations and pumping appliances but that that work was not complete [and that he] made clear that the work anticipated that the [LFB] would have diminished financial resources in the future, but also responded to the diminished demand on the [LFB’s] services over the last ten years.”  He records also that LFEPA “agreed an initial draft for pre-consultation engagement with key stakeholder organisations and staff, including the FBU.”</p>

He stated that the indications were that the settlement for LFEPA for 2014/15 would reduce by at least £21.5 million, that this would not necessarily be LFEPA’s savings target for that year and that “further substantial savings will need to be made … including the rationalisation of the fire estate”.  He stated that the impact of the settlement gave LFEPA greater flexibility to manage the reduction in Government support over the next two years and that “it is imperative that [LFEPA] brings back proposals in early 2013/14 to manage the scale of reductions anticipated in 2014/15”.  He requested the submission of plans for both 2013/14 and 2014/15 in time to conclude the preparation of his draft consolidated budget for the London Assembly meeting on 8 February 2013.</p>

The first was effectively a decision imposed upon the GLA by central government as it was upon other local authorities around the country.  The second was a function of the way the central government cuts were announced and the way the GLA’s budgetary arrangements were organised.</p>

In summary, he suggested that the best way forward, given the financial constraints, was to allocate resources on the basis of 151 appliances at 100 fire stations (usually referred to as the ‘151/100 option’) – in other words, suggesting the closure of 12 fire stations (Clerkenwell, Clapham, New Cross, Southwark, Bow, Kingsland, Downham, Belsize, Knightsbridge, Silvertown, Westminster and Woolwich) and the decommissioning of 18 appliances.  I will say more about how this recommendation emerged in due course.  That, however, was the draft Plan upon which the Commissioner was inviting LFEPA to embark upon a consultation process.</p>

For present purposes, the ‘headline’ changes to the original draft plan would result in the retention of two fire stations previously earmarked for closure (Clapham and New Cross) and the retention of four further appliances resulting in the overall reduction in appliances to 155 rather than 151 as originally proposed.   The revised draft Plan proposed to reduce the number of fire-fighter posts by 552 instead of the 520 proposed in the original draft Plan.  The revised draft Plan also proposed the reduction from 16 to 14 of the number of fire rescue units (‘FRUs’) available in London and to reduce to 4 from 5 the minimum crewing levels on FRUs.  (A FRU is a purpose built vehicle designed to provide specialist rescue functions which include incidents that involve line rescue, water rescue, road traffic accidents, people trapped in machinery and/or hazardous materials. A FRU also provides an extended duration breathing apparatus role for use in large complex building fires and to support or rescue fire-fighters in need of assistance.)</p>

There is inevitably some overlap between these various approaches and compartmentalising the submissions under one heading or another has been difficult.</p>

In his oral submissions Mr Stilitz asserted that, taken as a whole, these proposals, if implemented, would result in “a decimation of the London Fire Service”, namely, “roughly a 10% cut to London’s front-line fire-fighting capability”.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel10" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">So far as the challenge based upon “classic public law grounds” is concerned, in summary Mr Stilitz contends that the decisions taken (i) failed to take into account all essential material considerations, (ii) failed to comply with the requirements of the National Framework to take into account all foreseeable risks and (iii) were, by “treating manifestly unlike boroughs alike”, irrational.  These arguments reflect the established <span style="font-style:italic">Wednesbury</span> approach (see <span style="font-style:italic">Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd. v Wednesbury Corporation</span> [1948] 1 KB 223) that the court may intervene only if it can be demonstrated that the decision-maker failed to take into account material considerations, took into account immaterial considerations or otherwise reached a decision that no reasonable decision-maker could reach.  I will return to further articulations of the appropriate approach in that context in due course (see paragraph 218 below), but, as I have already indicated (see paragraph 71 above), it is also to be noted that Mr Stilitz also contends that because fire-fighting resources are being reduced by 10%, potentially matters of life and death are at stake and that, accordingly, a heightened level of scrutiny should be adopted in such cases.  He relies on <span style="font-style:italic">R (Rogers) v Swindon NHS PCT</span> [2006] 1 WLR 2649, <span style="font-style:italic">per</span> Sir Anthony Clarke MR at [56] and <span style="font-style:italic">R (Hillingdon LBC) v Lord Chancellor</span> [2008] EWHC 2683, <span style="font-style:italic">per</span> Dyson LJ at [67].

He became London Fire Commissioner from 1 October 2007.  Nonetheless, basing the following account largely on his undisputed evidence, it should be noted that the first IRMP, the London Safety Plan (‘LSP1’), was adopted by LFEPA in March 2004.  This stated that the LFB would continue using the former recommended attendance times on a temporary basis whilst consideration was given to what the appropriate standard should be.  Since then LFEPA has adopted three further LSPs, excluding the Plan under consideration in these proceedings.<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>The Second London Safety Plan 2005/2008 (‘LSP2’) was approved in March 2005, the third for 2008/2011 (‘LSP3’) was approved in March 2008 and the fourth for 2011/2013 (‘LSP4’) in March 2011.</p>

The Commissioner describes how the principle came to be adopted in his witness statement and I will return to that briefly (see paragraphs 84-85 below) after spelling out what it involves.  Since the adherence to the principle in the Plan under consideration in these proceedings is heavily criticised by the Claimants, it is important to understand its implications.

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“The [LFB] plans the allocation of its resources on a London-wide basis. By this I mean that we plan the location of fire appliances (and other resources) so they can arrive at incidents as quickly as possible, wherever the incident occurs in London. Since LSP2, the [LFB] has adopted as a guiding principle the concept that Londoners should have equal entitlement to the fastest possible attendance times, irrespective of whether they live in an area in which there is a higher likelihood or a lower likelihood of fire occurring in the first place. The [LFB’s] view is that in the event of a serious incident, each person should be entitled to expect a broadly similar response in terms of resources deployed and the time to arrive. Just because a person lives in an area with a lower likelihood of fire occurring, this does not mean that they should have a slower response time when a fire actually does occur. For convenience, this is referred to in this witness statement as the principle of “equal entitlement”. This is a guiding but not overriding principle because it is subject to a number of other objectives and operational constraints as I explain below. However, it is important to appreciate at the outset that one of the [LFB’s] guiding principles since 2004 has been to organise ourselves in such a way that one person receives broadly the same response as another, regardless of where they are located in London.”</p>

Arriving quickly at an incident is an important factor which affects the [LFB’s] ability to protect the public from fire, however there are complex and difficult judgment calls to make as to how to balance a desire for a fast response with the fact that in some areas the demand for emergency responses is lower. </p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">67.<marker name="tab"/>One possible approach is to differentiate between different geographical areas, affording priority (and therefore allocating more resources) to responding to incidents faster in a particular area. If this principle was adopted, a fire service could take into account any number of factors in determining its “priority areas”, for example, a service could decide to prioritise attendance times in areas which have the most significant public buildings, or the most valuable property, or the highest population density, or the highest numbers of people with particular characteristics, or any combination of these factors. This may well involve difficult judgement calls as to which categories of people or premises should benefit from faster attendance times and thus be prioritised over others. Such an approach, in particular the prioritisation of particular groups of people, may practically be very difficult to organise because any identified “priority” areas would be likely to be dispersed around London. </p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">68.<marker name="tab"/>Another option, and the one that has been adopted by the [LFB] since 2004, is the principle of seeking to achieve similar attendance times across the whole of the area covered by the service, without prioritising attendance times in particular areas. … this is referred to as the concept of “equal entitlement”.  Equal entitlement means that one of the [LFB’s] aims is to deliver the fastest attendance times to the widest possible coverage of London’s population, or, put another way, one of our guiding principles is to respond to every incident in the best time possible wherever the incident occurs within London.  </p>

	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">69.<marker name="tab"/>In practice, the guiding principle of equal entitlement means that people in similar situations living in different parts of London can expect reasonably similar attendance times. For example, an elderly disabled person living in a high-rise building in Camden can expect a similar attendance time to an elderly disabled person living in a high-rise building in Croydon. In my opinion, both individuals are entitled to expect similar attendance times from a [LFB] that serves the whole of London, in so far as reasonably practicable.”</p>

Further, in my opinion, a person in London should not be treated as being a lower priority for the [LFB] in the event that a fire does occur, simply because they live within an area in which the number of incidents is statistically lower. This is an opinion that was shared by my predecessor as Commissioner when LSP2 was introduced. As a result, the critical point that drives the [LFB’s] guiding principle is the desire to minimise attendance times to a fire wherever it occurs in London, subject to other objectives and operational constraints.”</p>

In other words a fire in a bedroom in Westminster has the same potential consequence as a fire in a bedroom in Sutton or Bromley. In risk terms it is also difficult to argue that, just because one person is less likely to have a fire that it follows they should receive a slower response if they do have one.

The Commissioner makes the point in his witness statement that “it would be incorrect to assume … that an attendance time of 5:59 will prevent adverse outcomes from fire whereas an attendance time of 6:01 (or even 7:01 or 8:01) will not.”  The Claimants have a different view of the matter to which I will turn later.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel10" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The most fundamental challenge made to the Commissioner’s report and, in consequence, to the Mayor’s decision is put in a number of ways and various factors are embraced within it.  However, in short, it is that the formulation of the Plan commenced from the wrong starting-point.  It is said that the National Framework and the extant Guidance (on the assumption that it was extant and relevant) demanded that LFEPA should prepare an IRMP having identified and assessed “all foreseeable fire and rescue related risks that could affect its community” and which also then demonstrated how “prevention, protection and response activity will best be used to mitigate the impact of risk”.  In other words, it is said that a comprehensive risk assessment of “all foreseeable risks” must be carried out <span style="text-decoration:underline">before</span> considering how those risks are to be addressed.  If that had been done, it is argued, in respect of the seven Claimant boroughs, certain vulnerable sections of the community would have been identified as being at higher risk than others elsewhere in London and more extensive and intensive provision would or should have been provided in relation to those “higher risk” sections of the community such that the response (or attendance) time to deal with a fire would be shortened.  By adopting an approach to the Plan predicated upon seeking to achieve uniform attendance time targets, it is argued that the Commissioner’s approach was “back to front”.   The Claimants submit that the proper approach is look at the risk first and then decide what the appropriate attendance times should be rather than adopting the attendance times as parameters before looking at the risk.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel10" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is argued that the adoption of the principle of equal entitlement results in a “one size fits all” approach which is not what the National Framework and the Guidance Notes contemplate and is, in any event, irrational:  a plan that does not take account of local risk factors cannot, it is contended, be one in which increasingly scarce resources can be said to be deployed rationally and proportionately.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel10" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I will turn to what might be termed the “high level” features of this argument in due course, but it is necessary, in the first instance, to set out why the Claimant boroughs say that their residents (or at least sections of their communities) are particularly adversely affected by the Plan.  The principal, though not exclusive, focus of each borough is upon the number of high-rise dwellings in their area and upon the proportionately greater number of elderly people than elsewhere in London.  Compared with the Outer London boroughs, it is said that they have far higher population densities, far higher levels of social deprivation, more social housing (much of it of a high-rise nature), more high profile buildings and concentrations of high-risk groups with certain “protected characteristics” (see the Equality Act 2010 at paragraphs 41-42 above) such as the disabled, young people living alone and older people living in social housing.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel10" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Claimants acknowledge that the principle of equal entitlement might be justifiable if Greater London were a broadly homogenous city, with little variation in terms of population and risk factors across its neighbourhoods, but assert that that is not so.  Drawing on the Commissioner’s Report, the draft Plan and the Supporting Documents, they highlight the facts that (i) London includes city, suburban and semi-rural areas, (ii) population density varies from 82,000 people per square kilometre in parts of Inner London to 100 people per square kilometre in parts of Outer London, (iii) approximately 50% of London’s population is concentrated in just 20% of its total area and (iv) nearly 40% of Greater London is classified as green open space.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel10" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Within that unevenly spread population there are groups with particular lifestyle characteristics who are assessed to be at greater risk than others and to whom LFEPA have ascribed “priority postcodes” (sometimes referred to as “P1s”).  The lifestyle characteristics include those fitting the description of young people renting flats in high-density social housing, elderly people reliant on state support, lower income workers in open terraces in often diverse areas and young, well-educated city dwellers.  The Claimants rely upon the fact that the majority of these postcodes are in Inner London and that in the Inner London boroughs priority postcodes make up around 56% of homes and account for 63% of dwelling fires and 71% of casualties whereas in Outer London boroughs, priority postcodes make up only 2% of homes and account for only 5% of dwelling fires and 5% of casualties.  The source of those statistics is Supporting Document 5 to the Plan and the Claimants, accordingly, contend that the Commissioner’s own documents show the highly variable risk profile across London, with high risk factors being heavily concentrated in the Inner London boroughs.  I will be returning to the question of priority postcodes and the Commissioner’s response to the kind of argument being advanced in due course (see paragraphs 184-185), but will continue for present purposes to outline the Claimants’ case.</p>

He says that in contrast to the national trend, the number of fire-related fatalities in Southwark has risen over the last 10 years even allowing for the Lakanal tragedy in July 2009 when 9 people died.  The numbers of fires, injuries, rescues and mobilisations in Southwark are all above the London average.  Southwark has a population density of 9988 residents per square kilometre and is the largest social landlord in London.  75% of the council housing stock consists of high rise flats or maisonettes (i.e. four floors or over) and he estimates that “at least 37% of dwelling fires in Southwark over the past 5 years were in high-rise buildings which required 3 appliances to arrive before the fire could be tackled.”  He also says (and I do not understand it to be disputed) that by reference to the ‘P1’ postcode assignment, Southwark houses “a far greater density of people at high risk from fire than outer London boroughs.”  He also foresees a significant increase in the number of elderly and disabled residents, and those with mental health problems, which is projected in the years to 2020.</p>

The number of primary fires has reduced more slowly in Tower Hamlets than across London as a whole over the previous six years (by 4.6% compared to 9.3% London-wide).  79% of all households in the borough are within purpose-built blocks of flats or tenements, the second-highest proportion nationally after the City of London.  It is estimated that at least 50% of these blocks are of six storeys or more and thus require attendance by a third appliance (see paragraph 260 below).  14% of primary fires in Tower Hamlets occur in high-rise buildings.

I cannot reproduce those tables in this judgment, but his comment is broadly justified although, as with all figures of this nature, there is considerable variation from year to year.  It is equally to be observed that there are other non-Claimant London boroughs where the annual levels in the respects he has highlighted are usually higher than the overall London average.

	    <p class="ParaLevel10" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Casting an eye down Appendix 6 would show that all the Claimant boroughs generally do see more dwelling fires per year than the average, although Islington usually appears to be relatively not far above the average when it is above average, although Southwark, Tower Hamlets, Lewisham and Hackney do always seem to be well above average.  It does, however, have to be observed that there are a good number of other boroughs that are not Claimants in these proceedings which regularly experience dwelling fires significantly, or at least materially, in excess of the annual London average.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel10" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Performing the same exercise in relation to the fatalities does, fortunately, record that the average annual fatality rate for all of London never exceeds 2 per borough and the average figure is usually 1 or 2 per borough.  There will obviously be the occasional tragedy such as Lakanal that will put a particularly high figure into the statistics for one year (as that particular tragedy did for Southwark in 2009/10), but the picture does broadly reveal that, for example, Southwark is usually (though not always) above average, as from time to time is Tower Hamlets, but there is a variation across all the Claimant boroughs as indeed there is across many of the other non-Claimant boroughs.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel10" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">One trend that even a layman can discern from these figures appears to be a general reduction in the number of dwelling fires in London over the 6-7 year period which is reflected in the reduction of the average figure from 215 in 2006/07 to 196 in 2012/13. I will have to return later to what the Commissioner says about the calls on the fire service (see paragraph 135), but the observation I have just made does chime with what he said in his witness statement that “[there] is a strong decreasing trend in relation to all types of incidents which demand a response from the [LFB] in London, including the number of dwelling fires.”</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel10" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In order to put the figures relating to dwelling fires (which, of course, represent a significant risk to life and limb) into context, the Commissioner in his witness statement draws attention to the comparative infrequency of dwelling fires as a source of “incident type” requiring the active intervention of the fire service.  Supporting Document 2 demonstrates that the 10 most common incident types in London, in <span style="text-decoration:underline">descending</span> order of frequency, are false alarms from automatic fire alarms (‘AFAs’), outdoor fires, false alarms from members of the public (made with good intent), releasing people from passenger lifts, gaining entry to people locked in or locked out, flooding, dwelling fires, road traffic accidents, other building fires and road vehicle fires.  The figures for 2009/10 to 2011/12 show that of these 10 most frequently attended incidents (accounting for about 90% of the incidents attended in those three periods) dwelling fires accounted for only 6% whereas, for example, AFAs accounted for 35%, outdoor fires 12% and good-intentioned false alarms from members of the public 11%.  It will be appreciated that the fire service will send differing numbers of appliances to an incident depending on the nature of the incident and the type of premises. Each type of incident has what is called the “pre-determined attendance” (“PDA”) which is the initial response to a 999-call.   The PDA for a dwelling fire is always two appliances. It can be higher for more complex situations.</p>

However, it seems to me to be somewhat unreal to take the “high level” argument at this stage and to endeavour to deal with it before at least examining the way in which the other criticisms are advanced.  Those criticisms, if justified, are said to underline and confirm the failure of the Commissioner to address the particular factors within each borough (of the nature identified above) that demand a different response to the provision of fire services in those boroughs from the provision to be provided elsewhere.  Dealing with the issues in this way will enable the rather bigger picture to be viewed than it would be if each individual component of the Claimants’ case was isolated and considered separately.</p>

The suggestion is that there is more to the whole period of response time than simply the “drive time”.  In the first place, there is the duration of the 999-call.  He submits that the extent to which significant sections of the local populations may not speak English (a factor likely to be linked to race) is left out of account and that it should be considered when assessing the risks in a community where significant parts of the population may not speak English or where English is their second language.  In the second place, there is the issue of high-rise buildings.</p>

Use of “drive time”, he contends, operates to understate the delay in commencing fire-fighting in the Claimant boroughs because each has a far higher concentration of high-rise and more large and complex buildings.  It follows, he submits, that when deciding which stations to close and appliances to decommission, the Commissioner has under-estimated the risks occasioned by fires in the Claimant boroughs.</p>

Mr Antony White QC and Ms Sarah Hannett,<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>for the FBU, who also referred to the DCLG publication, say that the measure of response time used by the Commissioner (a) masked differences in call time that can vary substantially (for example, if a caller’s first language is not English) and (b) makes comparison with other fire and rescue services more difficult (contrary to the requirement in the National Framework that “communities need to be able to access information in a way that enables them to compare the performance of their fire and rescue authority with others”).</p>

He contends that an “important feature of fire-fighting in London has been left wholly disregarded” and an essential relevant matter thus left out of account.  This was particularly so in relation to the Claimant boroughs because the attendance of a third appliance </span>is a disproportionately greater feature of operations than in London as a whole because of the higher concentration of high-rise buildings.  According to Mr Toy’s statement, he says that whilst it has not been easy to analyse the number of high-rise dwelling fires, “we estimate that at least 37% of dwelling fires in Southwark over the past 5 years were in high-rise buildings which required 3 appliances to arrive before the fire could be tackled: Southwark is second highest in absolute terms for high-rise fires and third highest in terms of the proportion of high-rise fires to total fires.”  In Tower Hamlets, according to Mr Halsey, 35% of all primary fires in buildings required a three appliance response, compared with the London average of 32% (excluding false alarms and other incidents).</p>

The modelled impact on average 3rd appliance response (+23 seconds London-wide) is greater than on both 1st appliance (+15 seconds) and 2nd appliance (+16 seconds) response times, as to be expected with 18 fewer pumping appliances. However, the 151/100 position does provide more equitable level of 3rd appliance coverage.

These must be viewed against the London-wide average increase of 23 seconds.  Simply for comparison purposes, it might be noted that Hillingdon, Lambeth, Waltham Forest and Westminster would also experience increases in the broad range of 50-55 seconds.  4 boroughs were shown by the model to have some reductions in time (only two, Barnet and Harrow, being reasonably substantial reductions), but overall most boroughs either stayed about the same or saw an increase of up to 30 seconds.  Mr White makes the point that those boroughs that will experience a decrease in third appliance response time as a result of the Plan are those which had few or no high rise fires in 2011/12 (see the document referred to in paragraph 153 below).  He cites Barnet as gaining a 20% improvement in third appliance response times, but having had only 2 fires at high rises in 2011/12 and Harrow as gaining a 43% improvement in third appliance response times, but having had no high rise fires in 2011/12.</p>

First, the ‘validation’ part of the process ensures that the model accurately reflects the operational responses of the LFB’s appliances in terms of response performance and appliance utilisation.  He describes the model as “an electronic representation of the [LFB]”. He also says that it “reflects the demand on the [LFB] at any particular time.” Second, the ‘optimisation’ part of the process seeks to identify the “best” options for allocating resources, where what is “best” is determined by the objectives and constraints that the LFB places on the model.  Third, the ‘simulation’ part of the modelling process helps to assess the workload and performance impact of any change in appliance and station deployment, taking account of appliance availability. At this stage, incidents are generated electronically at particular locations across London and vehicles are assigned to respond based on the LFB’s rules relating to crew skills, type of incident and so on, and the likely effects of different deployment scenarios, without having to test it in the real world.  This stage also assesses how any changes impact on attendance times to all incidents over a particular period and produces information about the attendance times both at London and borough levels.  Finally, the sensitivity analysis is designed to ensure that the solutions identified are robust and that factors which have not been input directly into the optimisation process are considered in the process. It takes account of the impact of any changes proposed in the optimisation stage in relation to particular factors (for example, attendance times to high-rise buildings, attendance times to areas of deprivation) to ensure that the outcome that has been proposed in the optimisation process is acceptable as against these factors.</p>

It has not been easy to reproduce in this judgment some of the pictorial representations of the locations of incidents in relation to the location of fire stations, but reference, for example, to the illustration at Appendix B5 to Supporting Document 11 (which can be found at http://www.london-fire.gov.uk/Documents/Sup11-Fire-service-modelling.pdf) demonstrates the location of existing fire stations in Greater London superimposed on the plan showing the distribution of the most serious incidents (i.e. non-false alarms receiving two or more appliances as a response) that occurred in the period from April 2007 to March 2012 (see paragraph 172 below) and the “cluster” to which the Commissioner refers can be identified clearly.

	    <p class="ParaLevel10" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Claimants’ suggestion that “local risk” has not been properly considered is refuted strongly by the Commissioner by reference to one fundamental feature of the modelling process.  I will record his own words and those of ORH about this below (see paragraphs 171-172), but in summary (and put very simply) what is said is that at the initial validation and optimisation stage of the process, the history of where the most serious incidents (as defined in paragraph 169 above) for the <span style="text-decoration:underline">previous five years</span> have occurred is fed into the modelling programme to inform the programme of where this aspect of the demand upon the LFB’s services is likely to emerge in the future.  Because the definition of a “serious incident” for this purpose involves not less than two appliances being sent out, because the PDA for a dwelling fire is always two appliances (see paragraph 135 above) and because excluded from the history are false alarms, what is thus fed into the programme is the history of the true demand for “real” fires that threaten life and limb.  The history will include all “real” fires in high-rise dwellings, whether in the Claimant boroughs or elsewhere in London. The Commissioner’s position is that this will almost certainly represent an accurate measure of the true demand and the modelling programme will thus “know” where the demand has to be met (and its intrinsic frequency) when it is asked to put forward various options in the light of other factors fed into the modelling exercise.  It follows, he asserts, that the true measure of “local risk” of any sort involving a dwelling fire, including those in high-rise buildings, has been reflected in the modelling process from the outset.  This is not, of course, the only factor injected into the modelling process, but it is the principal factor that the Claimants are suggesting was ignored totally.</p>

One of the ways in which this is achieved is through populating the model with historical data about incidents. There is a strong correlation between where we have attended incidents in the recent past and those we currently attend, so we know that the historical data is a very strong predictor of future demand on the service given the strong year-on-year correlation between incident locations. For the purposes of the optimisation process, the model is run against all serious incidents occurring over the last five years that are not false alarms (i.e. those incidents that receiving two or more appliances in attendance).  However, all incidents are considered when the model is simulating the outcomes that have been proposed during the optimisation stage in order to see the real effect of any changes on the [LFB]. This approach means that the options generated during the optimisation process are not influenced unduly by the number and location of automatic false alarms, however all incidents are considered when the simulation process is run to ensure that true impact of the proposals are measured. </p>

However, this … misunderstands the modelling process. The model considers the location of all serious incidents across London for the last five years. Given that serious incidents includes any incident to which two or more fire appliances have attended that is not a false alarm, the model will take account of any fires that have taken place in high-rise buildings, high profile buildings and heritage buildings across London over the last five years. Given the strong correlation between the locations of these incidents year on year, the modelling process optimises the location of resources in order to best respond to these serious incidents, including, for example, high-rise buildings, heritage buildings, or high profile buildings. To the extent that particular types of premises or particular groups of people generate demand for the [LFB] to attend to serious incidents, this is taken into account in the model through the risk nodes. This means that the method adopted by the [LFB] is grounded in evidence of the actual likelihood of serious incidents occurring in particular localities. The Claimants appear to be advocating an approach which looks at the theoretical likelihood of a fire occurring at a particular type of premises, for example high-rise buildings or high profile buildings.  However, the approach adopted by the [LFB] is to look at actual evidence as to the likely locations of serious incidents based on historical data and to plan by reference to this.”</p>

Incident weighted centroids were defined for each LSOA and nodes were therefore created at these locations; for the larger LSOAs (in terms of size and incident volumes), additional nodes were placed to improve the relationship between incident locations and nodes. This gave a total of 4,935 nodes across London including the station locations.</p>

As a result, there are now 6,697 nodes within London to which incidents can be assigned, an increase of 40% from the previous travel time matrix ….”</p>

This, he says in his witness statement, “involved consideration of the impact of the proposals on nine different areas of interest … those living at priority postcodes, the impact on accidental fires in the homes that were severe or significant, high-rise housing incidents, the impact on the top 10% of deprived lower super outputs areas, fatalities at fire, injuries at fire, rescues at fire, third appliance attendance times and heritage buildings<span style="font-style:italic">.</span>”  That stage comes after the stage at which the issue of response times is addressed in the modelling process, but I am endeavouring at present to focus on the issue of intrinsic local risk assessment and will return to the response time issue shortly (see paragraphs 202-204).

Whilst these factors had already been factored into the optimisation process indirectly by way of the 6,700 risk nodes representing the likelihood of fires in particular locations, the sensitivity analysis was a method to ensure that the direct impact on particular sectors of the population, particular areas or premises, and the consequences of the fire were not unacceptably worse under the proposals.

If I have understood the Claimants’ arguments correctly, these contentions, though related, are to be treated separately.  The emphasis of the argument at the level at which I am considering it appears to be that the Commissioner did not incorporate local risk factors (such as high rise buildings, demographics, local deprivation and so on) in the analysis and thus that these factors simply did not feed into the decision as to where the cuts in service should be made.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel10" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Moffett on several occasions challenged the Claimants on the basis that they had ignored a fundamental aspect of the modelling process, namely, that reliable predictions of where fires were likely to occur in future had been injected into that process from the outset and that those predictions descended to a very localised geographical framework because of the adoption of the nodes to which I have referred above.  Mr Stilitz rejected the charge, but I am bound to say, having reviewed the arguments for the purpose of preparing this judgment, it is difficult to find any meaningful response to the contention that local risk <span style="text-decoration:underline">was</span> taken into account in this way and, subject to the argument concerning the principle of equal entitlement, that it was an entirely effective, rational and fair way of doing so.  If and to the extent that the Guidance Note issued by the ODPM (see paragraphs 28 <span style="font-style:italic">et seq</span> above) remains of relevance, Mr Moffett suggests that this approach certainly meets the spirit, if not indeed the letter, of paragraph 3.3.4 of the Guidance Note and indeed also paragraph 3.4.4 of the same Note.  He submits that, subject to the argument about the principle of equal entitlement, the Commissioner was implementing the statutory framework or, more accurately, was affording the Mayor the basis, if he accepted the Commissioner’s recommendation, for complying with that framework.</p>

It did address in arguably the most meaningful way (namely, by reference to the detailed history of the previous 5 years) the local vulnerabilities to fire at a level at least commensurate with ward level (though in fact more particularised than that).  The National Framework and indeed the Guidance Notes are not prescriptive as to the means by which all foreseeable risks are identified – what is required is that they are addressed at a level of detail that enables proper planning of a response to the needs thus identified.

	</paragraph>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“… it is important to understand that the attendance standards are not a proxy for risk. This is important, because the Claimants’ case appears to proceed on the wholly mistaken assumption that it was the attendance standards which drove my deployment proposals, as an alternative to risk. This was not the case. The Brigade’s overall aim is to get to emergency incidents as quickly as possible anywhere in London. Performance against this objective is measured by reference to the attendance standards, which operate as key performance indicators. Whilst I accept that the speed of attendance is an important factor in mitigating the risk of casualties from fire, there is no clear dividing line in relation to the risk of casualties as between an attendance time of 5:59 and 6:01. Therefore, where the average attendance time for a particular borough exceeds the attendance standard, this does not mean that an unacceptable risk is therefore posed to people living and working in that borough. The same can be said in relation to individual wards within boroughs.  In setting the attendance standards at 6 minutes for the first appliance and 8 minutes for the second appliance, I acknowledge that some responses will be faster and some will be slower than those averages. It is inherent in the use of average attendance times that there will be some variability in performance either side of the average. In short, the attendance standards are principally used to measure performance on an ongoing basis, however they can also be used to feed into decisions in relation to reallocation of resources to ensure that proposals do not result in undesirable outcomes at borough level. One of the reasons for adopting the third attendance time measure in LSP3 (i.e. an appliance to arrive within 12 minutes in 95% of occasions) is to ensure that no incident has an exceptionally protracted attendance time.”</p>

Three constraints were also imposed on the optimisation process: (i) protecting particular stations from closure, (ii) maintaining a minimum of one fire station in each Borough, and (iii) station capacity (those stations that could take a second appliance). A further stage was to apply particular rules to the model, namely protecting performance at borough level by <span style="text-decoration:underline">ensuring that no borough that was currently outside of the attendance standards had poorer performance as a result of the reallocation of resources and any boroughs that were within the attendance standards did not move to outside the attendance standards</span>.

However, it is fair to say that none of those earlier plans involved cuts to front-line services and an interference with response times and that, accordingly, the context of the decision under review in the present case might be said to be different from the context of the decisions previously made.   Mr Moffett submitted that the context did not matter: the approach was either lawful or unlawful.  I am not sure that I can accept that proposition in quite the unequivocal terms in which it is advanced.  That no-one has mounted a challenge previously does not inexorably lead to the conclusion that what had been done previously was lawful when examined carefully.

Given the initial injection into the modelling process of the location of all serious fires over the previous 5 years (see paragraph 170-173 and 195 above), the modelling inevitably results in more substantial resources being allocated to inner London because serious incidents are more likely to occur in inner London:  the model will try to ensure that sufficient fire appliances are allocated to attend those areas however many serious fires are predicted to occur per day there, just as it will to ensure that sufficient fire appliances are allocated to attend those areas where a lesser number of serious fires are predicted to occur per day.  The principle of equal entitlement seeks to ensure that the fire appliances arrive within broadly the same periods irrespective of where the fire may be.</p>

The paragraph of his witness statement that I quoted in paragraph 207 above is similar to paragraph 69 of his witness statement that I quoted in paragraph 79 above.  He suggests that the Commissioner’s example given in his paragraph 69 “dodges the hard questions” and “means that a fit middle-aged person living in a semi-detached house in Croydon can expect the same attendance time as an elderly disabled person living at the top of a high-rise block in Camden.”  Mr Moffett submitted that it was difficult to understand the point being made here and, with respect to Mr Stilitz, I agree.  Mr Moffett emphasises that the Commissioner’s approach is to try to ensure that similar people in similar circumstances have the benefit of similar response times if a dwelling fire occurs and, in order to see whether the principle works, endeavours to compare like-with-like.  Mr Moffett’s riposte was telling: on the Commissioner’s approach, he argued, a disabled person in Camden benefits from the <span style="text-decoration:underline">same</span> response time as a fit person in Croydon, but if the argument advanced by Mr Stilitz is valid, a fit person in Camden would benefit from a <span style="text-decoration:underline">better</span> response time than a disabled person in Croydon.</p>

It would be that it is possible to conceive of almost any number of permutations of individual and collective circumstances throughout Greater London that could promote a discussion, possibly a lively one, about what is a “fair” or “the safest overall” arrangement for the emergency fire services.   There will be “hard questions” to address from almost any angle.  At the end of the day, someone or some body has to make a judgment about how best to allocate limited resources.  Similar considerations will arise in any other fire service authority area in the country, whether in rural or urban communities.  Judgments have to be made.

In 2002, following certain legislative changes, the local authority changed its housing allocation scheme from a “needs based” points system to a “choice based” system under which all those with priority need, save for a limited number of exceptional cases who were made a direct offer of an appropriate property, were classified in one group and entitled to bid for any available housing which matched their assessed needs. The house was then allocated to the bidder who had been on the housing list for the longest time. The scheme also allowed existing local authority tenants who wished to transfer to a different, but equivalent, property within the area to bid on equal terms with priority needs applicants, but provided that a maximum of 5% of available properties could be allocated to such bidders in any one year.  The legislative changes (to be found in section 167(2) of the Housing Act 1996) required a local authority to have a scheme for allocating social housing which gave reasonable preference to those with urgent housing needs.</p>

It would be impossible, in my opinion, to challenge the rationality of including waiting time as one of the factors properly to be taken into account by a housing authority when deciding to whom an available dwelling should be allocated. But why should waiting time be the determinative factor? Why should apparently greater needs of one person in the priority band be subordinated to apparently lesser needs of another person in the band simply because the latter had been longer on the waiting list? This was the question that [Counsel for the Claimant’s] submission posed for your Lordships. The question is, I think, best answered by posing a further question. What is the alternative? The formulation of sub-bands within the <a href="http://login.westlaw.co.uk/maf/wluk/app/document?src=doc&amp;linktype=ref&amp;context=72&amp;crumb-action=replace&amp;docguid=IA1A81130E44A11DA8D70A0E70A78ED65">…</a> priority band, with the sub-bands being placed in order of priority, has been suggested as a preferable alternative.

To allow the choice to depend upon the judgment of a council official, or a committee of officials, no matter how experienced and well trained he, she or they might be, would lack transparency and be likely to lead to a plethora of costly litigation based on allegations of favouritism or discrimination. The waiting time criterion constitutes a basis of selection that has the merit of certainty, the absence of any subjective evaluation and that, therefore, avoids these drawbacks.”</p>

The earlier decisions in the High Court and Court of Appeal … concluded that a policy was irrational if it did not contain “a mechanism for identifying those with the greatest need and ensuring that so far as possible and subject to reasonable countervailing factors (for example, past failure to pay rent etc) they are given priority” …. There are numerous problems with that approach. … The trouble is that any judicial decision, based as it is bound to be on the facts of the particular case, that greater weight should be given to one factor, or to a particular accumulation of factors, means that lesser weight will have to be given to other factors. The court is in no position to rewrite the whole policy and to weigh the claims of the multitude who are not before the court against the claims of the few who are. Furthermore, relative needs may change over time, so that if the council were really to be assessing the relative needs of individual households, it would have to hold regular reviews of every household on the waiting list in order to identify those in greatest need as vacancies arose. No one is suggesting that this sort of refinement is required. It would be different, of course, if the most deserving households had a right to be housed, but that is not the law.”</p>

Its adoption came nowhere near, he submits, the test articulated by Lord Diplock as the basis upon which a court might intervene.

He recognises the legitimacy of the former as one approach, but believes the latter to be more appropriate.  The Claimants contend that the former is the only approach in the present context.  It is at this point that I cannot agree.   I would agree that, if its adoption had the effect of causing all local risk factors to be ignored or so devalued in the process as to have no meaningful impact, there would certainly be grounds for concern that the National Framework had not been properly reflected in the process and indeed that a rational approach was not being followed.  However, for the reasons I have given (see paragraphs 194-196 above), I have not been persuaded that that is indeed the effect of its adoption.  As I have previously indicated (see paragraphs 204-205), the <span style="text-decoration:underline">actual</span> influence of the principle on the Plan is less potent than the Claimants contend.  Whether the Commissioner’s approach to its influence at the stage in the process at which it was considered is right or wrong is not for me; but I cannot see how its influence can fairly be described as irrational.

	    <p class="ParaLevel10" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I have approached the foregoing issue on the basis of what I have characterised previously as “standard” scrutiny.  Although the provision of fire services may arguably have an impact on some unspecified person’s Article 2 rights in the event that he or she is awaiting the arrival of a fire appliance to extinguish a fire that is constituting a threat to life, that circumstance is very far removed from the situation in <span style="font-style:italic">Rogers</span> (paragraph 72 above) where the decision of the Health Trust to refuse funding for the treatment of the claimant’s breast cancer was a relatively immediate matter of life and death for her.  At that level, one can well see the need for anxious or rigorous scrutiny.  The situation here, however, reflects a very much more distant and intangible threat to life and comprises essentially a review of the process by which the limited resources for the many facets of the work of the LFB are deployed.   Adoption of heightened scrutiny in this context could call for its adoption in other contexts where it could be said that taking one decision rather than another might involve some increased danger.    Whilst any court would subject the influence of the principle of equal entitlement (as indeed all other aspects of the challenges advanced in this case) to careful scrutiny, I do not consider it necessary to go further than the standard <span style="font-style:italic">Wednesbury</span> approach.

Asking the programme to generate a plan or plans minimising all attendance times across London by reference to that information constituted a response to the need to generate a proposal designed to meet those risks.  Judging the proposal that emerged by reference to the attendance time targets was <span style="text-decoration:underline">one</span> (rational) approach to considering whether the plan is acceptable as a means of providing an emergency fire service for the whole of London.

It formed an attachment to the Commissioner’s final report.  Mr Stilitz complains that the exercise was a very limited exercise and says that this is evidenced by the cursory way, as he suggested it to have been, that third appliance attendance times were dealt with.  I will, of course, be looking at that discrete issue shortly (see paragraphs 259-263), but it seems to me that the true criticism here is that there appears to have been no active engagement with the consequences for the Plan in the specific areas to which reference was made by those considering the sensitivity analysis.

It is, of course, always easy to criticise a particular style, but had there been the odd sentence saying, for example, something along the lines that “these consequences are regrettable but, in our judgment, acceptable in the light of the need to make the level of savings required” would at least have given greater confidence that the consequences <span style="text-decoration:underline">had</span> been addressed and that there was a reason why they were adjudged acceptable.</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“… It is important to understand what is meant by “risk”. The Brigade understands the term “risk” in two ways. Firstly, the likelihood of an incident occurring and, secondly, the consequences that arise when an incident does occur. The reason why it is important to distinguish between “risk” in the sense of the likelihood of an incident occurring, and “risk” in the sense of the consequences of an incident should it occur is because, in general terms, different activities of the Brigade are directed at these different types of “risk”. For example, the Brigade’s fire prevention and protection activities are primarily directed at minimising the former, whereas its emergency response activities are primarily directed at minimising the latter on a pan-London basis …. That is not to say that a certain type of risk is irrelevant when it comes to determining how the Brigade plans and provides for its activities (and I explain further below how the likelihood of an incident occurring is a very important factor when determining the organisation of emergency response resources). However, it is important to recognise that the organisation of emergency response resources in a particular area is not something that has any real influence on the likelihood of an incident occurring in that area …. As I explain below, a holistic approach to prevention, protection and emergency response is a key part of LSP5.”</p>

For example, LSP5 promotes a number of activities to further fire prevention and fire protection, including campaigning for the installation of domestic sprinklers, enforcing safety regulations, influencing the planning process to ensure the built environment is more resilient against fire, and educating people to change their behaviours to reduce the likelihood of fire. This complements our emergency response work and together provides our integrated risk management approach as reflected in LSP5.”</p>

However, this is not the measure used to determine the lifestyle group(s) most at risk.  The differences in proportions between each Mosaic Group and the number of fires and casualties within them can be converted to an index score which highlights where particular groups are over- or under-represented and a chart of the index scores, both for the likelihood of an incident occurring and the chance of that incident causing a casualty (death or injury), is produced to identify the lifestyle groups most at risk.</p>

Priority postcodes areas are situated in all London boroughs, although there are more priority postcode areas in the inner London boroughs, including in the Claimant boroughs. This means that our fire prevention work in these areas is more directly focussed on the inner London boroughs, and in the claimant boroughs. For example, in 2011/12, the Brigade was able to target more than 47,000 high risk households for HFSVs and the majority of these were in inner London boroughs. We continue to undertake visits to priority postcode households on a regular basis. In 2013/14 (despite the reduction of resources from the closure of some fire stations and removal of some fire engines) we aim to conduct 72,500 HFSVs, of which 58,000 will be visits to priority postcodes - an increase on the previous year 2012/13. Many of our prevention priorities, including those involving priority postcodes, are more effectively delivered by working with services that are currently located at borough level (for example, social services, planning/building control, housing providers). Furthermore, in many cases additional funding for prevention work is available for and controlled by local councils (e.g. local strategic partnerships).”</p>

It is anticipated that by 2030 the number of fires and overall incidents will have decreased further, in particular the number of fires is estimated to decrease by 23% between 2010 and 2030. I understand that representatives of the London Boroughs of Islington and Southwark express the view that the downward trend in incidents and fire deaths is not expected to continue, however I do not believe that this view is supported by empirical data or evidence.

He says that “[all] other metropolitan brigades count their attendance time from the same point.”   Although he asserts this, he does say (and the documentation supporting the draft Plan confirmed) that that “the calculation methodology used in LSP5 … had been used by the Brigade since 2008”, rather suggesting that it was a relatively recent innovation.  I should also say that I have noted the content of the report of Mr Deon Webber, a Senior Investigator at International Fire Investigators and Consultants Limited, filed in support of the Claimants’ claim, which says that the DCLG’s definition (see paragraph 143 above) “forms the basis of most risk management, and is widely accepted by the UK FRS as the norm.”   The status of this report was put in issue by Mr Moffett although the matter was not considered during the hearing and little, if any, reference was made to it by Mr Stilitz.</p>

Furthermore, it is the one period of time in the overall period from the commencement of a fire until the beginning of active steps to extinguish it (or indeed its extinction) over which the fire authority has a degree of control (subject, of course, to traffic conditions and unexpected interruptions in getting to the fire).

If he was suggesting that one can conclude from the figures to which I have referred that there are less deaths the longer one waits for the fire brigade, then that is, with respect, obviously wrong.

Neither, of course, were the first and second appliance attendance times if my analysis of the evidence and argument concerning that issue is correct (see paragraph 204-205 above).  It was at the “simulation stage” of the modelling process that the first and second appliance target times were used to assess the Plan that the model had produced.  What is also not in issue is that third appliance times were <span style="text-decoration:underline">not</span> used at that stage to assess the impact of the proposed Plan.  The reasons for that, according to the Commissioner, are that third appliance attendance is relatively unusual, the vast majority of incidents being resolved by the attendance of one or two fire engines.  He develops this point, in relation to the modelling, in the following way:</p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“… The average number of appliances sent to any incident in London is 1.6. In terms of incident type, the highest number of appliances attending an incident is an average of 2.1, namely for primary fires, with all other types of incident being sent on average less than 2 appliances. Further, there are currently no attendance standards associated with third appliance attendance times.  The combination of the very low number of serious incidents attended by a third appliance and the absence of a standard means that modelling the impact on third appliance response performance is not as straightforward as the other LSP5 work in modelling terms. Further, third appliances may often not be immediately mobilised but may be sent later, for example if it becomes apparent that two appliances are unlikely to be sufficient to deal with the incident. Similarly, on some occasions a third (or even fourth or fifth appliance) will be sent as part of a PDA for particular buildings and a third appliance is not, at a given incident, actually required. The relatively low number of incidents, coupled with the variety of factors that influence the mobilisation of a third appliance means that it is more difficult to model. It is important to recognise that irrespective of the complexities of modelling the data in this area, my view is that only a limited amount of insight or understanding about the Brigade’s response is brought about by information based on the attendance of a third appliance at a small number of incidents.”</p>

The basis, of course, of the suggestion that third appliance times should be taken into account in the process is that they would inform the modelling process of how serious incidents that may demand the arrival of three appliances should be accommodated in the modelled plan.  There is an issue between the Commissioner and the FBU (which I am not in a position to resolve) about what precisely can be achieved in relation to a serious fire before a third appliance arrives, but the Commissioner does make it clear that, from his perspective, it is <span style="text-decoration:underline">not</span> necessary for a <span style="text-decoration:underline">minimum</span> of thirteen fire fighters to be present at the scene of a serious accident <span style="text-decoration:underline">before</span> actual fire fighting can commence and, accordingly, it is not necessary to await the arrival of the third appliance before active steps to extinguish the fire can be taken.  </p>

Some of these, he observes, rank amongst the best attendance times in the whole of London.  Indeed reference to the table produced at Appendix A to Supporting Document 24 does show that Southwark and Tower Hamlets (as boroughs) have the fastest third appliance response times in London after a plan based on 151/100 is implemented.</p>

Can that decision or judgment be characterised as irrational?  There is certainly an argument that, if the information was available in reliable form, it <span style="text-decoration:underline">could</span> have been directly influential in the modelling process.

The Brigade’s estate has a number of complexities that need to be taken into account, including that many of the stations are either of some age, or Grade II listed buildings or located in a conservation area which restrict the ability to develop and modernise the stations to ensure they meet modern operational needs. Some stations have received substantial levels of recent investment and have been recently upgraded, including a number in central London. I did not think that it was reasonable or responsible for the Brigade to consider closure of those fire stations which had benefited from significant additional investment for particular purposes. In my view, it would be unreasonable, for example,  to close a fire station which had just undergone a £10 million investment in order to refurbish it for a special purpose, namely to accommodate particular vehicles. Such a closure would amount to a considerable waste of public money. </p>

Similarly, some stations are in a government funded PFI programme and I thought it was appropriate that these stations be retained as they represent a good opportunity to secure better quality accommodation that is more flexible and fit for purpose which confers an overall benefit in terms of fire-fighting in London. Other stations had particular features which meant that it was not sensible to close them, for example, some stations provide space for resources that are difficult to locate such as the Bulk Foam Unit or specialist protective equipment. Taking into account these factors, I concluded that 28 stations in London should be protected from closure by any changes to the allocation of resources. However, I kept open the possibility that these stations could be subject to a change in the number of appliances accommodated, for example, a station that was protected from closure could be reduced from a two appliance station to a one appliance station (or vice versa).”</p>

If at no other point, then certainly at this point, it would be open to a fire authority to consider its estate and decide whether closing a particular fire station was a “cost effective” way of dealing with matters in the light of the results of the risk assessment.  There is nothing in the National Framework which says that cost factors may not, in certain circumstances, outweigh the risk factors. However, I can see no sustainable objection to taking a view at the outset of the modelling process that closing certain stations upon which there has been considerable recent expenditure, or where there are obvious benefits from retention within the estate, would be unlawful, unreasonable or irrational.</p>

The charges levelled by Mr Stilitz at the whole consultation process included that it failed to disclose “the most controversial and unpalatable implications of the cuts”, that aspects of the ways certain information was conveyed was “misleading”, that “statistical slight of hand” was employed, that certain calculations were “doctored” and generally that the whole process was an exercise in “spin”.   All this, he submits, demonstrates that the need for an “effective consultation”, as demanded by the National Framework (see paragraph 39 above), was not satisfied in this case.  He suggests that the process of under-playing the bad news started with the Commissioner’s Foreword to the draft Plan and was evident in the leaflet inviting the public to attend the various public meetings.  Mr White also submitted that inadequate and/or misleading information was provided in the consultation exercise and added that no consultation took place on the decision made after the consultation process closed to reduce the crewing levels on FRUs and to reduce the overall number of FRUs (see paragraph 60 above).</p>

I think that most people who saw and considered objectively the original version of the calculation would say that, whilst no additional death - even over a three-year period - would be acceptable, the figures are so close that there is no material difference between them, and accordingly, it would be wrong to conclude that there would inevitably be more fatalities arising from fire with the introduction of the proposal then being considered.  It is possible that the person who decided to present the shortened version of the calculations in the letter to Councillor Rowley thought much along these lines and felt that presenting the issue in that way was the best way of not raising unwarranted concern.  However, unfortunately, having chosen that course the not wholly unexpected suspicion that some other agenda was being addressed has arisen.</p>

So far as I am aware, no further calculation was carried out in this regard in relation to the 155/102 proposal that finally found favour.  Given that two further fire stations and four further appliances were to be retained, it is possible that the differential between the pre- and post-plan situation so far as the fatality rate was concerned might have varied very slightly from the earlier calculation so that the statistical increase was even less than shown by the calculation to which I have referred.  However, that is speculative although the Commissioner’s letter to the Mayor dated 31 July (see paragraph 382 below) does contain a sentence which conveys that message.  The question is whether this particular feature in the consultation process, whether of itself or as part of a bigger picture, renders that process invalid.</p>

For my part, looking at the matter as objectively as one can, I cannot see how the revelation of the full calculation would or could have made any difference at all to the outcome and I am unable to conclude that, certainly taken in isolation, the failure to reveal the full calculation led to a flawed consultation.

Nonetheless, the issue still remains as to whether this information ought to have been revealed at the outset of the consultation process.</p>

Mr Stilitz suggests that this shows that average response times increase significantly in Camden and that the Outer Boroughs have not been affected significantly.

That was itself a reasonable decision to take although I do not consider that that would have absolved the Commissioner from responding to a reasonable request for details of the impact of the proposals at a more localised level during the consultation process, which indeed is what he did. There was sufficient time thereafter for representations to be made about the impacts by those who had interested themselves in the process.

Information concerning these attendance times was supplied when the issue was raised and I have drawn attention to the way it was supplied (see paragraphs 149-152 above).

One point of significance is that, whilst 3rd appliance attendance times were not used to assess the draft Plan to emerge from the modelling process (indeed “there are currently no attendance standards associated with third appliance attendance times”, according to the Commissioner’s evidence), it is quite plain that all fires that had demanded the attendance of a third fire engine in the previous 5 years (which meant that all high-rise building fires were assigned appropriately to one of the 6700 nodes) <span style="text-decoration:underline">had</span> been fed into the modelling process at the outset.</p>

In that context the argument was that if there was in any particular locality a preponderance of high-rise buildings, resources should be deployed in a way that ensured a speedier response time for first and second appliances in those areas than for areas where there are fewer high-rise buildings, rather than to look to ensure that the area more sparsely populated with high-rise buildings should not receive a slower service than the average London-wide response times.   Again, I will not repeat my analysis of that argument.  However, as it seems to me, all that this issue would do would be to offer another dimension to that argument.</p>

The view of the Commissioner was that “the very low number of serious incidents attended by a third appliance” meant that modelling of the impact of third appliance attendance would not advance the process in any meaningful way.

The leaflet (see paragraph 284 above) contains two substantive sentences, one of which speaks of the need to make cuts of over £28 million and the second of which indicates that this will involve the closure of 12 fire stations and a substantial reduction in the number of fire-fighters. For my part, I cannot see how it can be said that this would encourage the view, as Mr Stilitz suggested, that there was nothing to worry about.</p>

In the light of the actual response to the consultation process, it is unrealistic to suggest that anyone was misled by the documents into thinking that everything would be the same.

Equally, none of the consultation documents referred to a reduction in the minimum number of crew on FRUs.  Indeed the draft Plan stated that “we have no plans to change the current normal or minimum number of crew on our regular fire engines or on most other appliances.” Accordingly, there was no consultation on either of these proposals, neither of which, he submits, were foreseeable from the draft Plan.  He contends that they amounted to fundamental changes to the proposals “of a kind that it was conspicuously unfair to adopt the proposals without giving the FBU and other consultees an opportunity to make representations.”  An assessment of the safety implications of a reduction in crew numbers of FRUs was not undertaken prior to the recommendation in the report of 18 July and there was no consultation on the consequences for public and fire-fighter safety of the reduction in the number of FRUs or whether the two specific FRUs chosen for disbandment were the appropriate choices.</p>

Taking all of this into account, I tasked officers to go back and do what some people asked us to do (particularly those Council Leaders who said that they believed that there were savings to be made elsewhere, with more effort from officers), which is to try and find savings which do not affect front line pumping appliances. It has not been my first choice to do this and my draft proposals reflect my belief that it is possible to safely make operational reductions from the pumping appliance fleet. However, I do not want to ignore what I have heard during the consultation and so I have gone back and looked again at the operational fleet as a whole. </p>

The action already taken to introduce more widespread use of alternate crewing, together with the proposals in the draft plan, have consumed the available opportunities for a significant saving that does not reduce the number of front line vehicles. The aerial fleet has been protected in recent years, despite low levels of utilisation, but my sense is that these appliances have the same characteristics as pumping appliances in terms of their perceived value. Consequently, I now propose to make savings by reducing the spend on Fire Rescue Unit (FRU) resources.”</p>

In these incidents two FRUs are mobilised and therefore it would be possible to contemplate a reduction in crewing levels from a minimum of 5 to a minimum of 4. This proposal would save £3.6m and in my view will have no detrimental impact on capabilities. Further, in light of the low level of utilisation of FRUs (namely 4%) I considered that the fleet could be reduced by two units, namely those at Millwall and Hornchurch, the reasons for these locations being identified in my report to the Authority … resulting in a further saving of £2.2m.”</p>

Those most directly affected by the fresh proposals would be the members of the FBU who operate FRUs and also those boroughs in which the FRUs that are to be decommissioned are currently to be found. The FBU did take advantage of the period from 10 July to 18 July to make some representations about what was proposed in the final report, but no suggestion was made that there should be a re-consultation on this issue. Instead certain representations were made about the proposal in the sense that the observation was made that no suitable risk assessment had been carried out. Furthermore, whilst Millwall is in the borough of Tower Hamlets, Tower Hamlets has made no submissions about this particular matter. Hornchurch is in the borough of Havering, but no representations have been made by that borough. In those circumstances, the natural inference to be drawn is that the issue is not seen generally to be as fundamental as is now being sought to be suggested.</p>

In terms of impacts on users of the service, it is difficult to quantify the exact effect on people who share protected characteristics.

This is because information about incidents collected by the Brigade indicates that the behaviour and lifestyles of individuals remains one of the primary factors in the number of fires that LFB attends. Whilst it is true that certain lifestyles identified as being at higher risk will also contain people who share protected characteristics, belonging to a protected characteristic group in the first place does not place individuals at risk.”</p>

Some boroughs would have improved attendance, others would remain the same, and some would get worse.

He says that it contains no analysis at all.  Moving to the paragraph quoted in paragraph 356 above, he and Mr White invite condemnation of the approach that appears there.  Mr White’s essential criticism is articulated in paragraph 349 above.  Mr Stilitz says that the formula used in this paragraph is the means by which the Commissioner tries to “duck” the issue of the impact of the proposals on people with shared protected characteristics.  The means adopted to achieve this, he submits, is for the Commissioner to say that <span style="text-decoration:underline">lifestyle</span> is a better indicator of risk than possession of a particular protected characteristic and that since having a particular protective characteristic does not necessarily marry up with lifestyle, protected characteristics can be ignored.   </p>

He also criticises the implicit assumption in this paragraph that there will be no indirect discrimination against persons having certain protected characteristics, “even though it is entirely plausible that there would be such an effect”.  He cites as examples young single adults in social housing who share the characteristic of being young or of older residents in social housing who share the protected characteristic of being old.  Mr White joins by saying that the EIA failed to identify where in London persons with particular protected characteristics were concentrated and, in particular, did not examine whether persons with particular protected characteristics were concentrated in specific wards.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel10" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Moffett (supported where relevant by Mr Drabble) rejects these criticisms.  He submits that reading the equality analysis as a whole demonstrates (a) the Commissioner was aware of the need to have due regard to the Act and (b) did so “in substance” which is all that the law requires.  Both Mr Moffett and Mr Drabble take head-on the criticism that focusing on lifestyle characteristics in some way avoids addressing protected characteristics and reject it.  I will refine the argument a little further below, but in essence it is that focusing on lifestyle characteristics where relevant means that those assessed as most vulnerable to fire, including any with protected characteristics, are targeted for the deployment of resources.  Mr Moffett particularly draws attention to the fact that the paragraph quoted in paragraph 355 above was <span style="text-decoration:underline">not</span> concerned with attendance times, but with “prevention and protection work” which is not affected by the closure of fire stations.  All that this part of the equality analysis is saying is that the resources in connection with prevention and protection will continue to be focused on those with those lifestyle characteristics assessed as most likely to cause them to be victims of fire.  Mr Drabble adds that focusing resources in this way will have the inevitable effect of benefiting those with protected characteristics who are at risk from fire and that there is nothing wrong with this approach.  As Mr Moffett put it, the impact on those with protected characteristics will, because of their lifestyle, be targeted specifically.</p>

Mr Moffett contends that this pool, as well as the pool with lifestyle characteristics that makes them vulnerable to the risk of suffering a fire, is the pool by which to judge whether there is indirect discrimination within the Act.  He draws on the approach in <span style="font-style:italic">Bailey</span> for this purpose.  There the question was whether the appropriate pool for analysis was the whole population of the Borough of Brent or the more limited pool of library users in the borough.  The Court of Appeal held that it was correct to choose the more limited pool for this purpose.  The matter was addressed in this way by Pill LJ, drawing upon what was said by the House of Lords in <span style="font-style:italic">Secretary of State for Trade and Industry v Rutherford</span>:</p>

If the choice of pool was simply a matter of discretion for the decision-maker then, subject to a potential public law challenge, it would seem to me that the Commissioner’s approach was well within his discretion and there would be no basis for judicial review.  However, it does seem to me that there is a compelling logic to doing so in any event for the reasons summarised in <span style="font-style:italic">Bailey</span>.  Whilst any member of the whole population of London <span style="text-decoration:underline">could</span> be affected by a fire, there are certain sections of the population that are <span style="text-decoration:underline">more likely</span> to suffer a fire and the effect upon them as future users of the fire service is the correct area in which to address the question of whether there would be indirect discrimination within the Act.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel10" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It also seems to me to be a legitimate view that identifying these sections of the population is a more focused and proportionate way of carrying out the necessary evaluation under the Act than simply to assume that, for example, the elderly, the young or the disabled are more vulnerable to the risk of a fire.  Mr Moffett makes the strong point that merely belonging to one of those categories does not increase the risk that someone within that category will experience a fire.  He recognises, of course, that someone with a particular protected characteristic (e.g., old age) may be affected more seriously if they do experience a fire, but that to target resources by reference simply to the number of elderly people in a locality, without regard to whether they are within a group likely to be at risk from fire, is not an approach dictated by having due regard to the Act.</p>

Councils cannot be expected to speculate on or to investigate or to explore such matters ad infinitum; nor can they be expected to apply, indeed they are to be discouraged from applying, the degree of forensic analysis for the purpose of an EIA and of consideration of their duties under s.149 which a QC might deploy in court.

It does seem to me that focusing at a borough level on those most likely to experience fire was a legitimate means of considering, amongst others, those with protected characteristics and that approaching it as the Claimants and the FBU suggest would almost amount to starting with a blank piece of paper and subjecting the whole of London to a very detailed analysis reflected in the examples given by Mr White.  It is the kind of analysis that Haddon-Cave J may have had in mind in <span style="font-style:italic">R (Branwood) v Rochdale MBC </span>[2013] EWHC 1024 (Admin) when he said (at [60]) that it was “not the law that public authorities must … collect, analyse and record each scrap of data with regard to every single protected group and then analyse each such group <span style="font-style:italic">seriatim</span> against every limb of section 149 looking at endless permutations and combinations.” He said that a “sense of proportionality and reality is required.” I respectfully agree.</p>

If the combined effect of the Mayor’s decision and the Commissioner’s recommendation is that there was a breach of section 149, LFEPA’s decision would also be invalid.  But if the Mayor’s decision did not breach the Act, I would not consider that LFEPA was, in the circumstances of this case, under any independent duty to conduct a section 149 analysis.  Given its legal responsibility to obey the direction of the Mayor, its primary duty was to take that course.  If it had conducted its own analysis and had reached a different view from that of the Mayor, a rather difficult situation would have been reached about which, happily, I need express no view.  However, that was not the position and, in my judgment, in the events that happened, LFEPA had no option but to comply with the direction and it cannot be in breach of its duty under section 149 by not conducting its own analysis.</p>

The methodology predicts that even the original draft proposals would not have resulted in a higher number of fire deaths.

Mr Drabble says that in his report of 21 January the Commissioner stated that he did “not believe that the level of reductions posed in this report will have a significant detrimental impact of the safety of Londoners.”  Perhaps more relevant, because it represents his final publicly expressed word on the issue before the Mayor considered the position, is the Foreword to the final report.

By seeking to make good that assertion they wish to suggest that the Mayor must have misdirected himself as to the effect of the Plan and, accordingly, overlooked a material consideration when deciding to issue his direction on 2 August.

As a starting proposition, it is obvious that longer attendance times <span style="text-decoration:underline">could</span> (not necessarily would, but could) increase the risk of serious injury or death and, whilst not having said so expressly in the Foreword, that must be the natural inference to be drawn from it unless a redeployment of existing resources can be managed in such a way as to minimise those potential adverse consequences.  However, another side of the message being conveyed in the Foreword (and indeed the other side of the coin on this particular point) is that the continued “proactive preventive work” over the three year period of the Plan would reduce the incidence of fires, mostly those in dwellings.  Both those messages were conveyed in the Commissioner’s letter to the Mayor of 31 July, but the Commissioner chose to focus on the fatality rate as an indicator of whether the proposals were “appropriate for keeping Londoners safe from fire”.</p>

As I have said, it could only be if it could be demonstrated that the Mayor displayed a fundamental misunderstanding of the implications of the Plan that it would be open to the court to consider declaring the direction of 2 August invalid.

Nothing in [the Plan] will impact the ability of the Brigade to evacuate people from premises as crewing levels of pumping appliances will not be changed.”</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel10" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">A layman will have no difficulty with the intuitive feeling that “every second counts” when it comes to fighting a fire which threatens life and limb.  Indeed it must be so: it is why we see fire-engines racing through the streets, why all drivers make way for them and why the statistics, whether for London or elsewhere, are focused on the time taken to get to an incident.  What is known to everyone also, of course, is that no matter how efficient and well-funded a fire service may be and no matter how well-trained, well-intentioned, fit and committed its fire-fighters are, it will never be able to guarantee that no-one will die or be injured as a result of fire.  The present front-line emergency response system in London cannot prevent in the region of 50 deaths per year as a result of fire.  It is equally obvious to any well-informed layman that cuts to the existing front-line services in London which will increase response times to serious incidents are bound to increase at least the statistical likelihood that deaths or serious injuries will continue to occur at the same, or possibly a greater, rate <span style="text-decoration:underline">unless there is some unused capacity in the existing system </span>that, redeployed, can redress the situation and/or there is <span style="text-decoration:underline">some countervailing reduction in the incidence of serious fires</span>, particularly those in dwellings.  Any pretence to the contrary would be regarded by most people as untenable.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel10" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There is no doubt, on the evidence put before the court, that there has been a decreasing incidence of dwelling fires, both countrywide and in London, over the years and there is some evidence that that decline is continuing in the seven Claimant boroughs although, equally, some doubts are expressed about it.  The LFB has a programme that exists to try to educate people about how to avoid creating fires.  Whilst the expression may be a little old-fashioned, there can be little quarrel in this context with the adage that ‘prevention is better than cure’.  Fire-fighting will only be necessary if there is a fire to fight.  The National Framework makes clear that this is an important and integral component in any fire service authority plan.  In his letter to the Mayor of 31 July (see paragraph 381 above), the Commissioner refers to the focus to be placed on that during the currency of the Plan.  He also says in the same letter “that the evidence shows that there is sufficient capacity to continue to provide an excellent response across London”, that response being (according to the evidence before me) directed to the areas of London most likely to experience a serious fire (based upon the experience of the previous 5 years).  The response is judged against the attendance standards to which much reference has been made in this case although not, on the evidence, dictated as such by those standards.</p>

There are obviously very strongly held views that the proposals are seriously misguided and the FBU has characterised the Plan as “the most reckless integrated management plan ever put forward by any fire and rescue authority in the country.”  It is wholly outside the province of the court to determine whether there is any validity in an assertion of that nature and it does not arise for consideration.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel10" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">One factor was emphasised by Mr Moffett to which I have made little reference so far, but it is an important point and it emerges in most, if not all, cases where a court is asked to intervene in a process where there are limited resources to meet certain established objectives.  There have been a good number of such cases over the last few years.  It is a factor of which it is sometimes necessary to remind those who consider that the court can put right what they consider to be wrong in a decision of this nature.  Simply expressed, it is that the court cannot make the choices involved because (a) constitutionally it is not for the court to do so and (b) in most such cases (and certainly the present case) the court does not have every party affected by the decision before it.  In this case I have received what may well be very genuine and well-founded concerns about the effect of the proposals in seven boroughs.  I have not heard from the other 26 and it does not require much imagination to appreciate that, if the Plan was quashed and re-considered in a way that addressed the concerns of the seven boroughs, other boroughs may then emerge to say that the interests of their residents have been overlooked or not given sufficient weight in the new dispensation.  I have, from time to time in the judgment, noted the impact of attendance times on other boroughs not before the court simply to remind myself that there could be another side to the argument.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel10" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Moffett reduced the factor to which I am referring to the pithy description that the process involved here is a “zero sum game”, which for this purpose simply means that, given the finite pot of resources for meeting the fire services budget in London, a gain in expenditure achieved in one area will result in a loss somewhere else.  The court has never engaged in determining how a finite pot is to be distributed between competing demands.  Baroness Hale of Richmond touched on this in the case of <span style="font-style:italic">Ahmad</span> to which I referred above (see paragraph 219).  There are many examples in the cases, but an authoritative reminder of the principle appears in the speech of Lord Slynn of Hadley in <span style="font-style:italic">R v Chief Constable of Sussex, ex p International Trader’s Ferry Ltd</span> [1999] 2 AC 418, at 430:</p>

In the former the Master of the Rolls said in relation to the decisions which have to be taken by health authorities ‘difficult and agonising judgments have to be made as to how a limited budget is best allocated to the maximum advantage of the maximum number of patients. That is not a judgment which the court can make.’ The facts here are different and the statutory obligations are different but mutatis mutandis the principle is relevant to the present case….”</p>

Mr Moffett has questioned why the Secretary of State’s decision not to interfere with the Mayor’s direction has not been challenged in these proceedings.  The bottom line for present purposes is that no such challenge was mounted, but it raises the question of the extent to which the court can truly engage in issues of irrationality in such a context (as opposed, for example, to issues concerning the consultation process).  At all events, there has been no extensive debate about that and I merely raise the question without endeavouring to answer it.  I have, as will be clear, engaged with the issues raised in the case and have not sought to suggest that the court should not do so.</p>

I trust I will be forgiven, at this stage of a lengthy judgment, for not setting out the competing contentions in full.  The Claimants seek to justify making LFEPA and the Commissioner defendants, in addition to the Mayor, because, they say, no particular body or person was prepared to take full responsibility for the decision to proceed with the final version of the plan.  To my mind, that may go to the question of costs, but not, I apprehend, any further.</p>

The substantive decisions under challenge were, therefore, made by the Mayor.  LFEPA resolved to implement the Plan because of the Mayor’s direction and I can see why, at least as a matter of formality, it was necessary to make LFEPA a defendant because, if the Claimants were right, that decision would have to be quashed.  The Mayor, of course, had to be a defendant in any event.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel10" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">However, whilst, as I have said, the Mayor made the relevant substantive decisions, he did so substantially by accepting the final report and recommendation of the Commissioner to implement the final version of the Plan.  Any criticisms of the process by which that report and recommendation came to be made were, in all practical senses, always likely to be responded to by the Commissioner, not by the Mayor himself.  Given the Mayor’s personal responsibility, by virtue of his office, to make the final decision, he was always destined to take part in the proceedings as a defendant, but if the Commissioner had not been a party, whether as a defendant or an interested party, it is highly likely that the Mayor would have asked the Commissioner to play a part in the proceedings by justifying the process and the report that emerged from it.  That, of course, is what effectively happened:  Mr Moffett, with the agreement of Mr Drabble, took the principal role at the hearing in defending the Commissioner’s report and the consultation process for which, on a day-to-day basis, he was responsible.  </p>

The short point is that it is usually a <span style="text-decoration:underline">decision</span> that is the subject of a judicial review claim.  The decision may be based upon a report, which is examined in detail at the hearing, but the report is not made the subject of a judicial review application itself.  The “quashing” of a report, whether it contains a recommendation or not, is an elusive concept.  A decision based upon an inadequate or defective report can plainly be quashed, but quashing the report itself makes little obvious sense.  </p>

Whilst the nature of the advice in the <span style="font-style:italic">United Co-operatives</span> case was rather different from the advice or recommendation of the Commissioner in the present case, it seems to me that the Commissioner’s report and recommendation is much more on the <span style="font-style:italic">United Co-operatives</span> side of the divide between the two types of advice referred to by Elias J.  Although Mr Stilitz suggested that the report was a “statutory report” pursuant to section 21(7) of the 2004 Act, I do not think that is so:  the Plan is arguably a statutory plan once adopted because it is made pursuant to the National Framework which itself is provided for by statute, but that seems to me to be different from saying that the report is statutory in form.  </p>

Accordingly, I would not myself have granted permission to apply for judicial review of his report and recommendation and, accordingly, it seems right that I should refuse it formally now.

The same, of course, applies to the Mayor’s involvement.  Having had full argument in the case (albeit much of it on behalf of the Commissioner), I would grant permission to apply for judicial review both against LFEPA and the Mayor, but dismiss the substantive claim on the merits for the reasons given elsewhere in this judgment.  For the reasons given in paragraph 343, I have indicated that I would propose to refuse permission to apply for judicial review to the FBU in relation to the additional matter on which they sought to rely which I now do formally.</p>
