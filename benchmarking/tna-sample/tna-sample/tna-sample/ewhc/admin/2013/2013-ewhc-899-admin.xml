It is within the North Western Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. As well as a watercress farm there are also on the site buildings used by Vitacress for sorting, washing and packing vegetables and salads for sale to customers. Initially this second use of the site related only to watercress grown on site but gradually it grew to incorporate watercress grown elsewhere and then salads and vegetables grown elsewhere which are transported to and from the site by road. Operations at the site extract water from the aquifer at the source of the Bourne Rivulet and discharge waste water back into the Bourne Rivulet which itself runs into the River Test which is a Site of Special Scientific Interest.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Condition 28 is of importance in this claim for judicial review. The main part of the existing buildings housed packing machinery used for packing watercress grown on site and watercress and other salads brought to site after they were washed. Although the new building to the north of the existing building for which planning permission was granted was subject to condition 28 the main part of the building was not. Neither were the three new intake bays to the north east of the existing building. The effect of condition 28 was thus that while neither Vitacress nor any subsequent owner would be permitted to increase the level of production at the site by putting packing machinery or other packing processes into the new enclosed storage area to the north of the existing building, they would not be prevented from doing so by using the new enclosed covered storage area  for purposes for which currently part of the adjacent north area of the existing building was used, thereby freeing up or liberating, as it was described at the hearing, that space to accommodate additional packing machinery. Nor would it prevent the new intake bays being used in a similar fashion.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Claimant (“Mr Evans”) was one of those who, in the consultation process held by the Council before the decision was taken, objected to the proposed development on environmental grounds. The principal concern was that the proposed development might lead to an increase in production at the site which in turn might lead to pollution of the Bourne Rivulet and the River Test by increased levels of discharge of effluent and the discharge of effluent of a particularly harmful kind and to increased levels of road use by industrial vans or lorries. Vitacress responded by stating that the proposed development would not lead to an increase in production. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Evans challenges the decision to grant planning permission on a number of grounds. One was that the Council treated inconsistently the 2008 proposal which led to the grant of permission in 2010 and a prior proposal made in 2003 for which permission was granted, albeit subsequently quashed in earlier judicial review proceedings on the ground that the Council had failed to carry out an Environmental Impact Assessment (“EIA”) screening opinion. That ground was abandoned in the course of the hearing. Although there were four remaining grounds in reality two of them were closely related and I deal with them together. The first ground was that the Council unlawfully directed itself that it was not able to control by condition the level of operations in the existing buildings on site. The second and third grounds were that the Council failed properly to assess the likely effects of the development, including both indirect effects and the cumulative effects of the pre-existing activities on the site and those flowing from the permission if granted. This was said to be a breach of the Town and Country Planning (EIA) Regulations 1999 (“the Regulations”) and Directive 85/337/EEC as amended (“the Directive”). </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Evans has an additional challenge to the failure of the Council to take enforcement action against what he alleges is the unlawful existing use of the existing buildings. He contends that the existing facility constitutes an EIA project and that the existing industrial use of the site as a packhouse is unlawful because no EIA has ever been carried out in respect of it as required by EU law and in particular Article 2 (1) of the Directive. His response to the contention by the Council and Vitacress that the existing uses are immune from enforcement and thus lawful by reason of the expiry of 10 years since the existing use began pursuant to sections 171B and 191 (2) of the Town and Country Planning Act (“TCPA”), is that if and to the extent that that contention is correct, it would be necessary to disapply section 171B in accordance with principles established by the European Court of Justice (“the ECJ”) in case 106/77 <span style="font-style:italic">Amministrazione delle Finanze dello Stato v Simmenthal SpA </span>[1978] ECR 630.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Evans contends that the Council unlawfully directed itself that it was not able to control by condition the level of operations at the site. As a matter of law he submits that, as was accepted at the hearing by Vitacress, it was lawfully open to the Council to impose conditions controlling any increase in the level of production at the site. As a result of that misdirection the Council he submits failed to take into account or consider whether such conditions should be imposed. The need for and/or appropriateness of such conditions were a material factor which the Council was obliged to address its mind to and had it done so it cannot be ruled out that it might have decided to impose such conditions. As a result the decision to grant planning permission was unlawful and should be quashed.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is Mr Evans’ case that the nature of the permission proposed to be granted was such that it was at the very least capable of leading (a) to increased levels of production at the enlarged site with consequent adverse effects on the discharge of pollutant effluents into the Bourne Rivulet and therefrom to the River Test and (b) to a significant increase in road traffic by industrial vans and lorries. The increase to the levels of production could come about in any or all of the following ways. First it would be possible for Vitacress or a subsequent owner or user of the enlarged site to move out existing storage functions from the area in the existing packhouse adjacent to the new northern storage area extension into that extension, thereby freeing up or liberating space in the existing packhouse for new processing-related functions, in particular packing machinery. Although any increase in the level of production caused thereby would result from an increase in production in the existing building which was not subject to existing planning restrictions and would not be covered by Condition 28, it would result indirectly from the grant of permission to erect the covered storage area to the north of the building. In addition in a plan of the proposed development submitted by Vitacress a rectangle inside the existing packhouse was marked “packing”, whereas in the plan of the existing site it was unmarked, thus indicating that a part of the proposal was to introduce some packing related process into the rectangle which was not currently there which might add to productivity.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Second the expanded intake rooms at the extended area of the northeast side of the existing packhouse building could be used to house the return of the inspection facility from Vitacress’ site at Amesbury, to which it had been transferred some years earlier. That transfer had been proposed before the prior 2003 application for planning permission on the basis that it would reduce raw material traffic from the St Mary Bourne site by around 30%, the inference being according to Mr Evans, that were the inspection facility to be transferred back to Bourne it might lead to a similar increase in the volume of traffic, especially HGV traffic. The area concerned was not subject to Condition 28. Third that area could also be used for a major increase in raw material storage space to overcome an existing bottleneck in that space so that much larger consignments could be handled and processing rates increased accordingly.</p>

There were he submitted two reasons why the Council did not take it into account. First the relevant facts were not drawn to the attention of the planning committee, which took the relevant decision on behalf of the Council. Second the planning committee was misled by the report prepared for it by its officers into thinking that it was not lawfully open to the Council to impose conditions restricting the use of existing parts of the site buildings. </p>

This was based on a passage in the Officers’ Report dated 18 August 2010 which stated that “the Council does not have the legal power to control the existing use.” and a further passage which stated “The existing use is considered to be established on the site and any controls the Council may impose must only relate to the development now proposed. They cannot seek to control the underlying use.” Those passages were said to be seriously in error. They did not reflect the terms of sections 72 (1) (a) of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (“the 1990 Act”) which provide that conditions may regulate the use of land under the control of a developer “whether or not it is land in respect of which the application was made”. Nor did they reflect the principle derived from the authorities that a condition may be imposed on existing land which is not the subject of an application for planning permission provided that it fairly and reasonably relates to the proposed development for which permission is sought. </p>

Alternatively he submitted that if and to the extent that the passages referred to were intended to reflect the correct legal test they failed to do so in that they must by implication have been based on the premise that in order for a condition fairly and reasonably to relate to the proposed development it is not sufficient that the use of the existing site which the condition would be designed to prevent was one which <span style="font-weight:bold">could</span> as distinct from <span style="font-weight:bold">would</span> result from the proposed development.

VSL was described as a vertically integrated company which retained complete control of every aspect of its business from the growing of the salad products, their delivery to Lower Link Farm, their processing and packing and onward distributions to customers. The perishable nature of its salad products meant that it was unable to produce and then store its products, which had to be picked, chilled, inspected, washed, fixed, packed and delivered to customers all within a short time frame. The salad leaves arriving at Lower Link Farm were principally delivered from VSL’s existing cold store at Amesbury, where they were inspected and picked into batches, ready sorted for each wash line within the packhouse at Lower Link Farm.

The closure of two existing breaks in the cold chain relating to the unloading and loading of salad products from HGV’s is a basic requirement for chilled food suppliers which VSL cannot currently meet. The existing intake and despatch operations are energy inefficient as chilled air is lost from delivery vehicles and the packhouse resulting in unnecessary energy use of CO2 emissions.

Those uses might have potentially caused contamination of underlying soils and ground water and the EA had to take a precautionary approach in respect of recommending a number of conditions. As to surface water quality the EA commented that there should be no impact on water quality of the Bourne Rivulet provided the mitigation measures set out in section 11 of the ES were implemented correctly. As to the protection of ground water quality further work would be required which could be secured by conditions. As to biodiversity the ES provided an appropriate assessment of the impact which the development would have on the local ecology. Concerns about the effect of Vitacress’s operations on the aquatic invertebrate community, and the steps taken to address that were recorded but the proposed works were unlikely to affect that and the EA had no undue concerns in respect of biodiversity. A condition was suggested in respect of the biodiversity enhancement proposals. Under the heading of flood risk and water resources it was recorded that chapter 11 of the ES stated that the redevelopment would not intensify the production volume of the site or require increases in water abstraction. The EA proposed conditions on foundation designs to ensure that surface water could be effectively attenuated and discharged at appropriate rates. Various conditions were sought. </p>

I was told that those third party comments included comments made by the Claimant. The summary stated that the EA position remained as set out in their original response. The suggested conditions would reduce the impact of the development in respect of EA roles and responsibilities. The EA noted that the ES said that there would be no increase in water abstraction or effluent produced as a result of the application. The EA noted that discharge of effluent to the Bourne Rivulet was controlled by consents, the first of which was after an NRA prosecution in respect of chlorine discharge. The use of chlorine had now stopped, reducing the quantity of solids discharged and the impact of salad washings which were known to be toxic to gammarus (fresh water shrimp). There had been measurable improvements to the invertebrate fauna of the Bourne Rivulet as a result of the measures taken. The EA evidence showed that discharges from the Vitacress site were not having an impact on the River Test which was an SSSI. The EA had no evidence that the stock piling of composting watercress/stable/gravel mix which was subject to EA regulations was causing pollution of surface or ground waters and was working with Vitacress and others to help them investigate other reuse or recycling opportunities for that product. The EA was recorded as having no additional comments in respect of the additional consultation.</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">A watercress farm has been established on this site for many years. The first commercial lease dates back to 1905 and Vitacress has been packing bunched watercress on the site since 1950. Over time this process has become increasingly mechanised and Vitacress has diversified the agricultural operations with other salad leaves and salad products brought to Lower Link Farm for washing, mixing and packing. Key to the development of watercress production on the site is the ready supply of natural spring water which is abstracted from underground aquifers to flow through the watercress bed. VSL say that locating the packhouse operations at Lower Link Farm is essential to enable VSL to use the readily available fresh spring water, pumped under licence from boreholes on the site, for the washing of salad products. Several planning applications have been submitted relating to the development of the site, as noted above. In their supporting information VSL state the site now comprises the following functions:</p>

That application was considered by the Council’s Development Control Committee on 10/12/2003 who resolved to grant planning permission subject to a S106 agreement to secure a contribution towards BEST and a Landscape Management Plan. The agreement was completed and planning permission was issued on 14 April 2004. The decision was challenged in the High Court in July 2004 on several grounds. Legal advice to the Council was that the Council had not considered whether the development was a Schedule 2 development and if so whether it was an EIA Development in accordance with the Regulations and that the Council had failed to undertake a screening opinion required by the Environmental Regulations. The Council submitted to judgement which quashed the planning permission dated 14 April 2005 in respect of BDB/55966. In September 2004 the applicant requested that the Secretary of State make a screening direction as to whether the application was an EIA development.

Therefore 3% of the total produce processed on site is grown at Lower Link Farm. The conclusion drawn is that the majority of activities involve the washing, mixing and package of salad stuffs not grown on-site and that this activity should be considered as an industrial process. Accordingly there are two planning activities taking place, industrial and agricultural, the majority of those relating to this application being an industrial process, although the agricultural activity remains – the farming and harvesting of watercress. Officers wrote to the agents in March 2009 to advise them of their view that the use of the site appears to have developed incrementally from its original use as a watercress farm with ancillary washing and packing facilities to mixed use as a watercress farm and an industrial facility (for the washing, mixing and packaging) of salad products.

Legal advice to the Council is that there is an established use at the site without any limit, either in respect of the amount of watercress that can be grown or in respect of the amount of salad that can be imported and processed. If the appellant were to intensify the use it may be possible to enforce against this, although the concept of change of use through intensification is notoriously somewhat difficult to enforce against. This conclusion has a significant impact on the potential scope for controlling the use through conditions or Section 106 agreement - this issue is discussed in detail under ‘Consideration of Conditions and Limitations’ below.</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">The other point of concern for the Council is whether the ES has failed to assess the potential scope of activities on site. It seems this argument is based on the concern that the current proposals may lead to higher levels of activity on site. This is a difficult issue: VSL has been pushed on this point and maintain that the current development would not lead to any more operations being undertaken at the site. Although the Council have been concerned about this and have properly asked for more information, I do not understand that the Council have any evidence to question the assertion that the development proposed will not lead to any greater growing of watercress or packing/washing of salad leaves. In the circumstances it seems to me that the EIA regime is not designed to bite on the impact of existing development, but of the proposed development (if necessary considered in connection with existing development). This much is clear from the Circular 02/99 paragraph (part 46-47, which discusses ‘changes or extensions to existing or approved development’ as follows: </p>

This should be considered in the light of general guidance in this Circular and the indicative thresholds in Annex A. However, the significance of any effects must be considered in the context of the existing development.  For example, even a small extension to an airport runway might have the effect of allowing larger aircraft to land, thus significantly increasing the level of noise and emissions. In some cases, repeated small extensions may be made to development. Quantified thresholds cannot easily deal with this kind of ‘incremental’ development. In such instances, it should be borne in mind that the thresholds in Annex A are indicative only. An expansion of the same size as a previous expansion will not automatically lead to the same determination on the need for EIA because the environment may have altered since the question was last addressed.</p>

The analysis in Section 5 of the ES of alternative development scenarios emphasises the fundamental link between the proposed facilities and the existing site operations and hence the need, in terms of operational requirements, for the different elements to be provided on this site, rather than elsewhere. Paragraph 5.14 makes it clear that the location of the packhouse operation at Lower Link Farm is essential to enable VSL to use the readily available supply of fresh spring water from boreholes for the washing of salad products. Similarly, the replacement of the workshop in situ rather than off-site is justified on the basis of the need to maintain speed of delivery to customers due to the perishable nature of the salad product handled on the site. Paragraph 5.25 of the Planning Supporting Statement states that each element of the application is locationally specific to Lower Link Farm, demonstrating a requirement for developing within this countryside location. </p>

The most significant concern is traffic together with issues relating to water abstraction and water quality and ecological impact, but also include noise and light pollution. VSL’s position on this is that the driver for this development is the need to close the existing breaks in the cold chain, which is a very high priority for VSL and its customers, and to reduce costs through removing unnecessary vehicle movements and handling of goods.

Increases in capacity could take place without the proposed development as there are no planning restrictions on the use of that capacity. What is proposed is a development which would enable improvement in product quality and reduction in costs, together with environmental benefits, but whether that leads to increased production depends on other factors such as market demand, seasonal production, weather conditions, etc. The proposed development will not result in an increase in traffic volumes to and from the site by the same reasoning.’</p>

Thus it is not sufficient that a condition is related to planning objectives: it must also be justified by the nature of the development permitted or its effect on the surroundings. For example, if planning permission is being granted for the alteration of a factory building, it would be wrong to impose conditions requiring additional parking facilities to be provided for an existing factory simply to meet a need that already exists, and similarly wrong to require the improvement of the appearance or layout of an adjoining site simply because it is untidy or congested; despite the desirability of these objectives in planning terms, the need for the action would not be created by the new development. Nevertheless it is proper for conditions to secure satisfactory access, for example, or parking facilities, genuinely required by the users of the proposed development. Conditions can also be proper where the need for them arises out of the effects of the development rather than its own features; where permission will result in intensification of industrial use of a site, for instance, a condition may be necessary requiring additional sound-insulation in the existing factory buildings. It may even be justifiable to require by condition that an existing building be demolished-perhaps where to have both would result in the site being over-intensively developed.’</p>

In the circumstances and in the light of the advice received, officers have concluded that it would not be reasonable or lawful to impose a condition on a planning consent to limit the existing established mixed use of the site.

The site is in a sensitive location within the AONB, adjacent to a Conservation Area and accessed by a rural road network. The location is relatively unsustainable in terms of the application of policy. Added to this are the proximity of the SSSI and concerns regarding the sensitive local water receiving environment. The proposed development is sought to support and facilitate the operation of the existing business, which, whilst it has developed from agricultural origins as a watercress farm which still remains, is now a substantial international business largely concerned with the importation, processing and despatch of watercress and other baby leaf salad products grown elsewhere. The existing use is considered to be established on the site and any controls the Council may impose must only relate to the development now proposed, they cannot seek to control the underlying use.</p>

Consideration also needs to be given to the fall-back position, or the situation which would exist either in the event of refusal or the development not being proceeded with. The Council has no powers to require the existing use to relocate as advocated by a number of third parties.

The documentation in support of the former projected 10 per cent year on year production increase which by 2008 was anticipated to lead to a 29 per cent increase in lorry movements. He said that it was claimed at the time that the proposals would not in themselves lead to increased production. That would be met by the installation of additional wash/pack lines within the buildings which would not require planning permission. It was now apparent that those additional wash/pack lines had been installed in the intervening years. Those additional pack lines must have taken up previously available internal floor space. </p>

He referred to the fact that the 2003 application proposed that the increased internal space would enable the eventual relocation back to the site of the pre-sorting currently carried out at Amesbury. He submitted that it must be presumed that this would again be possible under the current proposal, again leading to increased traffic movements due to the loss of “consolidation” and pre-selection of “good material only” arriving on site. </p>

He asserted that the application was designed to streamline the site operations to maximise the ability to meet hoped for increase in customer demand. He further asserted that it was to be inferred that the proposal to build a huge covered store rather than simply putting loading doors onto the factory, which would have been the most cost effective way of closing the chill chain, was intended to enable production to increase and to relocate to the Amesbury operation to the site at Saint Mary Bourne. He therefore submitted that the Council should impose the tightest controls on the operation of Vitacress as it existed because Vitacress had made clear that at present there were no restrictions on their operations in terms of operating hours, production output, vehicular movement, water usage monitoring etc.</p>

Whilst the internal arrangements of the internal packhouse could be altered to increase the number of pack lines that could be done in any event without the need for the new development. In fact the number of pack lines had been reduced form eleven to ten and two bowl lines had been installed in the same area. It was not the number of pack lines that determined output but customer demand and the nature of the product on the pack line. Thus if customer demand required more bowls and fewer bags the maximum capacity would decrease even if the number of lines increased.</p>

They included both the existing uses and the proposed uses of the buildings and areas. The Council were made fully aware that the areas covered by the 2008 application had no direct link to the volume produced because future demand increases could be accommodated within the existing building pre-development and the purpose of the development which was granted planning permission in 2010 was to deliver environmental benefits, increase efficiencies and reduce costs in the existing business operation.  He also stated that there was no intention to bring its Amesbury operation back to the site.  In a second witness statement dated 6 February 2012 in response to Mr Rushworth’s first witness statement Mr Evans asserted that Mr Rushworth was wholly unclear about whether inspection would or would not return from Amesbury to the site. In any event he asserted that Mr Rushworth’s evidence was that the 2010 permission would enable the return of inspection. He asserted that the return of inspection from Amesbury would appear to have significant implications in terms of changed HGV traffic. He referred to Mr Rushworth’s statement to the Council in 2002 that the temporary relocation of inspection to Amesbury was expected to result in a 30 per cent reduction of HGV traffic at Lower Link. He asserted that the clear indication was that if and when the inspection process returned to Lower Link as would now be made possible by the proposed expansion of the packhouse, incoming HGV traffic would in fact increase because it would consist of smaller vehicles and/or part loads, as present supplied the Amesbury facility, rather than large, articulated vehicles which presently departed from Amesbury with consolidated, full loads.</p>

The additional space in the proposed extension was primarily needed for packing and ancillary operations on the larger scale resulting from the increased production. Sir Douglas Frank QC stated that it was quite clear that the extension itself was not to be used for the working of machinery but rather to enable the machinery in the existing factory to be used 24 hours a day. Thus a condition which had for its purpose the restriction on the use of machinery in the interest of amenity and particularly nuisance from noise could have a bearing only on the existing factory. It could not in his judgment possibly be said that that condition was not related to the development being permitted because it was the development that was being permitted which would enable the machinery in the existing factory to be operated 24 hours a day. He found that there was no evidence on which the Secretary of State could come to the conclusion that the condition imposing time limits within which machinery could be operated in the existing factory or the extension was not related to the permitted development. On the contrary it seemed to him that it necessarily arose from it. As to the restriction on noise levels from operations conducted in the existing factory and the extension he held that a similar consideration applied because the noise would chiefly be generated from the existing building and that noise if it were to be increased or to become objectionable would do so mainly as a result of the permitted development enabling the existing building to be used more effectively. </p>

In other words he did not contend that it would in principle be unlawful for a planning authority to impose a condition by reason of a conclusion that it reasonably and fairly related to the proposed development for which planning permission was sought if the only link was a reasonable belief that without the condition some adverse event <span style="font-weight:bold">might</span> occur on other.</p>

The Minister, being the ultimate authority on planning questions arising in the enforcement of planning control, was the appropriate authority to determine “whether a condition ‘sufficiently’, i.e. fairly and reasonably, relates to the permitted development.

Viscount Dilhorne stated: “If in the circumstances of this case the condition imposed was not, in the Secretary of State’s opinion, fairly and reasonably related to the permission granted, the courts cannot interfere with his conclusion unless it is established that he misdirected himself or reached a conclusion to which he could not reasonably have come.”</p>

So it will be necessary to search elsewhere for the reasons why the members decided to change their minds. In such circumstances it might well be sensible at the very least to record the member’s reasons in the form of a minute. But if, as in the present case, there has been a refusal of planning permission contrary to the planning officer’s recommendation, a further application is made, the planning officer again recommends planning permission and the committee then decided to grant planning permission, it is a fair inference in the absence of evidence to the contrary that the members have been persuaded by the planning officer’s views. I accept Mr Singh’s submission that one is concerned with the members’ reasons not the planning officer’s, but where a planning officer makes a recommendation which is followed by the members, the reasonable inference is that the members did so for the reasons advanced by the officer, unless of course there is some indication to the contrary.” (page 15).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The very first sentence of this section of the Officers’ Report accurately summarised the legal position: “Any condition imposed on an application must fairly and reasonably relate to the permitted development.  Circular 11/95 says that a condition ought not to be imposed unless there is a definite need for it and unless a condition fairly and reasonably relates to the development to be permitted, it will be ultra vires”. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">That general statement of the law was, in my judgment, correct and it is not in my judgment realistic to suggest that any of the passages relied on by Mr. McCracken were reasonably capable of being interpreted by the Committee as intending to derogate or to depart from it.  I note in particular that paragraphs 24 and 25 of the Circular, which were cited with approval by Pill LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Delta Design and Engineering</span>, were set out in full in the Officers’ Report which was introduced in these terms: “In commenting on whether the condition would be reasonably and fairly related to the development to be permitted, Counsel reiterated her original advice and quoted from Circular 11/95 as follows:…”.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The “reasonably and fairly related to the development” test was thus both repeated in the Officers’ Report and said to have been applied by Counsel in her original advice.  There was a further extract from Counsel’s legal advice: “It seems to me that there is no problem in principle with a condition that purported to interfere with existing rights. The question is whether it is sufficiently connected with the proposal.” Again that was an accurate statement of the law in my judgment.  In my judgment it is those references to Counsel’s advice as to the legal test for imposing conditions to which reference was made in the passage which I have analysed when it stated that “In the light of the advice received” officers had concluded that it would not be…lawful to impose a condition on a planning consent to limit the existing established mixed use of the site.” It is true that in the following paragraph of the extract from Counsel’s opinion there appeared the statement that she understood that the officers had accepted Vitacress’ argument that the new development would not allow them to increase throughput “and as such there can be no basis for seeking to limit the currently unlimited use of the remainder of the site”.  No doubt if that argument had been advanced by Vitacress and accepted by Officers there could be no basis for seeking to limit the use of the remainder of the site.  However I have indicated that that factual position was corrected in the immediately following passage of the Report.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There is no warrant in my judgment for a conclusion that in any of the passages relied on by Mr. McCracken the clear statement in the Officers’ Report as to the correct legal test to be applied was or was reasonably capable of being understood as having been materially altered.  Although in deference to Mr McCracken’s submissions I have analysed the various passages on which he relied, I remind myself that the Report is not to be construed as if it were a statute and is not susceptible to textual analysis such as is appropriate to construction of a statute, and that an application for judicial review based on criticism of the planning officer’s report will not normally begin to merit consideration unless the overall effect of the report significantly misleads the Committee (see <span style="font-style:italic">Oxton Farms</span>).  Applying that approach for all the reasons which I have given I am not satisfied that the overall effect of the Officers’ Report significantly misled the Committee about material matters, whether of fact or law.</p>

He submitted that this was recognised by the Council as demonstrated by the fact that it sought such an assessment by way of additional information to the ES in its letter dated 15 September 2009 to Vitacress. Although that letter did not explicitly describe itself as a request for further information pursuant to Regulation 19, it is plain that that is what it was and Vitacress’ November 2009 Addendum to the ES described itself as a response to a regulation 19 request.

He submitted that that had been noted by the Environment Agency (“the EA”). In the Council’s Scoping Opinion dated 14 January 2008 the Council quoted comments provided by the EA in respect of Vitacress’ Scoping Report and the ecology and water environment section in which Vitacress had stated that the EA had confirmed that no existing potential impact arising from the site would extend so far as to impact on the River Test SSSI.

Mr McCracken submitted that neither the ES nor the Addendum contained any range of pesticides or residues both of which he submitted fell within the regulation 19 Request.

Lord Hoffmann's speech must be considered in its context. <span style="font-style:italic">Berkeley</span> was a case where there had been no environmental statement. Even in such a case the House of Lords was prepared to accept that “an EIA by any other name will do as well. But it must in substance be an EIA” (see page 617). If an application for planning permission has been accompanied by a document purporting to be an environmental statement, can it be said that that document falls outside the definition of environmental statement in Regulation 2 (so that the local planning authority is unable to grant planning permission: see regulation 3(2)) because it has failed to describe a likely significant effect on the environment subsequently identified by the local planning authority, or a particular mitigation measure thought necessary by the local planning authority? The omission might have been due to an oversight on the part of those preparing the environmental statement, or to a deliberate decision because it was not considered by the author of the environmental statement that a particular environmental effect was likely, or, if likely, that it was likely to be significant, or because the author of the environmental statement was unfamiliar with the particular mitigation technique, or because he considered that mitigation was unnecessary. </p>

It follows that the document will contain the applicant's own assessment of the environmental impact of his proposal and the necessary mitigation measures. The Regulations recognise that the applicant's assessment of these issues may well be inaccurate, inadequate or incomplete. Hence the requirements in Regulation 13 to submit copies of the environmental statement to the Secretary of State and to any body which the local planning authority is required to consult. Members of the public will be informed by site notice and by local advertisement of the existence of the environmental statement and able to obtain or inspect a copy: see Regulation 17 of the Regulations and Article 8 of the Town and Country Planning (General Development Procedure) Order 1995. </p>

This process of publicity and public consultation gives those persons who consider that the environmental statement is inaccurate or inadequate or incomplete an opportunity to point out its deficiencies. Under Regulation 3(2) the local planning authority must, before granting planning permission, consider not merely the environmental statement, but “the environmental information”, which is defined by Regulation 2 as “the environmental statement, including any further information, any representations made by any body required by these Regulations to be invited to make representations, and any representations duly made by any other person about the environmental effects of the development”. </p>

In the light of the environmental information the local planning authority may conclude that the environmental statement has failed to identify a particular environmental impact, or has wrongly dismissed it as unlikely, or not significant. Or the local planning authority may be persuaded that the mitigation measures proposed by the applicant are inadequate or insufficiently detailed. That does not mean that the document described as an environmental statement falls out with the definition of an environmental statement within the Regulations so as to deprive the authority of jurisdiction to grant planning permission. The local planning authority may conclude that planning permission should be refused on the merits because the environmental statement has inadequately addressed the environmental implications of the proposed development, but that is a different matter altogether. Once the requirements of Schedule 4 are read in the context of the Regulations as a whole, it is plain that a local planning authority is not deprived of jurisdiction to grant planning permission merely because it concludes that an environmental statement is deficient in a number of respects. </p>

Ground 1 in these proceedings is an example of the unduly legalistic approach to the requirements of Schedule 4 to the Regulations that has been adopted on behalf of claimants in a number of applications for judicial review seeking to prevent the implementation of development proposals. The Regulations should be interpreted as a whole and in a common-sense way. The requirement that “an EIA application” (as defined in the Regulations) must be accompanied by an environmental statement is not intended to obstruct such development. As Lord Hoffmann said in <span style="font-style:italic">R v North Yorkshire County Council ex p.

	      </a>, at page 404, the purpose is “to ensure that planning decisions which may affect the environment are made on the basis of full information”. In an imperfect world it is an unrealistic counsel of perfection to expect that an applicant's environmental statement will always contain the "full information" about the environmental impact of a project. The Regulations are not based upon such an unrealistic expectation. They recognise that an environmental statement may well be deficient, and make provision through the publicity and consultation processes for any deficiencies to be identified so that the resulting “environmental information” provides the local planning authority with as full a picture as possible. There will be cases where the document purporting to be an environmental statement is so deficient that it could not reasonably be described as an environmental statement as defined by the Regulations (<span style="font-style:italic">Tew</span> was an example of such a case), but they are likely to be few and far between. </p>

Sullivan J also quoted an extract from the report in which the Director of Planning accepted that fear regarding adverse health effects as expressed by objectors should not be viewed as baseless, since the responsibility of risk to health could not entirely be dismissed so that it was appropriate to afford some weight to that genuinely held view. The area health authority’s conclusions would not in view of the Director support a rejection of the application on health related grounds.

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">I have dealt with it in some detail because it does illustrate a tendency on the part of claimants opposed to the grant of planning permission to focus upon deficiencies in environmental statements as revealed by the consultation process prescribed by the Regulations and to contend that because the document did not contain all the information required by schedule 4 it was therefore not an environmental statement and the local planning authority had no power to grant planning permission. Unless it can be said that the deficiencies are so serious that the document cannot be described as, in substance, an environmental statement for the purposes of the Regulations, such an approach is in my judgment misconceived. It is important that decisions on EIA applications are made on the basis of “full information”, but the Regulations are not based on the premise that the environmental statement will necessarily contain full information. The process is designed to identify any deficiencies in the environmental statement so that the local planning authority has the full picture, so far as it can be ascertained, when it comes to consider the “environmental information” of which the environmental statement will be but a part.” (Paragraphs 62 – 68).</p>

The EA noted that chapter 11 of the ES stated that the redevelopment would not intensify the production volume of the site or require increases in water abstraction. A further letter from the EA was referred to in the Officers’ Report responding to detailed third party comments in which its position was said to remain as set out in their original response. It noted that the ES said that there would be no increase in water abstraction or effluence produced as a result of the application.

The scheme is designed to elicit facts and opinions not only from the applicant but from members of the public and other interested bodies and parties.

In fact the issue with which the Court of Appeal was concerned in <span style="font-style:italic">Jones</span> was not the correct approach to assessing the adequacy of an environmental statement. The court was concerned with the Town and Country Planning (Assessment of Environmental Effects) Regulations 1988. Regulation 4(2) of those Regulations contained a similar prohibition against the grant of planning permission unless the local planning authority or Secretary of State had first taken the environmental information into consideration as appears in Regulation 3(2) of the 1999 EIA Regulations. Regulation 4(1) provided that Regulation 4(2) applied to any “Schedule 2 application” which was defined by Regulation 2(1) as one which “would be likely to have significant effects on the environment by virtue of factors such as its nature size or location.” Regulation 2(2) provided that where the Secretary of State gave a direction including a statement that in his opinion a proposed development would be likely or would not be likely to have significant effects on the environmental by virtue of factors such as its nature, size or location… that statement should determine whether an application was or was not a Schedule 2 application by reason of the effects which the development would be likely to have. </p>

Dyson LJ, as he then was, pointed out that there was no express reference to the role of the local planning authority corresponding to the statement in Regulation 2(2) that where the Secretary of State gave a direction which included a statement that in his opinion proposed development would be likely [to have significant effect on the environment]that statement was determinative.

But it would be very surprising if the nature of the court’s reviewing function were to differ according to whether the question as to whether the application is a Schedule 2 application is made by the local planning authority or the Secretary of State. The question that is left to be determined in the first instance by the local planning authority is the same as the question that is determined by the Secretary of State pursuant to Regulation 2(2). I do not consider that the use of the word “opinion” in Regulation 2(2) indicates that there is any difference. The fact that the decision of the local planning authority may be overridden by a formal direction of the Secretary of State does not justify or require a different role for the court in the two cases. Accordingly I would hold that what Lord Hoffman said in relation to challenges to decision to the Secretary of State applies equally to challenges to decisions by local planning authorities.</p>

Significance in that context was not a hard-edged concept. The assessment of what is significant involved the exercise of judgment. In so holding he rejected a submission that where there is any uncertainty about the environmental effects of a development it cannot be said that it would be unlikely to have significant effects on the environmental and that an EIA would be required and he approved the following conclusions of Richards J, the first instance judge:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As regards Ground 3 Ms Parry submitted that <span style="font-style:italic">Baker v Bath</span> adds nothing to the requirement in paragraph 4 of Part I of Schedule 4 of the Regulations that the ES should include a description of, among other things, the cumulative effects of the development on the environment.  <span style="font-style:italic">Baker v Bath</span> itself was concerned only with the circumstances in which EIA is required for an extension to or a change to a project.  In this case there was no question of the Council suggesting that no EIA was required because this was an extension or a change to something that was already there.  Mr McCracken accepted that <span style="font-style:italic">Baker v Bath</span> did not specifically deal with the scope of EIA but argued that the logic of the principle in that case to the effect that it is contrary to the purpose of the Directive if the effects of changes or modifications are not taken into account applies.  In response to that Ms Parry submitted that the effects of changes or modifications were subject to EIA.  Mr Evans’ real complaint she submitted was not that there was no assessment of the cumulative effects of the proposed development on the environment but rather that Vitacress’ assessment of the cumulative effects was based on a bare assertion that because the development would lead to no increase in production there would be no additional indirect effects on the environment flowing from the development.  That she submitted was in effect the same objection which he made in respect of Ground 2 and the answer to it was the same, namely that it was not <span style="font-style:italic">Wednesbury</span> unreasonable for the Council to decide that the ES and Addendum were not inadequate for that reason.</p>

As a result of its research Vitacress had introduced a number of measures in recent years to improve water quality.  The improvement works to the site’s water management had resulted in a reduction in the levels of nutrients and sediment entering the channel, and critically levels of PEITC (the natural mustard oil released from damaged watercress).

Paragraph 11.57 was unequivocal in its assertion that the proposals did not include any increases in the rate of production so that they would not affect the volume or quality of water being discharged into the Bourne Rivulet.  Paragraph 11.56 and earlier passages in the baseline analysis and description constituted a favourable and positive assessment of the effect of the existing activities on the site.

It was stated that as a consequence the existing and proposed discharges from the development complied with EA discharge consent criteria and would not change post-development.

Regulation 3(2) prohibited the Council from granting planning permission unless it first took “the environmental information” into consideration. Regulation 19(7) required the Council to suspend determination of Vitacress’s application and not to determine it before the expiry of 14 days after the date on which “further information” was sent to the persons to whom the statement to which it related was sent or the expiry of 21 days after the date that notice of it was published in a local newspaper whichever was later.</p>

There was an extract from Counsel’s advice which I have set out earlier and to which I refer below.

The question of the adequacy or inadequacy of the ES and Addendum formed a central part of the Officer’s Report and the matter was gone into in considerable detail. Competing arguments from Vitacress and objectors were highlighted, the background was explained, extracts of the Addendum were quoted as was an extract from Counsel’s opinion and a conclusion was reached in the Officer’s Report that both the ES and the Addendum were considered to fulfil the requirements of the scoping opinion and adequately to address the issues raised in accordance with the Regulations. In so far as the Committee is to be taken as having adopted the approach set out in the Officer’s Report, it is in my view clear that they took into account the contents of both the ES and the Addendum. Moreover any member of the Committee who for any reason wanted to check for him or herself was directed at the very outset of the Report to the link to both the ES and the Addendum.  Thus, subject to whether the Council was lawfully entitled to treat the ES as an ES and the Addendum as “further information”, the answer to the first question is yes. </p>

As to the ES, Mr McCracken was in my judgment right to accept that for the purposes of the hearing in front of me the adequacy of the ES was a matter for the Council subject to review on <span style="font-style:italic">Wednesbury </span>principles.

The trigger for the obligation on a planning authority to notify the applicant of the need to supply additional information set out in Regulation 19(1) is the forming by the relevant planning authority of the opinion that the statement submitted by the applicant which is referred to by him as an environmental statement for the purposes of the Regulations should contain additional information in order to be an “environmental statement” as defined in Regulation 2(1). Thus the role and significance of the additional information which is required to be supplied is in the context of satisfying the planning authority that the purported environmental statement complies with the definition of an environmental statement as set out in Regulation 2(1). It would in my judgment be anomalous if in all other respects the question whether the purported environmental statement complies with the definition in Regulation 2(1) is a matter for the council to decide but the assessment whether the additional information supplied pursuant to Regulation 19(1) is sufficient or adequate to lead to the conclusion that the purported environmental statement satisfies the definition of an environmental statement within Regulation 2(1) is a matter for the Court.</p>

The process of publicity and public consultation gives those persons who consider that the environmental statement is inaccurate or inadequate or incomplete an opportunity to point out its deficiencies. Under Regulation 3(2) the local planning authority must consider not merely the environmental statement but also the other parts of the environmental information including any representations made by any body required by the Regulations to be invited to make representations and any representations duly made by any other person about the environmental effects of the development.</p>

The fact that it may conclude that planning permission should be refused on the merits because the environmental statement has inadequately addressed the environmental implications of the proposed development is a different matter altogether. Once the requirements of Schedule 4 of the Regulations are read in the context of the Regulations as a whole it is plain that the local planning authority is not deprived of jurisdiction to grant planning permission merely because it concludes that an environmental statement is deficient in a number of respects.</p>

The Regulation 19 request sought information on the raw materials used in and the waste generated by the existing operations and in each case an assessment of the potential impacts on the ecology and water environment and an assessment of the degree to which the development could lead to the capability for increased productive capacity on the site. It followed, so I understood Mr McCracken to submit, that because the ES did not contain the information and assessments sought by the Council, the Council must for that reason have judged the ES to be so inadequate as to be incapable of being an ES. Further (assuming that, contrary to his primary case, the assessment of the adequacy of the information continued in the Addendum was a matter for the Council) no reasonable Council could have considered that the information in the Addendum remedied or rectified the defects which the council had judged to exist in the ES.</p>

In other words it was a test applicable to the prior question of whether there needs to be an environmental assessment at all and not, as in this case and as posed by the requirements for the content of a ES, to the question whether the ES included such of the information referred to in Part I of Schedule 4 as was reasonably required to assess the environmental effects of the development and which Vitacress could reasonably be required to compile, that information including “a description of the likely significant effects of the development…”.</p>

Quite apart from my doubt as to whether the very wide test of whether a significant effect cannot be excluded on the basis of objective information applies to an assessment of “the environmental effects of the development” referred to in Regulation 2(1)(a) and the reference to “a description of the likely effects of the development on the environment” in paragraph 4 of Part I of Schedule 4, it is important to bear in mind that an ES need only include such of the Part I Schedule 4 information as is reasonably required to assess the environmental effects of the development and which the Applicant can reasonably be required to compile.  In circumstances where the Applicant has made it very clear, as Vitacress did in this case, that the proposed development will not result in any changes in its activities which would have a material effect on the environment beyond that flowing from its existing activities, it cannot in my judgment be said that no reasonable planning authority could conclude that information as to what effects on the environment the development might have if, contrary to the Applicant’s assertions, the development did lead to results which would or could have material effects on the environment beyond those resulting from its existing activities, is not information reasonably required to assess the environmental effects of the development which the Applicant can reasonably be required to compile.</p>

That applies both to the answers in the Addendum to which I have referred and also to Mr McCracken’s criticisms of both the ES and the Addendum for not including sufficient data to enable the environmental effects to be assessed.  For example he submitted that the failure of Vitacress to identify the pesticides and residues was a fatal flaw.  In my judgment that particular omission needs to be seen in the wider context both of the considerable degree of detail to which the ES and Addendum condescended as regards the produce and the waste, and the fact that, whatever the pesticides and residues consisted of, they did not lead to effects on the environment from Vitacress’ existing activities which caused the EA sufficient concern to object to planning permission being given.</p>

In the detailed statement of grounds in the claim form for judicial review it was stated that the decision challenged was predicated on the assumption (as given in the reasons for the grant) that the site’s established lawful use was mixed agricultural/industrial by reason of acquired immunity for the industrial use under section 171 B of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (“TCPA”). It was asserted that in reaching that apparent conclusion the Council (1) misdirected itself because development consent cannot be obtained, including via such acquired immunity, for an EIA development (which the Lower Link Farm represented) unless the relevant environmental impact assessment has been conducted which was not the case and (2) did not take into account the evidence indicating that the Council itself believed the primary use of the site to be agricultural with any industrial use ancillary in the 1990s and in 2003; with the position remaining unclear even in 2009 when the interested party stated that the use was still “functionally linked to the historic agricultural use of the site”, implying that a new non-agricultural (industrial) use had not clearly been created.</p>

Although the letter from Mr Evans’ solicitor stated that the Council was then in a position to issue an enforcement notice against a material change of use and addressed the question of statutory immunity by reason of passage of time, the letter concluded by expressing the hope that the materials enclosed “are helpful to the council in considering the matter further… We believe that a response from you would be appropriate before putting the matter to a judge for consideration.” On 13 May 2011 the Council wrote: “At present, the Council’s position is that the use of the site is a mixed agricultural/industrial use with the industrial element predominant this [sic] that this use has occurred for more than ten years and would therefore be likely to be immune from enforcement. Independent legal advice to the Council is that there is an established use at the site without any limit, either in respect of the amount of watercress that can be grown or in respect of the salad that can be imported or processed. This is the Council’s considered view on the basis of the site having been deemed, by the Council, to have acquired the lawful use of mixed agricultural/ industrial use with the industrial element predominant.

It asserted that to the extent that the letter did not represent a  decision the Council was deemed to have “decided not to consider whether or not to take enforcement action against the interested  party and [to have] made this decision without providing any reasons for so doing].” That was a reference to order 3(1) of the Order of HH Judge Anthony Thornton QC dated 13 May 2011 that “unless the Defendant has responded to the Claimant by Wednesday 19 May 2011 in a way and with reasons which enables the Claimant to decide to withdraw its judicial review claim, the Claimant is to comply with the directions as issued on the basis that the Defendant has decided not to consider whether or not to take enforcement action against the interested party and has made this decision without providing any reasons for so doing.” That he said constituted a marginal adjustment to the directions which he had already made requiring the Defendant to file supplementary grounds based on the Councils’ presumed decision not to enforce again the industrial use of the site.

Given that no EIA was undertaken of the industrial use of the site which was EIA development that development was unlawful under the EIA regime. Section 191(2) of the TCPA provides that uses are lawful if they are immune from enforcement “for the purposes of this Act”. That did not mean that there is not a breach of the Directive.

The concession was initially made by Mr Mould towards the end of the fourth day of the hearing with a view to avoiding the need for the parties to develop oral submissions on the complex factual and legal questions arising out of Mr Evans’ contention that the changes in use at the site constituted a breach of Article 2(1) of the Directive in that they had not been preceded by development consent or environmental impact assessment.  The time estimate of two days agreed between the parties had proved to be a significant underestimate even if the application had been heard by a specialist planning judge.  In the event it lasted 5 days.  In the form in which it was originally made the concession was qualified by the words “it is arguable that”.   Mr Mould had accepted that it was arguable that by reason of the change of use prior to 2000 there was a project which required development consent and environmental impact assessment.  As I understood it the reasons for that qualification were both factual and legal.  Mr Mould did not accept that it was clear that the changes prior to 2000 constituted a change from agricultural and ancillary industrial use to agricultural with predominant industrial use.  Further he did not accept that the incremental nature of what occurred over a period of time in terms of change of use required either development consent or environmental impact assessment as a matter of EU law. </p>

However when Mr McCracken came to reply it became apparent that he was not content to proceed on the basis of a qualified concession which would leave open the question whether the change in use prior to 2000 constituted a breach of EU law.  After much heated discussion Mr Mould indicated that he was prepared to withdraw the “arguability” qualification to his concession in the interest of confining the issues to be decided under Ground 4 to the question whether the domestic statutory time limits in the TCPA were compatible with EU law and whether the Council was obliged to make a section 102 order.

It is whether the statutory immunity from enforcement action by reason of the effluxion of time conferred by section 171B of the TCPA is incompatible with Article 2(1) of the Directive and must be disapplied by the English Court.  The second is whether the Court should order the Council to serve a section 102 order.

Such an appeal would have given rise to a deemed application for planning permission under section 177(5) which the Secretary of State would have had to decide.  That would have required the Secretary of State to determine whether the existing use was development requiring environmental impact assessment. To do that he would have made a screening direction in respect of the existing use which was undoubtedly Schedule II development to see if it was likely to give rise to a significant environmental effect, following which he would either have directed an environmental statement to be produced or stated why he did not consider that it was likely to give rise to a significant environmental effect.</p>

Since the council was unable to determine appropriate conditions for development within three months of the application it considered that it was deemed to have granted permission on the company’s conditions by virtue of paragraph 2(6)(b).  The applicant, a retired quarry engineer who lived nearby, applied for judicial review of the council’s decision seeking a declaration that paragraph 2(6)(b) failed to give effect to the Directive and its requirement that Member States should ensure that an assessment was made of any significant environmental effects before giving development consent for development of the kind proposed and should be suspended.

Under European law the court could give direct effect to an unimplemented Directive and treating an environmental impact statement as a uniform pre-requisite of a determination did not touch any legal relationship between the company and the applicant.  Accordingly the applicant was entitled to rely on the direct effect of the Directive as against the council as an emanation of the state and the council and the company were obliged to treat the statutory default provision for the deemed grant of permission as ineffective.

Paragraph 2(6)(b) purported to confer default approval of planning conditions if the Council did not determine the appropriate conditions within three months.  Sedley LJ held that the 1991 Act not only manifestly failed to require an environmental impact assessment as a pre-condition of making a determination as to conditions insofar as it is deemed a determination to have been made in the circumstances described in paragraph 2(6)(b), but it positively encouraged a developer to withhold a statement in the knowledge that the resulting deadlock would shortly be resolved by operation of law in the developer’s favour.  This he said had been recognised by the UK Government which was at an advanced stage of consultation on the best means of bringing national law into conformity with the Directive and in the interim had strongly advised voluntary compliance.  (1490D-E).  By contrast in this case the question is whether provisions which impose a 10 year time limitation for a council to bring enforcement action and provide that where there has been no such enforcement action existing use becomes lawful satisfy the conditions of certainty and effectiveness such that they are not incompatible with the Directive and thus do not fall to be disapplied on <span style="font-style:italic">Simmenthal </span> principles. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in">“27. In other words, to achieve its proper purpose, [sic] does not exempt any project with those characteristics from assessment, with the result that,<span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:9.5pt"> </span>although the national public authorities have a wide discretion, Community law precludes implementation of such projects without prior authorisation and, if appropriate, without assessment of their impact, where implementation becomes irreversible with the passage of time.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in">28. That is precisely the effect of the United Kingdom system, which, as the case of the scrap yard over which these proceedings arose demonstrates, and as the defendant Government accepts, allows action to be taken in breach of the Directive, without prior evaluation or impact assessment, and to be legitimised by the passage of time so that the situation can no longer be remedied.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in">30. It is of little importance whether the ground of the breach relates to the date on which the local authorities, in the exercise of their discretion, took no action or to the point in time when the LDC was issued, precluding any breach; it is of still less relevance whether the certificate in question is in the nature of a decision or is merely declaratory. The crucial point is that, for reasons of convenience, it was decided not to intervene and a situation in breach of [sic]arose, whereas, wide as the discretion of the administration is, it may not give rise to a result contrary to the central objective of the Community legislation set out in Article 2(1) thereof.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in">31. Without doubt, as the United Kingdom Government pointed out in paragraph 89 of its defence, reiterating paragraph 20 of its response to the reasoned opinion of the Commission, the discretion under discussion is not unfettered, since it would otherwise border on arbitrariness. Therefore, the competent authorities have to assess in each case whether to put an end to the breach because it unacceptably affects public amenity or whether, rather, it is necessary to allow the unlawful use of the property to continue in the public interest, despite its negative effect on the environment. However, the availability of that option reveals the breach complained of by the Commission, since it opens the door to situations where, weighing up the requirements at issue, 'the planning authority may decide to exercise its discretion not to bring enforcement proceedings. And it is here that any possible breach of the Directive could occur' (final part of paragraph 20 of the response to the reasoned opinion).</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in">32. Therefore, the debate should not focus on whether it is appropriate for national legislation to provide for a limitation period for enforcement action in respect of breaches of Community law, such that, once that period has expired, no remedy is available, as a general principle entailed by the principle of legal certainty.  Rather, it is a matter of analysing whether, regardless of the passage of time, the United Kingdom legislation allows the possibility that activities included in the first two annexes to [sic] might be carried out without approval and without the required consent; as we have already seen, that question must be answered unequivocally in the affirmative.</p>

If those responsible for monitoring the lawfulness of town planning do not react on learning that a facility is operating without an assessment of its effects on the environment having been carried out, or, where its scale is evident, do not require its assessment, they are tacitly consenting to it and, thereby, contravening the Directive. The fact that, by reason of the passage of time and in the light of the principle of legal certainty, it was not appropriate to take enforcement action, does not make conduct which was previously on the margins of the law 'lawful'; it merely precludes any reassessment of the past in order to safeguard the stability of legal relations, which is one of the pillars of our co-existence in society. That conclusion does not preclude those harmed by the unlawful conduct from obtaining compensation on other grounds such as the responsibility of the State in breach to safeguard property rights, which the position of the United Kingdom Government would undermine.</p>

To that extent there is in my judgment at least some support, in the fact and reasons for the dismissal by the Court of the Commission’s action, for the proposition that the Advocate General’s Opinion must be treated with some caution in that there was no argument addressed based on the EU authorities which uphold domestic legislation as being compatible with EU law provided it satisfies the principles of certainty and effectiveness.  </p>

The Judge held that a failure in such circumstances to take enforcement action which could have either prevented the time limit from expiring or led to an EIA on appeal was incompatible with the objectives of the Directive.  It was not concerned with the situation which falls for decision in this case, namely whether, where the statutory time limit has expired and the immunity from enforcement action has been conferred, the statutory provision must itself be disapplied as being incompatible with the Directive.

The premise of that opinion was, in my judgment, an acceptance of the compatibility of section 171B, if not also of section 191, with the Directive by reason of the principle of legal certainty.  The reference to safeguarding the stability of legal relations in my judgment suggests that the Advocate General considered that not only section 171B but also section 191 were compatible with the Directive, since it is the declaration of lawfulness pursuant to section 191 which safeguards the stability of existing legal relations insofar as it protects the rights of owners and/or operators of a site whose operations have become deemed to be lawful as a result of the impossibility of further enforcement action.</p>

In my view it does not follow from the primacy of Community law that a national court must in all circumstances set aside procedural rules which prevent a question of community law from being raised at a particular stage in the proceedings.  What the primacy of Community law requires in the first place is a general rule that, when a national court is confronted with a conflict between a substantive provision of national law and a substantive provision of Community law, the Community provision should prevail.  It is easy to see that, in the absence of such a general rule, Community law would be a dead letter.</p>

However, the approach consistently taken over the years by the Courts suggests that what is sufficient to satisfy the public interest in this respect corresponds precisely to the well established principles already referred to, namely the principles that national courts must ensure the enforcement of Community rights where they are invoked in national proceedings in accordance with national procedural rules; and that the national rules need only be disapplied where they make it impossible or unduly difficult for those rights to be enforced….</p>

Moreover, if the view were taken that national procedural rules must always yield to Community law, that would, as will appear below, unduly subvert established principles underlying the legal systems of the Member States.  It would go further than is necessary for effective judicial protection.  It could be regarded as infringing the principle of proportionality and, in a broad sense, the principle of subsidiarity, which reflects precisely the balance which the Court has sought to maintain in this area for many years.  It would also give rise to widespread anomalies, since the effect would be to afford greater protection to rights which are not, by virtue of being Community rights, inherently of greater importance than rights recognised by national law.  It too, for example, can scarcely be argued that Mr van Schijndel’s and Mr van Veen’s putative right under Community law to choose their own insurance scheme is more important and merits greater protection than, for example, the right of a plaintive to recover damages for personal injury.   </p>

The imposition by Member States of a reasonable time-limit for taking legal proceedings to challenge a decision cannot be considered to make reliance on Community law virtually impossible or excessively difficult.  Such time-limits are an application of  the principle of legal certainty protecting both individuals and administrations.  The need for legal certainty in matters of taxation is demonstrated particularly by the present case.

It does so by precluding the taking of such enforcement action after the end of a period of years whose length depends on the nature of the breach of planning control.  It is in my judgment a provision whose function is essentially procedural.  It regulates the time within which a planning authority may take enforcement action to secure compliance with the requirement of the Directive that there should be, if appropriate, an environmental impact assessment and indirectly regulates the time within which interested or affected parties may seek to acquire a local planning authority to take such enforcement action to secure compliance with the Directive by instituting judicial review proceedings.  </p>

Applying those principles to the facts of this case, if either of the two outline planning permissions required and/or were not the subject of valid screening exercise, there was a clear domestic remedy, if exercised promptly, for quashing either of them and/or the screening opinion at the leisure park outline permission stage. The domestic requirement of promptness in the exercise of the remedy, as Miss Robinson observed, strikes a reasonable balance between the need to provide a remedy and, in this instance, the public interest in the effective administration of planning controls and legal certainty. Accordingly, in my view, this challenge to the reserved matters screening opinion was not deprived of effect by the Council's reliance on the formal validity of the outline permissions and the screening opinion in relation to the latter, since they had been challengeable by judicial review, if sought promptly - a sufficient remedy as a matter of community law."</p>

In 2003 Vitacress applied for planning permission to extend buildings on the site describing the existing use in terms which would have enabled an objector such as Mr Evans to challenge the lawfulness of its and invite the Council to take enforcement action by reason of the lack of an EIA in respect of it and failing that to institute judicial proceedings to require it to do so.  The same he submitted was the case in the previous year.  Vitacress had made successive planning applications identifying the range of processes carried on at the site. </p>

While it is possible to imagine hypothetical circumstances in which a change of use is concealed from public sight requiring special provision (see section 124 of the Localism Act 2011 inserting section 171BA, into the TCPA), I accept that general proposition.  Indeed the fact that special provision was made for concealed breaches of planning law while leaving otherwise unchanged the time limits in section 171B in my judgment shows that further careful consideration was given to the reasonableness of the 171B time limits when the Localism Bill was under consideration and discussion.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The statutory time limit for enforcement action contained in section 171B were imposed in response to the report of Robert Carnwath QC, as he then was, entitled “Enforcing Planning Control” published in February 1989 for the Department of Environment.  The Report gave careful and detailed consideration to the time limits for enforcement and the factors that had to be balanced in arriving at appropriate limitation period (see paragraph 3.4 at page 69).  In particular he considered whether it would be appropriate to adopt a single limitation period of six years for all enforcement action in line with the normal limitation period in a civil action (see paragraph 3.10 at page 71).  The proposal that there should be provision for changes of use to be legitimised after ten years without enforcement action was one of the main recommendations of that report.  It was a considered recommendation for the rationalisation of the provisions for established uses and other immunities (see paragraph 1.3(ii) at page 62).  I accept Mr Mould’s submission that the ten year time limit in section 171B(3) was drafted carefully and reflected a reasonable attempt to strike a balance between the need for certainty on the part of users, operators and owners of property and the obligation of the United Kingdom and of local planning authorities to secure proper compliance with the requirement for securing EIA where appropriate.  The principle of certainty has an obvious and important role to play in assessing the reasonableness of limitation periods, as was pointed out by Advocate General Jacobs in paragraph 64 of his Opinion in <span style="font-style:italic">Denkavit.  </span>I accept Mr Mould’s submission that having regard to this background and all the circumstances to which I have referred, application of the principle laid down in  <span style="font-style:italic">Peterbroeck </span>to section 171B leads to the conclusion that it does not render application of the Directive impossible or excessively difficult.  </p>

It follows that I do not accept the Claimant’s fourth ground of challenge to the decision of the Council dated 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2010 to grant planning permission, namely that in assuming that the site’s established mixed agricultural/industrial use with the industrial element predominant was lawful by reason of acquired immunity for the industrial use under section 171B the Council misdirected itself.  (In fact the conclusion reached by the Council was that use of the site would be <span style="font-weight:bold">likely</span> to be immune from enforcement because it occurred more than ten years earlier, as advised by the officers in the Officers’ Report.)

The discontinuance power under section 102 would be superfluous and unlikely to attract the Council since it would risk having to pay compensation which risk would not arise in the case of an enforcement action.

That was partly because the power to make an order under section 102 is not dependent on proof of illegality and partly because immunity not being a prohibition against the making of an order where domestic law has been broken the principle of equivalence must have the same effect where there has been a breach of EU law.</p>

The making of a section 102 order is a potentially draconian matter.  Vitacress is a thriving business employing a very large number of people whose livelihoods depend upon its continuing its existing use of the site.  Section 102 appears in the planning section of the TCPA (Part 3) and not the enforcement section (Part 7).  It is a discretionary power which is exercisable on its face only if, having regard to the development plan and to any other material considerations, it appears to a local planning authority that it is expedient in the interests of the proper planning of their area (including the interests of immunity) that any use of land should be discontinued or that any conditions should be imposed on the continuance of a use of land or that any buildings or works should be altered or removed.  Not least because of the potential seriously adverse consequences on Vitacress and its employees and because of the obligation on the Council to pay compensation if such an order is made, any decision whether to make such an order would ordinarily be expected to be taken by the Council only after careful consideration and, it is to be assumed, after having given an opportunity to interested parties to make representations.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Mould submitted that in the circumstances of this case it would not be appropriate for the court to make a declaration that the existing development at the site is unlawful.  In my judgment such a declaration would be inappropriate.  First, as I have held, the existing use is immune from enforcement by reason of section 171B which is not incompatible with the Directive.  Second, without deciding the point, I see force in Mr Mould’s submission that to grant such relief to Mr Evans would be inconsistent with the effect of the immunity and also with the consequential effect of section 191(2) whereby for the purposes of the TCPA uses are lawful at any time if no enforcement action may then be taken in respect of them because the time for an enforcement action has expired.  Mr McCracken accepted that paradoxically section 191(2) complies with the principle of certainty.  I see force in the argument that there is no material difference between the certainty flowing from section 191(2) and that flowing from section 171(B).  Part of the reasoning of Advocate General Jacobs in <span style="font-style:italic">Denkavit</span> in holding that appropriate limitation periods laid down by national law are not incompatible with EU law was the need for legal certainty.  He gave by way of an example that if companies were able to claim reimbursement of the levies paid over the last 20 years that would entail very serious consequences for the finances of the Chambers of Trade and Industry (paragraph 64).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In the current context it is in my judgment clear that an essential part of the purpose of the limitation periods laid down by section 171(B) is precisely to confer certainty on users and operators. It is hard to see a significant difference between that certainty and the certainty conferred by the resulting effect of section 191(2).  I see the force of Mr Mould’s submission that that certainty would be undermined if an affected person such as Mr Evans who is prevented from requiring the Council to serve an enforcement notice on Vitacress requiring it to cease its existing use were nonetheless entitled to a declaration of illegality.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In any event I see no practical utility for such a declaration.  As appears earlier the argument on Ground 4 proceeded ultimately on the basis of a reluctant concession made in order to enable the immunity point to be decided.  Mr Mould and Ms Parry expressly reserved their positions should the matter go further.  Since I have rejected the submission that 171B immunity should be disapplied, such a declaration would not be a necessary precondition for the making of an order under section 102 which, as I have indicated, does not depend upon proof of illegality. </p>

In my judgment the reality is that although there was the odd reference to section 102 in some of the earlier documents, Mr Evans never demanded that the Council should make a section 102 order even if enforcement was not a legal avenue open to it and that failure to make such an order would be unlawful.  There is no evidence that the Council has considered the question whether it should make a section 102 order in order either to procure a cessation of the existing use either permanently or pending a planning application by Vitacress for the existing use.  For those reasons I decline to direct the Council to make such an order.  </p>
