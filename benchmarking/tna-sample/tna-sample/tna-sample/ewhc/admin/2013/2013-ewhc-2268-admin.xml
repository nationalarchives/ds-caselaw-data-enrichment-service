	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This is a case about salami slicing. It is a claim for judicial review of the decision of the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government dated 6 January 2012 that Environmental Impact Assessment should not be required for the demolition of a Victorian Chapel in the Klondyke area of Sefton.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The principal ground of challenge is the assertion that the Secretary of State’s failure to consider the demolition as part of the Phase 2 and 3 demolition and redevelopment proposals of the Sefton Metropolitan Borough Council (“the Council”) in the Klondyke area and his failure to have regard to the impact of the project or to consider the cumulative effects of the demolition was unlawful. The second ground is an assertion that the Secretary of State’s reasons for considering that the impact of the demolition together with the redevelopment of the chapel site and the previous clearance and the further redevelopment of Phase 1 were not likely to give rise to significant effects were neither adequate nor intelligible.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Under its first ground of challenge the Claimant argues that as a matter of fact the Council’s proposed demolition of the Chapel was part of a larger project comprising Phases 2 and 3 of its proposed redevelopment of the Klondyke area of Sefton. Accordingly the Secretary of State was obliged in his screening direction to consider the demolition of the Chapel not on its own but as part of that larger project. His assertion that screening of Phases 2 and 3 was premature because no application for prior approval had been made with respect to it and his consequent consideration of the effects of the Chapel demolition without regard to any other demolition or redevelopment in Phases 2 and 3 was unlawful.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">On behalf of the Secretary of State Mr Forsdick submitted that “salami slicing” is the term applied to the splitting up of projects into small sub-projects with the effect of each part coming below the thresholds for Environmental Impact Assessment (“EIA”) and therefore avoiding (whether deliberately or not) the need for EIA. In the two leading Spanish cases a single long distance rail construction project was split into small “local” projects with the result that the section in question ( and the project as a whole) was not subject to EIA (<span style="font-style:italic">Commission v Spain</span> [2005] Env LR 20 [52]-[54] and a single project for the upgrade of the Madrid Ring road was split into 15 sub-projects with the result that the section in question (or the project as a whole) was not subject to EIA (<span style="font-style:italic">Ecologistas nen Accion v Ayuntamiento de Madid</span> [2009] PTSR 458 [25], [44]-[45]. In both cases it was held that that approach was impermissible under the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive 2011/92/EU (“the Directive”). It impermissibly constituted what is commonly called “salami slicing”. The true project was in each case in fact the wider whole – the complete ring road or the long distance train line.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Forsdick submitted that the legal principle applicable on the facts of this case is that at the screening stage a project should not be considered in isolation if in reality it is properly to be regarded as an integral part of an inevitably more substantial development – see the test enunciated by Simon Brown LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">R v Swale BC ex parte RSPB </span>[1991] JBL 39. However it was submitted that there is a distinction between projects which are an integral part of an inevitably more substantial development which Mr Forsdick submitted involves a single project being split into parts as in the two Spanish cases and individual projects which are justified on their merits and/or which would be pursued independently of some wider policy, even if the development, or as in this case the demolition, involved could at some future point also be part of a more comprehensive proposal. In the latter case there is no salami slicing and no unlawful or impermissible avoidance of the EIA regime.</p>

The Orrell Chapel, Springwell Road, Sefton, also known as the Welsh Presbyterian Church (“the Chapel”) was built in 1902.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In April 2002 the previous Government launched the housing market renewal initiative (“HMRI”) which was aimed at tackling issues of empty housing and neighbourhood decline within Pathfinder areas. The initiative provided money to help restructure the housing market so that housing could be redeveloped. Klondyke is an area of Sefton dominated by small two-storey Victorian terraced housing with no front or back gardens.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In July 2004 the Council published Supplementary Planning Guidance (“SPG”) in relation to Klondyke. The Council stated that it would use the guidance as a material consideration when deciding on development proposals within the Klondyke and Hawthorn Road area. It set out in more detail how the Council would apply the policies of the draft Sefton Unitary Development Plan and would expect developers to show how their proposals dealt with the issues covered in the guidance when putting forward planning applications. It stated that it would use the document to make sure that the right development took place at the right time and to support its use of compulsory acquisition powers if necessary. It further stated that the SPG identified where redevelopment would take place and where new homes would be built. It stated that some of the proposals in the document might need to be revised and updated. It further stated that it would use the information contained in the SPG to prepare development briefs for the area which would provide more detailed information about how the new areas would be developed, including where new shops and open space would be located and which areas would be redeveloped for industrial and commercial use in respect of which there would be consultation.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The SPG stated that it was one of a number of planning policy documents that would be relevant to redevelopment proposals in the area and a diagram showing how it fitted in to the hierarchy of planning policy documents showed that it fitted in beneath the emerging unitary development plan and design and development briefs which in turn came before planning applications.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The SPG stated that the Council would support development proposals for the Klondyke and Hawthorn Road corridor area if they would help to regenerate the neighbourhood in a planned way and reflected the phasing requirements set out in the Guidance. Those requirements were set out in four tables which referred to three phases. The first table was headed “Klondyke phase development programme, units to be cleared and sites identified for re-housing”. Each phase identified a number of units to be cleared; Phase 1 was headed 2004-2008. Phase 2 was headed 2006-2009 and Phase 3 was headed 2008-2012. Phase 1 provided for 320 units to be cleared, Phase 2 380 and Phase 3 130. The fourth table stated that there would be no re-housing potential in phase 3 “as this is the last area to be developed” but that the area covered by phase 3 would be able to accommodate 40 new homes in the long term. Phase 2 would have the potential for re-housing 165 but would not be available until current residents were re-housed. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Chapel was described as a landmark providing “variety and interest within the built environment” which should be preserved.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In November 2004 the Council published a Development Brief to guide future redevelopment of the Klondyke and Canal Corridor area. It was to be read in conjunction with the Supplementary Planning Guidance. It was stated that the redevelopment of the sites covered by the brief (Phases 1 and 2) would be phased to ensure the successful relocation of the existing residents, community facilities, shops and businesses within the Klondyke estate who wished to stay in the local area.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Development Brief did not in its text refer to Phase 3. However it included a map which identified sites subject to Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 development respectively. The Chapel was shown in Phase 3 development to become open space as part of an enlarged Aspinall’s Field and the Brief identified the provision of green space from different development phases. Preferred sites for green space were identified as adjacent to the canal and at the extended Aspinall’s Field which in the map included Klondyke Phase 3. It also stated that the remaining areas identified in Figure 1 of the SPG (ie Phase 3) were not the subject of the Development Brief. Further development briefs would be produced for those sites at a later date. </p>

The report said that the Chapel was “currently included in the last phase of the redevelopment proposals and that initial discussions had been held with the Pastor and Sefton MBC about acquiring the Church building”. It stated that the Chapel’s “future in the Supplementary Planning Guidance is for eventual acquisition and demolition to make way for open space.” [This appears to have been incorrect – see paragraph 12 above.] We believe that a feasibility study should be carried out to consider the retention of this building in the future”. The report stated that the Chapel’s location in Phase 3 of the development programme meant that it offered the community the opportunity for medium to long term use as a community facility. I was told that this report has been on the Council’s website since 2006. </p>

It had therefore been proposed by the council and agreed by Adactus that they were prepared to enter into a licence agreement with the Council which would permit the council to demolish terraces and groups of properties owned in their entirety by the council and Adactus when they became vacant. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Because of the restriction on resources it was unlikely that much demolition in phase 2 and 3 of the Klondyke would be achieved in the current financial year but with the licence in place vacant blocks could be demolished swiftly as resources became available. The conclusion was that entering into a licence agreement with Adactus would enable the Council quickly to demolish property in the Klondyke area as resources became available, thus reducing the risk of crime and antisocial behaviour related to vacant properties and reducing security costs for the Council and Adactus.</p>

In such circumstances there will not be time to apply for PNA. In such cases the developer must give retrospective justification for the demolition.

The site would be cleared and levelled and redeveloped at a future date and in the vicinity another site had already been cleared on Springwell Road within the wider Klondyke area other sites had been cleared and were being or were about to be redeveloped.

The latter words echoed criterion 1(b) in Schedule 3 “the cumulation with other development”, albeit that criterion appears in Schedule 3 under the heading “Characteristics of development” and not under the heading “Characteristics of the potential impact”.</p>

In late 2007 the Presbyterian Church of Wales took the decision to sell the building. On 1 May 2008 it was sold at auction to K and K Estates Limited, a property development company from London. Shortly after purchasing the building the new owners discovered that the title to the building contained connexional covenants which prevented K and K Estates Limited from developing the site and the building was left empty and unused. </p>

It resulted in the evacuation of nearby residents because of fears that the fire would spread to nearby properties. In that incident the roof structure of the main building and rear hall was extensively damaged resulting in the loss of the roof covering and irreparable damage to roof timbers which were not capable of re-use. The suspended wooden floor of the main building and rear hall was also damaged beyond repair and was now incapable of re-use. The internal decoration and the fixtures and fittings were badly damaged and would have to be renewed if the building was brought back into use. The only area of the building to escape extensive damage in the fire was a small room housed in the front turret.</p>

That decision had nothing whatsoever to do with avoiding the need to carry out an EIA. In fact following the decision taken by the church elders that the building was surplus to requirements the Council looked at options to find a long term use for it and held discussions with local community groups that were looking for a facility in the area. Unfortunately nothing came of those discussions and the Welsh Presbyterians sold the building at auction to private individuals who could not deliver development and who failed to secure the use of the building as a community facility. It was while the building was owned by that new owner that it was first damaged by fire. Faced with a badly damaged building in a regeneration area which was purchased by a developer who could not make an alternative scheme work and with no available funding or identified long term use it was decided to pursue demolition. It was the Council’s view that given its type size and condition as well as its location it was not economically viable to refurbish the building and bring back in to use. To date no organisation had submitted to the Council a business plan setting out how it could be viably refurbished.  </p>

That is either because the application is part of a larger project, as in the ECJ judgments in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Commission v Spain [2005]ENV.L.R.20, Ecologistas En Accion-CODA v Ayuntamiento de Madrid C-142/07 [P.T.S.R. 458] and Karnten v Kartner Andesregierung C-205/08 [2010] [ENV.L.R.15]</span> or because it has a cumulative effect with other projects.  It was common ground that EIA cannot be avoided by splitting up “the proposals” into a series of applications.  There were he submitted two dangers: the first that EIA is avoided entirely, the second that EIA takes place so late in the process, when many elements have been approved, that environmental harm has taken place without proper assessment. It is not appropriate to allow elements of “the project” to proceed and then to carry out an assessment at a later stage encompassing the earlier acts of demolition.  He drew attention in this regard to recital 2 of the Directive and in particular the last sentence thereof:</p>

But the further question arising in respect of a Schedule 2 development, the question whether “it would be likely to have significant effects on the environment by virtue of factors such as its nature, size or location” should, in my judgment, be answered rather differently.  The proposal should not then be considered in isolation if in reality it is properly to be regarded as an integral part of an inevitably more substantial development. This approach appears to me appropriate on the language of the regulations, the existence of the smaller development of itself promoting the larger development and thereby likely to carry in its wake the environmental effects of the latter.  In common sense, moreover, developers could otherwise defeat the object of the Regulations by piecemeal development proposals.”</p>

Alternatively if there was any room for a contrary view the Secretary of State failed to have regard to relevant considerations and was required to provide full reasons for such a view but did not do so.  </p>

He failed to mention or deal with the documents which describe demolition of the Chapel as part of the HMR program - ie the Development Brief, the 24 October 2011 letter and the prior approval applications.  He failed to mention the Community Facilities Report which contradicted his position.  He failed to produce any documents supporting his rationale.  As to his statement that the Chief Officer Report of 13 January 2012 was to pursue demolition “in order to remove the risk and blight posed by the damaged church”, Mr Lunt did not exhibit the report and it was only subsequently provided when the Claimant’s solicitors referred the Council to Part 31 of the CPR.  That report did not in fact contain the claimed reason but instead referred to the HMR program of demolition and clearance.  Mr Lunt claimed that the Council had discussions with community groups about the future of the Chapel but the Council had since said that it had no documents relating to that.  He exhibited two plans dated October 2012 showing the Chapel and Springwell Court outside Phases two and Three.  However those documents, prepared for the purposes of litigation, were not compatible with the October 2011 letter which included those properties in the Phases.  </p>

If that was correct the study proceeded under a major mistake as to the community facilities which would be retained.  It was not credible that such an error would not have been corrected by Council officers before the report was accepted.  Instead it was published by the Council on their website and it was reported to Cabinet.  This alleged error was only raised seven years later.  The Council was incapable of answering directly the question as whether the prior approval application forms were correct to say that the reason why the demolition needed to take place was that the Chapel was part of the Housing Market Renewal Initiative.  </p>

He relied in this context on the references in the AMEC Bat report, which was on the Council website and which the Secretary of State had at the time of the 6 January 2012 decision as well as the photographs in that report of the state of the Chapel. “It is derelict and presents a health and safety risk” … “severely dilapidated state, having been subject to numerous arson attacks…The roof has largely collapsed as a result of vandalism and is only partially intact.” This he submitted was consistent with the position of the Council as communicated to the Secretary of State in the letter dated 24 October 2011, namely that the Council had stand alone proposals which would be pursued pending comprehensive proposals coming forward.

The fact that he said that the Council had acquired the Chapel to demolish it and incorporate it into the proposed open space was effectively a concession that it was part of the HMR programme. The empty properties referred to by Mr Lunt which bounded the Chapel on one side were because of the HMR Programme and in particular the Council’s purchase of homes for demolition in phases 2 and 3. </p>

It was headed “HMRI Demolition Programme 1B Demolition of Springwell Church”. It explained the background as being that that programme made provision for the phased demolition and site clearance in Klondyke.

None of the material supported the Secretary of State’s present assertion that the demolition was a separate and independent proposal. There was no evidence that demolition would have been proposed if the site had not been included in the HMRI Programme. Indeed it was unlikely that the Chapel would have got in to the condition it was in if the area was not being vacated for demolition and the Chapel had been acquired for that purpose. The timing of the demolition might have been brought forward because of its condition but the demolition was still part of the wider programme.</p>

Whether a screening direction should be made over the entirety of phases 2 and 3 in advance of application for their demolition was a separate matter from the need lawfully to screen the application for the demolition of the Chapel.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Secretary of State’s decision therefore fell in to error in the following ways. First he failed to have regard to material considerations, failing to deal with the evidence in the documents relied on by the Claimant that the proposed Chapel demolition was part of the wider HMRI Programme. Second his failure to consider what was the project was in breach of the requirements of Schedule 3 paragraph 1(a) of the 2011 Regulations which provide that the characteristics of development must be considered having regard in particular to the size of the development. Third there was no evidence on which a conclusion could be reached that the demolition was an independent project. Fourth any conclusion that it was an independent project was irrational in light of the evidence and the conclusion in the screening analysis that demolition of the Chapel would facilitate the redevelopment of the area for housing in accordance with the Development Brief SPG. Fifth is was an error of law to disregard future demolition and redevelopment which had not yet been applied for. Sixth (and this overlapped with the second ground of challenge) neither the reasoned screening direction nor the EIA Analysis, which was not part of the statutory reasons, addressed this issue clearly precisely fully or at all. If the Secretary of State (or in reality Ms Lewis) considered those issues it was not possible to tell how he did so. </p>

The first is that no EIA will be required at all because each application is considered in isolation. The second alternative danger is that if the screening exercise looks at the current application and its preceding applications there may come a point at which those amount to likely significant effects. But by that stage the earlier applications would have been approved and nothing could be done about them. On the facts of this case if the demolition and redevelopment of phases 2 and 3 including the Chapel would be likely to give rise to significant effects on the environment then a planning application and EIA would be required. If the screening decision only considered the application which was before the Secretary of State together with any earlier applications, the conclusion that EIA was required would be reached after demolition of the Chapel had been allowed. In that case even though a later EIA would consider the effect of demolishing the Chapel together with the balance of phases 2 and 3, it would be too late to affect whether the Chapel should be retained. The purpose of requiring EIA at the earliest possible stage before development is authorised would therefore be frustrated. </p>

In this case the proposed demolition of the Chapel was part of a wider project comprising not only phases 2 and 3 but also phase 1 of the Housing Market Renewal Programme. That was the reason given by the developer (who in this case is also the Council) and that was consistent with every relevant document from November 2004 to January 2012. The Council’s policies included the demolition of the Chapel in the overall project, i.e the Development Brief. The Council was carrying out its own policy. In phases 2 and 3 that included the acquisition of properties, leaving them vacant, demolishing some buildings and ultimately intending to demolish all of them. The Council continued to pursue that policy for example in the 28 October 2010 cabinet report, the Transitional Fund bid and the 24 October 2011 letters. While there may be cases where future cases are so uncertain and the immediate application is being pursued for its own merits such that the future stages can be disregarded, this case was not one of them. </p>

First that appeared to be a reference to the Council’s letter dated 24 October 2011 which did not propose a single application. It referred to a comprehensive method statement but not to a single application. It was silent on a single application and in fact envisaged some earlier demolition. Indeed the Secretary of State’s EIA Analysis referred to proposals for phases 2 and 3 coming forward for elements or the whole. Since the screening decision a demolition application had been made for part only of phase 2, namely nos 106, 110, 112 Monfar Road on 4 April 2012. Second the Secretary of State’s reliance on a future large scale application for phases 2 and 3 did not address the second danger flowing from a failure to consider the wider project of which a current application is a part until the later parts of the wider application are applied for. If, when there is an application for the demolition and/or development of the remainder of phases 2 and 3 an EIA is required it would be too late to save the Chapel and any other building which had been demolished in the meantime. For those buildings it would be EIA after rather than before the event. </p>

On the other hand Article 4.2 of the Directive provides that when a case-by-case examination is carried out as well as when thresholds or criteria are set for the purpose of determining whether a project should be made subject to an EIA the relevant selection criteria set out in Annex III shall be taken into account. Those criteria include “the cumulation with other projects” (see paragraph 1(b) of Annex III). Thus the Directive requires the cumulation with other projects to be taken in to account by Member States in determining whether a project shall be made subject to an EIA when a case-by-case examination is carried out as well as when the determination is made through thresholds or criteria set by the Member States. Since the purpose of the 2011 Regulations is to implement the Directive it may be that the power under Regulation 4(9) to direct that development is EIA development should be construed as being subject to the same obligation to have regard in making the decision such of the selection criteria set out in Schedule 3 including in particular the cumulation with other development in paragraph 1(b) thereof as are relevant to the development.</p>

First it can arise at the stage of identifying what is the “project” or “development” whose likely effects on the environment fall to be considered. Is it only the proposal for which planning consent is sought irrespective of which screening direction is sought or is it that proposal together with a wider project or development of which it is alleged to be a part?

That was necessary in order that the Directive’s goal of prevention could be fully achieved. The most important decision from an environmental point of view in connection with construction of roads was the route it would take. The planning for long road links such as the one in point takes place in stages – assessment of need, regional planning, route – whereby the decision concerning the overall linear route, although not binding for the final decision on the route for specific project sections, would nevertheless invariably limit the options of the project developer. To limit the obligation to carry out an EIA to specifically planned sections carried the risk of a significant restriction of the EIA’s practical importance. Projects which had already been executed in respect of part of longer road links – which perhaps in isolation appeared not to have given rise to significant environmental problems – might mean that later, in connection with planning approval for other sections, on practical grounds sufficient account would not be taken of serious environmental problems revealed by the EIAs undertaken for those sections. If, for example, sections A and C which had already been constructed were to be linked up by section B, the planning approval for the construction of sections A and C would mean that the feasibility of the planning authority’s selecting an alternative route for section B was severely restricted.

It was to be treated as a project for the construction of a line for long-distance traffic because it was part of a 251 kilometre railway line between Valencia and Tarragona which formed part of the “project” known as the “Mediterranean corridor” linking the Spanish region of Levante to Catalonia and the French boarder. </p>

That is of course to be expected since the selection criterion of “the cumulation with other projects” in paragraph 1b of Annex III of the Directive only requires to be taken into account under Article 4(3) when a case-by-case examination is carried out or thresholds or criteria are set for the purpose of paragraph 2 of Article 4 in respect of projects listed in Annex II.

The Advocate General, expressing the same opinion as that of the Court on this point, stated that if Spain’s reasoning were followed it would mean that a specific project would never be regarded as involving long-distance traffic because the successive sections of the line would all cover small distances and would connect neighbouring places. Adopting Spain’s suggested interpretation of the Directive would be likely to restrict its scope considerably and to jeopardise the attainment of its objectives.</p>

Nor did it state that the effects on the environment of the other sections of the 251 kilometre railway line needed to be taken into account when deciding whether the 13.2 kilometre section was likely to have a significant effect on the environment. Again that follows from the fact that a finding that the 13.2 kilometre section was a project listed in Annex I (because it fell within the definition of Point 7) meant that Article 4(1) automatically required that it be made subject to EIA.</p>

The scheme as a whole substantially exceeded the threshold at which the regional rules applicable made a project subject to EIA whereas all but one of the sub-projects did not. The broad statement of principle against what has come to be known as “salami slicing” was stated as being that the purpose of the amended Directive cannot be circumvented by the splitting of projects and that the failure to take account of the cumulative effect of several projects must not mean in practice that they all escape the obligation to carry out an assessment when, taken together, they are likely to have significant effects on the environment within the meaning of article 2(1) of the amended Directive. The premise on which the principle appears to have been based was the existence of a project as defined by the amended Directive which is likely to have significant effects on the environment within the meaning of article 2(1) which has been split up into one or more sub-projects which, looked at on their own, would not fall into the definition of an Annex I project and/or fall below the relevant Annex II threshold ,or threshold in the domestic implementing legislation, which would trigger the need to consider whether EIA is required.  The means by which the ECJ appears to have contemplated that effect is to be given to the principle was  either by artificially deeming the project to fall within Annex 1 through a generous interpretation of the relevant part of Annex I, thus calling for a mandatory EIA or by requiring, as part of the consideration whether projects covered by Annex II are likely to have significant effects on the environment, account to be taken of their interaction with other projects. </p>

The proposed project in that case was for modification of the airport’s infrastructure, the construction of a control tower, new runway exits and aprons and work to restructure and widen the runways without altering their length. The Advocate General stated that the court, with an overall assessment criterion and with a view to ensuring the effectiveness of the Directive, held that “works to modify an airport with a runway length of 2100 metres or more thus comprise not only works to extend the runway but all work relating to the buildings, installation or equipment of that airport where they may be regarded, in particular because of their nature, extent and characteristics, as a modification of the airport itself” [AG75]</p>

SeaSpace submitted a planning application with regard to part of the Mount Pleasant site. The proposal was stated to be for a “spine road and associated roundabout and surface water attenuation works.” It was common ground that the actual “area of the works” to which the planning application related was properly assessed as being less than one hectare and Davis J said that it was also said that it could amount to  no more than 0.5 hectare. Taken in isolation the development for which planning permission was sought was thus below the 1 hectare threshold in the second column of paragraph 2 of schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) (England and Wales) Regulations 1999 (the 1999 Regulations) which were then in operation.

Phase one was described as “a key element” of the proposal prior to the submission of the wider Ore Valley Proposals and it was stated that development of the spine road would enable the first phase of the residential development, being part of the “wider Millennium Community Proposals”, to be brought forward.

Phase 1 for which the planning consent was sought had no meaningful existence on its own. The only rationale for the existence of the spine road and associated works was to provide access to the contemplated residential development of the Mount Pleasant site and thereafter Phase 2. In the absence of that it was a road which had no function or use. The reality was that Phase 1 was part of an overall “project” and as such the application for development consent for Phase 1 had to be treated cumulatively and as part of that overall project and in conjunction with Phase 2. Were it otherwise the need for an EIA in respect of Phase 1 would have been circumvented by the splitting of the project, and thence the applications for development consent, into two. </p>

If that was so the area of development involved plainly exceeded that set out in the appropriate respect in the second column of Schedule 2 and as such it was a “Schedule 2 development”. Accordingly the Council was required before taking its decision on the planning application to assess whether the development taken as a whole was “EIA development”; in particular whether it was likely to have significant effects on the environment by virtue of factors such as its nature size or location. Since on its own admission the council had made no such assessment because it took the view that the development for which consent was being sought was not Schedule 2 development the decision to grant planning application was unlawful and must be quashed. </p>

On the face of it the application was properly determined as not being a Schedule 2 development since no part of it was in a sensitive area and the threshold stipulated for roads was not exceeded. That approach accorded precisely with the natural meaning of the 1999 Regulations. It was also consistent with the purpose of the amended Directive. Article 4(2) thereof made clear that a case-by-case analysis was not required in each case and that thresholds might properly be set, provided the criteria in Annex III were first taken in to account and the Secretary of State (as confirmed by the recital to 1999 Regulations) had taken those criteria in to account. The assertion of “cumulative effect” underlying the asserted need for EIA was in any event theoretical only and had no practical bearing on this particular case or generally with regard to the relevant thresholds set out in Schedule 2 of the 1999 Regulations. </p>

Both the structure and the language of the 1999 Regulations were clear. Before consent or development could be given it had first to be assessed as either a Schedule 1 or Schedule 2 development. A schedule 2 development was only an EIA development if it was likely to have significant effects on the environment. But the issue of likelihood of significant effects only fell to be considered where the development <span style="font-weight:bold">was </span>a Schedule 2 development (assuming no sensitive area was involved). There was therefore a two stage process; and the question whether an application was an EIA application (that is to say one likely to have significant effects on the environment) only arose if the application had first been assessed as a Schedule 2 application (as defined). The definition of “EIA application” and the wording of, for example Regulation 7 showed that it was the application for planning permission which was to be considered for that purpose. Moreover such an interpretation and approach was clear and easily workable by planning officials. [56][57].</p>

Certainly the evidence showed that no application would have been made for the Phase 1 development were it not for the proposals with regard to the Phase 2 development.

Indeed were it otherwise there could be difficulties in any given case in assessing just what “project” might be involved or, even if there was some wider project in mind just what form it might take. Those were precisely the considerations alluded to by the Advocate-General in the <span style="font-style:italic">Naturschutz. </span>In that context however he stated that he would perhaps not give quite so much emphasis to that particular point as did counsel for the Council and SeaSpace. After all if there <span style="font-weight:bold">was</span> a Schedule 2 development (as defined) the planning authority in deciding whether such development was EIA development (see Regulation 4(5)) had to do the best it could in assessing, for example, cumulation implications.

If it was nevertheless in some way to be treated as an application for the Ore Valley project that posed difficulties for the assessment said then to be required; for even if there was a possibility that there might be some eventual Ore Valley project there could be no certainty at all as to what eventual size and form (e.g. in the mix of housing, shops, office, etc.) it might ultimately take or be permitted to take, assuming planning permission for that project was granted at all. </p>

Davis J said that he had some difficulty with the emphasis which counsel placed in that context on a development having “no independent existence”.

The second defendant wished to demolish regardless of the outcome of the re-determined planning permission because it would increase the value of the site and reduce the cost to maintain the site once the wharf had been removed. Even if permission were not obtained on the re-determined application, the allocation in the UDP meant that the site would be redeveloped if not pursuant to the re-determined application then pursuant to another application and any redevelopment of the site would involve demolition of the wharf. The demolition of the wharf would enable the second defendant to carry out site investigation works which could not be carried out while the Borthwick Wharf building remained in place in order to reform the second defendant’s design and method of construction, the demolition would allow the second defendant to progress agreed archaeological investigations which could not be carried out pre-demolition and it would permit access to the river wall to carry out repairs in a safe manner. </p>

That was for two reasons. First the evidence was that intention of the developer was to carry out the demolition whether the planning proposal went ahead or not. Second if the outstanding planning permission were granted then Borthwick Wharf would be demolished but if it were refused the building could still and would still be demolished.

The principal ground on which the decision was challenged related to the failure of the council to require the production of a master plan for the area as a whole before determining the application. It had required an Environmental Statement on the basis that the possible cumulative effects of future redevelopment of the site should be considered but the developer did not accept that a master plan was required at that stage as the development proposals were said to be “stand alone” and not reliant on any future development of neighbouring land. The planning officer reported that the applicant’s urgent need for the manufacturing facility had required it to be applied for in advance of the master plan which would follow and that a proposed section 106 agreement included the provision of that master plan within 12 months of the commencement of the development. The council’s failure to require the production of a master plan for the area as a whole was alleged to comprise a failure to take in to account a relevant planning consideration and to have been perverse. It was also alleged to comprise a failure to take in to account the likely significant environmental effects of the development, in particular, the cumulative impact of the proposal together with any likely future proposals on the rest of the site contrary to the requirements of the 1999 Regulations. </p>

It was therefore necessary to have a master plan to judge the cumulative effect of Phase 1 together with the future proposals for the wider area because it might show that the harmful effects of the present application could be avoided when the wider area was taken into account, but it would be too late to do so after the grant of planning permission Phase 1.</p>

He accepted that the normal approach would be to assess only the cumulative impacts from projects which have been permitted but in that case relied upon the fact that the council had required the developer as part of the section 106 agreement to produce a master plan within 12 months of development which he submitted showed that the council thought there would be potentially significant environmental effects but that they had failed to use their power under regulation 19 of the 1999 Regulations to require further information. He further relied on national guidance that an obligation in a section 106 agreement was only a material planning consideration if it was necessary. It followed that the council must have thought a master plan was necessary. By granting the planning permission without having further first required a master plan he submitted that the council had failed to take account of the environmental information which they had identified as being necessary in order to assess the likely environmental effects of the development contrary to the 1985 Directive and the 1999 Regulations.

Before the initial refusal of planning permission by the local waste authority the owners of the site had decided that they would seek permission to extend the period for completion of the proposed works to 2016 and that two years after the instant application they would also seek a major extension of the landfill site to accommodate a larger amount of waste by 2026.  By the time of the inquiry leading to the decision it had not been decided whether only HW was to be disposed of in the extended facility or whether LLW was to be included.  However, the prospective application for permission for the larger scheme would clearly allow for the disposal of LLW.</p>

By contrast in this case the question raised is whether the Secretary of State was required, in deciding whether the proposed demolition of the Chapel was EIA development requiring an EIA, to take into account the selection criterion prescribed in paragraph 1(b) of Schedule 3 of the 2011 Regulations, which provides that the characteristics of development must be considered having regard in particular to the cumulation with other developments.  Whether he was so obliged turns in part on whether that criterion was relevant to the proposed demolition of the Chapel.  (See Regulation 4(6).)</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in"> The Claimant did not support the allegation in its letter dated 13 December 2011 that the Council had a history of “Salami Slicing”  the project to demolish 4.7 hectares of  Victorian housing in order to avoid EIA. Although in its letter dated 20 December 2011 it cast doubt on the Council’s statement that the reason for the demolition of 51 – 57 Springwell Road was that the properties were unsafe, one of the arguments it deployed in support of that, namely that if it were genuinely the case that the buildings were unsafe the Council would not need to submit a prior approval application for their demolition, appears to have been incorrect as apparently accepted by Mr Harwood. In my judgment the Secretary of State was entitled to take at face value the Council’s detailed explanation for the reason why those properties were demolished.</p>

He had that power, he was asked by the Claimant  to exercise it and he duly proceeded to consider whether the merits of the case justified exercising it. In his formal reasons for his decision not to make such a direction he did not suggest that he had no jurisdiction to make it, but merely that he did not consider on the evidence before him that it would have a significant effect on the environment.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In reality on the material before me there is nothing to suggest that that scenario, while theoretically possible, was likely to occur in practice. In support of its assertion that the proposed demolition of the 483 properties in Klondyke Phases 2 and 3 was likely to have significant effect on the environment the Claimant in its letter dated 8 September 2011 drew attention in great detail to ten separate matters, which did not include any alleged effects on the environment of the demolition of the Chapel and indeed none of which even referred to it.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Nonetheless, unlikely though such a scenario may be, if the demolition of the Chapel was the factor which made the difference between Phases 2 and 3 not being considered by the Secretary of State to be EIA development and being considered to be EIA development, the fact that there had been a screening direction in respect of the Chapel before a screening direction in respect of Phases 2 and 3 would not prevent the Secretary of State from determining that Phases 2 and 3 were EIA development and would not prevent planning permission for Phases 2 and 3 from being impermissible without the environmental information having been taken into account (Regulation 3(4)). Any attempted salami-slicing on the part of the Council would thus have been ineffective in protecting Phases 2 and 3 from proper screening.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is of course true, as Mr Harwood pointed out, that if the Secretary of State was under an obligation to treat the development before him in December 2011 as part of a wider Phase 2 and 3 Klondyke development, there would remain a theoretical danger flowing from his failure to do so which would not be covered by the points which I have listed above. That danger would arise if instead of the demolition of the Chapel making the difference to phase 2 and 3 being EIA development or not it was the other way round: in other words if the factor which made the difference between the Secretary of State considering that the demolition of the Chapel was not likely to have a significant effect on the environment and considering that it was likely to do so  was if Klondyke phases 2 and 3 were to proceed. In that eventuality if the consequence of the Secretary of State leaving out of account at this stage the effect of phases 2 and 3 was that the Chapel was demolished, it would be too late to retrieve the position when the two developments were considered together as part of a subsequent screening directive in relation to phases 2 and 3. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Again in my judgment this is a theoretical rather than a realistic possibility based on the material before me. As already mentioned at no point did the Claimant allege that the wider Phase 2 and 3 development would or even might make the difference between the demolition of the Chapel not having an adverse effect on the environment and having such effect. Indeed it did not at any stage allege that the demolition of the Chapel would have any adverse effect on the environment either taken on its own or in combination with the rest of Phases 2 and 3. </p>

That rationale was that, following the failure of the search for alternative users of the Chapel and subsequent arson attacks which led the Council’s deputy building control manager to report that it was dangerous, with no resources to restore the badly damaged building and no long term use or occupier identified for it, the Council decided that the best course of action was to purchase it and apply to demolish it and ultimately incorporate the site into Extended Public Open Space. After it was acquired by the council in 2011 it was again broken into twice, most recently on 8 December 2011. Being relatively isolated and bounded on the one side by open space which was a focus for antisocial behaviour in the area and on the other sides by empty properties it was thus particularly vulnerable to break ins and arson attacks because there was little natural surveillance. </p>

The November 2004 Development Brief long preceded the acquisition of the Chapel by the property company and the subsequent search for other users. The suggestion in the October 2005 Communities Facilities Study that the SPG stated that the Chapel’s future was for eventual demolition was inconsistent with the terms of the SPG which I have referred. </p>

He did not say that the proposal to demolish the chapel was not part of the strategy for the area. What he said was that the decision had nothing whatsoever to do with avoiding the need to carry out an EIA. That is a very different thing. As I have found, there is in my view no evidence to support such a suggestion and certainly none which would render irrational a failure to conclude that that is what happened. Nor in my judgment is there anything in the documents to render incredible Mr Lunt’s statement that faced with a badly damaged building in a regeneration area which was purchased by a developer who could not make an alternative scheme work and with no available funding or long term use it was decided to pursue demolition and that the Council’s view was that given its type, size and condition, as well as its location it was not economically viable to refurbish the building and bring it back into use. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Harwood’s better point as it seemed to me was that Mr Lunt’s statement that by March 2011 the Council had decided to demolish the Chapel and incorporate the site into the public open space proposed when the housing was demolished showed that by that stage at the latest the demolition of the Chapel was part of the wider demolition project. Indeed the reason given for the demolition, namely that “ the building is part of the Housing Market Renewal Initiative” in the Council’s prior notification application supports the proposition that by that time it may have been viewed internally at least by some in the Council as part of a wider programme.</p>

Nor was it a part of Phases 2 and 3 until a comparatively late stage and for reasons that were independent of the nature and purpose of Phases 2 and 3. This is a very far cry in my view from a section of a ring road, a long distance railway line linking two towns and a single power line which happened to cross the border between two countries. </p>

That function was to address the problem posed by a derelict building which was subject to repeated arson attacks,  which it was economically unviable to refurbish and bring back into use and  the retention of which would be expensive and difficult to monitor and was not justified by any prospect of alternative use in the event of rebuilding.)</p>

It was not in truth one integrated development such as the Carlise Airport development in <span style="font-style:italic">Brown </span>or the Madrid ring road project in the <span style="font-style:italic">Ecologistas</span> case or the Mediterranean corridor railway project in <span style="font-style:italic">Commission v Spain</span>. </p>

That decision did not prevent the Secretary of State from considering on its merits the question whether the demolition of the Chapel was likely to have significant effects on the environment and, had he decided that it would, making a direction to that effect.

It was subsequently decided to pursue the demolition of the building in order to remove the risk and blight posed by the damaged Chapel because it was the Council’s view that given its type size and condition as well as its location it was not economically viable to refurbish the building and bring it back into use. No organisation had submitted a business plan to the Council setting out how the Chapel could be viably refurbished. All that in my judgment is very far removed from the proposition that the demolition was only proposed because the site was in the HMR programme. The fact relied on by Mr Harwood that the building was unlikely to have got into the condition it did if the area was not being vacated for demolition does not seem to me to advance his argument. The submission that it was unlikely to have got into that condition if the Chapel had not been acquired for the purpose of demolition is not borne out by Mr Lunt’s narrative of events. The arson attacks to which the Chapel was subject began in August 2008 and continued through 2010  before the decision to purchase the Chapel was taken by the Council. </p>

First there is no equivalent power conferred on a relevant planning authority, when deciding whether to adopt a screening opinion to the effect that development is EIA development, to disregard the fact that none of the conditions contained in sub-paragraphs (a) and(b) of the definition of “Schedule 2 development”, and in particular the minimum threshold of 0.5 hectares relevant in this case, is satisfied.</p>

In my judgment the answer to that question is yes because Regulation 4(3) provides that a direction of the Secretary of State shall determine for the purposes of the Regulation whether development is or is not EIA development.

Moreover, although under Regulation 4(9) the Secretary of State is not confined to making directions in respect of Schedule 2 development, the means chosen by the draftsman to achieve that effect was not, as it could have been, to widen the definition of Schedule 2 development in Regulation 2(1).

The claimant’s complaint that the council should have decided that the smaller initial development was EIA development depended in the first instance in persuading the court that by reason of the connection between the smaller initial development and the larger later development the former satisfied the relevant threshold on which its designation as Schedule 2 development depended.</p>

By those words it seems to me that Simon Brown J was emphasising that the circumstances in which it is necessary to take into account the effects on the environment of a larger development are where those effects can properly be attributed to the smaller development because by promoting the larger development it carries in its wake or has a causal responsibility for them.

The latter was in no way dependent on the former as evidenced by the fact that the Chapel was not originally in the plan for Phase 3 in the SPG and that the Council itself negotiated with various parties with a view to preserving it as recently as 2009, at which time on the Claimant’s case the plans for Phases 2 and 3 had already  been in existence for many years.</p>

I can conceive of hypothetical circumstances where the Council submitted a series of separate proposals  to demolish houses in the Phases 2 and 3 area street by street with the object of avoiding EIA in which, as accepted by Mr Forsdick, any one proposal might properly be characterised as an integral part of the wider Phases 2 and 3 and the Council might be guilty of salami slicing.

That could occur if by salami slicing a large project into a series of sub-projects each sub-project escaped EIA because its small size did not satisfy the definitions in Annex 1 and 2 or Schedules 1 and 2.

In doing so the Secretary of State would be free and indeed likely to be obliged to have regard to the demolition of the Chapel as a cumulative development within the meaning of paragraph 1(b) of schedule 3 of the 2011 Regulations which would be likely to be a criterion relevant to the development then under consideration(Regulation 4(6). As regards any significant adverse effects on the environment from the demolition of the Chapel that was considered by the Secretary of State in the screening direction on 6 January 2012.

Moreover the language of paragraph 4 of Schedule 4 makes it explicit that the cumulative development which should be covered in a description of the likely significant effects of the development must result from the existence of the development. That is to be contrasted with the language of paragraph 1(b) of Schedule 3 which provides that one of the selection criteria for screening Schedule 2 development is that the characteristics of development must be considered having regard in particular to the cumulation with other development.

Any adverse effect of “other development” can thus only be relevant to that question if it is such that because of it the initial development rather than the “ other development” has a significant effect on the environment.

I would draw attention in particular to the fact that Laws LJ had of course well in mind that by the time EIA of the two projects together came to be considered the grant of planning permission of the first one would be a fait accompli, the very point emphasised in this case by the Claimant. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I would also draw attention to the fact that Mr Harwood submitted that in deciding whether the project which falls to be assessed is the  larger one  the question is an objective one based on what the developer’s intentions are known to be<span style="font-weight:bold"> or, if the application is of little use on its own, what is likely to follow. </span>(Emphasis added). In this case the Secretary of State was entitled to take the view that the application to demolish the Chapel was not of little use on its own but had a site specific justification irrespective of whether Phases 2 and 3 would proceed and irrespective of whether it formed a part of Phases 2 and 3.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in"> I would also draw attention to the fact that Mr Harwood accepted that there will be cases where future stages are so uncertain and the immediate  application is being pursued for its own merits that the future stages can  be disregarded. He took issue with the proposition that there was insufficient detail in respect of Phases 2 and 3 to require them to be considered in the context of the screening direction in relation to the Chapel. However that is a question of fact and for the reasons given earlier I do not consider that the Secretary of State erred in taking the view that consideration of Phases 2 and 3 was premature and indeed there was no challenge to that conclusion as regards the formal decision to that effect. In my judgment it cannot be said that the Secretary of State was relying on an impermissible assertion of an inflexible rule of law that no future development can ever be required to be considered in a screening direction until and unless there is a formal application for planning permission.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The second ground of challenge was that the Secretary of State’s reasons for considering that the impact  of the demolition with (a) the re-development of the Chapel site and (b) the previous clearance and the future re-development of Phase 1 were not likely to give rise to significant effects are neither adequate nor intelligible.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This ground was not advanced at the hearing with any great enthusiasm or elaboration. The letter dated 6 January 2012 set out under three distinct headings a summary of the reasons for the conclusion that the proposed demolition of the Chapel was not EIA development. I have quoted them above. Reference was made to the fact that other sites within the wider Klondyke area had been cleared and were being or were  about to be redeveloped as supporting the conclusion that the demolition of the Chapel was not considered to give rise to significant environmental effects alone or in cumulation.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As pointed out by Mr Forsdick the cumulative impacts with Phase 1 were considered in box 27 of Ms Lewis’s screening analysis which I have set out earlier in this judgment. No further alleged cumulative effects with Phase 1 were put forward by the Claimant in response to the Secretary of State’s invitation to explain why the demolition of the Chapel should be subject to EIA. The proposal was for a small scale removal of the Chapel to slab level and not for its redevelopment. Its location was far removed from Phase 1. In my judgment there is nothing in this ground of challenge.</p>
