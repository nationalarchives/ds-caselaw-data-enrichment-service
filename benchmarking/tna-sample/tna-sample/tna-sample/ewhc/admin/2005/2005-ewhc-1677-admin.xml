	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Various claimants in these three applications for judicial review challenge the lawfulness and integrity of the Hunting Act 2004.  Broadly speaking, they do so on the ground that the Act is a disproportionate, unnecessary and illegitimate interference with their rights to choose how they conduct their lives, and with market freedoms protected by European law; and an unjust interference with economic rights.  They say that the Act is oppressive legislation, enacted irrationally by a majority of the members of the House of Commons, who rejected a rational compromise promoted by the Government; legislation which, so far from achieving its avowed aim of preventing cruelty to animals, will in fact promote such cruelty.  The other side of the controversy, espoused by the House of Commons majority, and supported in this court by the RSPCA, is that hunting wild animals with dogs for sport is not only cruel, but unethical, and should be stopped.  The Act is proportionate legislation to achieve that legitimate aim which withstands human rights and European law objections.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">We have concluded that it was within the rational, proportionate and democratic competence of Parliament to make this enactment and that the court should not intervene.  Our route to that conclusion has to pick its way through a mass of dense undergrowth cultivated by human rights and European legislation and jurisprudence.  It is often hard to see the overgrown wood for the trees.  We acknowledge that some of our intermediate judgments are more finely balanced than others, but that does not, in our view, apply to the main conclusion.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is the defendants’ case that hunting is by definition intentional.  Subject to that, the offences created by the Hunting Act are absolute in the sense that there is no provision equivalent to those in section 1 of the Protection of Animals Act 1911, where an element of some of the offences of cruelty to animals is that the offender causes the animal unnecessary suffering.  Hunting wild mammals with a dog is banned, unless it is exempt hunting, whether or not it causes unnecessary suffering.  </p>

This would have banned deer hunting and hare coursing (clauses 6 and 7), but permitted fox, hare and mink hunting subject to registration of individuals or groups by a registrar (clauses 1 and 2).  There were to be two tests for registration, of which the registrar had to be satisfied.  These tests were labelled the utility test and the least suffering test (clause 8).  The utility test was that the proposed hunting was likely to make a significant contribution to the prevention or reduction of serious specified damage which the quarry would otherwise cause.  The least suffering test was that an equivalent contribution could not reasonably be expected to be made in a manner likely to cause significantly less pain, suffering or distress to the quarry.  </p>

The ban on hunting with dogs which it imposed did not represent legislation promoted by the Government following the Burns Inquiry and the Portcullis hearings.  The legislation promoted by the Government was that in the original Michael Bill, which, in the cases of fox, hare and mink hunting, provided for registration, not an outright ban.  As Mr Bradley, the civil servant in the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs responsible to the Minister for Rural Affairs says in paragraph 6 of his witness statement, “the Hunting Act 2004 does not represent the policy of the Government, but rather the will of the House of Commons as expressed on a free vote”.  Mr Bradley also points out that the length of Parliamentary time spent on the issue of hunting since 1997 is virtually unprecedented in modern times.  The Hunting Act was passed by a large majority of Members of Parliament from all major parties.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">An account of the history of hunting with hounds is given in paragraphs 8 to 30 of the first witness statement, largely unchallenged factually, of Baroness Mallalieu, the President of the Countryside Alliance.  It has been part of British rural life “since before recorded history”.  Mr Friend and Mr Thomas say that its origin “lies in the dawn of time” in the Iron Age and before and during the Roman occupation.  There are important links between property ownership and hunting, but it is and always has been socially inclusive in rural Britain.  Foxes were hunted as vermin to safeguard farm stock.  The “Master” of a Hunt denoted a leader of the local society as well as being in charge of the local pack.  The bond between a community and its pack is immensely strong.  Historically deer hunting reduced with the clearance of forests.  Foxes became the most popular quarry from the mid-18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> century.  The excitement of jumping fences in pursuit of hounds led to present day sports, including cross-country riding, steeple chasing, national hunt racing, eventing and hunter trials.  Hunting survived the advent of the railways in the 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> century and of roads, urban development and arable farming in the 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> century.  Hunting is supported by the vast majority of farmers and land owners who allow it to take place on privately owned land.  They benefit from hunting because it helps to control the fox population without extinguishing it; and because hunts voluntarily provide valuable services including retrieving and disposing of fallen stock and repairing fences and hedges. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Baroness  Mallalieu assembled estimated statistics (paragraph 79ff of her first witness statement) showing that there is an estimated fox population in England and Wales of 217,000 foxes before each breeding season.  We understand that the population more than doubles during the breeding season, but that a number of foxes, broadly equivalent to the annual number of cubs born, dies from one cause or another by the start of the next breeding season.  Of these, an estimated 21,000 to 25,000 were killed by hunts – that is, less than 10% of those who died from all causes.  An estimated 100,000 foxes are killed on the roads each year.  Many of the rest are shot – one estimate refers to 80,000.  Mr Bradley (paragraph 58) highlights other statistics derived from the Burns Report.  These include that, of the 21,000 to 25,000 foxes killed by hunting, up to 11,000 may be dug out by terriers.  The defendants further point to evidence indicating that, even in upland Wales, rather more foxes were culled by shooting (46%) than by hunting (35%).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Thus hunting is embedded in the rural community.  Yet it is, and has been for a long time, highly controversial.  Many of those concerned with animal welfare and protection regard hunting with dogs as an ethically unacceptable “blood sport” which expression we understand to connote chasing an animal with hounds and exhausting it, and then, for foxes at least, having the hounds kill it often in an unacceptable manner; and this for sport.  Those who support and defend hunting maintain that hunting foxes does not cause them unnecessary suffering; in particular that a hunted fox is normally rendered insensible and killed instantly or within a few seconds; and, importantly to these proceedings, that there is no other method of culling foxes, an admitted necessity, which has been shown to cause less suffering.  We must examine some of the evidence here, but it is no part of our function to form or express any judgment as to the balance of the highly emotional ethical issue.  We do not do so.  We simply acknowledge that a strongly held division of view exists.  We note that there is an articulated feeling among some in the rural community that the Hunting Act represents oppression of a rural minority by an elected Parliamentary majority.  We also note that the claimants in the present proceedings do not attribute bad faith to the elected Parliamentary majority.</p>

As a trustee and Master, the Fernie’s properties, equipment, hounds, horses and contracts of employment with its staff are all vested in Mr Cowen.  The Fernie hunts on his family land (of which he is a trustee) about 1 in every 3 days that it is out hunting.  The family land has been managed specifically for the purposes of fox hunting and has thereby acquired a special amenity value that is threatened by the Act.  The Fernie provides two important services to local landowners and farmers: control of the fox population and a fallen stock service.  Mr Cowen and his family have a social life that revolves around the Fernie.  The hunting ban will have a fundamental effect upon his family, their lifestyle, social life and that of the wider rural community.</p>

The hunt goes over his land 3 or 4 times a season.  The hunt hunts both on horseback and on foot as a gun pack.  Generally when hunting, the hunt crosses the land of various different landowners during a day.  However, at least twice a year as a gun pack and twice a year when mounted they hunt exclusively on the Llwyn Maddoc estate to protect pheasants from foxes.  The ban will have a disastrous effect on his lifestyle, livelihood, social life and property rights.  His grandfather founded the hunt in 1909 to protect his own and other local farmers’ stock, as they were losing too many lambs to foxes.  His grandfather remained Master of the hunt for the next 37 years.  Since then, his family has been an integral part of the hunt.  Mr Jones has been hunting since he was 5 years old.   He has a wife and 3 children and they have always hunted together as a family.  It is the central unifying force in their life.  The hunt provides an invaluable pest control service and the hunt committee, of which Mr Jones is a member, employs a professional huntsman who would lose his job if the ban proceeds.  The hunt provides the only social life for the whole community in what is a very rural and quiet area with limited social and recreational activities.  Mr Jones feels passionately that the ban will unnecessarily degrade his own family and community life.  He fears that without hunting there is even less reason for one of his own children to take over the family farm and that the ban will lead to further drift from the area of local young people.</p>

When the ban is implemented, he may be able to keep at most 3 or 4 dogs and will have no option but to destroy the rest of the pack.  They are pack animals and are not suitable as domestic pets.

The results of his survey are set out in his witness statement and demonstrate that a significant number of European visitors hunt in England and Wales.  For example, the Cotswold Hunt state that Portuguese, Dutch, French and Irish visitors have subscribed to their hunt and they also receive regular visitors from France, Germany, Portugal and Sweden.  The results also show that several hunts employ workers from other EU Member States.  For example, the Pembrokeshire and Carmarthenshire Mink Hounds employed two French workers between 2002 and 2005.  Finally, there are links between hunts in England and Wales and hunts in other EU Member States.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The claimants do not accept that preventing unnecessary suffering to wild mammals was the reason, or the full reason, why the House of Commons voted for a complete ban.  They say, however, that a purpose of preventing unnecessary suffering cannot be justified because (a) it is, on (as they contend) unchallenged evidence, necessary to control foxes, deer and mink, and many farmers and landowners see hare as a pest; and (b) there is no scientific support for the proposition that the alternative means of control cause less suffering than hunting with dogs.  The case here is vividly put by Mr Friend, who says that, when quarry is hunted by hounds, it is either alive and free or it is dead.  It is never wounded.  His assertion that the inevitable consequences of the Hunting Act will be that wild mammals will be killed by methods that invariably inflict more pain and suffering than hunting with hounds may overstate the case.  The more moderate version of this, advanced on behalf of the Human Rights claimants, is that a significant proportion of mammals, culled by inexpert shooting, especially with shotguns, will be wounded but not killed outright.  They will accordingly suffer for perhaps a substantial period.  The same may apply to those who are trapped or snared.  In many areas, the terrain and public access make shooting ineffective or unsafe.  In some areas, the legal means of culling under the Hunting Act are not viable.  This particularly applies to the upland areas of mid Wales and the Lake District, where hunting takes place with foot packs or fell packs and gun packs.  By contrast, hounds kill a fox, once it is caught, instantaneously or very quickly.</p>

We recall that deer hunting and hare coursing were to be banned under the original Michael Bill.  But the case is that there is no equivalent scientific evidence for fox hunting, and Mr Bradley accepts (at paragraph 48 of his witness statement) that in some instances fox hunting might satisfy the tests of utility and least suffering.  The Human Rights claimants’ case is that the evidence shows that hunting is often the method of least suffering, and that in a significant number of cases the Hunting Act would achieve the opposite of its stated purpose.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Bradley says that virtually all the material now placed before the court was considered by the Burns Inquiry or the subsequent Portcullis House hearings and was before Parliament when the Act was passed.  The defendants adopt the conclusions of the Inquiry, as supplemented by evidence given at the hearings and other evidence which has come to light subsequently.  The defendants seek only to establish that there was a substantial body of evidence which could be relied upon in support of the view that hunting is cruel and which provided a sufficient basis on which the House of Commons could reach the conclusion, informed by moral judgments, that it should be banned.  Although the extent of suffering caused by fox hunting cannot be established precisely, there is a body of evidence in favour of the view that it is cruel and should be banned.  Mr Bradley refers to evidence before the Burns Inquiry questioning as implausible the contention that foxes caught by hounds are killed quickly and surgically rather than suffering more seriously before they are killed.  He points to the statement in the Burns Report that hunting with dogs “seriously compromises the welfare of the fox”.  The claimants emphasise later statements by Lord Burns and Lord Soulsby, another member of Lord Burns’ inquiry panel, that the panel were not asked to make, and did not make a judgment about cruelty.  Mr Bradley points to evidence at the Portcullis House hearings by Professors Morton and Linzey to the effect that hunted animals experience, not only physical pain, but a whole gamut of suffering.  Professor Morton expounded an anthropomorphic approach, and a principle that, if you are unsure about something scientifically, you should make the choice which eliminates or reduces the risk.  The claimants say that this contention is misplaced.  The “precautionary principle” should only be applied when there is a choice between stopping something which may be harmful, but cannot be proved to be harmful, and doing nothing, so as to risk the harm.  They say that, with hunting, the choice is between two potential harms, which have to be evaluated and balanced.</p>

But Mr Bradley says that that is not an uncontested view.  Animal welfare organisations, including the RSPCA, have maintained that the fox is not a significant pest.  Fox hunting makes a minimal contribution to controlling fox numbers.  The Burns Report also concluded that the overall contribution of traditional fox hunting, within the overall total of control techniques using dogs, was almost certainly insignificant in terms of managing the fox population as a whole (paragraph 5.36).</p>

It is acknowledged that shooting may cause suffering, if an animal is wounded and escapes.  But the Hunting Act itself has provisions to reduce that risk and other steps have been taken to promote effective marksmanship (paragraph 63). The defendants say that the number of shot foxes who escape wounded and are not retrieved is uncertain.  A study which sought to measure wounding rates (Fox et al. 2003, 2005) was based on a single shot, although in real life many wounded foxes are promptly killed by a second or third shot.  Further, the defendants allude to a point of view that, if shooting results in suffering, it is qualitatively different, being unintentional, from suffering caused by hunting. </p>

Shooting would be a more humane method of culling in most cases, and in the vast majority of cases, if  appropriate steps were taken.  Different people could reasonably take different views about which was preferable.  Ethical views about hunting inevitably played a part in a balancing judgment for which there is no purely scientific solution.</p>

The Hunting Act enables dogs to be used to retrieve wounded deer.  There is unanimous agreement that deer populations need to be managed, but hunting accounts for only a small fraction of the number of deer killed each year.  Hunting deer does not occur in most parts of England and Wales where there are deer.  Hunting deer only takes place in three areas in West Somerset and Devon.  Even in those areas, it accounts for only about 15% of the total cull required.  Deer hunting was to be banned in the original Michael Bill.  As we have said, Mr Anderson, but not Mr Gordon, more or less conceded (without formally doing so) that a ban on deer hunting might be justified, although paradoxically the most acute examples of the adverse effect of the hunting ban are those concerned with deer hunting on Exmoor.</p>

There is an undoubted need to control mink, but the defendants do not believe that the Hunting Act will have any significant effect on that objective.  The Burns Report estimated that there were about 18,000 mink in England and Wales, and that mink hunts accounted for only between 400 and 1400 mink a year.  Trapping is the recognised main means of controlling mink.  Some are also shot.  Packs of dogs catch on average less than one mink per hunting day and most of those that are found escape.  The contribution to control by mink hunts is insignificant and has to be set against the disturbance and damage caused to wild life, river banks and vegetation.</p>

Mr Bradley says that hares are seldom a significant pest.  Where control is necessary, shooting is generally used.  The report found that an estimated 200,000 to 300,000 hares are shot in Britain each year (paragraph 5.85), while hunts killed in the region of 1,650 hares in a season (paragraph 2.47).  Mr Bradley asserts that hare coursing and hare hunting have no justification as pest control at all.  Both are described by the Burns Report as being “essentially carried out for recreational purposes” (paragraph 5.94).  Hare coursing has serious welfare implications for reasons which Mr Bradley explains in paragraph 72.  The Government has adopted the consistent position that hare coursing should be banned outright. </p>

There is bound, we think, to be a decline in riding to hounds.  We hesitate to say how sharp that decline might be.  The Burns Report was similarly cautious.  Fox hunts will not, we suppose, all disband overnight.  Still less will related social activities collapse immediately.  On the other hand, we cannot but suppose that there would be a substantial contraction of hunting related activities in the medium term.  More importantly, for present purposes, we proceed on the scarcely contested basis that a significant number of individuals, of whom the individual claimants are representative, will suffer in a variety of tangible and economic ways and that some will lose all or part of their present livelihood.

The Society’s current policy is supported by a large majority of its members and donors.  Mr Thomas states that the Society is opposed to hunting with dogs for sport or any other purpose including pest control because, on the evidence, neither the limited (at best) need for pest control of the various quarry species, nor the need for wider population control of deer in some cases, justifies the considerable suffering which the practice causes.  In any event, the Society believes that hunting with dogs is an inefficient method of control and that alternative methods are more appropriate.</p>

Nor do the claims of incidental benefits, such as habitat conservation, dispersal and promotion of the welfare of the quarry species obscure its fundamental purpose as a sport.  It is plain that most participants regard hunting as a sport, not pest control.  Mr Rolls has a colourful quotation, in paragraph 49 of his witness statement, from a former President of the Master of Foxhounds Association that hunts are not glorified pest destruction societies.  It is the RSPCA’s view that those elements of hunting which exist solely for sport cannot be morally justified.  The suffering caused to the quarry is wholly unnecessary.  Such elements include, they say, prolonging the chase of the quarry to enhance the sport of the huntsmen and followers.</p>

The humaneness of properly conducted shooting of deer in the United Kingdom has been scientifically established.  Wounding rates in such cases, assessed over thousands of culls, are very low.  The Burns Report (paragraph 6.60) tentatively concluded that lamping using rifles, if carried out properly and in appropriate circumstances, has fewer adverse welfare consequences for shot foxes than hunting and digging out.</p>

The Society did not and does not believe that it is possible to regulate cruelty out of hunting.  The Society, however, recognises that it is necessary to appreciate what is achievable in practice taking into account political realities.  It was with this in mind that the Society gave conditional and qualified support to the original Michael Bill.  The Society took the view that the Bill would, with amendments that had been made to it in committee and further amendments which it advocated, “effectively finish off hunting”.  This was on the basis that hare coursing and hunting, deer hunting and terrier work would be banned, and that fox and mink hunting would not in practice be allowed to continue because they would not meet the least suffering and utility tests.</p>

Taking the petitioner’s averments as true, the court considered that certain aspects of fox hunting support the view that it forms part of private life.  It is, for example, the principal leisure pursuit for many people and is therefore an aspect of the development and fulfilment of their personalities.  It is a core part of their lives, affording them the opportunity of forming social relationships.  But the question could not be determined by those considerations alone.  The court continued at paragraph 66:</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“In our opinion, other aspects of fox hunting prevent its being part of the private lives of the participants.  It is conducted in the open over large tracts of private and public land.  … Only a landowner possessed of an extensive estate could undertake fox hunting within the confines of his own property.  None of the petitioners claim to be able to do that.  A typical hunt crosses the land of several owners.  It is not a solitary activity.  Even if only the mounted participants are taken into account, it is undertaken by a substantial number of people.  For the majority of participants it is a sport, however central it may be to their lives.  When followers are taken into account, the hunt takes on the character of a spectator sport.  It is also a public spectacle.  The fact that the hunt is inclusive rather than exclusive points against its being part of the private lives of the participants.  If any competent horseman is welcome to join the hunt for a modest subscription, as the petitioners aver, the individual participant has no control over the identities or numbers of those with whom he shares the activity.  Moreover, the social aspects of hunting extend far beyond the hunt itself.  They involve the wider community, a point that is emphasised in Dr Marvin’s Report.”</p>

It is a dynamic provision, not set in stone.  It is, he submits, an over-simplification to characterise private life as confined to a private place.  The cases have developed a concept of personal autonomy – a right to choose how people conduct their lives.  The Hunting Act is a colossal interference with some people’s personal and social lives.  The seriousness of the interference is critical because of the extent to which it affects the choices people make of how they live their lives.  This does not mean that there is no limit to the ambit of Article 8, as the defendants suggest.  The ban smashes some people’s lives in a number of respects.  For some people, for example Mr Dayment, hunting is an entire way of life upon which they depend.  For some, there will be a loss of livelihood or their home as a result of the legislation.  </p>

Mrs Pretty suffered from motor neurone disease, an untreatable progressive illness, leading to respiratory failure and pneumonia.  She wanted her husband to help her commit suicide.  It would be a criminal offence for him to do so.  She complained that the refusal of the Director of Public Prosecutions to grant her husband immunity from prosecution infringed a variety of her rights under the Human Rights Convention, including Article 8.  The European Court of Human Rights accepted that she was prevented by law from exercising her choice to avoid what she considered would be an undignified and distressing end to her life.  The court was not prepared to exclude that this constituted an interference with her right to respect for private life as guaranteed under Article 8(1) of the Convention (paragraph 67).  The court concluded however that the interference might be justified as “necessary in a democratic society” for the protection of the rights of others and that, accordingly, there was no violation of Article 8 (paragraph 67).  In short, there was an interference with Mrs Pretty’s Article 8(1) right to respect for her private life, although the tone of this decision suggests that it was a marginal one.  But the interference was justified.</p>

Elements such as for example, gender identification, name and sexual orientation and sexual life fall within the personal sphere protected by Article 8.  Article 8 also protects a right to personal development and the right to establish and develop relationships with other human beings and the outside world.  Though no previous case has established as such any right to self determination as being contained in Article 8 of the Convention, the court considers that the notion of personal autonomy is an important principle underlying the interpretation of its guarantees.”</p>

Paragraphs 54ff of the majority opinion consider the scope of the right to respect for private life under Article 8(1).  It secures to the individual a sphere within which he can freely pursue the development and fulfilment of his personality.  He must have the possibility of developing relationships of various kinds, including sexual, with other persons.  However, there are limits to the personal sphere.  The concept of private life comprises to a certain degree the right to establish and to develop relationships with other human beings, especially in the emotional field for the development and fulfilment of one’s own personality.  The protection afforded by Article 8 does not extend to relationships of the individual with his entire immediate surroundings – see also <span style="font-style:italic">Niemietz v Germany</span> [1992] 16 EHRR 97.  But the “zone of interaction” with others, even in a public context, may fall within the scope of private life – see <span style="font-style:italic">PG and JH v United Kingdom</span> (Application No. 44787/25, 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2001).

If they were correct, Article 8(1) would confer a broad right to do anything a person chooses to do, privately or publicly, alone or in conjunction with others.  Although the concept of “private life” in Article 8 is “elusive” and can extend “to those features which are integral to a person’s identity or ability to function socially as a person” (Lord Bingham CJ in <span style="font-style:italic">R.

The main object and intended sphere of application of Article 8 was that of “domiciliary protection” of the individual (see Sir Gerald Fitzmaurice in <span style="font-style:italic">Marckx v Belgium</span> (1979) 2 EHRR 330 cited by Lord Hope in <span style="font-style:italic">Harrow London Borough Council v</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">Qazi </span>[2003] UKHL 43, [2004] 1 AC 983 at paragraph 48).

General principles enunciated by the European Court of Human Rights have to be moderated by the individual circumstances in relation to which they are expressed. This court cannot, it is submitted, leap from the harrowing case of Mrs Pretty to the wide submission that is made.  Mr Sales submits that hunting may be of considerable importance to the claimants, but it is only one activity out of many which they may seek to pursue as work or leisure.  It can hardly be integral to their identity or their ability to function socially as persons. The European Court is dealing with matters of core significance to the identity of the individual.</p>

But for some, for whom hunting is a core way of life or central to their main business or employment, hunting may well come closer to the core of their existence.  Nevertheless, as Mr Sales submitted, the European Court has regarded hunting, including hunting with dogs, in the context or the claim under Article 1 of the First Protocol, as essentially a leisure activity, notwithstanding the history and culture associated with it and other benefits it may bring.  Mr Sales refers to <span style="font-style:italic">Chassagnou v France</span> (2000) 29 EHRR 615.  In that case, applicants complained that, despite their opposition to hunting on ethical grounds, they had been obliged to transfer hunting rights over their land and to become automatic members of municipal hunting associations, so that they could not prevent hunting on their property.  The court stated at paragraph 108, in its consideration of legitimate aim for the purpose of Article 11, that “[hunting’s] main purpose in the present day was to provide pleasure and relaxation to those who took part in it while respecting its traditions.”  Mr Sales submits that the desire to hunt is, on the basis of <span style="font-style:italic">Botta</span>, outside the scope of “private life”.  We see the force of this submission from many who support, follow or participate in hunting, but again consider that those who are concerned with hunting cannot all be tied in the same bundle.

It was there said that the keeping of a pet does not fall within the sphere of the owner’s private or family life for the purposes of Article 8.

Article 8 does not confer a right to private life, but only a right to <span style="font-style:italic">respect</span> for private life.  A mere impact upon private life is not sufficient to make Article 8(1) applicable.  A threshold of intrusion must be crossed before there is an interference with the right in Article 8(1) which is required to be justified under Article 8(2) -see <span style="font-style:italic">Costello-Roberts v United Kingdom</span> (1993) 19 EHRR 112 at paragraph 36.

But, as again was said in <span style="font-style:italic">Niemietz</span>, the notion of private life should not be taken to exclude professional and business activities where people have at least a significant opportunity of developing relationships with the outside world.  Mr Gordon points to elements of the authorities to which Mr Sales referred as favouring the claimants’ case rather than the defendants.  For instance, there is a direct and immediate link between a hunting ban and its effect on the claimants, such as there was held not to be in the case of <span style="font-style:italic">Botta</span>.  <span style="font-style:italic">Botta</span> does not exclude leisure activities from the scope of Article 8(1) as a matter of principle. </p>

But the ban scarcely impinges on their personality or its development, nor intrudes upon essential social relationships.  On the other hand, those for whom hunting is a core part of their lives, and perhaps has been a core part of the community in which they have lived all their lives; those for whose families hunting has been a central, personal and community activity for generations, may stand differently.  So also those for whom hunting provides their only, or main, source of employment and income.  Although hunting is a community open-air activity, and although its associated social activities do not, in the main, take place in the privacy of a single home, people thus affected can at least make a case, we think, that the ban intrudes into their private existences.  We are quite satisfied that there are such people.  In a sense, it is unnecessary to count them.  Some of those who live and have hunted in and around Exford in Devon appear to be examples.  But the number of people affected to the extent that they are able at least to make a case for interference under Article 8(1) must be quite small.  This would affect the question of justification and proportionality, if there were interference under Article 8(1).  </p>

Their circumstances are summarised in paragraphs 32 and 33 above.  We think that the question for them is whether hunting is so much a part of their personal integrity and social and inter-personal development that the ban may properly be said to interfere with their private lives.  This is on the authorities a matter of degree for which an evaluative judgment is required.  In the end, the Strasbourg cases contain largely anchorless generalisations, moderated only by the facts of the individual cases.  The facts of most of these cases are far removed from those in the present case.  But we agree with Mr Sales that the ambit of personal integrity and social and inter-personal development which they address tends towards intensely personal matters of physical or psychological integrity in a domiciliary context.  But not all of them.  <span style="font-style:italic">Sidabras</span> perhaps represents something of a watershed.  We should prefer to adopt the judicial choice favoured by Laws LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Sheffield City Council v Smart </span>[2002] LGR 467 at 480-481 but feel constrained by the majority decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Qazi</span> not to do so – see below for a more extended discussion.</p>

But on balance we do not consider that they cross the border.  We reach this conclusion in short because (1) the nature of the intrusion into personal integrity and inter-personal development caused by the hunting ban is qualitatively different from that in most of the core Strasbourg authorities; (2) other authorities, for example <span style="font-style:italic">Sidabras,</span> represent a degree of intrusion which is not present in the cases before the court; (3) much of the intrusion is economic, more appropriate for consideration under Article 1 of the First Protocol; and (4) the hunting community as a whole is not remotely equivalent to an ethnic minority.</p>

The Inner House considered that, although the concept of “home” extends beyond an individual’s dwelling house, an extensive country estate on which a person lives could not be regarded as his home.  “Home” connotes a dwelling house or habitation and its immediate surroundings.  It does not include whatever land is held with the house.

The wife had left the defendant and had given the housing authority notice to quit in accordance with the tenancy agreement.  The defendant resisted the proceedings for possession on the ground that the authority were interfering with his right to respect for his home under Article 8 of the Human Rights Convention.  There were two questions, both under Article 8(1).  The first question was whether the house was his “home” within Article 8(1).  The House of Lords decided unanimously that it was.  The second question was whether the defendant’s right to respect for his home was infringed by the enforcement of proprietary or contractual rights to possession, so that a question of justification under Article 8(2), as yet undecided, arose.  The House of Lords decided by a majority, Lord Bingham of Cornhill and Lord Steyn dissenting, that the defendant’s right to respect for his home was not so infringed.  </p>

It directs attention to where a person lives (Lord Bingham at paragraph 9).  Lord Hope, in considering what Article 8 protects, directed attention to the decision of the European Court of Human Rights in <span style="font-style:italic">Marckx v Belgium</span> (1979) 2 EHRR 330 at page 342.  This included the observation that the object of Article 8 is essentially that of protecting the individual against arbitrary interference by public authorities.  Lord Hope also drew attention to passages from the dissenting opinion of Sir Gerald Fitzmaurice.  Sir Gerald drew a distinction between an article of the Human Rights Convention being applicable and being interfered with.  He observed that the main, if not the sole, object and intended sphere of application of Article 8 was the “domiciliary protection” of the individual.  Lord Hope said at paragraph 50:</p>

The rights to respect referred to in this paragraph extends to the person’s home.  But the essence of this right lies in the concept of respect for the home as one among various things that affect a person’s right to privacy.  The context in which the reference to a person’s “home” must be understood is indicated by the references in the same paragraph to his private and family life and to his correspondence.  The emphasis is on the person’s home as a place where he is entitled to be free from arbitrary interference by the public authorities.  Article 8(1) does not concern itself with the person’s right to the peaceful enjoyment of his home as a possession or as a property right.  Rights of that kind are protected by Article 1 of the First Protocol.”</p>

We note that Lord Bingham  and Lord Steyn, in the minority in <span style="font-style:italic">Qazi</span>, agreed with paragraphs 26 and 27 of Laws LJ’s judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Sheffield City Council v Smart</span> [2002] LGR 467 at 480-481 about the relationship between the two paragraphs of Article 8.  Laws LJ considered that there is a judicial choice to be made between two possibilities.  The first would entail a judgment that the Convention requirement was not met at the Article 8(1) stage, i.e. that there was no want of respect for the tenant’s home.  The second choice would accept that there was a prima facie violation of Article 8(1), and entail the subsequent application of the more rigorous and specific standards set out in Article 8(2).  Laws LJ’s first approach, which he preferred and which Lord Bingham and Lord Steyn agreed with, might possibly result in a decision in this case that there is an interference with the right to respect for the home of people who lose their homes because they are tied to their hunting jobs which are lost.  But even on that view, the interference is indirect.  </p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“But there is a material distinction, in our opinion, between a restriction which compels an individual to join an association or prohibits him from joining it, or penalises him in either event (cf <span style="font-style:italic">Chassagnou v France</span>), and a restriction that, without reference to any association, nearly prohibits a particular activity with the indirect result that persons cannot associate for the purpose of carrying it out.  A restriction of the former kind is capable of engaging Art 11; but a restriction of the latter kind is not.  If it were otherwise, the prohibition of any activity would infringe Art 11.  We agree entirely with the conclusion of Lord Brodie on the question in <span style="font-style:italic">Whaley v Lord Advocate</span>.  As His Lordship said in that case, the 2002 Act does not prohibit the assembling of a hunt, on horseback or otherwise, but rather an activity upon which the hunt might engage.  The members remain free to assemble together for a mock chase, or a drag hunt or simply a communal ride.  What is subject to regulation is the nature of the quarry and the method of the kill, not the fact or manner of association (para 80).”</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Singh QC, on behalf of the RSPCA, agrees with Mr Gordon that the question whether Article 11(1) is infringed is a matter of degree.  He says that it is simply not sustainable for the claimants to characterise the hunting ban as prohibiting the entire purpose of their association or assembly.  He says that similar alternative activities with similar social, economic and cultural potential remain lawful and that the evidence is that hunts have continued to meet in order to pursue these activities following the hunting ban.  The European Commission held in<span style="font-style:italic"> Anderson</span> that Article 11 does not extend to protect freedom of assembly for purely social purposes.  Mr Singh submits, with reference to <span style="font-style:italic">Chassagnou</span>, that those involved in hunting remain able to share their beliefs and ideas and interests in association with others.  Many, if not most, continue to do so following the ban.  He submits that the decision of the Inner House in <span style="font-style:italic">Adams</span> was correct.  An application of Article 11(1) which is sufficiently wide to encompass the ban on hunting would devalue this and other Articles of the Convention.  The core of Article 11 rights is illustrated by the specific reference in Article 11(1) to trade unions.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The focus of Art 11 is directed at assembly or association.  It is true that many assemblies or associations would not occur unless those participating shared a particular purpose.  Alternative social activities for the hunts are still permissible, but, the whole point of the <span style="font-style:italic">meet</span> (a word itself redolent of Article 11) is defeated by the ban and, accordingly we accept that the effect of the ban will be to inhibit or impede the freedom.  But that, in our view, is not enough.  A prohibition which has an indirect effect on the freedoms protected by Art 11 does not fall within its scope.  Only a measure which directly affects such freedoms would do so. We should not, for instance, be inclined to hold that banning the consumption of spirits would interfere with the freedom to assemble and associate at a public house of those who only drink whisky or gin.  </p>

The defendants accept that the Hunting Act does to an extent infringe Article 1.  The principle issues between the parties are (1) whether a person’s “livelihood” constitutes a possession within Article 1; (2) the extent to which Article 1 is infringed; and (3) whether such interference as there is constitutes control of use of possessions or deprivation of them.  The third of these issues is relevant to the question of justification and proportionality, since the Hunting Act does not provide a compensation scheme.  Beyond this, all three issues are of general relevance only, since (a) the defendants accept that there is to a extent infringement of Article 1, so that an issue of justification and proportionality does arise; and (b) this court is not in a position to make a final determination in respect of individuals.</p>

If he is to stay within the law, he will be forced to shoot them, an action he is unwilling to take on moral and ethical grounds.  These are, it is said, clear examples of a control of use of land.

They have in effect been deprived of these possessions.  They have other property which is devalued as a result of the ban on hunting and which will require reinstatement.

This and the <span style="font-style:italic">Edgar</span> case were both claims brought by commercial concerns adversely affected by the Firearms Amendment Acts 1997, which extended the prohibition on hand guns.  They complained that the diminution in the value of their businesses constituted an interference with their possessions contrary to Article 1.  In both cases, the court held that the element of the complaints which was based upon diminution of value of a business assessed by reference to future income fell outside Article 1.  Only goodwill, in the sense of an established client base with its own inherent value and the existing assets of a company could qualify as possessions under Article 1.  </p>

I do not understand Lord Woolf CJ [2002] 1 WLR 3223, 3238 to have expressed a different view in paragraph 47 of his judgment.  On the other hand, the proscribed grounds in Article 14 cannot be unlimited, otherwise the wording of Article 14 referring to “other status” beyond the well established proscribed grounds, including things such as sex, race or colour, would be unnecessary.  It would then preclude discrimination on any ground.  That is plainly not the meaning of Article 14.”</p>

This section requires the court, so far as it is possible to do so, to read and give effect to primary and subordinate legislation in a way which is compatible with convention rights.  If the Hunting Act is on a purely domestic interpretation incompatible with the European Convention, the court has to try to interpret it in a manner that is compatible.  Otherwise, the court should make a declaration of incompatibility under section 4(2).  Mr Gordon submits that, assuming that the court would otherwise find incompatibility, it is possible to read and give effect to the Hunting Act in a way which is compatible with Convention rights by (for example) interpreting section 1 of the Act to read:</p>

Some of the defendants’ arguments will have more force in relation to one (for example Article 28) than in relation to the others.  Success in establishing infringement of any one Article in relation to any one European Law claimant will compel the defendant to justify the infringement in accordance with the Treaty and jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">But it is important to understand the scope of the principle on which Mr Anderson QC relies.  The principle that non-discriminatory measures are caught by Article 28 however even-handed their application is not concerned with the question whether a measure does in truth fall within Article 28.  The principle merely directs that a measure may be caught by Article 28 notwithstanding that it applies to both domestic and other products.  The principle does not itself provide the answer to the question whether the measure is within Article 28.  That logically prior question is now governed by the jurisprudence explained in <span style="font-style:italic">Keck</span>.<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>The paradigm case, as explained in<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span><span style="font-style:italic">Keck </span>at paragraph 15, does itself draw a distinction between the rules applying to a product in one Member State in contrast to the rules applying in another. The principle that a rule may fall foul of Article 28 notwithstanding its non- discriminatory application merely means that if, after the contrast is drawn, the measure is prohibited by Article 28, it will not be saved because it applies to domestic and non-domestic products alike.</p>

But its apparent attraction was to simulate shooting people, to which the necessary target could be attached.  Such use offended a German prohibition on games which simulated playing at killing people.  The Court ruled that such a prohibition affects the freedom to provide services contrary to Article 49, as well as the freedom to trade in goods in Article 28.

In <span style="font-style:italic">Keck,</span>  it was possible to draw a distinction between the paradigm case and other measures.  In relation to services, this is much more difficult.  If the same or similar tests were adopted it would tend to cover so many measures relating to services as to deprive Article 49 of any practical effect.</p>

The extent and depth of this conviction was shown clearly in the submissions made by Mr Friend to the court.  The claimants submitted that hunting with hounds has been a custom in this country for thousands of years, and that over the course of time those with a common passion and interest in the pursuit have been brought together by a common aim.  However, not all opinions or convictions, however sincerely or deeply held, constitute beliefs in the sense protected by Article 9(1) of the ECHR: <span style="font-style:italic">Pretty v United Kingdom</span>.  The right to hunt with hounds does not have the necessary qualities identified by the Court of Appeal or Lord Nicholls to qualify under Article 9.  In particular, the claimants failed to persuade us that their belief in the right to hunt went beyond enjoyment of and dedication to a recreational pursuit.  It cannot qualify as an aspect of human life or behaviour of comparable importance to that normally found with religious beliefs.</p>

The right to express views about the Hunting Act, the ban on hunting and the perceived incursion on freedoms and liberties that the ban imposes are all protected by Article 10 even if the information and ideas which the claimants make public would offend, shock or disturb the state or any sector of the population.  Equally, the claimants have a protected right to wear hunting dress whenever and wherever they please if they so choose.  The Hunting Act does not interfere with any of these forms of expression.  It is difficult to determine from the claimants’ argument what precise form of expression is alleged to have been infringed by the Act.  The alleged infringement of a right to membership of a social or cultural group and the participation in an associated lifestyle is more appropriately dealt with under Article 11, which we have considered elsewhere in this judgment.</p>

We put it compositely thus, being conscious nevertheless that the framework for justification may in theory vary somewhat depending on which right or freedom is infringed.  We have held that the question of justification arises under Article 1 of the First Protocol in the human rights proceedings and Article 49 of the Treaty in the European law proceedings.  We have also said that we will address justification in the context of possible infringements of Articles 8 and 11 of the Convention.  But, subject to some qualifications mainly by Mr Anderson, the parties have proceeded on the basis that substantially the same questions have to be addressed whichever route to justification is taken.  This is, we think, both sensible and pragmatically correct.  It would be strange, perhaps absurd, if the Hunting Act were held to be justified and proportionate for the purpose of one kind of infringement, but unjustified or disproportionate for the purpose of another closely related infringement.  This is especially so when human rights considerations are acknowledged to bear upon European law issues.</p>

We have held that the Human Rights claimants do not make any significant case for deprivation of possessions.  We are concerned in the main with a measure which controls the use of property.  The language of the Article makes the State the arbiter of what is “necessary”.  This has some bearing on the extent to which the court should carry out a re-evaluation of what is to be regarded as necessary.

One question for consideration was whether section 127(3) of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 was compatible with Article 1 of the First Protocol of the Human Rights Convention.  For that purpose the court had to look for the policy objective of the legislation.  That gives rise to the question what material is properly available to help the court do this.  There were submissions on behalf of the Speaker of the House of Commons and the Clerk of the Parliaments.  The policy and objects of a statute must be determined by interpreting its language, which alone represents Parliament’s intention.  Reference to debates for the purpose of determining whether the policy considerations put forward by those participating in debates in either House were justifiable in Convention terms and proportionate to the remedy proposed would involve “questioning” what is said in Parliament contrary to Article 9 of the Bill of Rights 1689.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Accordingly, our first task, in the search for the comparative policy objectives upon which we have to make a value judgment, is to look primarily at the Hunting Act itself.  We may also look cautiously outside the statute for its background context and underlying rationale; and also on the other side of the comparison for information tending to show its likely practical impact.  Where this takes us at the margins may be debateable, but the parties were in broad agreement in their oral submissions as to the relatively confined nature of the evidential material properly available for our consideration.  We are clear that we may consider the conclusions of the Burns Inquiry, and we note that opinions have been expressed over the years, at the Portcullis House hearings and elsewhere, in support of or in opposition to the continuation of hunting with dogs, and as to various aspects of the overall debate.  We are not, however, called upon to decide the many facets of disagreement; rather to evaluate whether the legislation which the House of Commons enacted was justifiable in Human Rights and European Law terms.  Statements by individual Members of Parliament in and out of Parliament are not helpful, nor, we think, admissible.  We have not in this respect looked at Hansard.  We are extremely cautious about looking to statements by the Minister in promoting his Bill, mainly because his Bill was not enacted.  We also disregard what the Minister may have said in criticism of the legislation which the House of Commons eventually enacted, both because to that extent he was not promoting the legislation which was enacted, and because we are “called upon to evaluate the proportionality of the legislation, not the adequacy of the Minister’s exploration of the policy options or of his explanations to Parliament” (Lord Nicholls at paragraph 67 of <span style="font-style:italic">Wilson</span>).  Finally, since the House of Commons rejected the registration scheme in the original Michael Bill, we may suppose that the House of Commons considered that scheme to be inadequate to achieve its policy objective.  We have therefore to evaluate that rejection, which may also cast light on the policy objective of the legislation which was enacted.  </p>

Mr Bradley in paragraph 17 of his witness statement says that the purpose of the Act was to end practices which a clear majority of Members of the House of Commons considered to be cruel because they cause unnecessary suffering to wild mammals.  We are not necessarily obliged to adopt this uncritically, but it does represent the defendants’ case in these proceedings.  The claimants accept that the protection of animals from unnecessary suffering could be a legitimate legislative aim.  They say that it is far from clear that this was the true legislative objective, but that, assuming that it was, it has to be justified as legitimate and sufficiently necessary and proportionate to justify interference with the claimants’ Convention rights.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Human Rights claimants say that there is no sufficient rational relationship between a legislative aim of protecting wild mammals from unnecessary suffering and the measures used to achieve this.  This is so because, it is said, the Hunting Act has the potential for causing unnecessary suffering.  The simple submission here is that, with hunting banned, more foxes will be shot.  A hunted fox dies quickly, but a fox that is shot but only wounded may experience protracted suffering.  The intended legislative aim of the original Michael Bill was to protect wild mammals from unnecessary suffering, but the same cannot be said of the Hunting Act.  The Act itself had the potential to cause unnecessary suffering.  The term “cruel” is misleading, because it elevates moral protest over proper consideration of the evidence.  Hunting is not cruel, if it causes an animal no greater suffering than other lawful culling methods.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Another strand of submission is that the Hunting Act has no sufficient legitimate aim (and is unnecessary and disproportionate), because it does not provide as a defence to a criminal charge in an individual case that the hunting satisfied tests of utility and least suffering.

The registration scheme would have achieved the objective and the complete ban on hunting goes further and is more intrusive than was necessary.

None of the remaining legal methods are without difficulty from an animal welfare perspective.  Although paragraph 6.49 of the Report concluded that being closely pursued, caught and killed above ground by hounds “seriously compromises the welfare of the fox”, this was not, as Lord Burns later explained, a judgment that fox hunting is cruel in the sense that it causes unnecessary suffering, nor a judgment that fox hunting should be banned.    The Report itself concluded (paragraph 6.61) that if hunting were banned, it is possible that the welfare of foxes in upland areas could be affected adversely unless dogs could be used at least to flush foxes from cover. </p>

We can see in general how the utility test might have been applied.  We can see also that the registrar could have concluded for an individual hunt in particularly difficult country that there was no other practically effective means of culling the foxes than hunting.  We cannot, and do not, guess whether a registration scheme would have resulted in 6, or 60, or 160 registered fox hunts.  We do however note the RSPCA’s view that the registration scheme would effectively have brought hunting to an end (see also paragraph 40 of Mr Bradley’s witness statement).  We also see force in the defendants’ submission that Members of Parliament may have considered that the proposed registration scheme would simply have subcontracted to the registrar an intensely difficult decision which Parliament itself ought to take.</p>

On that assumption, the State now either has to show that the Government’s original view was wrong, or has to demonstrate by scientific evidence that the more restrictive provisions of the Hunting Act are both necessary and the only means of achieving the legislative aim; or the State has to show both of these.  The evidence, in particular that of Mr Bradley, does not show this.  He and the defendants are driven to “the clarion call of morality”.  This is no more than a substitute for rational argument.  These claimants accept that moral views may, provided they have a proper basis and scientific evidence, have a part to play in a legislative judgment about unnecessary suffering.

There is also a purpose of reducing “hunt havoc” and trespass and criminality.  The objectives are rationally directed towards the prevention of disorder, protection of health and/or morals and the protection of the rights and freedom of others in Article 8(2) and 11(2), and to legitimate objectives of public policy under Article 1 of the First Protocol and Article 14, if that were applicable.  </p>

The Act does not, and is not required to, depend entirely on a scientific analysis.  It is not as if it were concerned, for instance, with food additives and their potential scientific and physiological effect.  It was an entirely tenable view for the legislature to adopt,  that hunting should be banned, not just because it causes animal suffering, but also because it is unethical.</p>

The nature of the evidence available to legislators was such that its assessment necessarily required an element of moral or value judgment.  It is impossible to know for certain to what extent hunted animals suffer during the chase and the kill.  This is just not because they cannot express themselves but because of the nature of hunting.  The chase can be portrayed as no different in substance from vigorous and healthy exercise; the kill as excluding suffering because of the speed at which it often occurs.  Whether or not you accept those arguments cannot depend purely on scientific evidence, because science has not yet provided, and is unlikely to provide, any definitive answer.  It must depend in part on beliefs as to the sentient capacity of animals (not presently susceptible to definitive proof); the extent of the respect which should be accorded to them; whether a precautionary approach should be adopted; and the relevance of the fact that hunting may be a purely recreational activity.  The Burns Report noted in paragraph 6.10 that reliance on physiological and behavioural indicators would leave room for argument about whether particular indicators were a sign of poor welfare or merely of exertion within normal limits.  There is a better understanding of the physiological changes which occur when a deer is hunted, “although there are still substantial areas of disagreement” (paragraph 6.33).  There comes a point where in “the argument ceases to turn purely on scientific evidence, but instead, becomes a broader judgment about animal welfare” (paragraph 6.32).</p>

But this evidence would resolve nothing, it is well known that different views are held on the desirability of the corporal punishment to children.  Evidence by parents, experts and others that in their opinion corporal punishment has an overall beneficial effect, or that it may do so in certain circumstances, would be no more than evidence in support of one view on a much discussed social issue affecting every family.”</p>

They say that the statements made by Mr Rolls in these proceedings were in the main available to legislators by means of the Burns Inquiry and the Portcullis hearings.  There is a respectable and well supported school of thought that hunting with dogs is obviously cruel.  There is a view, widely held internationally, that “man has a moral obligation to respect all animals and to have due consideration for their capacity for suffering and memory” (preamble to the European Convention for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals used for Experimental and Other Scientific Purposes).  This view guides a principle for the treatment of laboratory animals that, if something is likely to cause suffering in humans, it should be assumed to cause suffering in animals.  If there were doubt about the suffering of a hunted animal, it would be justifiable to legislate to remove that doubt.  Therein, perhaps, lies the point at which the claimants’ and defendants’ cases most obviously collide.

But, as Mr Sales said, if it was rationally open to the House of Commons to adopt a different view (as we think it was), it is open to the court to conclude that that is what they collectively did.  The State is not in a more advantageous position in these proceedings because the Hunting Act resulted from a free vote.  But, since we cannot consider the views in Parliament of individual members of the House of Commons, the search for their collective legislative aim, objectively determined from the evidence, cannot be abandoned.</p>

We acknowledge that a comparative assessment is necessary to satisfy the requirement that the measure must go no further than is necessary to achieve the aim.   But that is a comparison between the Hunting Act and other possible measures.  In urging a comparison between hunting with dogs and other methods of culling, the claimants assume a definition of cruelty (also assumed by the Government) based on unnecessary suffering, itself based on a comparative assessment of that which causes least suffering, and without an ethical overlay.  We can well conceive that Members of Parliament could rationally adopt a rather less structured view of what is cruel.  More importantly, however, a comparative evaluation between (1)  suffering caused by hunting with dogs, which is regarded as both unethical and intentional, and (2) accidental and unintentional suffering resulting from a shot which wounds but does not kill outright, could rationally fall on the side of the former.  There was, in any event, a reasonable basis on the evidence for a conclusion that, taken as a whole, hunting foxes with dogs causes more suffering than shooting them.</p>

In the medium term, say three to five years, more losses would occur as hunt followers brought their horse numbers into line with current use.  Losses would also arise in the wider rural economy, in particular the horse economy, although in part they would be offset by other changes, including expenditure being diverted into other activities.  In the long term, say seven to ten years, most (if not all) of the effects would be offset as resources were diverted to new activities and the rural economy adjusted to other economic forces.

Hunting is itself a social activity, and hunts organise a wide range of social and sporting events.  But it is also important to see hunting, especially organised hunting, in its wider context.  It is a highly co-operative social activity taking place in a rural setting.  Different people value different aspects but farmers and landowners are at its heart.  Rural communities are diverse and changing but farmers, as a group, feel that their interests and way of life are not understood by central government and the urban majority.</p>

For a significant minority, notably hunt participants and farmers in more isolated rural communities, the hunts play a dominant role.  The loss of these activities, if that were the outcome of a ban on hunting, would be keenly felt.  For those who take part, hunting is itself partly a social event, particularly during the winter months when alternative activities are scarce.  For others, the social activities organised by the hunts are significant, but less so than those organised by other groups, in particular the pub and the church.  Event those who would not feel greatly, at a personal level, the loss of the hunts’ social activities consider that it would have a detrimental effect on the social life of others and on community life in general.  A number would also feel that it would mark the end of an important, living cultural tradition.  The precise balance between these different responses would vary from region to region and area to area.  Generally, however, the impact would be felt most strongly in the more isolated rural areas.  In areas of greater population density where these are more alternative activities available, and where the population is more socially diverse, a ban would make less of a social impact.

The precise nature of these indicators will vary depending on the animal concerned but they will usually comprise a mixture of physiological indicators and behavioural indicators.  But, because they are only indicators, there is often room for argument about the extent to which a particular finding indicates poor welfare as opposed to, for example, exertion that can be regarded as falling within natural limits.

It is clear, moreover, that if the dog or dogs catch the hare, they do not always kill it quickly.  There can also sometimes be a significant delay, in “driven” coursing, before the “picker up” reaches the hare and dispatches it (if it is not already dead).  In the case of “walked up” coursing, the delay is likely to be even longer.  (Paragraph 6.68)</span>

There seems reason to suppose, however, that being closely pursued, caught and killed by hounds, or being dug out or bolted, seriously compromises the welfare of the mink.  The kill, by the hounds or by shooting, is normally quick once the mink is caught.  In the absence of hunting, more mink would probably be killed by shooting and, mainly, trapping.  These methods involve welfare implications but we do not have sufficient evidence to conclude how they compare with those raised by hunting.  (Paragraph 6.71)</span>

The Countryside Alliance were responsible for bringing this challenge. Very clearly there are, I think, the second to eleven claimants individually, plainly, played a crucial role.  It would be naive to think that those eleven individuals came to Court entirely unprotected by internal arrangements with the Alliance. There is a mechanism by way of indemnification which was subject of much concern and scrutiny at the earliest stage of this case. But it is not yet tested and it would be concerning to the claimants if indeed it was necessary to get into that territory at all.  So what I would like to just preface my main submission that there should be no order, with the fact that if you are against me, you should draw some distinction between the position of the Alliance and the individual claimants.</span>

	      <marker name="tab"/>
	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">MR BOWEN:  I distinctly have two hands. The first point I would like to make in relation to costs is that it is almost inevitable that if the Alliance had not brought various groups together and had not been the centre point for research initially and consultation and debate, as they have been throughout, you will have seen, throughout the various enquiries.  When the Act was finally passed in plainly controversial circumstances another challenge will almost certainly have come from somewhere.  It is like so many things a matter of speculation, but I think I can say it is very probable that a claimant, with the benefit of funding from the Legal Services Commission would have emerged. Accordingly, and I do not say this in merth in any way, the Countryside Alliance have in a perverse way carried out some public service for the government, by funding what would in any case have been substantial costs, irrespective of whether we have gone over the top on evidence or not, even if the case was brought in a more factually and evidentially slimmed down fashion.  The government, the State as a whole, would almost certainly have had to have paid.  If they had been legally aided there would have been no prospect of enforcing the event of a win. So that on its own must, in my respectful submission, be a compelling reason for saying that this is a no order case.  I would like to bolster that by saying that, quite clearly, and I do not want to repeat everything that Mr Lissack said in opening, the impact on whole communities, on individuals, lost livelihoods on the way that people have chosen to live their lives in this case is profound. I think your Lordships entirely accept that. For understandable reasons have found against us on our technical Human Rights argument.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">To an extent it adds further insult to injury -- I think is a phrase that has come up on paper and possibly orally when this case was opened -- that there should also be a financial condemnation in addition to the rejection of our argument.  Now, I can further bolster that by saying that the government have not been wholly successful.  Plainly Mr Anderson is on slightly stronger ground than me because of the manner in which he dealt analytically with his claim. But nonetheless the question of legitimate aim was plainly not easy.  You have not, this Court has not adopted wholesale the government's defence on legitimate aim.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">MR BOWEN:  Not hunting, I am sure. But the major point, which is taken in similar cases -- the New Zealand Maori case I am thinking of particularly -- is that this claim was not brought, out of personal gain, personal motive by the Alliance.  It was brought for the very simple reason, that there was a massive ground swell of opinion and disagreement with what the State was doing, but somebody had to come to Court and argue against it.  On that basis, we have represented, the claimants two to eleven, have represented rural communities all over England and Wales, many of whom, substantial parts of those communities share those views and share those believes. So, in short, if ever there was a public interest case, this is it.  Yes, we have lost and I entirely accept that. If I do not know if Mr De La Mare may or may not in his response start talking about protected costs orders, paragraph 74 of Corner House Research and those five or six guidelines which we plainly would not fitted into because this case would have happened anyway, even if such an order had been made.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">My understanding is that the fact that the individual claimants and/or the Alliance, trying to change those guidelines, did not come to Court to try to seek such an order, in no way undercuts your Lordship's discretion, which plainly generally exists in this jurisdiction to make no order. The fundamental rule, as stated, many times over, is that there is no rule.  This is a case which cries out, justice wise, for no order, my Lord.

Secondly, it is the kind of category into which cases where the exceptional step of a no order as to costs has been made, where the effect of imposing costs in the litigation has been to disable, if you like, or impede the litigant of capacity of that group, to pursue public interest cases. There is no suggestion that the Countryside Alliance is not going to be able to pursue with the utmost vigour whatever course it thinks necessary in pursuing this litigation.

The Court should have an opportunity to control the way the litigation is handled in order to ensure that there is some proper balance being struck, by the costs protections, on the one hand, and the position of the public purse on the other.

One, they could have found applicants who could have happily funded the litigation in its entirety.  Secondly, the Legal Services Commission decided whether or not to grant funding to a case.  First of all, they would have looked at the merits and one would imagine they tried to get legal funding to begin with. We (inaudible) about that. Secondly, if where you make an application to the Legal Services Commission, the Legal Services Commission will look at the extent to which it is reasonable to expect other people to bear a proportion of the costs of litigation. There is no indication that that step has been taken. Quite why the public purse should meet the entire costs on both sides in a case such as this, I am really at a loss to see.</span>

I say that the EC case as a whole has effectively been won in the circumstances to hive off a piece of that particular piece of litigation. It is somewhat of an artificial exercise. I take his gateway point.  Yes, the gateways were hotly contested. But in terms of how much time that actually took up in terms of preparation of the case and indeed in argument -- the point was very shortly dealt with -- I say it was a very small point. If I have to get to negotiating or making submissions about the level of discount, I would say 10% is much closer to the mark than 20%.  I say 100% is actually the better result.

If you have swains of individuals who say, claim at least and uncontroverted by evidence, that they are going to be able to do little else than stack shelves in Sainsbury's.  In some cases, Mr Bigham for instance, who has been a terrier man for 42 years. He is in his early 60s.  He says he is hard pushed to think what he is going to do.</span>

He certainly did not spend half-a-day on livelihoods. Equally Mr Sales' reply was probably on that issue 10 or 15 minutes. A lot of it is on paper.  There is now a conflict between the Divisional Court here and the Court of Appeal at the Inner House.  It would seem sensible that it was unresolved.

Mr Friend, our provisional view that you should not, you and Mr Thomas should not get permission to appeal runs as follows:  we do not think you should get permission to appeal on those points that you alone took. We fully appreciate that you also took points which were common to the Human Rights claimants, article 8, Article 11 and Article 14 and so forth.  They are, subject to what Mr De La Mare has to say to us going to get permission to appeal on those grounds. There is not any point, if I can put it that way without being in any way offensive, in you rowing in on the same ground, which is going to be covered any way. If they succeed, you benefit. If they do not succeed, you avoid the risk of having to go to the Court of Appeal.  That is the sort of thought we are having now.  Do you want permission to appeal?</span>

They cannot, and I knew they could not. But one has to exhaust domestic remedies before one goes to Europe. Although the other claimants may be unsuccessful on the co-points and the co-issues, they, I would wish, to take those to Europe, if indeed it gets that far. I notice that you are not going to grant permission on 14. Nine, conscience, I remember the comments you made I did not convince you.  I was not talking about recreation, I was talking about way of life. I accept your views on 10. On 17, you ask me to elaborate.  Perhaps in another court I can elaborate. I have never found anybody to take 53.  On that principle alone, I seek permission.  And 14. I take the other words.  Also I did but make, I thought, quite a cogent argument on ethnic identity which you have rejected. I do think it should be looked at by another court and that would immediately link into 14.  I would seek your permission to appeal but I do understand that if you do not, I do have the right to leave to appeal. That is all need to say my Lord.</span>

Your Lordship already has done, namely that it is a public interest case, rather than one that has real prospects of success. With that marker I will say no more. Other than to say, in respect of Mr Friend, while I will say two things. In respect of Mr Friend, I well understand why your Lordships gives him mirror image permission.  I wonder whether a little bit of case management might be sensible in the circumstances. Mr Friend very much wants to keep his points alive. Might it not be sensible that his claim was stayed effectively, recognising the fact that there is test case litigation going forward, so that the case being handled by Mr Bowen and his team can be resolved finally?  Then all look alike cases -- there may be others apart from Mr Friend's -- can be disposed of once the law has been clarified by the Court of Appeal and higher if necessary.  I can see that there may be other potential claimants in the woodwork. We do not want the Court of Appeal to be bombarded by all of them.</span>

The thinking behind that is simply that there is no utility, as we see it, in Mr Friend and Mr Thomas also being enabled by this Court to appeal to the Court of Appeal on those issues when the very same issues are going to be advanced by the Human Rights claimants, but that the position should be covered, the contingency should be covered were the Human Rights claimants to succeed in the Court of appeal.

I do not know whether any attempt will be made to appeal the Article 14 point, or indeed any other points that are still open.  Is it my understanding of your order that we have until 16th September also to put in our process to the Court of Appeal on those aspects. I think unless your Lordships clarify the position, there may be some procedural confusion.  I would respectfully suggest it would be for more sensible to put everything in at once, as opposed having complied with the ordinary 14 day rule in relation to those small parts.</span>
