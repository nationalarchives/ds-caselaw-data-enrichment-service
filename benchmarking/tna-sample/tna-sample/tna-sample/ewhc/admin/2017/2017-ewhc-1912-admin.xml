	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This is an appeal by the Government of Rwanda [“GoR”] against the decision of the then Deputy Senior District Judge Arbuthnot, declining to permit the extradition of these five men to Rwanda.  The requested Parties [“RPs”] cross-appeal.  The decision of Senior District Judge Arbuthnot [hereafter “the SDJ”], as she now is, was given on 22 December 2015, following a hearing which occupied the Court for 66 days.  She declined to order extradition.  Her decision in respect of the first four named Respondents was founded on her conclusion that there was a real risk they might suffer a flagrant breach of their rights to a fair trial if extradited, such that there would be a breach of Article 6 of the European Convention of Human Rights, and of Section 87 of the Extradition Act 2003 [“the 2003 Act”].</p>

SDJ Arbuthnot found that his extradition was barred by the Rule against double-jeopardy.  However, she indicated that she would also have discharged the fourth Respondent pursuant to Section 87 of the 2003 Act.</p>

In 1993 he attended a meeting in Myamirambo [sic: read Nyamirambo] Stadium in Kigali where Hutus were called to disassociate themselves from the Tutsi who were said to be the enemy, at this meeting VB was said to be in charge of protocol.  Finally in 1 [sic]. He attended the swearing in ceremony for the interim government on 4th July 1994 at Kibehehank where he collected financial contributions.  2.

CM took part in the looting of a property and he punished those who looted without killing the owners first; he also led a number of attacks over some days on Ruhashya over the Mwogo River which killed thousands of Tutsis.</p>

The commune policemen who were under his direct control played an important part in the killings.  CU urged people attending meetings to kill Tutsis.  He gave instructions that certain Tutsis were to be tricked to come out of hiding so they could be killed, he ordered that Tutsi bodies should be moved so they would not be seen by foreigners.  He is also alleged to have distributed guns.  In May 1994 he addressed about 300 people and urged them to destroy property belonging to Tutsis.</p>

The evidence against <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman Bold'">Celestin Mutabaruka</span> are that he took over the running of a forest management company in Musebeya, Gikongoro called Crete Zaire Nil (“CZN”) in January 1992.  When he took over he brought in ethnic segregation and by June 1992 it is alleged he was persecuting and discriminating against Tutsis.  In November or December 1993 there was an attempt to remove him from his post when he was to be replaced by a Tutsi.  CMU refused to go and claimed that his removal was a political issue between two parties, the MRND and PSD.  There is documentary evidence which confirms his writing to the President of Rwanda saying he had set up a political party and asking the President to intervene in his removal from CZN.  </p>

Importantly as far as the prima facie case is concerned, it is alleged that during the genocide he played an important role along with his close friend and colleague Jonas Kanyarutoki in the killings which took place at Gatare when people who had taken shelter in the Presbyterian Church were persuaded to leave and then killed on 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 1994.

Using CZN vehicles, he led Interahamwe and fired into the crowd killing one person through the eye.  He returned the following day and finished off any survivors. He was said to be one of the leaders who would stand with the Interahamwe and give them briefings.  About 40,000 Tutsis are said to have died in those attacks. </p>

Various letters are exhibits including his asking the President, Prime Minister and Commanding Officer of the Gikongoro gendarmerie for a firearm, another a letter from a CZN employee complaining that he had sacked a number of Tutsis unfairly and a letter from Oswald Rugema complaining of unfair dismissal and of being arrested at the behest of the CMU on what he says is a trumped up charge.  In one of the letters which is undated CMU denies the accusations of ethnic segregation at CZN (…).  These letters continue into 1994.”</p>

At the same time, once (relatively) stable government returned, there was an enormous requirement for some form of justice, beyond the capacity of the formal court system.  Therefore the system of <span style="font-style:italic">gacaca</span> courts was established.  The term means “lawn”, because the hearings often took place outside on the grass or on an open space.  The <span style="font-style:italic">gacaca </span>court was typically formed by elders or responsible members of the community.  They heard witnesses, reached verdicts and passed sentences, on genocide cases, in many instances, sentences of very great length.  There was an appeal system.   Three of the Respondents had <span style="font-style:italic">gacaca</span> hearings.

Transfer takes place to the Specialized Chamber of the High Court in Kigali, which will be the Court of trial for the RPs if extradited.

If the political regime is autocratic, betrays an intolerance of dissent, and entertains scant regard for the rule of law, the judicial arm of the State may be infected by the same vices; and even if it is not, it may be subject to political pressures at the hands of those who are, so that at the least the courts may find it difficult to deliver objective justice with even-handed procedures for every litigant whatever the nature of his background or the colour of his opinions.  We must take care, of course, to avoid crude assumptions as to the quality of a State’s judiciary based on the quality of the State’s politics.

We have had the advantage of being able to consider not only the HRW Report of July 2008, including its treatment of the Bizimungu case (paragraph 104 above), but also the evidence of Professor Reyntjens, Professor Sands and Professor Schabas, and in particular the acceptance by Professor Schabas in cross-examination on 21 April 2008 that there probably was executive interference in the Bizimungu case (see paragraph 101 above).

But "real risk" does not mean proof on the balance of probabilities.  It means a risk which is substantial and not merely fanciful; and it may be established by something less than proof of a 51% probability.  The approach is the same as that taken in refugee cases, where the asylum seeker has to show a real risk that if he is returned to his home State he will be persecuted on any of the grounds set out in the 1951 United Nations Refugee Convention ….   We think that despite his citation of the correct test the judge fell into error here.

The deposition begins from the refusal in <span style="font-style:italic">Brown</span>, and the core case can be summarised as follows:  there have been material changes in the provision of video conferencing facilities in Rwanda; changes in witness protection facilities in Rwanda and changes in Rwandan law allowing international judges to try cases of genocidaires transferred or extradited to Rwanda.  There were, in addition, some changed practices as to representation.  The affidavit went on to recite, as “developments in relation to extradition requests by Rwanda for genocidaires”, a number of decisions by the ICTR Referral and Appeals Chambers and other non-Rwandan Courts, permitting transfer or extradition to Rwanda.</p>

This underpins many of the arguments made below and to us.  Much of this bears on the central issue of fair trial, but also on other grounds advanced by the RPs.  It was said then by the GoR that no Court had refused to extradite, transfer or deport to Rwanda since 2009, in relation to those accused of genocide charges, although a late exception arose in November 2015, when a Dutch Court in The Hague refused to extradite a Rwandan citizen, Mr Iyamuremye.  This was of particular interest, since a key witness in that case was Mr Martin Witteveen, who played a very significant part in these proceedings.  However, since this matter arose so very late, and since so little detail had surfaced for her to consider, SDJ Arbuthnot declined to rely on this decision.

Even in respect of the factual conclusions reached by that Court, there is no strict rule binding any Court in these proceedings to follow them.  However, the latter point does not seem to us to arise.  There is no evidence which would cause doubt to be thrown on the conclusion in 2009 based on the evidence then available.

His points included reliance on a new provision under the 2009 Transfer Amendment Law providing for a quorum of three or more judges to try cases; immunity from prosecution for witnesses in respect of anything said or done in the course of a trial and the capacity to take evidence by deposition or video-link, in Rwanda or abroad, provided there is good reason.  There is a right to legal aid, and an obligation placed on all members of the Bar in Rwanda to provide <span style="font-style:italic">pro bono</span> legal services.  The Rwandan Bar Association [“RBA”], later renamed the Kigali Bar Association [“KBA”], has an obligation to provide for legal services to the indigent.  The Ministry of Justice pays a monthly stipend for such legal services and was said to have specific funds available for transferred and extradited defendants.  Mr Ngoga described arrangements for facilitating defence investigations, suggesting that the judicial police conduct investigations “for and against” the accused.  There were said to be proper provisions for witness protection.  There were two bodies responsible for that programme.  The first was the Witness and Victim Support Unit [“WVSU”] housed within the public prosecutor’s office.  The second body was the Witness Protection Unit [“WPU”] set up more recently under the direction of the judiciary, in response to concerns that “some defence witnesses might be reluctant to use the WVSU”, given its association with the prosecutors.</p>

To conclude, I am drawing a distinction between the way the Rwandan High Court tries cases with a political flavour and the way they try genocide allegations.  This is based on the clear evidence I have seen about the approach taken by the Specialised Chamber towards the five transferred genocide cases.  Having considered all the evidence, I cannot exclude a risk of interference but judging from the transferred defendants the highest risk is from the pressure exerted by GoR ministers’ comments in public and in the press.  I consider any such risk would be reduced by a robust, able and experienced defence team with an ability to investigate the defence case and international monitoring of some sort.  I consider that without both of these the RPs would be at a greater risk of judges behaving partially and being influenced by factors outside the evidence.”</p>

I find that they are frightened and are expressing their genuinely held views.  Many of the witnesses are from rural backgrounds and are of relatively low educational attainment.  The reputation of the GoR at home and abroad as I have found in Paragraphs 221-223 cannot be of assistance either but Witteveen’s evidence of his experience, which I accept, is that the witnesses are more frightened of local repercussions rather than national ones although both are feared.  The witnesses’ fears vary from a concern that they will be killed or imprisoned and tortured to a fear of losing their benefits as genocide survivors.  Some fear they may be charged with genocide minimization type offences or prosecuted for offences arising out of the genocide.</p>

Part of this professionalism and these standards is the necessity to have defence attorneys who possess the knowledge, experience and the resources to conduct investigations for the defence, including the capabilities to conduct investigations abroad</span>”.  He has profound doubts that the defence lawyers assigned to the transfer cases can do that.  His solution is still to extradite but to provide a lawyer with the right experience to work alongside Rwandan lawyers who would be provided with appropriate funds to conduct investigations.  In his view (and in my view) “<span style="font-style:italic">it ensures the necessary adequate defence capabilities for the defendant that meets the required standard and guarantees not only procedurally fair trial but also a fairness to the trial</span>”.

It is too early to say that sufficient funding for defence investigations in relation to witnesses abroad will be provided.  These defendants are legally aided in this country and will be indigent in Rwanda.  I have seen in this case what the effective representation by counsel can achieve.  Without such representation and funding, the High Court in Rwanda would be presented with the prosecution case and the RPs would find it impossible to present their side of what happened.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in"> Drawing the threads together, SDJ Arbuthnot focussed on four key issues when deciding whether there would arise a “real risk of a flagrant denial of justice”:  the independence of the judiciary and pressure from the Executive; the availability of, and conditions for, defence witnesses; adequate legal representation for those facing genocide trials; and more briefly, on international supervision.  Those matters interlock.  SDJ Arbuthnot recognised concerns about the independence of the judiciary and about defence witnesses.  Reciting the correct legal test, that is to say not full procedural fairness as would be required for conformity with ECHR Article 6 in a State which is a member of the Council of Europe, but the lower standard of “a real risk of a flagrant denial of justice”, SDJ Arbuthnot concluded that the difficulties she identified with the independence of the judiciary and the position of defence witnesses might be, but in the event were not sufficiently offset, by robust and effective representation.</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“24. While the Strasbourg jurisprudence does not preclude reliance on articles other than article 3 as a ground for resisting extradition or expulsion, it makes it quite clear that successful reliance demands presentation of a very strong case. In relation to article 3, it is necessary to show strong grounds for believing that the person, if returned, faces a real risk of being subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment: <span style="font-style:italic">Soering</span>, paragraph 91; <span style="font-style:italic">Cruz Varas</span>, paragraph 69; <span style="font-style:italic">Vilvarajah</span>, paragraph 103. In <span style="font-style:italic">Dehwari</span>, paragraph 61 (see paragraph 13 above) the Commission doubted whether a real risk was enough to resist removal under article 2, suggesting that the loss of life must be shown to be a "near-certainty". Where reliance is placed on article 6 it must be shown that a person has suffered or risks suffering a flagrant denial of a fair trial in the receiving state: <span style="font-style:italic">Soering</span>, paragraph 113 (see paragraph 10 above); <span style="font-style:italic">Drodz</span>, paragraph 110; <span style="font-style:italic">Einhorn</span>, paragraph 32; <span style="font-style:italic">Razaghi v Sweden</span>; <span style="font-style:italic">Tomic v United Kingdom</span>. Successful reliance on article 5 would have to meet no less exacting a test. The lack of success of applicants relying on articles 2, 5 and 6 before the Strasbourg court highlights the difficulty of meeting the stringent test which that court imposes. This difficulty will not be less where reliance is placed on articles such as 8 or 9, which provide for the striking of a balance between the right of the individual and the wider interests of the community even in a case where a serious interference is shown. This is not a balance which the Strasbourg court ought ordinarily to strike in the first instance, nor is it a balance which that court is well placed to assess in the absence of representations by the receiving state whose laws, institutions or practices are the subject of criticism. On the other hand, the removing state will always have what will usually be strong grounds for justifying its own conduct: the great importance of operating firm and orderly immigration control in an expulsion case; the great desirability of honouring extradition treaties made with other states. The correct approach in cases involving qualified rights such as those under articles 8 and 9 is in my opinion that indicated by the Immigration Appeal Tribunal (Mr C M G Ockelton, deputy president, Mr Allen and Mr Moulden) in <span style="font-style:italic">Devaseelan v Secretary of State for the Home Department</span> [2002] IAT 702, [2003] Imm AR 1, paragraph 111: </p>

One key question in <span style="font-style:italic">Othman</span> was whether evidence would be used in a Jordanian trial which was the product of torture.  The case was an appeal from the decision of SIAC, which concluded that there would not be a flagrant denial of the right to a fair trial, because of other safeguards which they found present in the Jordanian trial system.  That conclusion was disapproved by the Court of Appeal, essentially on the ground that SIAC had considered such evidence merely as one element affecting the issue of fair trial, rather than considering the potential breach of the prohibition on torture itself (paragraphs 53 and 67).

We observe that the court’s conclusion that there was a real risk of a flagrant denial of justice was not based on the simple proposition that lack of judicial independence and impartiality would of itself involve a flagrant denial of justice.  The court adopted a more calibrated approach than that.  In assessing the seriousness of the lack of independence and impartiality, they took into account the fact that there was evidence of actual governmental interference in particular cases.  Furthermore and in any event, it is not at all certain that the lack of independence and impartiality of the judiciary in Rwanda was a decisive factor in the court’s overall conclusion stated at para 121.  It is clear that the lack of independence and impartiality was not the only feature of the Rwandan justice system which led the court to its overall conclusion.  </p>

It is a striking fact that there is no case of which we are aware in which this test has been successfully invoked in any context in relation to article 6 on the grounds of lack of independence and impartiality of a court.  We recognise that judicial independence and impartiality are cornerstones of a democratic society and that their absence will without more involve a breach of article 6.  But we cannot accept that lack of judicial independence and impartiality will necessarily involve a flagrant denial of justice or the “nullification or destruction of the very essence of the right guaranteed” by article 6.  Whether the lack of independence and impartiality has that effect must depend on the particular facts of the case, examined critically as a whole.  Regrettably, there are many states throughout the world where judges are less independent and less impartial than they are in the UK and other democratic societies which are fully committed to the rule of law.  But even where the judiciary are not fully independent and impartial, it is possible for a trial to take place which does not involve the complete nullification or destruction of the very essence of the right guaranteed by article 6.”</p>

At critical points of the procedure, the Claimant had no legal representation.  She was “frequently threatened and intimidated into making statements”, was denied “a proper opportunity to prepare her case” and “had incompetent legal representation by a lawyer who was not independent of the Executive”.  On the facts in the case itself, the Court rejected that there had been a flagrant denial of justice.  However, in the rather different context with which they were dealing, the Court was assessing the procedural failures and, unsurprisingly, doing so on the specific facts.  Ms Orobator admitted being in possession of the drugs in question.  Her defence was necessity, or duress.  The case was not complicated.  She did have sufficient access to her legal representative for him to appreciate the nature of her defence and to present mitigation.  The legal representative:</p>

A flagrant denial of justice goes beyond mere irregularities or lack of safeguards in the trial procedures such as might result in a breach of Article 6 if occurring within the Contracting State itself.

It was this type of reasoning which influenced the court in deciding that the evidence about the general situation in Albania was irrelevant, in that the material produced contained nothing to suggest a concern in the appellant's particular case. It is this area which the court now requires to review. The court assumes that the United Kingdom Supreme Court was not disagreeing with the European Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Dzhaksybergenov </span>v <span style="font-style:italic">Ukraine</span> (<span style="font-style:italic">supra</span>) when it stated (para 32) that "systemic corruption in a judicial system affects everyone who is subject to it" and that thus "No tribunal that operates within it can be relied upon to be independent and impartial". Rather, it must be asking this court to consider whether the general circumstances in Albania are so extreme as would inevitably lead to a violation in the appellant's and any other person's case. If that is correct, it would theoretically be sufficient for the appellant to demonstrate that the general situation in Albania, is in the "most extreme" category, thus avoiding the need for any reference to the particular circumstances of the appellant's own case. This would result in a "total ban" (<span style="font-style:italic">Dzhaksybergenov</span> (<span style="font-style:italic">supra</span>) para 37; <span style="font-style:italic">Shapirov</span> (<span style="font-style:italic">supra</span>) at para 35) on extradition to Albania. However, conversely, presumably if it is positively demonstrated that a particular person will in fact receive a fair trial in Albania, the general situation in Albania cannot fall into the "most extreme" category, since it would have been demonstrated that the extradition of the particular individual would not result in a violation. It must therefore follow, if that were demonstrated, that extraditions to Albania as a generality will not necessarily violate a Convention right.</p>

It must, first, determine whether there is "systemic" corruption in the Albanian judicial system on the hypothesis (which this court must accept) that, if there is, it must affect everyone involved in that system (including the appellant) on the basis that no "tribunal that operates within it can be relied upon to be independent and impartial". Secondly, it must determine whether there are substantial grounds for believing that there is a real risk of a flagrant denial of justice in the appellant's case if he were returned to Albania. That does not require an appellant to prove the existence of a risk on the balance of probabilities. He merely has to show "substantial grounds" and leave it to the respondent to dispel any doubts. It would seem, however, that the evidence demonstrating the grounds has to be "compelling" in the form of something approaching an international consensus.”</p>

As the criticism of DJ Evans in <span style="font-style:italic">Brown</span> (paragraph 34) makes clear, the height of the bar is not derived from the standard of proof, or the establishment of “real risk”, as opposed to straight probability:  the “high test” lies in the degree of denial of fair trial if the risk eventuates.</p>

The first is some account of the experts and/or professionally qualified witnesses whose evidence is in the case, or who play important roles.  We include those who gave evidence in the proceedings in 2008/2009, since their evidence and the Courts’ conclusions have been considered in the later litigation and because in the cases of two witnesses (Nerad and Reyntjens), their evidence was introduced directly before SDJ Arbuthnot.</p>

Although never advanced as a witness as such, and never in Court, Arguin’s account, particularly as set down in his report “<span style="font-style:italic">Rwanda’s Capacity to Ensure an Effective Defense in Transferred Cases</span>” dated 22 May 2016 was admitted before us.  In addition, his exchanges with Witteveen are relied on.  Arguin is a US-trained lawyer who served as a federal and state prosecutor, working with the US Department of Justice and the Massachusetts Attorney General’s office on “a broad range of policy matters”.  That took place over a period of ten years or so.  From 1992 to 2000 he was an equity partner and associate with K and L Gates in Boston.  He says that he has “qualified for judicial appointment at both the state and national levels in the United States.”  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In 2010 he was appointed as Chief of the Appeals and Legal Advisory Division of the ICTR Office of the Prosecutor in Arusha.  During the five-year period ending in 2015 he “directed all litigation relating to [the] referral proceedings” in eight genocide cases including Uwinkindi and Munyagishari.  As indicated above, in 2010 the United Nations passed a resolution designed to hasten the closure of the ICTR and to bring to an end its role in prosecuting or over-seeing the prosecution of Rwandan genocide suspects.  Mr Arguin’s service in the role we have indicated appears to have ended in December 2015 (when the ICTR was closed), since when he has served as Deputy Chief of the Rule of Law Unit with the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan.  He has never been questioned orally in any case of which we are aware.  If he were to be questioned, we consider he would be liable to be pressed whether part of his responsibility was to try to achieve the objectives of the UN Security Council expressed in that Resolution:  in other words to transfer the caseload to Rwanda.  Securing the transfer of suspects and cases that fell within Article 1(3) to Rwanda within the time frame set was a prime objective.  He was part of the prosecution team resisting the revocation of the transfer of the Uwinkindi case to Rwanda.</p>

In June 2014 he became an Advisor on International Crimes to the National Public Prosecution Authority [“the NPPA”].  He was instructed on behalf of the GoR.  The sequence and thrust of his reports is of significance.  His first report of 19 September 2014 (three months’ post-appointment) was succeeded by an Addendum report of 19 May 2015.  He then drafted an Additional Expert Report of 3 June 2015.  Crucially, he then sent a memo dated 1 June 2016 recording further views, unfavourable to the case of the GoR, to James Arguin (q.v.).  This memorandum was never disclosed to SDJ Arbuthnot.  Despite that, his views as to the inadequacies of the system of trials, and in particular the arrangements for defence representation, were crucial in the decision of SDJ Arbuthnot to decline extradition.  In his final Memorandum, Witteveen records that he has been warned by three separate individuals not to return to Rwanda, and that “some Rwandan authorities have called me a traitor” (memo 1 June 2016, paragraph 16).</p>

He also accepted that there have been “extra-judicial killings and disappearances” and that there was a “shrinking political space in Rwanda”, including “a clamp- down on opposition parties, on critical media and local human rights groups and on the local population expressing critical views”.

Professor Longman recognised the many positives of the Rwandan regime whilst pointing out that in his view the international community is being manipulated and conned into seeing the positives of good technocratic governance whilst ignoring the authoritarian RPF’s grip on politics.  Professor Longman explained that a key element of the RPF’s strategy to maintain strong support from the international community is by justifying many of its policies by referring to the genocide and its legacy.  It has suppressed discussion about its own violence against civilians as it took power and in its invasions of Congo.  The RPF justifies its behaviour by saying that it is preventing another genocide.  The restrictions on free speech and the laws banning “<span style="font-style:italic">divisionism</span>” and “<span style="font-style:italic">genocide ideology</span>” are said to be because of a necessity to prevent extremism from gaining strength in Rwanda (Paragraph 21).</p>

In this expert’s view since 1999 the RPF had given up the extensive violence it used to control the population after the genocide to using more subtle means to silence it and keep it fearful (Page 6, Paragraph 19).  Laws had been passed to regulate speech, judicial processes are used to silence critics, opponents are arrested whether they are journalists or politicians.  Professor Longman’s evidence was that all the human rights organisations have either been taken over, coerced or closed.  The press is similarly controlled.  His evidence is that the population from the “<span style="font-style:italic">most local communities to the highest levels of political and civil society, feel threatened and fearful</span>”.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The table of violations is divided into differing sections.  Table A records 15 examples of extra-judicial killings and/or inadequate investigations into such deaths, between 2005 and 2007.  The updated schedule records 21 episodes from 2008 through to 2015.  In each case the episode may refer to a single or to multiple deaths.  SDJ Arbuthnot singled out one or two episodes by way of illustration in her judgment, but looking at the underlying material it is clear she could have made other selections of equal potency.  There is a clear pattern to be discerned from the episodes digested.  A preponderance of those who have died or disappeared have been political opponents of the existing government, journalists who have been critical of the government, or former associates of the President and the government who have fallen out of favour. </p>

He had fallen out with President Kagame and been granted political asylum in South Africa in 2009.  He became an opposition party supporter.  As SDJ Arbuthnot indicates, there were hostile statements from a range of Rwandan government ministers following his killing, culminating in a speech on 12 January 2014 when President Kagame said:</p>

According to Human Rights Watch, in at least eight of the Rubavu cases there were indications that state agents were involved.  In June 2014, a US Government press statement expressed concern about the arrest and disappearance of “dozens of people”.

They include a report by Amnesty International, documented and accepted by the United States Department of State, relating to the torture or other inhumane treatment of detainees by military intelligence and other state personnel in 2010 and 2011.  These episodes were said to have involved a considerable range of torture techniques.  Another example drawn from the schedule is the arrest in September 2012 of two university students attempting to deliver a petition to the office of the Prime Minister.  The episode was again reported by the State Department.  The students were, it is said, detained in solitary confinement without food or water for two days by police in Kigali and beaten with metal rods.

SDJ Arbuthnot there addressed the events of July 2013 concerning a group known as LIPRODHOR, one of the last remaining human rights advocacy organisations in Rwanda.  The group was taken over, ousting the existing leadership.  The ousted president of LIPRODHOR challenged the takeover legally.  He then received threats of violence from the Rwandan Governance Board, a state body responsible for relations with civil organisations.  In the middle of the dispute in June 2014, the New Times newspapers, a supporter of the Kagame government, stated that Human Rights Watch was an organisation that supported the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda [“FDLR”].  FDLR is an organisation with a military wing opposing the GoR and operating in the Eastern Congo.  SDJ Arbuthnot dealt with this episode at some length, her concerns being firstly that the human rights organisation was subverted and secondly that there was a pro-government attempt to undermine or remove authority from Human Rights Watch.</p>

The President was “clearly furious” at this intervention, which accused the GoR of human rights abuses and of crushing the opposition.

From being appointed Deputy Minister of Justice in 1996, he led the reconstruction of the justice sector.  In his witness statement, he dealt in some detail with the system of <span style="font-style:italic">gacaca</span> courts, and we will return to his evidence on that topic later in this judgment.  He, too, has had extreme difficulty with President Kagame.  He left the country in 2003.  He was subsequently tried <span style="font-style:italic">in absentia</span> by a Military Court in Kigali in 2011.  He was accused alongside the three other authors of a document entitled “<span style="font-style:italic">Rwanda Briefing</span>”, which constituted an analysis of political governance in Rwanda and an assessment of the leadership of President Kagame.  He summarises its conclusion in very similar terms to his brother, Dr Rudasingwa, who was one of the co-authors.  The conclusion was that Rwanda has become “a hard-line, one-party, secretive police state with a façade of democracy”.  </p>

The second attempt at interference was made by James Musoni (President Kagame’s personal assistant on RPF matters) and Colonel Jack Nziza who asked Dr Gahima to arrest, detain and institute criminal proceedings against several opposition politicians in order to prevent them from participating in forthcoming elections.  Although Dr Gahima declined this request, the police nonetheless opened fake criminal investigations against most of the politicians in question, arrested them and instructed the politicians to report for questioning on many days during the course of the campaign period.  Both of these individuals still hold high office in Rwanda.”</p>

In paragraph 479 she noted the evidence of Dr Clark (for the GoR) who was told by Minister of Justice Busingye that “executive interference has continued” in trials (judgment paragraphs 479-480).

For example, if we look at this memorial, it only refers to the people who died during the genocide against the Tutsis.  There is another untold story with regard to the crimes against humanity committed against the Hutus.

The judge recited the account from Amnesty International that the trial judges showed “signs of hostility and anger” towards the defendant, interrupting her regularly.

It is clear that the President and the GoR were very concerned about the prosecution against Ingabire but at the same time there is no evidence that the judges were directly interfered with by the executive.  </p>

I cannot exclude the fact that the High Court judges may have been reacting to Kagame and his ministers’ repeated comments, the press reporting and other factors that are unknown, when they convicted her.  These comments undermined the presumption of innocence in her case and I give more weight to the influence that ministers’ comments may have in Rwanda than I would give to such comments in a genuinely democratic country.   I noted, against the above, that the High Court did acquit her of four out of the six charges she faced.  The Supreme Court although doubling her sentence and convicting her of a new charge, did not uphold all aspects of her conviction. The Supreme Court judgment is detailed and I have no evidence that that Court was unfair in its conclusions other than it is upholding (as indeed the Court must) the law of minimizing genocide, which interferes with free speech and did so, in Amnesty’s view, on this occasion. ”</p>

This case occupies paragraphs 282 to 370 of the judgment, in addition to later comments from SDJ Arbuthnot about the quality of Uwinkindi’s representation.  The referral decision from the ICTR to the Rwandan Courts was itself hotly contested.  One of the principal planks advanced by Uwinkindi against transfer was that defence witnesses were afraid of harassment, imprisonment or even death for them or their relatives if they gave evidence in defence.  This was countered by the prosecution, relying on the fact that very many witnesses from Rwanda had testified for the defence at the Rwandan tribunal and no witness had subsequently raised security concerns with the ICTR witnesses and victims support section.  The ICTR judges were concerned “not with whether the fears of potential witnesses were legitimate, but with whether the accused would be able to secure the appearance of defence witnesses and thus obtain a fair trial” (judgment, paragraph 287).  As to the impartiality and independence of the Rwandan judiciary, the ICTR found the Rwandan higher judiciary to be “suitably qualified and experienced and have the necessary skills” (judgment, paragraph 291).  The prosecution relied on the acquittal rates in Rwanda.  </p>

Thereafter, the progress of Rwandan litigation could be examined at least to some degree through the reports of the ICTR monitors, as well as Rebuttal Material produced by Ms Kabasinga and the additional report from Mr Witteveen (judgment, paragraph 295).

In order to achieve a fair trial he required legal facilities sufficient to find the witnesses he required, proof them and organise their evidence to be delivered within Rwanda.  Had his case remained with the ICTR, such resources would have been available.  This picture was confirmed to SDJ Arbuthnot by one of the ICTR monitors (Ms Buff) whose monitoring reports addressed the matter and established that 74 per cent of the defence witnesses called in the 57 cases tried at the ICTR lived outside Rwanda when they testified.  Ms Buff also commented to the Senior District Judge that she had reviewed the submissions made by the GoR and the KBA and concluded that:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There was a further issue about the Rwandan system for obtaining evidence within the country.  The system is that the judicial police, at least in theory, conduct investigations both for the prosecution and for the defence, performing the functions that an investigative judge would perform in the civil law system.  When Ms Buff (the ICTR monitor) raised this with Uwinkindi, he told her “that he would rather die than provide the names of his witnesses to the prosecution” (judgment, paragraph 302).</p>

At the time of the Uwinkindi proceedings, Mr Buff noted that the second witness protection unit, initiated by the judiciary (the WPU) “was in a fledgling state and had yet to be set up” (judgment, paragraph 304).</p>

It is not sensible to try and reproduce that here.  The nub of it is that Uwinkindi’s first lawyers wished to be instructed on terms comparable to those which apply in the ICTR, which would allow resources for obtaining evidence from abroad.  An hourly work rate was agreed initially, but the Rwandan authorities insisted on a change to those arrangements because they were too costly.  The financial arrangements were reduced in November 2014, and in December 2014 the Rwandan Ministry of Justice adopted a new legal aid policy, with the effect of a further reduction in the funding for defence representation.  Moreover, the new contract included a controversial Article 6, which provided for a unilateral cancellation of the representation contract in the event that “counsel make any statements aimed at discrediting the Government or the Ministry in the course of their work, either to the press or during the trial”.  Uwinkindi’s first team of counsel declined to accept the agreement and the Ministry of Justice terminated their contract with a notice period of three months, during which the lawyers were expected to go on assisting the defendant but would be paid at the reduced rate (judgment paragraph 331).</p>

The lawyers objected to Article 6, and the lawyers withdrew, leaving Uwinkindi unrepresented.  In January 2015, Uwinkindi asked for an adjournment, but the High Court ruled that the proceedings should continue.  His existing team of lawyers were present for a period but after an adjournment did not return to the courtroom.  The High Court found the lawyers had done this in order to delay the trial and they were promptly fined (judgment, paragraph 336).</p>

However, Uwinkindi refused to cooperate with them since they were not of his choosing.  During March 2015, these new representatives remained in court but did not participate in the hearing, during a period in which fourteen prosecution witnesses and nine defence witnesses gave evidence without being questioned, either by Uwinkindi or his new defence lawyers.  As SDJ Arbuthnot observed in paragraph 340, this meant that all the prosecution witnesses had been heard without being questioned on his behalf.  After further months without decisive action, Uwinkindi asked the MICT to revoke the decision to refer his case.  Before that was concluded his trial continued.  The High Court decided his new counsel should continue to represent him but that the witnesses who had been heard in March should be re-heard and granted an adjournment for preparation.  In October 2015, the application to revoke the transfer failed.  </p>

In relation to his case as it developed in Rwanda, the Senior District Judge relied considerably on the evidence of Martin Witteveen.  We have outlined his background earlier in this judgment.  It was in dealing with Witteveen’s evidence in the Bandora case, that SDJ Arbuthnot made clear her view of his capacity as a witness and the importance of his evidence overall.  It is worth quoting the following paragraphs:</p>

I found him to be a credible, reliable and compelling witness.  He was compelling as he was clearly an objective witness who told me what his recent experiences of the trial system in Rwanda were.  His evidence was also useful as he had conducted many investigations in Rwanda and he explained to the court his experience of dealing with witnesses in genocide cases.</p>

He explains in the section “<span style="font-style:italic">Scope of this report</span>” that his written evidence is based solely on his experience and he tries not to rely on secondary evidence.  He also makes it clear in Paragraph 16 that he is going to refrain from making observations on the human rights and political situation in Rwanda for two reasons, firstly it is not his expertise but secondly he endorses the GoR’s approach that he does not see how observations on human rights and the political situation in Rwanda can help the court to decide whether VB and others will get a fair trial.

The trial took place between September and December 2014.  Twelve prosecution and fourteen defence witnesses gave evidence and Witteveen was very critical of the defence performance.  Cross-examination of prosecution witnesses and examination in chief of defence witnesses was “chaotic” (judgment, paragraph 394); the defendant led much of the questioning without guidance or direction from his attorneys (judgment, paragraph 394); the lawyer’s questioning was unstructured without strategy, often talking over each other and being interrupted (paragraph 395); Bandora and his lawyers repeatedly mentioned the name of a protected witness who was supposed to remain anonymous (paragraph 395).  </p>

Each said they had been visited by prosecutors in prison and had been promised release if they testified against Bandora.

On 4 June 2013, Hakizimana provided a third statement in which he accused Bandora of ordering killings and collaborating with the Interahamwe.  In March 2014, he was questioned about a letter he had written in 2008, in which he said he had given false evidence against Bandora at the <span style="font-style:italic">gacaca</span> proceedings.  He said he had done so because he had been pressurised in prison.  It is established that each of these witness statements had been taken by a prosecutor for the GoR, named Faustin Nkuzi.

The material shows “an evolution in the evidence of one of the witnesses, from saying he was pressurised to give false evidence against Bandora in 2008 … to accusing him of direct killings when interviewed by the prosecutor whom he said had induced him to falsely accuse Bandora”.  The judge also noted that the second significant witness, Baziga, “also said he had been induced into giving false evidence, his evidence follows a similar pattern to that of the first witness, Hakizimana” (paragraph 397).  It clearly was important in SDJ Arbuthnot’s mind that the GoR had not gone through this in detail with Martin Witteveen, if it was to test his judgment about the capacity of the defence counsel in the trial.   As she observed in paragraph 398, Witteveen found it “incomprehensible that the defence attorneys did nothing with this information”.  In the ensuing paragraphs of her judgment she recited further evidence from Baziga and another witness as to allegations of bribery, leading to “virtually no enquiry”.  She also recited Witteveen’s concern that only a limited number of witnesses gave evidence, even though the names of “many other possible witnesses were mentioned yet no attempt had been made by the defence to get them to Court”.  Witteveen also explained that there had been no effort made to contact witnesses abroad and the defence lawyers had “not even asked MiniJust for a budget to investigate the defence case”.  The judge accepted the evidence of Witteveen, summarising the conclusion in paragraph 402:</p>

Nothing, however, that Witteveen said led me to conclude in that case that the judges were not independent or impartial nor that defence witnesses were reluctant to give evidence.”</p>

Clearly, too, we keep in mind the fact that the Rwandan legal system is in essence a civil law system, and the role of attorneys may be rather different than would be expected in a common law Court.  However, we record our concern here that this points to the obligation of the Court to investigate such obviously relevant material if the defence do not.  We find it hard to accept the proposition that SDJ Arbuthnot was wrong to rely on Witteveen’s conclusions about this trial, on the basis that the inaction of the defence was tactical rather than proceeding from incompetence.  He himself comes from a civil law jurisdiction, made a judgment of these attorneys and the system which supported them, which was a general judgment proceeding from a good knowledge base. </p>

The hearing before the Referral Chamber included presentation by the defence of affidavits from sixteen anonymous witnesses who said they were afraid to testify in Rwanda.  The Chamber found the defence affidavits “<span style="font-style:italic">prima facie</span> credible” (judgment, paragraph 409), but found it was beyond their role to determine whether the fears were well-founded.  The Chamber was satisfied as to safeguards in Rwanda.  The Referral Chamber also held (paragraph 410) that the legal aid system in Rwanda was adequate.  They did so on the basis of availability of counsel and the existence of the legal aid payment scheme.  The Chamber also found that the lack of independence of the judiciary in Rwanda was “speculation” and the Chamber relied on the Rwandan law and on the constitution.  </p>

On that issue, SDJ Arbuthnot agreed with the GoR’s witness, Dr Clark, “that such an appointment is very unlikely for the reasons he gave, one amongst which is national pride” (judgment, paragraph 411).  The ICTR also drew comfort from the fact that monitoring would take place in relation to ICTR referred trial and there was at any stage the possibility of recall from Rwanda, both of which safeguards are absent in the case of extradition (judgment, paragraph 412).  Further, SDJ Arbuthnot accepted the submission that the ICTR decision in this case (in common with the other cases) was taken without the “benefit of the quantity, quality and type of evidence that is before this Court” (judgment, paragraph 412).</p>

When it comes to payment for the defence lawyers, I cannot say without more that the GoR is being intransigent but I consider that the GoR had not anticipated how expensive these sort of cases are to investigate and defend adequately.  As the complaints to the ICTR multiplied and in the light of the comments of Witteveen, who was after all the GoR’s own witness, the GoR have bowed finally to the pressure and changed the law in relation to investigators.  This should have happened before when this issue was raised by other defendants such as Uwinkindi in 2011 at the ICTR and in 2012 in the High Court in Rwanda.  The change in the law is so recent there is no evidence how the new law will be applied in practice.

He was presented with a list of counsel which was different from, and much shorter than, the list which formed part of the contract between the Ministry of Justice and the RBA.  Over the ensuing year he had a number of hearings before the High Court.  He was still in dispute as at June 2015 and was then not yet represented.  SDJ Arbuthnot was unable to reach a conclusion as to whether the lack of representation was the fault of the government or the Defendant.  She did observe that the judges in the case appeared to be dealing with this case in a fair and sensible way, granting adjournments.  Counsel for Ugirashebuja made submissions in relation to this defendant and were able to add, from open source material in July 2016, that the prosecution had commenced opening arguments in the case but Mbarushimana had not accepted assigned counsel and appeal to the Rwandan Supreme Court was pending.  This case is clearly the least significant of those considered in detail by the judge.</p>

We have already analysed the evidence of Dr Gahima and Dr Rudasingwa.  The judge heard from Philippe Larochelle, an ICTR defence advocate who had defended in a Rwandan genocide case in Canada ending in 2013.  The Court found coordinated fabrication by the prosecution witnesses.  The scale of the case (and by implication the scale of such cases as these Respondents) was indicated by the activity of that defence team, which consisted of three lawyers and three investigators who had met more than 500 potential witnesses around the world.  Mr Larochelle indicated that witnesses were intimidated on a wide scale, the intimidation ranging from speeches during annual commemorations of the genocide to police harassment.  The defence had to conceal the identity of their witnesses.  The Canadian prosecuting authorities were concerned at Rwandan involvement with prosecution witnesses.</p>

The Judge recited that evidence between paragraphs 493 and 503.  Both professors looked at the core claim by the GoR that there had been significant changes since the <span style="font-style:italic">Brown</span> decision.  Professor Longman accepted (paragraph 498) that professionalism in the justice sector had increased “and that the quality of justice had improved, it was just that the politicisation of the system had increased”.  He described seeing “manipulation in every high profile trial”.  SDJ Arbuthnot did not reject this evidence, but noted that Professor Longman’s account had two drawbacks, namely that he had not been to Rwanda since 2006 as he did not feel safe, and that he had never been to the Rwandan High Court:  his evidence was generalised.  Equally, Professor Reyntjens considered that there was gross manipulation by the GoR in some cases and was critical of the recent decisions by the ICTR to transfer defendants. The ICTR approach:</p>

Dr Clark had more recent experience in Rwanda than Professors Reyntjens or Longman (for the reasons they have explained).  He had interviewed extensively individuals within the judicial system, including <span style="font-style:italic">gacaca</span> judges but no High Court judges.  Dr Clark emphasised the importance of extradition and prosecution for the Rwandan government and SDJ Arbuthnot accepted from him that the GoR had shown “a marked dedication” to reforming the domestic judiciary.  Against that background, Dr Clark set out to repudiate the findings in <span style="font-style:italic">Brown</span> and the reports of Reyntjens and Longman.  He relied on the stream of ICTR Appeal Chamber decisions, and advanced the position that the Bizimungu case “was the only case of judicial interference” (judgment, paragraph 510).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Dr Clark’s evidence about interference with the judiciary appears to us to have been rather ambiguous.  As the Judge recited in paragraph 511, none of the sources interviewed by Dr Clark in April 2010 could cite concrete examples of political interference in genocide trials.  However, in giving evidence before the Court in June 2015, Dr Clark agreed that the view of many of those he had interviewed was that there was continuing “subtle executive interference” with the judiciary.  A number of individual witnesses to that effect were cited.  A safeguard which many of his respondents considered would be helpful was the instruction of international defence counsel for high profile Rwandan suspects.  However, despite the change in the Rules, it appears that had never happened.  Moreover, in paragraph 513, SDJ Arbuthnot observed that although there are no concrete examples of interference provided by Dr Clark “he did not pursue the question perhaps as much as he could have done”.</p>

We deal below with the question of the incomplete account of Witteveen’s views which was before her.  For the present we consider what Witteveen material she did have.  SDJ Arbuthnot noted that at the time of Witteveen’s first report in September 2014 he had been working full time within the NPPA for only three months, but he had previously spent a considerable period in Rwanda investigating two criminal cases.  Witteveen’s broad conclusion was that there was no evidence the judiciary were not independent when it came to genocide proceedings (judgment, paragraph 514).  He did not consider that “ill-judged comments made by politicians in Rwanda would be any worse than many judges face from around the world” (judgment, paragraph 516).  He, too, said he had never seen interference with specific criminal cases since the Bizimungu case and had not seen a loss of independence, neutrality or objectivity.  He did not consider these respondents to be accused of “political crimes” (judgment, paragraph 516).</p>

The Respondents, on the other hand, submit that SDJ Arbuthnot was insufficiently robust in her findings and that the material before her should have led her to consider there was a much higher risk of executive interference with justice in genocide cases such as these.</p>

The problem with which the judge was “wrestling” is whether that approach will affect these genocide cases (paragraph 523).  The various Courts that have sent defendants back to Rwanda for trial have done so on the basis that genocide cases are not “political”.  Although she noted the significance that three of the Respondents were <span style="font-style:italic">bourgmestres</span>, and Brown/Bajinya allegedly a member of the <span style="font-style:italic">Akazu</span>, she found that he was not a “high profile” member of the <span style="font-style:italic">Akazu</span>.  The Judge did not find there was credible evidence that the Respondents were “political opponents to the GoR in 2015”.  Nor was she persuaded that the extradition request was driven by political considerations (paragraph 526).  She did accept that the Respondents, if returned, would be “high profile” defendants, and that seems established.  She concluded that the “GoR will use the return of the RPs as examples to show that the State’s justice system is recognised internationally as a system which can try defendants fairly” (judgment, paragraph 527).</p>

The only change which appears to be actually put in practice was the amendment to the Transfer Law of 2009, allowing three or more judges to try complex and important cases.  The Judge noted (paragraphs 534, 535) that Dr Clark thought it unlikely that any application for an international judge to come and try a transfer or extradition case, pursuant to the legal amendment of 28 November 2011, would be granted since it would be unacceptable to Rwanda - “politically unpalatable” as Dr Clark had put it (paragraphs 434-5).  </p>

The Judge also noted (paragraph 539) that the change of security of tenure to appointment for a determinate term ran counter to the normal principle that security of tenure should ensure independence and impartiality, but she found that “there is no evidence that the change to removal on the grounds of serious professional misconduct or incompetence is being used by the High Council of the Judiciary to remove judges for bringing in the wrong verdicts” (paragraph 539).  The Judge noted that these cases would not be monitored, by contrast to those transferred from the ICTR.  Such a mechanism would be a reassurance were it to exist (paragraph 541).</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“545. To conclude, I am drawing a distinction between the way the Rwandan High Court tries cases with a political flavour and the way they try genocide allegations.  This is based on the clear evidence I have seen about the approach taken by the Specialised Chamber towards the five transferred genocide cases.  Having considered all the evidence, I cannot exclude a risk of interference but judging from the transferred defendants the highest risk is from the pressure exerted by GoR ministers’ comments in public and in the press.  I consider any such risk would be reduced by a robust, able and experienced defence team with an ability to investigate the defence case and international monitoring of some sort.  I consider that without both of these the RPs would be at a greater risk of judges behaving partially and being influenced by factors outside the evidence.”</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">After careful consideration, we reject the submission of both sides that the judge was wrong on this issue.  We reject firmly the submission of the GoR that the judge should unequivocally have stated the judiciary was independent and that there was no risk of bias or interference in these cases, because they are not “political”.  The clearly authoritarian nature of the regime; the long and continuing history of the influence of political will over the justice system where the case is perceived to matter; the evidence of Gahima and others; the evidence of threats arising from criticisms of the regime, not in a political context but in the context of the justice system; the “Osman” warnings; the experiences of witnesses who gave evidence in genocide cases unfavourable to the prosecution, whether in Rwanda or abroad:  all these point to a high level of risk of pressure within the system.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In our view, the fact that the ICTR has sent a number of cases back to Rwanda is important, but not conclusive.  It is not clear that the ICTR had access to the amount and quality of evidence which was before the Court below, or is available to us.  Moreover, the ICTR took the decisions in those cases in the knowledge that there was a procedure for revocation, and therefore an escape route if matters were shown to have gone wrong.  There is no such escape route for the English Courts.  Moreover, it seems an inevitable, but important, context for the decisions of the ICTR that, if trials were not to continue indefinitely before the ICTR, prolonging its existence far beyond the planned end-point for that jurisdiction, then the only destination for such cases (apart from other foreign Courts) would be Rwanda.  We should not be understood to mean that the decisions of the ICTR were influenced by improper considerations.  However, it would appear to us that this must inevitably have represented an important institutional consideration and the source of some momentum towards transferring cases to Rwanda.  So far as other decisions in other jurisdictions are concerned, it is clear that the GoR has advanced the decisions of the ICTR with a powerful rhetorical flourish:  if the ICTR has agreed to transfer cases, who are you to refuse?  In an unpersuasive piece of advocacy, Mr Lewis QC for the GoR did so to us.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Another matter relevant to this conclusion arises from the “sea change” advanced by the GoR.  It is a definite advance that three judges can sit in such cases.  However, what is to be made of a change of law permitting a foreign judge to sit in such cases, which on the ground of national pride is never expected to be put into practice, as conceded by the GoR’s own expert?  At best this is an empty gesture, at worst an attempt to beguile.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The strongest points in favour of reposing confidence in the independence of trials are:  (1) the general view that the judiciary are better trained and are possessed of integrity and (2) the eyes of the world will be on these cases if the Respondents are returned.  The GoR has, objectively, a real interest in their trials proceeding fairly.  We consider those to be positive factors worthy of consideration.  However, they are moderated by one or two other considerations.  Firstly, as the experts conceded and the judge recognised, any pressure behind the scenes will likely go undetected:  indeed will be virtually undetectable.  Secondly, objective self-interest may be a poor guide to official or political action in an authoritarian state.  Short term political considerations, or a show of power, or mere prejudice, may easily supersede.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">We also bear in mind the concerns of Martin Witteveen, as expressed in his memorandum of 18 June 2015, of which SDJ Arbuthnot was unaware, as we mention below.  He expressed himself there to be unsure of the independence of the Rwandan judiciary (“To an extent … I even question the independence of the judges”).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">For these reasons, we incline to the view that the judge’s conclusions on this issue veer towards being too sanguine as to the prospects of independent and unbiased trial.  However, we do not go so far as to say she was wrong.  Her decision was reasonable, based on the evidence before her, but the evidence before us has itself shifted the balance.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">However, the great emphasis she placed on effective defence representation becomes entirely comprehensible.  Given the risk of pressure or bias, in order to prevent a flagrant denial of justice, it is indeed vital that defendants charged with genocide-related offences are represented well, so that all necessary material is gathered and presented, that prosecution cases are fully challenged and proper arguments presented.  The weight SDJ Arbuthnot places on representation and advocacy in this context is entirely correct.   Without such representation, convenient verdicts will be easy to reach.  With such representation, judges who wish to be fair will be given the material which may compel a correct but unpopular outcome.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Senior District Judge summarised the evidence given in both directions.  As we have already indicated, there was a good deal of evidence to suggest that witnesses would be fearful of coming forward.  The SDJ began by observing that the Respondent Mutabaruka already has nine defence witnesses whom he says he will be able to call if tried in Rwanda (paragraph 548).  She noted there is no particular explanation as to why these witnesses are willing, if it is true that there is a general fear.  The Appellant submits that there is much evidence that defence witnesses do come forward to give evidence at every level of Court in Rwanda, as they have done in cases before the ICTR.  The ICTR has never found that the Rwandan authorities have systematically engaged in witness intimidation (paragraph 552).  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In the earlier proceedings, the District Judge and then the Divisional Court agreed that both prosecution and defence witnesses had been attacked and killed, a point relied on in her submissions by Ms Ellis QC.  She went on to point in the Tables to a number of the individuals threatened but, as SDJ Arbuthnot observed, the majority of those would appear to be political opponents or critics of President Kagame (judgment, paragraph 544).  We have mentioned before that Professor Reyntjens was concerned he could not safely return to Rwanda.  His concern crystallised in a conversation with a Rwandan ambassador in May 2012, when the Professor told the ambassador he would not return to Rwanda as he was afraid he would be arrested and prosecuted for revisionism.  “The ambassador had said ‘maybe you wouldn’t be wrong’” (judgment, paragraph 554).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In paragraphs 557 to 569 of her judgment, SDJ Arbuthnot dealt with the evidence of Scarlet Nerad.  This witness gave a number of examples of witnesses concerned with their safety:  prosecution witnesses too frightened to change their evidence and potential defence witnesses too fearful of assisting at all through concern as to reprisals.  She also advanced evidence that witnesses who had given evidence for the defence in <span style="font-style:italic">gacaca</span> proceedings had suffered as a result.  Ms Nerad gave evidence of four prosecution witnesses who now say pressure was put upon them to incriminate Mr Ugirashebuja.  On the same point, Mr Fitzgerald QC gave another example from the papers.  However, the Judge observed that Ms Nerad had been “most effectively cross-examined” producing a number of concerns about her evidence.  In relation to proceedings against Ugirashebuja, it emerged that the acquittal of which Ms Nerad had spoken arose in relation to events in a different sector with different witnesses from those concerned within the extradition request.  More seriously, the Judge found that Ms Nerad had a tendency to accept what she was told without question.  A number of the instances of concern about evidence arose in deportation cases where no guarantees had been given, and thus the level of concern may have been inappropriate.  It also became clear that Ms Nerad had not set out in any of the statements she had taken from anonymised witnesses that they had been told of various measures which could be taken to protect their identity, such as anonymisation, video linking and so forth.  </p>

Of the 20 statements from new witnesses obtained in 2013 and 2014 in relation to CU’s case, all of them have been anonymised, because the witness says he or she is frightened of being identified.

Batard was an experienced investigator who had carried out investigations for the ICTR following the genocide.  He accepted that “thousands of witnesses had testified in <span style="font-style:italic">gacaca</span> proceedings publicly, and hundreds of defence witnesses had given evidence at the ICTR and returned to Rwanda afterwards” (paragraph 579).  Batard explained that each witness had different concerns and would be expressed differently.  They were often very subjective.  His overall conclusion was that witnesses were fearful, but the fears may often not be justified.</p>

He gave evidence that the Rwandan authorities gave assistance to investigators from Finland, Norway and Holland.  His contribution was to suggest that in his experience witnesses were not frightened by what the GoR might do, but they were often concerned by how the local community and defendant’s family might react.  He considered there were times when witnesses influenced each other but he did not know of any example where they had been influenced by the authorities (judgment, paragraphs 587/8).  </p>

In Mugesera no defence witnesses were called.  In Uwinkindi a handful of defence witnesses had been called, but at a time when the defendant was unrepresented.  The majority of his defence witnesses lived abroad and no budget had been set aside for finding and interviewing witnesses in Rwanda or for preparation of witnesses abroad.  In Bandora, on the evidence of Mr Witteveen, the defence had called 14 defence witnesses.  In Munyagishari no funds for an investigator had yet been provided and no defence witnesses presented.  In Mbarushimana the case was not yet begun, but there was as yet no budget for obtaining defence evidence.  In the five transfer cases the video-link system has not been used “simply because the witnesses have not been identified as the funds have not been provided.” (judgment, paragraph 591).  </p>

The Judge noted that “the reputation of the GoR at home and abroad … cannot be of assistance either”, but she noted Witteveen’s evidence that witnesses may be more frightened of local repercussions rather than national.  The witnesses are afraid of a range of outcomes, from death, imprisonment, and torture to prosecution.  The fact that some defence witnesses have been heard in Uwinkindi and Bandora, and others have agreed to give evidence in Mutabaruka’s case, was of significance.  The Uwinkindi Referral Chamber in 2011 had found that “in most of the then 36 genocide cases tried in the High Court, defence witnesses were available” but the Judge was able to note no detail of the numbers.</p>

Firstly, it is likely to restrain direct threat or intimidation.  That may be so, but it is far from certain, for the reasons we have given above concerning decision-making in authoritarian regimes.  Secondly, it is likely to mean that the safeguards designed to induce witnesses’ fears, and listed by SDJ Arbuthnot in paragraph 597 of the judgment, are indeed put in place.  They are steps which are verifiable by monitors and by reporting, but in particular by effective defence legal teams.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As recognised by the judge, it is inevitable that witnesses will be fearful.  That is not the issue.  The issue is whether the fear can be overcome to a degree sufficient to avoid a flagrant denial of justice through the absence of witnesses or the distortion of their evidence, and to do so in these cases, which even if not “political”, must to some degree be regarded as “trophy” cases by the Rwandan authorities.</p>

She was deciding that conditions could be put in place so that identified witnesses, at least in sufficient numbers, could be reassured, brought to Court and give their evidence under conditions which meant the evidence would not be distorted by fear.  To that end, the safeguards identified are vital.  So also is the presence of adequate representation, “able and effective representatives … to investigate and put together the case for the defence”.  The judge was stating that such representation was necessary to overcome the fear of witnesses who were identified, but she was also stressing the interlocking nature of her findings overall.  The closer we have considered her conclusions, the deeper our respect has become for the underlying logic in her thinking.</p>

To that extent his evidence was “of great importance for the GoR’s case” (<span style="font-style:italic">Brown</span>, paragraph 108).  Whilst his general distinction as an expert was not in issue, there is no doubt that the Court took the view that his evidence on that occasion was flawed and his status “as a dispassionate expert” was substantially undermined (<span style="font-style:italic">Brown</span>, paragraph 118).  </p>

He said that it involved two careers, one in his national jurisdiction from 1984 until 2004 and the second in the international sphere.  In his national jurisdiction, all of his work, certainly since 1989, was as a prosecutor in the Court Prosecutor Service, mostly in the field of organised crime.  In 2004 he moved into the international arena and, in the first instance, became an Investigation Team Leader in the Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court in The Hague.  His work over the next four years largely centred on investigations into alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in Northern Uganda.  He conducted a good number of field missions in Uganda and had primary responsibility for “witness protection, organisation and networking.”</p>

They concerned Yvonne Ntacyobatabara and Joseph Mpambara.  Each was of Rwandan descent, the former becoming a Dutch citizen and the latter having been granted fugitive status in the Netherlands. Each was tried by The Hague District Court. Between October 2008 and March 2009 Mr Mpambara stood trial for war crimes and torture. He was found guilty of torture and sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment.  That sentence was increased to life imprisonment on appeal in July 2011 when certain matters in respect of which he had been acquitted were replaced with convictions.  So far as Ms Ntacyobatabara is concerned, her trial took place between October 2012 and March 2013 when she was convicted of incitement to genocide and sentenced to the maximum sentence available, namely, 6 years and 8 months.</p>

Eighteen of the witnesses were defence witnesses, four of whom were heard in Kigali.  Those heard in Kigali were heard in a meeting room in the High Court, although one defence witness was, at her request, heard in a hotel room in Kigali.  In relation to Mr Mpambara, Mr Witteveen heard 32 witnesses during the appeals phase, almost all of whom were “victim witnesses” and were heard in Kigali.  Three witnesses were defence witnesses and since they were already convicted of various offences by the ICTR (and thus serving sentences in UN prisons), they were seen where they were serving their sentences.  </p>

Since Witteveen was not in place until June 2014, the report could not have been available when the proceedings before the SDJ commenced on 3 March 2014.  Mr Witteveen’s first report was disclosed at some stage and he was scheduled to give evidence on 8 June 2015.  Shortly before that (on 3 June 2015) he produced an ‘Additional’ report in which he raised his concerns about the quality of the defence representation available in Rwanda.  Both reports formed the focus of his evidence and cross-examination before the SDJ on 8-10 June 2015.

Uwinkindi had been “without any defence” (additional report, paragraph 21).  We have looked at these cases above, but Witteveen’s views on them all deserve to be considered together.  In relation to Munyagishari, his trial was stalled due to his defence lawyer’s refusal to accept the latest financial terms.  Witteveen found it remarkable that Mugesera’s lawyer had maintained “complete silence” during the proceedings and throughout the evidence of 23 prosecution witnesses (judgment, paragraph 605).  As to Bandora’s trial, which was concluded, Witteveen described the lawyer’s handling of witnesses in such a way that led the Judge to describe it as “chaotic and clearly unprofessional … Their questioning of their own witnesses was very short, irrelevant and repetitious and the protected witness’ name was mentioned”.  Bandora’s lawyers had made no attempt to get a budget to investigate the defence case (judgment, paragraph 606).   Witteveen pointed out to the Judge that neither the Defendants, nor the majority of their lawyers, had “any trust in the GoR institutions” which led to complacency or confrontational attitudes (amended report, paragraph 20; judgment, paragraph 607).    </p>

Finally, counsel for the GoR submitted to the Judge that Witteveen had expressly disavowed that his concerns met the high threshold necessary for proper objection under Article 6.

There have been thousands of genocide trials in Rwanda at all levels of the judicial system and at present it would seem that that country can ill afford to put in the sort of resources required to investigate properly each case, especially for the defence but probably not for the prosecution either.  One of my concerns is whether it is appropriate that this court should look at the prospects of a fair trial using as a benchmark the very high standards expected in the European context.  I suspect that by Rwandan standards, the five transferred defendants are having a fair trial.  They are occasionally represented and whether they are or not, can address the court.  They can ask questions of the prosecution witnesses and although they cannot call defence witnesses from abroad at least they can call some witnesses from Rwanda.  The authorities may well question with some justification why it should be that defendants transferred from abroad should have the resources to defend themselves that local defendants lack.  I remind myself that defendants in Gacaca proceedings did not have lawyers and were tried by people of integrity with little or no legal training in the local communities.  I agree with Mr Witteveen in the conclusion in his first report that with genocide allegations impunity is not an option.  Nevertheless my responsibility is to conclude from the evidence whether if returned there would be a real risk of a flagrant denial of justice in relation to the prosecution of these men.</p>

Although of course counsel for Rwanda are right when they say he had seen only a limited number hearings but he had read the notes provided by his colleague as well as all the other evidence in relation to the conduct of the trials.  The evidence he gave about how shocked he was by what he had witnessed of the defence representation of Bandora was striking and vivid.  He had such “<span style="font-style:italic">deep concern</span>” and “<span style="font-style:italic">profound doubts</span>” (cross-examination 9.6.15) about the quality of defence representation that he felt duty bound to draft his Additional Report and wanted to give the court a true picture of what was going on.

I feel reluctant to consider the rates of pay fixed by the President of the Kigali Bar Association who after all knows the local conditions and what the cost of living in Rwanda is, which this court does not.  Nevertheless I did consider that the officers of the KBA who negotiated the rates of pay for the defence lawyers with MiniJust did not understand the demanding nature of even an adequate defence approach to such cases and had never considered the amount of preparation required.  It was clear from MiniJust’s approach that it had completely underestimated the time it would take to defend such cases when it had decided on the original fees of 30K RwFr per hour per lawyer.  MiniJust was concerned this was open to abuse and since then it has gradually reduced the fees which has led to the disputes.  It is mark of the lack of professionalism of the lawyers that they have allowed the disputes to overshadow the work that should have been taking place to defend the transferred men who face such serious charges with long sentences if they are convicted.</p>

I have said above that the early lawyers in Uwinkindi were clearly able to argue procedural points; Ms Kabasinga in the Rebuttal Material provided the brief curriculum vitae of the two later lawyers appointed for Uwinkindi.  In the Supreme Court, Uwinkindi argued that one of the two new counsel had been found by another court not to have the ability to plead a genocide case whilst the second lawyer had no relevant experience.  I take into account that they may not have included their experience of genocide cases in their cvs but on the face of it I had to agree with Uwinkindi they did not seem to have the experience that is needed in such cases.</p>

In VB’s case, instructed lawyers and investigators have poured over a mass of Gacaca material to find out what witnesses have said on earlier occasions, some of these witnesses were defendants in trials.  Although VB has carried out some of this work, the other RPs if returned to Rwanda will have to do so too.  Another example, this time not in the case of VB but in the case of CMU, is the witness Sabine Hategekimana who accepts lying before the ICTR in another case.  Proper investigations into that matter will have to be undertaken which will include obtaining statements taken by ICTR investigators.</p>

The importance of defence preparation and investigation is shown by the example found in the case against VB where witnesses transpose accusations against one man to the RP.  Miss Malcolm contends a similar situation has arisen in the case against CMU, in that whereas Alfred Musema is accused of orchestrating killings at Bisesero, the same witnesses now suggest CMU is the perpetrator.  Miss Malcolm and Mr Weeks have produced schedules which analyse the evidence of two ICTR witnesses, Kabagora and Ntagara in their submissions.  They show a number of differences in their accounts at different times.  All these investigations I accept will have to take place conducted by lawyers or investigators who have experience, knowledge, application and the appropriate funding.</p>

This leads to the second concern I have in relation to these RPs which is the lack of funding for the identification and locating of witnesses in particular abroad.  Without such funding and without defence counsel with the ability to identify, locate, contact and interview such witnesses themselves or without an investigator to do it for them, it is difficult to see how Uwinkindi or any other defendant will have a defence case to put before the court.</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">629. In August 2015 a new law was passed allowing for applications for defence funding for investigations in genocide transfer cases.  Uwinkindi had raised this as a problem at the ICTR in 2011 and in the Rwandan High Court in 2012.  It took four years for the law to be changed and I suspect it had a lot to do with Uwinkindi’s ability to refer his case back to MICT.  This change of course opens the way for funding to be granted.  It is too early to say how this will be applied in practice.  I noted that the Uwinkindi budget for investigations abroad was US $ 64,595 (about £43,000), a vast sum.  Any investigation budget for witnesses abroad inevitably will dwarf amounts spent on the lawyers and the investigations in Rwanda.  In the cases of these five RPs some of the investigation work has been done and it may well be the costs will be lower, nevertheless the GoR will have to spend a great deal on investigations and it remains to be seen whether they will commit that sort of money to defence cases.</p>

From all the evidence I have read and heard I concur with Witteveen’s Final Conclusions in his Additional Report, he is certain that the facts in genocide cases can be established but “<span style="font-style:italic">only under the condition of high quality and professional investigations, applying internationally accepted standards.  Part of this professionalism and these standards is the necessity to have defence attorneys who possess the knowledge, experience and the resources to conduct investigations for the defence, including the capabilities to conduct investigations abroad</span>”.  He has profound doubts that the defence lawyers assigned to the transfer cases can do that.  His solution is still to extradite but to provide a lawyer with the right experience to work alongside Rwandan lawyers who would be provided with appropriate funds to conduct investigations.  In his view (and in my view) “<span style="font-style:italic">it ensures the necessary adequate defence capabilities for the defendant that meets the required standard and guarantees not only procedurally fair trial but also a fairness to the trial</span>”.  Unfortunately this court does not have the power to order extradition on conditions and I am applying a different test.</p>

I find that if extradited, as things presently stand, the defendants would be denied the effective representation of counsel in cases which so obviously call for effective and skilled representation by suitably experienced and resourced defence lawyers.  It is too early to say that sufficient funding for defence investigations in relation to witnesses abroad will be provided.  These defendants are legally aided in this country and will be indigent in Rwanda.  I have seen in this case what the effective representation by counsel can achieve.  Without such representation and funding, the High Court in Rwanda would be presented with the prosecution case and the RPs would find it impossible to present their side of what happened.  I find the RPs would be exposed to a real risk of a flagrant denial of justice and a breach of Article 6.”</p>

He sent a Memo headed ‘CONFIDENTIAL – NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION’ to Mr Arguin, the Chief of the Appeals and Legal Advisory Division of the MICT.  It was dated 18 June 2015 and was thus composed in the week following the testimony given before the SDJ. It also emerged from a further memo from Witteveen of 1 June 2016 that the Memo of 18 June 2015 was prompted by comments made by Arguin to Siboyintore on Witteveen’s Additional Report, which Witteveen saw when he returned to Rwanda.  Witteveen has said that he knew Arguin dealt from Arusha with the referral cases, though he had never seen him in Rwanda.  Witteveen felt that Arguin should know his (Witteveen’s) opinion in relation to the handling of genocide cases once they reached Rwanda.  That was the background to the formulation of the Confidential Memo of 18 June 2015.</p>

She also confirms that she received Witteveen’s email with his memo of 19 June 2015, on the day it was sent to Arguin, because Arguin forwarded it to her.  She did read this, although she is unclear when she did so.  She forwarded this to Richard Muhumuza, then Prosecutor General of Rwanda.  This was because she regarded it as the duty of such an expert as Mr Witteveen to “raise concerns internally and suggest solutions”.  She says she never discussed that with Mr Siboyintore.  It does not appear that she took any action about it or sought to discuss it with Siboyintore at the time.

I do maintain my opinion in my additional report and my testimony in court that I am convinced that there are no defence attorneys who can perform a credible defence investigation, certainly not abroad. This is not necessarily a criticism to the attorneys, but an obvious fact as lawyers not very often have the knowledge, expertise, experience and skills to perform such an investigation. That is why defence teams hire qualified investigators. But under Rwanda [case] law, a defence investigator cannot be appointed and the lawyers will have to personally conduct this task. It is totally unrealistic.</p>

Simply because these lawyers will challenge both the authorities in general as well as the court. These lawyers will not accept everything the Minister has determined in his policies, they will fight for sufficient resources to perform a credible defence investigation, they will delay proceedings with their motions and filings before the court. And this is not accepted. Consequently, they will be removed from the case as happened in Uwinkindi and will happen soon in Munyagishari. More ‘cooperative’ lawyers will be appointed.”</p>

Even as we speak, drafts of contracts with defence attorneys are discussed, clauses are taken out or taken in, the fees issue has not been concluded definitely and defence attorneys are moved out of the case and replaced. One court orders that the defendant be submitted a list to choose his defence attorney, another court now finds that there is no right to choose a lawyer from a list when indigent and rules the RBA needs to appoint a lawyer. Whether this is a purely legal decision or is motivated by the need to speed up trials and sideline lawyers who are critical who have to be sidelined as non-cooperative is an open question. The decision of the Minister to keep the execution of legal aid to himself is in my view not a very wise decision as it makes the whole thing too political. It is him against the defence lawyers. The usual language that everything is solved now and the defence attorneys can concentrate on their cases, no longer suffices.”</p>

I believe it was him personally who decided that the proceedings were taking too long and the cases should be concluded. Based on the minutes of the meetings with the defence attorneys and other documents, there can be no doubt he decided to act. A question of course is: what were his motives and why he didn’t leave it to the judges. He claims it was the limited budget and the fact that it got depleted by the defence attorneys delaying tactics. But I put that into question. Based on his legal aid policy, promulgated in September of 2014 he had budgeted 100.000.000 Rwandan Francs each year for four years for hiring lawyers for the transfer cases. If he pays each defence attorney 1 million a month, he can hire eight lawyers for these cases to stay within the budget. If the Minister spends 15 million Francs in a case and the case takes five years, he spends 3 million Francs per case per year. To spend 100.000.000 in a year he needs 33 cases, while there are only five. So, his assertion that he depleted the budget is not very convincing.</p>

But the reality of course is that the judges decided on postponements during all these years. Sometimes these postponements were triggered by requests of the defence attorneys, but not always. In Uwinkindi the composition of the chamber changed in 2014 leading to an additional postponement. Many times the courts have been extremely indecisive in matters that should not take long to decide.

Firstly in Uwinkindi of course where the judges have quickly rejected every motion and request by the defence and decided to proceed with the case without defence. When the defence attorneys decided to appeal the decisions of the High Court in January, I was told that the High Court would wait for the Supreme Court’s ruling, as they did in the past. But I found out end of February that the High Court had changed its position and was now proceeding with the case. To my surprise they went on hearing witnesses, both prosecution witnesses as well as defence witnesses without any presence of defence attorneys. The judges had taken three years to take their time in deciding all kinds of preliminary matters and now, all of a sudden, they finished the witnesses in just a couple of days and without defence attorneys.</p>

After expressing the conclusion to which we have referred, Mr Witteveen poses the question of “what could be behind this speeding up of proceedings and removal of attorneys”.

Generally, all defence attorneys claimed it is very hard to defend genocide defendants especially from abroad as society in general but their family, partners, clients and the like in particular do not accept they defend a defendant on genocide.

This clause has been removed now from the new contracts offered by the Ministry but they may still be valid under the existing contracts such as in Bandora. Apart from what the clause says and whether the clause is valid or not, I continuously sense that defence attorneys are conscious not to criticize. The clause does not make much difference.</p>

A crucial element of the trial in Bandora was in October 2014 when two prosecution witnesses retracted their statements claiming they had been visited by the prosecutors in the court room who requested him to wrongfully accuse the defendant. The statements by these two witnesses did not attract much attention and the defence never requested anything to the court in examining what exactly had happened, although it seemed relevant. I questioned the defence attorney afterwards why he had not requested that this incident were to be investigated. The defence attorney replied he thought it was sufficient for him the witnesses had retracted their statements. Although it is hard to prove, there is certainly a likelihood, in light of the other observations, that it is not expected from defence attorneys to request a further examination of alleged conduct by the prosecution. Surprisingly, in the verdict of the High Court in Bandora, the incident was reduced to mentioning the witnesses had retracted their statements. The fact that the witnesses claimed the prosecutors had requested them to falsely accuse the defendant did not make it to the verdict.</p>

The Defence contends that running this particular line of defence is “simply untenable” in Rwanda’s current political-legal climate. It concludes that despite the immunity added  to  the  Transfer  Law  in  2009  it  is  unlikely  that  a  potential  witness  would  be  willing  to  present  evidence  on  the  role of the RPF in killings in Rwanda and that it is equally unlikely that any defence counsel in Rwanda would agree to represent a client putting forward such a politically sensitive defence.

Therefore I strongly advocate for forms of hybrid solutions. I believe this has been a missed chance years ago, when there were better opportunities to create hybrid systems in Rwanda. The case of the War Crimes Chamber in Bosnia and ICTY’s role in it, could serve as an example. But there is still time to amend what was not fixed earlier. I have therefore recommended to have foreign defence attorneys team up with local attorneys and defend the cases with external donor funds. Equally important is it to have foreign judges sit in the High Court chamber, which was foreseen when Rwanda adjusted their laws to facilitate that and what the ICTR, when referring the cases, expected to happen [para 114 Uwinkindi referral decision]. </p>

It is important to acknowledge that the CPS are not to be criticised for failing to bring these views to the attention of the SDJ, because they were unaware of those views until July 2016.  We did ask for further information concerning the apparent failure of the Rwandan authorities to inform the CPS about these views, given that the proceedings before the SDJ were still continuing.  Evidence continued through June and July 2015, the closing submissions of each side were made in August and September 2015 and the SDJ was preparing her judgment during October to December 2015.  We made an order on 7 December 2016 requiring a signed witness statement from “any relevant authority” within the GoR by 4 pm on 16 December 2016, setting out when  Witteveen’s memo was first received.  We required a full explanation of why the memo was not sent to the CPS promptly.  We have set out some of the results above.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is right to say that the initial statement served in purported compliance with this order was from Miss Kate Leonard, a barrister who is a specialist prosecutor with the International Justice and Organised Crime Division of the CPS.  She has had conduct of these extradition proceedings on behalf of the GoR since 2013.  Complaint was initially made (in our view, with some justification) that this did not comply with our order.  However, matters were rectified subsequently.  It seems that the first that the CPS knew of the existence of any further document emanating from Mr Witteveen was when Mr Frank Brazell, the solicitor acting for Dr Brown, emailed Miss Leonard saying that he had become aware of the existence of a further report/statement from Mr Witteveen, that had been produced to the Dutch authorities for the use in the extradition proceedings before the Dutch Courts. Miss Leonard’s enquiries of the GoR resulted in an indication that the GoR had no knowledge of any such document.  At that time the Dutch prosecutors also confirmed that no such document been produced or used in the Dutch proceedings. However, in early February 2016 it emerged that the Dutch prosecutors were in possession of the confidential memo from Mr Witteveen, but since it had been classified as “confidential”, it could not be disclosed. Mr Witteveen subsequently confirmed to the CPS that he had indeed prepared the memo, but said that it was not intended for use in court proceedings.  Whilst he was willing for the memo (and indeed his response to Mr Arguin’s report) to be disclosed, it required the consent of the Dutch prosecutors before this could occur. That consent was forthcoming in due course. Mr Arguin also agreed that his report should be disclosed, but only when the United Nations Office of Legal Affairs (‘OLA’) had given its consent. That consent was given on 3 September 2016.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Miss Leonard has confirmed that the CPS had received Mr Arguin’s report on 15 June 2016 and Mr Witteveen’s memos on 11 July 2016, but said that she did not send them to the GoR at that stage because the CPS did not have the permission to do so of OLA or of the Dutch Prosecution authority.  Eventually, the requisite permissions were received and “[all] three documents were added to the appeal bundles, encrypted on disc and served on the defence and Court on 29 September 2016.”  Miss Leonard says that “[due] to technical difficulties with the encryption process and the time involved in preparing the bundles for service, [the documentation] was not prepared and sent to Rwanda at this time”.  This chimes with what Mr Siboyintore has said.  It is unclear to us to what extent those representing the Respondents in these proceedings were alerted to the inclusion of these documents in the bundles, but reference to the documents was made by Counsel in their Skeleton Arguments and in oral submissions.  Thus it follows that at some stage in about October/November 2016 they became aware of Mr Witteveen's further written contributions.</p>

It appears that, following the reporting to the President of the MICT of Uwinkindi’s comments expressed in the Monitoring Report dated March 2015, consideration began to be given within the MICT procedures to an application for revocation of the referral.  The formal application appears to have been made on 5 August 2015.  The relevant dates are given in paragraphs 2-6 of the decision of the Trial Chamber given on 22 October 2015.</p>

Those of most relevance to the current proceedings were the suggestions (i) that the actions of the Minister of Justice denied Uwinkindi the choice of counsel, (ii) that insufficient funds were available to conduct a proper defence investigation and (iii) that his right to a fair trial was violated by the decision of the High Court to fine his counsel and by showing bias towards the prosecution.</p>

The Trial Chamber was criticised by the Appeals Chamber for not referring to the report, aspects of which were said to have “clear relevance”, but it was concluded by the Appeals Chamber that “consideration of the report as a whole does not substantiate Uwinkindi’s contentions as to inequality of arms, and specifically, the inadequacy of the means available for the presentation of the defence in his case”: see paragraph 56.  We bear in mind that the further views of Mr Witteveen expressed in the confidential Memo were not available either to the Trial Chamber or the Appeals Chamber. </p>

In his later report of 22 May 2016, Mr Arguin says that he “directed the prosecution’s response” to this application and others by Uwinkindi and Munyagishari.

The ICTR and MICT did not recognize Mr Witteveen as an expert and, thus, his unsolicited memorandum containing only his personal opinions or beliefs was not regarded as evidence …. Uwinkindi, in all events, was well aware of the pending United Kingdom extradition proceedings as he attached various filings from that case, including copies of Mr. Witteveen's various reports, to his submissions in support of revocation. He did not, however, substantively develop any of the points raised in Mr.Witteveen's reports in his revocation request, despite the opportunity to do so.”</p>

In each of those cases the Court at first instance noted that the MICT Trial Chamber “did not include [the] report in its assessment and appears not to have had it.”  By the time those two cases reached the Court of Appeal in The Hague in July 2016 it was accepted that the MICT Trial Chamber had been aware of the report.  In the Report of the appeal in the case of Jean Claude Iyamuremye dated 5 July 2016, for example, it is recorded that “[also] submitted on … appeal was a further memorandum from Witteveen of June 2016 entitled ‘Why extradition to Rwanda is perhaps not such a good idea…’”, along with the confidential Memo, Mr Arguin’s report and Mr Witteveen’s response to the Arguin report dated 1 June 2016.  The first of these additional documents is not in evidence in the present proceedings, but its title suggests that it takes the stance that extradition to Rwanda may not be appropriate.

It also made clear that it started from the assumption that “in a constant series of rulings and most recently in the ruling of the MICT of 20 October 2015 in the Uwinkindi case, the ICTR and the MICT have ruled that the suspects transferred by the ICTR to Rwanda will receive a fair trial.”  The Dutch Court of Appeal continued by saying that these rulings of the ICTR and MICT “show that these tribunals have addressed the arguments of the suspects in detail and that they have dismissed the objections against the legal procedure under the Transfer Law in comprehensively reasoned judgments”.</p>

However, that does not (or should not) preclude a closer examination of what was available for consideration by those “international legal forums” and to consider whether the material newly before us that was not available to those fora should be seen as altering the perspective to be applied to the decisions in those cases.  Equally, whilst we pay due regard to the reasoning of the Court of Appeal in The Hague, we are not precluded from considering what conclusions we ought to draw from all the material that we have, even where it is the same as that Court had before it.</p>

It is necessary for us to summarise the various points that he made in this connection. </p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“One fundamental misimpression is … that Rwanda has adopted an accusatorial or common law system for trials in transferred cases. Rwanda has traditionally been a civil law jurisdiction.  Legal reforms instituted since 1994 have introduced aspects of common law practice, including expanded reliance on judicial precedent and cross-examination as a means of establishing truth. However, the Rwandan legal system cannot be categorized as either purely civil or common law; rather, it is a hybrid system that retains elements of both civil and common law practices.”</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“37.<marker name="tab"/>Another aspect of Rwanda's hybrid legal system relates to the conduct of trials. Rwandan judges play a much more active role in questioning witnesses than in most common law systems. Although the Transfer Law applicable to referred and extradited cases allows for cross-examination of witnesses, it does not specify how cross-examination will be conducted. In keeping with its civil law traditions, many Rwandan judges conduct the questioning of witnesses, generally after seeking input from the prosecution and defence on the types of questions that should be asked. Increasingly, Rwandan judges are providing counsel with more leeway to conduct their own cross-examinations as has been seen in all of the transferred cases, including Uwinkindi and Munyagishari.</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">38.<marker name="tab"/>It also is not uncommon in Rwandan judicial proceedings for the accused to play an active role in the conduct of their defence. Accused persons are not restricted to merely watching the proceedings and listening to the arguments of their counsel as they are in many common law systems. Instead, accused persons are free to directly address the judges and respond to points made by the prosecution or testimony of witnesses.  Counsel are present during these submissions and, when necessary, intervene to make any clarifications or additions that may be required to protect their client's interests.</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">39.<marker name="tab"/>Several of the criticisms Mr. Witteveen cites arise from his misimpression that trials in transferred cases are purely accusatorial in nature. He criticizes the adequacy of investigations without acknowledging the role of the judicial police in collecting both inculpatory and exculpatory evidence.  He criticizes what he regards as the active role judges play in questioning witnesses without recognizing that this is a common feature in many civil law jurisdictions and without acknowledging Rwanda's efforts to expand the role of counsel in conducting cross­examinations. He also criticizes the accused's ability to make direct submissions without recognizing that, in Rwanda, this is a hallmark of the right to direct one's own   defence. All of these criticisms contribute to Mr.  Witteveen's overall assessment that Rwandan defence counsel are ineffectual but none of them adequately accounts for the essentially hybrid nature of Rwandan trial proceedings.  Any assessment of fair trial rights in Rwanda must recognize this fundamental distinction.”</p>

Witteveen’s brief response was that Arguin’s attempt “to save these defence attorneys, e.g. how they sit in silence next to their clients, by pointing at the hybrid system of Rwanda’s justice system and the lack of any cross examination or defence, suggesting it could all be part of their strategy, which we are unaware of” was “unconvincing”.

It relates to defence investigations.  Arguin says that a practice direction issued by the Chief Justice on 6 August 2015 “preserves the role of the judicial police in criminal investigations and clarifies the procedure to be followed when an accused seeks to conduct investigations beyond those conducted by the judicial police.”  He described the position as follows:</p>

Once the High Court is persuaded that the request is reasonable and in the interests of justice, it will issue an order to the Ministry of Justice to extend the required funds.  In addition, the practice direction provides guidance on the types of expenses that will be covered, e.g., economy class tickets and daily subsistence allowance.”</p>

He says that the RBA is established as an independent entity under Rwandan law and is responsible for maintaining a list of qualified advocates and ensuring discipline within the profession.  The RBA maintains a list of those it considers qualified to represent those made the subject of transferred cases.  The flat rate fee each would receive is 15 million Rwandan francs (which we understand to have been around £12,500 at the time of the judgment below.).  This fee is said to be free of tax and does not prevent the taking on by the advocate of other cases.  It excludes the cost of various administrative services and of any additional investigations that may be permitted under the Chief Justice’s Practice Direction.  He says that there are 68 counsel who have more than ten years’ experience and he mentions specifically the advocate assigned to the Uwinkindi case, Mr Joseph Ngabonziza, a former judge of the Rwandan Military Court, who has experience of defending those accused of genocide and related crimes.</p>

The Court was right to sanction him and to adjourn the proceedings until the RBA had appointed a replacement. Any problems thereafter were entirely due, he said, to Uwinkindi’s failure to cooperate with the successor counsel.

If Arguin’s report was accepted in its entirety, there would be support for an argument that she ought to have decided the case differently.  If, however, the broad thrust of Mr Witteveen’s position in the debate is reliable along with his concerns, together with those the SDJ heard and accepted, then they support the conclusion that there is a risk of a flagrant denial of justice if the Respondents were returned to Rwanda.</p>

She arrived at the material findings of fact by substantially accepting the evidence of Witteveen.  Whilst, of course, we have to look at the position afresh given the availability now of Arguin’s views, it would be wrong to ignore the fact that the SDJ found Witteveen a compelling and reliable witness.    Had she seen his further written contributions, we think it likely that she would have seen what he said as further evidence of his objectivity.  For our part, we would accept that what he has said has required courage.  It would be a wholly unjustified conclusion to accept Mr Lewis’s contention that his words were those of an embittered man.  Our reading of what he has said suggests that what he has said has been said more out of sadness than anger or embitterment.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The additional material from Witteveen appears to us to add to his authority.  He has been able to establish his experience, and has a closer knowledge of how the system has actually operated in Rwanda in recent times than any other expert.  Moreover, he has given evidence which was clearly difficult given his position.  It has made his continued connection in the area problematic, putting the matter neutrally.  Yet in breaking with the obvious constraints of his being an employee (in effect) of the Appellant, he has not taken an extreme position in opposition to the GoR.  Rather he has maintained a nuanced and balanced position.  The Courts expect clarity, reason and moral courage in an expert witness.  It appears to us that Witteveen has shown those qualities here, responding to his growing acquaintance with the facts and his developing understanding of the true problems facing Defendants in Rwanda in such cases.</p>

However, as we have observed, he does come to the issues that have been raised from a particular viewpoint.  We find it difficult to accept that his approach has not been influenced to a degree by that viewpoint.  It is noteworthy that he could have been put forward as the GoR’s witness in these proceedings.  He was not.</p>

We take the view that his knowledge of the situation on the ground in Rwanda is simply not demonstrated to the extent of that of Witteveen’s.  We are concerned that there is a tone of defensiveness about some of his views.  We are inclined, from the content of his report compared to the thrust of the evidence about the transferred cases and their progress, to accept that Witteveen is right:  Arguin is relying on the theory of how things should be, rather than giving us a picture of how they really are.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The “high bar” set by the law, as we have analysed it above, reflects those principles.  If the objection to extradition were merely that the quality of criminal process was less than perfect, less than desirable, then such objection, whether viewed as a moral question, or judged against the test set by the law, would mean that extradition would proceed.  However, whether viewed as a moral question or tested by the law, if the extraditees were to return to face trial which represented a flagrant denial of justice, then the case is altered.  And the judgment on that question cannot be distorted by the desirability of trial in the country where the events took place, much less by such questions as Rwandan national pride, or the aim of building capacity or improving justice in Rwanda, much less of relieving international institutions of a longstanding expensive burden.  We think it unlikely that returning defendants to face charges in an inadequate criminal justice system would tend to improve matters there:  rather, it would be likely to reduce the pressure to change and improve.  </p>

If there is a real risk of a flagrant denial of justice, that means there is a real risk of the innocent being convicted.  To extradite in the face of such a risk, even if motivated by a desire to repatriate the criminal process to the country where it should properly be conducted, would be no more and no less a wrong than it would be to permit a serious miscarriage of justice here.</p>

As was SDJ Arbuthnot, we are struck by the fact that these renewed requests from the GoR, relying on improvements in the legal system, come from a state which, in very recent times, has instigated political killings, and has led British police to warn Rwandan nationals living in Britain of credible plans to kill them on the part of that state.    </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">We are also struck by the conjunction of hostile remarks by President Kagame and others, made during the currency of criminal proceedings, and the reported threats to Professor Reyntjens, Professor Longman, to other lawyers and now to Martin Witteveen, in other words threats not confined to political opponents, but affecting experts and lawyers critical of the criminal justice system in Rwanda.  We are not in a position to evaluate these threats in detail.  However, the deaths and disappearances which have been established, set beside the detention and mistreatment of defence lawyers such as Peter Erlinder, mean that there is sufficient material to show a real risk of political pressure and political interference in the justice system in Rwanda.  It is for these reasons that we have concluded that the view of SDJ Arbuthnot on this issue is not “wrong” but may be, if anything, rather too sanguine, particularly in the light of the new material available to us.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">We have to consider carefully if these cases are such as to attract such pressure on intervention.  The GoR argues that they are not to be compared with the cases such as that of Ingabire and others:  straightforward political opponents of President Kagame.  We accept the distinction, but we must consider how far it operates.  We understand the argument that it is in the best interests of the Rwandan authorities to conduct, or permit these trials to be conducted, fairly, since that is the best means to ensuring future extradition of those who have fled.  Yet the evidence is not encouraging that that objective reasoning is sufficient to guarantee the outcome.  We consider that there is a risk, unless clear conditions of guarantee are established, of interference and pressure in these cases.  These Respondents are not in general active political opponents of the regime.  We address the individual arguments below.  However, they are high-profile defendants, as all agree.  They are, with one exception, people with involvement in authority during the period of the genocide.  It is easy to see how, even if not regarded as first-rank political targets, one or more of them might be subjects of real interest to the authorities and thus the focus of pressure on the judiciary.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As to the independence of the Rwandan judiciary, we note carefully the context.  The evidence suggests that judges are not appointed unless they have party membership of the RPF.  Their appointments have moved from being indefinite to appointment for definite terms.  The Rwandan executive can achieve the dismissal of serving judges:  it has done so in recent times in respect of around 40 individual judges.  We are not in a position to say whether the suggested misconduct or corruption was established in these cases:  it may be so.  But the capacity of the executive to get rid of judges is established.  In such circumstances, there can be little doubt that judges will feel exposed.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The evidence is that judges in the past have ignored or resisted pressure.  However, as will be obvious, there will rarely be evidence when judges have acceded to pressure.  There are many indications that judges would wish to act independently, but there are also indications, including those illustrated by the later Report and Memorandum of Witteveen, when the conduct of trials has been disturbing.  Our conclusion here, once again, is that SDJ Arbuthnot is not “wrong”.  However, some of the material we have seen was not available to her.  Our view is that the evidence points to some risk, depending on the evidence before them and the safeguards in play, that judges might yield to pressure from the Rwandan authorities.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">We have concluded, likewise, that SDJ Arbuthnot was broadly correct in her conclusions as to the preparedness of witnesses to appear.  It seems likely that there will be a high degree of apprehension, and that some would simply decline to appear.  However, there is evidence that many witnesses have appeared in genocide trials, in the <span style="font-style:italic">gacaca</span> and conventional Courts.  We consider that the advent of the WPU should improve conditions for witnesses, and it is to be hoped that will communicate itself to them.  However, this must be a qualified conclusion, depending heavily on the actual conditions of trial, and on the critical issue of the defence capacity to fund, proof and deploy the witnesses in the first place.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">We do not consider the judicial police to be a credible mechanism for obtaining and deploying defence witnesses.  The overwhelming evidence, despite any theoretical function, is that they are not organised or tasked to perform that role, and nor do they do so in practice.  We touch on this theme again below, when considering defence capacity.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Which point brings us to the critical point in the judgment of SDJ Arbuthnot.  The closer we have read the evidence in this case, the firmer has become our agreement with the judge below that defence capacity is the vital element, the capstone, of the case.  Whilst in the context of our court system adequate representation is of course important, other safeguards in the system such as responsible unbiased prosecution, witness protection, unchallenged and complete judicial independence taken together, mean that inadequate defence may be compensated for and a reasonable quality of justice delivered overall.  Even in that context, it is well established that miscarriages of justice will occur, where defence representation is inadequate.  However, in the context of Rwanda, with the difficulties and weaknesses we have identified, the presence or absence of effective defence is absolutely central.  We are completely of one mind with the judge below on that point.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">For the reasons we have identified, and need not repeat, the arrangements for defence in Rwanda are clearly inadequate.  They would be inadequate even if the remainder of the criminal justice system was acceptable and the concerns which arise were not present.  In an authoritarian state, where judicial independence is institutionally weak and has been compromised in the past, where there is established fear by witnesses, not all of which can be effectively countered, the existing arrangements are quite insufficient to ensure a reasonable fairness in the proceedings.  The story of the existing post 2009 genocide cases, the “transferred” case, gives rise to real concern.  We cannot rule out a degree of tactical complaint and manoeuvring by those defendants, but objectively the conditions are such as to give ample opportunity for complaint.  Here as in other aspects of the case, we pay great regard to Martin Witteveen.  We consider that SDJ Arbuthnot was right to rely on his evidence, and that evidence is heavily fortified on this issue by material coming too late for her consideration but which is before us.  We cannot find reassurance from the evidence of James Arguin.</p>

In brief submissions, Mr Knowles has raised the prospect that further or additional undertakings by the Appellant might allay the concerns of the Court.  There are precedents for doing so:  see, for example, the approach taken in <span style="font-style:italic">Florea v Romania</span> [2014] EWHC 2528 (Admin) and <span style="font-style:italic">Giese v Government of the USA </span>[2015] EWHC 2733 (Admin).  Given the seriousness of the offences alleged here, we are prepared to permit the Appellant a final opportunity to seek to assure the Court that credible and verifiable conditions will be in place, to overcome the legal bar to extradition upheld above.  It should by no means be assumed that such assurances will successfully overcome the bar to extradition given the historical failure of the Appellant to cooperate in prosecutions in England, the serious concerns articulated earlier in this judgment, the length of time that has passed and the inherent difficulty of being able to rely on assurances.  However, it seems to us right that the opportunity should be afforded to the Appellant to persuade us that satisfactory assurances can be given.

It is said on Brown/Bajinya’s behalf that this accords him “high political status” and means that he is being pursued for extradition because of his “political opinions” and/or would be prejudiced at his trial because of those political opinions.

The CPS received a reply from the Prosecutor General stating that the Rwandans were not prepared to “cede jurisdiction to the UK authorities” and would not provide copies of their evidence to the police.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is contended by Mr Jones that the GoR has been taking an unreasonable stance in relation to the possibility of prosecution in the UK, particularly in light of its co-operation with other countries that have taken jurisdiction for dealing with offences of genocide.  The domestic jurisdictions in Holland, Germany, Finland, Sweden, Belgium, France, Canada, the United States of America and Norway have each undertaken the prosecution of Rwandan genocide cases under the principle of universal jurisdiction.  It is argued that it is to be inferred that the GoR co-operated in those cases.  No reason for the decision of the GoR not to co-operate in the prosecution of Brown/Bajinya and others in the UK has been given.  Ms Ellis, on behalf of EN, has argued that “such a vehement rejection of a similar request by UK authorities suggests that particular political importance has accorded to this case by the executive for reasons other than the interests of justice.”  It is also argued that there is no concept of “ceding jurisdiction” to a domestic Court.  Mr Jones referred to the CPS “Guidelines on the handling of cases where the jurisdiction to prosecute is shared with prosecution authorities overseas.”   He says that the title of these guidelines “recognises correctly that jurisdiction is not something inherent in one state, which it can “cede” to another state.” States, he submits, “have concurrent jurisdiction over crimes such as genocide.”  </p>

If the GoR will not co-operate in providing the evidence for the prosecution case, that overall objective cannot be achieved.  Views may differ about whether the GoR is acting reasonably in taking that position in this case or whether there is a political motive behind it, but it is that country’s entitlement to argue that Brown/Bajinya (and the others) should be tried in Rwanda where, all things being equal, it would be best and most advantageous for the trial to take place.  Equally, as Mr Knowles says, if the GoR cooperated with the UK authorities, ultimately the decision about whether to prosecute would be left to the independent prosecuting authority (the CPS) in the UK and would thus be out of the control of the Rwandan authorities.</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“146. Towards the end of the hearing evidence emerged that CU and EN had been tried in their absence before gacaca courts. In the case of CU an acquittal was declared by the relevant Gacaca Appeal Court to be a nullity on the ground of lack of jurisdiction. In the case of EN there had been a conviction of certain offences at one Gacaca Court, and an acquittal of other apparently similar offences in another Gacaca Court. The evidence was still emerging as the hearing before us concluded. Professor Schabas told the judge that there was no possibility whatsoever that the appellants could be tried by the gacaca courts. It is not clear whether this surprising turn of events was simply a case of the left hand not knowing what the right was doing, or an indication of something more sinister. Had we been minded to reach a different conclusion on the fair trial issue it would have been necessary to explore the implications of these gacaca proceedings in more detail.</p>

That is not, strictly speaking, the issue before us, but it is very difficult to resist the inference that steps were being taken by the prosecuting authorities in Rwanda to shore up its position vis-à-vis Nteziryayo either because of the recommendation for extradition or because of the known existence of a pending appeal to the Divisional Court.  In the submissions made to the SDJ on Nteziryayo’s behalf, Ms Ellis and Ms Evans contended that:</p>

To that extent, within Rwandan law, she argues that the proceedings that led to Nteziryayo’s acquittal were valid.  If that is correct, the rule against double jeopardy bites and Nteziryayo should not be extradited.  Furthermore, if we understand the argument correctly, since the <span style="font-style:italic">gacaca</span> proceedings are plainly not Article 6 compliant, there could be no basis for extraditing him to serve the sentence imposed.  If both acquittal and conviction have been lawfully annulled, there is no impediment to extradition on the basis of double jeopardy.</p>

Ms Ellis submits that Article 2 on its face is only relevant to someone who has been “transferred” to Rwanda and that since Nteziryayo had not been “transferred” in October 2008, he was not subject to Article 2.  Strictly speaking, an order for his transfer (by way of extradition) had been made, but its operation was suspended pending the appeal to the Divisional Court which, in due course, quashed the order.</p>

The evaluation of the issue of double jeopardy in Nteziryayo’s case does not depend on determining whether there was evidence that showed the lawfulness or otherwise of the annulment: it depended on interpreting the provisions governing the <span style="font-style:italic">gacaca </span>courts to which we have referred.  In our judgment, the <span style="font-style:italic">gacaca</span> court did have jurisdiction to determine Nteziryayo’s guilt or innocence according to Rwandan law at the time and, accordingly, the <span style="font-style:italic">gacaca </span>Court of Appeal had no power to declare that the acquittal was a nullity through lack of jurisdiction.</p>

The Appellant goes on to argue that the <span style="font-style:italic">gacaca</span> court, for reasons set down in paragraphs 216-227 of Ngoga’s deposition, is “not a Court of competent jurisdiction”.  This was said to have been recognised by the SDJ at paragraph 67.  It would therefore follow that the conviction and sentence is defunct, as it cannot be enforced in law.  </p>

It is said that it is “uncontroversial that the Extradition Act 2003 requires the judge to focus on the conduct alleged in the extradition request”.  Where different episodes arise, the Judge must focus on each episode separately and consider if the specific episode of conduct amounts to an extradition offence.  The Extradition Act was modified by the Extradition Act 2003 (Multiple Offences) Order 2003 (SI 2003/3150).  Specifically, Article 23(4) amends Section 78(4) so as to stipulate that the extradition judge:</p>

Ms Malcolm argues that the approach adopted in relation to the parallel provisions under Section 104 of the 2003 Act, governing appeals against an order for extradition, should constitute a parallel approach.  The principles laid down in the well-known case of <span style="font-style:italic">Szombathely City Court v Fenivesy</span> should be applied <span style="font-style:italic">mutatis mutandis</span>.  The policy behind Section 104 and 106 is clear:  the parties should not be permitted without good reason to raise issues or introduce evidence on appeal without having first litigated them below.</p>

The explanation is that the representatives of the Appellant missed the point at the time of drafting their closing submissions, and so far as it goes that is accepted by Mutabaruka’s representatives.  </p>

Whilst we have generally been liberal in our approach to fresh material in this case, since it is so voluminous, and since matters have continued to emerge, we have reached the view here that the egregious failures on this issue are such that by no liberality of approach can the threshold for jurisdiction be passed in respect of material now sought to be introduced.

As a matter of record, there is no suggestion that the verdicts have been nullified.  As the Appellants concede in their principal written submissions, the decision below was based on the absence of evidence that the <span style="font-style:italic">gacaca</span> conviction <span style="text-decoration:underline">had been</span> annulled or quashed.  The Appellant’s response to this is to point to the Organic Law No 04/2012/OL and the evidence of Dr Clark that the <span style="font-style:italic">gacaca</span> conviction <span style="text-decoration:underline">will be</span> quashed or annulled.  Part of Ms Malcolm’s reply is to cite the criticisms made by the GoR at other points in these proceedings, to the effect that it is unsafe to rely on “expert” opinion on the law from a non-legal expert (such as Dr Clark).  Reliance here is also rendered more difficult since, in effect, the Rwandan Government is relying on a future decision of the judicial branch, a promise Ms Malcolm says they should not be in a position to enforce.  </p>

SDJ Arbuthnot accepted his earlier political involvement, but considered that there was “weakness in the evidence that he is currently a political force in Rwandan politics or in the Diaspora”.  In paragraphs 89 to 91 the Judge gave her conclusions.  Broadly she considered that whilst Mutabaruka might be involved in RaS, essentially this “fairly new small organization” was insignificant and there was no evidence “that would lead to me to believe that Kagame would find [Mutabaruka] worthy of eliminating from the political scene”.</p>

She submits that it is significant the Rwandan Arrest Warrants were issued by the Prosecutor General and were therefore not subject to any judicial scrutiny or oversight.  The extradition request is an executive act.  The deposition of Simon Ngoga links UNISODEC directly to the MRND, for which it is said to have acted as “little more than a cat’s paw”.  Ms Malcolm suggests there is little evidence for this, but the expression of the opinion may be sufficient warning of a risk to fair trial.  Although, she submits, that in fact UNISODEC was a non-sectarian party, seeking to reduce ethnic tension, the stereotype or misrepresentation of the nature of the party may be the significant factor.  Ms Malcolm submits that the evidence of Adelbert Rugeruza and Azariah Shiyranbere demonstrates that, following his move to the United Kingdom, Mutabaruka remained politically active, although the activities were limited.  She relies upon the fact, as noted by SDJ Arbuthnot, that the witness Rene Mugenzi was aware of RaS as the metamorphosis or successor to UNISODEC.  The submission is in part that the judge was insufficiently sensitive to the practical realities for opposition parties to the Kigali regime.  Caution as to the adverse consequences of opposition mean that activities may be muted.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The reply to these specific points on behalf of the Appellant can be summarised as follows.  The evidence of Mutabaruka’s son, Peter Mutabaruka, and his long-standing friend Rugeruza was “entirely self-serving and deeply unconvincing”.   The conclusions of the Senior District Judge were correct.  Cross-examination of Rugeruza demonstrated that Rwanda Arise and Shine was not a continuation of UNISODEC, and indeed was not formed until, at the earliest, around 2012.  Hence the creation of “an alleged party of opposition” post-dates the investigation into Mutabaruka, and calls into question the genuineness of the political activity.  Moreover there is no “cogent evidence” that the party operates in any recognisable sense.  Rugeruza was said to be part of the party structure, but could not explain the party’s aims.  Peter Mutabaruka’s evidence also exposed the party as a “sham”, given his incapacity to answer as to ordinary details of the party’s membership, location and activity.  His answers were too thin to be credible, even allowing for caution as to individual names.  Peter Mutabaruka did confirm that the RaS had only operated publicly over the last two to three years, further undermining the suggestion that this extradition is for political reasons.  In short, the reliance on RaS is reliance upon a party “created as a cynical ploy to provide CMU with an additional defence to these proceedings”.</p>

On the contrary, her overall conclusion that there was no sufficiently compelling evidence that Mutabaruka was a significant political figure is undisturbed by the submissions made.  For those reasons, we conclude that this aspect of the case adds nothing to the concerns about fair trial expressed elsewhere in this judgment.</p>

In paragraph 663 of her judgment, she noted that there was a distinction between the evidence before the Rwoga <span style="font-style:italic">gacaca</span> hearing and the Kigoma allegations, which were quite discrete.  None of the 16 witnesses relied on in the request before the Senior District Judge were witnesses against Ugirashebuja in the Rwoga <span style="font-style:italic">gacaca</span> hearing.  She noted that the Claimant’s witness, Ms Nerad, stated that the Rwoga <span style="font-style:italic">gacaca</span> hearing related to different allegations in a different sector, made by different witnesses.  There may have been some “small overlap”.  In paragraph 663, in addition to the lack of significant overlap, SDJ Arbuthnot simply found that she could not conclude there were reasonable grounds for “believing the conduct alleged by CU may have occurred.  I do not find an abuse in these circumstances”.</p>

In this instance the lack of overlap, combined with the apparently comprehensible reasons for the <span style="font-style:italic">gacaca</span> quashing, means, taken together, that we cannot find the basis for an abuse of process in relation to Ugirashebuja on the request for extradition presented by the Appellant.

The Twa, who were pygmies, formed no more than a small <span style="color:#000000">percentage of the population. The majority of the people were Hutu. The monarchy, and many of the chiefs, were Tutsi.  Rwanda gained full independence in 1962.  Before that, in 1959, p</span>olitical unrest led to a great deal of violence.  The first victims were Hutu.  Thousands of Tutsi were killed.  There ensued <span style="color:#000000">a cyclical pattern of violence involving the two groups.  An</span> election gave an overwhelming majority to Hutu political parties.  The <span style="color:#000000">Tutsi monarch fled abroad.  </span>In 1961, after a referendum, the Tutsi monarchy was abolished and Rwanda became a republic.  In 1961 and 1962, Tutsi guerrilla groups staged attacks into Rwanda from outside the country.  Hutu within Rwanda responded.  Thousands were killed.</p>

His political party was the MRND.  Every Rwandan became a member, like it or not.  But the Tutsi population were not proportionately represented in the political and social life of the country.  The Habyarimana regime was hostile not only to the Tutsi, but also to Hutu who did not originate from the north-west of Rwanda where Habyarimana was <span style="color:#000000">based.

Meanwhile Tutsi exiles launched incursions into Rwanda under the banner of the Rwandan Patriotic Army (“RPA”).  Violent incidents ensued.  In early 1992 the President began the training of youth members of the MRND to <span style="color:#000000">form militias known as the </span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">I</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;color:#000000">nterahamwe. </span><span style="color:#000000">The </span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">I</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;color:#000000">nterahamwe</span><span style="color:#000000"> later massacred Tutsi, and committed other crimes which largely went unpunished.  The division between Hutu and Tutsi widened.  </span>In March 1992, a group of Hutu hard-liners founded a new radical political party, the CDR, which was more extremist than Habyarimana himself.</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“106. …  On 6 April 1994, President Habyarimana and other heads of State of the region met in Dar-es-Salaam (Tanzania) to discuss the implementation of the peace accords [sc. which had been signed earlier]. The aircraft carrying President Habyarimana and the Burundian President, Ntaryamirai, who were returning from the meeting, crashed around 8:30 pm near Kigali airport. All aboard were killed. </p>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">107. The Rwandan army and the militia immediately erected roadblocks around the city of Kigali. Before dawn on April 7 1994, in various parts of the country, the Presidential Guard and the militia started killing the Tutsi as well as Hutu known to be in favour of the Arusha Accords and power-sharing between the Tutsi and the Hutu. Among the first victims were a number of ministers of the coalition government, including its Prime Minister, Agathe Uwilingiyimana (MDR), the president of the Supreme Court and virtually the entire leadership of the <span style="font-style:italic">parti social démocrate</span> (PSD). The constitutional vacuum thus created cleared the way for the establishment of the self-proclaimed Hutu-power interim government, mainly under the aegis of retired Colonel Théoneste Bagosora. </p>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">108. Soldiers of the Rwandan Armed Forces (FAR) executed ten Belgian blue helmets, thereby provoking the withdrawal of the Belgian contingent which formed the core of UNAMIR. On April 21 1994, the UN Security Council decided to reduce the peace-keeping force to 450 troops. </p>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">109. In the afternoon of 7 April 1994, RPF troops left their quarters in Kigali and their zone in the north, to resume open war against the Rwandan Armed Forces. Its troops from the north moved south, crossing the demilitarized zone, and entered the city of Kigali on April 12 1994, thus forcing the interim government to flee to Gitarama. </p>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">110. On April 12 1994, after public authorities announced over Radio Rwanda that ‘we need to unite against the enemy, the only enemy and this is the enemy that we have always known...it’s the enemy who wants to reinstate the former feudal monarchy’, it became clear that the Tutsi were the primary targets. During the week of 14 to 21 April 1994, the killing campaign reached its peak. The President of the interim government, the Prime Minister and some key ministers travelled to Butare and Gikongoro, and that marked the beginning of killings in these regions which had hitherto been peaceful. Thousands of people, sometimes encouraged or directed by local administrative officials, on the promise of safety, gathered unsuspectingly in churches, schools, hospitals and local government buildings. In reality, this was a trap intended to lead to the rapid extermination of a large number of people. </p>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">111. The killing of Tutsi which henceforth spared neither women nor children, continued up to 18 July 1994, when the RPF triumphantly entered Kigali. The estimated total number of victims in the conflict varies from 500,000 to 1,000,000 or more.”</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in">The ICTR proceeded to consider whether the massacres which took place in Rwanda between April and July 1994 fell within the definition of genocide contained in the 1951 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (“the Genocide Convention”), which had been acceded to by Rwanda in 1975.  In doing so the ICTR gave further details of the facts:</p>
	    </blockContainer>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“114. Even though the number of victims is yet to be known with accuracy, no one can reasonably refute the fact that widespread killings were perpetrated throughout Rwanda in 1994. </p>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">115. Indeed, this is confirmed by the many testimonies heard by this Chamber. The testimony of Dr. Zachariah who appeared before this Chamber on 16 and 17 January 1997 is enlightening in this regard. Dr. Zachariah was a physician who at the time of the events was working for a non-governmental organisation, <span style="font-style:italic">‘Médecins sans frontières’</span>. In 1994 he was based in Butare and travelled over a good part of Rwanda upto its border with Burundi. He described in great detail the heaps of bodies which he saw everywhere, on the roads, on the footpaths and in rivers and, particularly, the manner in which all these people had been killed. At the church in Butare, at the Gahidi mission, he saw many wounded persons in the hospital who, according to him, were all Tutsi and who, apparently, had sustained wounds inflicted with machetes to the face, the neck, and also to the ankle, at the Achilles’ tendon, to prevent them from fleeing. The testimony given by Major-General Dallaire, former Commander of the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR) at the time of the events alleged in the Indictment, who was called by the defence, is of a similar vein. Major-General Dallaire spoke of troops of the Rwandan Armed Forces and of the Presidential Guard going into houses in Kigali that had been previously identified in order to kill. He also talked about the terrible murders in Kabgayi, very near Gitarama, where the interim Government was based and of the reports he received from observers throughout the country which mentioned killings in Gisenyi, Cyangugu and Kibongo. </p>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">116. The British cameraman, Simon Cox, took photographs of bodies in many churches in Remera, Biambi, Shangi, between Cyangugu and Kibuye, and in Bisesero. He mentioned identity cards strewn on the ground, all of which were marked ‘Tutsi’. Consequently, in view of these widespread killings the victims of which were mainly Tutsi, the Chamber is of the opinion that the first requirement for there to be genocide has been met, the killing and causing serious bodily harm to members of a group. </p>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">117. The second requirement is that these killings and serious bodily harm, as is the case in this instance, be committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a particular group targeted as such. </p>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">118. In the opinion of the Chamber, there is no doubt that considering their undeniable scale, their systematic nature and their atrociousness, the massacres were aimed at exterminating the group that was targeted. Many facts show that the intention of the perpetrators of these killings was to cause the complete disappearance of the Tutsi. In this connection, Alison Desforges, an expert witness, in her testimony before this Chamber on 25 February 1997, stated as follows: ‘on the basis of the statements made by certain political leaders, on the basis of songs and slogans popular among the Interahamwe, I believe that these people had the intention of completely wiping out the Tutsi from Rwanda so that - as they said on certain occasions - their children, later on, would not know what a Tutsi looked like, unless they referred to history books’. Moreover, this testimony given by Dr. Desforges was confirmed by two prosecution witnesses, witness KK and witness OO, who testified separately before the Tribunal that one Silas Kubwimana had said during a public meeting chaired by the accused himself that all the Tutsi had to be killed so that someday Hutu children would not know what a Tutsi looked like. </p>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">119. Furthermore, as mentioned above, Dr. Zachariah also testified that the Achilles tendons of many wounded persons were cut to prevent them from fleeing. In the opinion of the Chamber, this demonstrates the resolve of the perpetrators of these massacres not to spare any Tutsi. Their plan called for doing whatever was possible to prevent any Tutsi from escaping and, thus, to destroy the whole group. Witness OO further told the Chamber that during the same meeting, a certain Ruvugama, who was then a Member of Parliament, had stated that he would rest only when no single Tutsi is left in Rwanda. </p>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">120. Dr. Alison Desforges testified that many Tutsi bodies were often systematically thrown into the Nyabarongo river, a tributary of the Nile. Indeed, this has been corroborated by several images shown to the Chamber throughout the trial. She explained that the underlying intention of this act was to ‘send the Tutsi back to their place of origin’, to ‘make them return to Abyssinia’, in keeping with the allegation that the Tutsi are foreigners in Rwanda, where they are supposed to have settled following their arrival from the Nilotic regions. </p>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">121. Other testimonies heard, especially that of Major-General Dallaire, also show that there was an intention to wipe out the Tutsi group in its entirety, since even newborn babies were not spared. Even pregnant women, including those of Hutu origin, were killed on the grounds that the foetuses in their wombs were fathered by Tutsi men, for in a patrilineal society like Rwanda, the child belongs to the father's group of origin. In this regard, it is worthwhile noting the testimony of witness PP, heard by the Chamber on 11 April 1997, who mentioned a statement made publicly by the accused to the effect that if a Hutu woman were impregnated by a Tutsi man, the Hutu woman had to be found in order ‘for the pregnancy to be aborted’.”</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.54in">The Divisional Court<span style="font-style:italic"> in Brown and others</span> in 2008 and 2009 when it considered the independence of the judiciary relied on the Bizimungu case allied with the conclusions about the state of the polity in Rwanda.  The High Court also relied on the HRW report of 2008 and the evidence of Professors Reyntjens, Sands and Schabas and in particular on the acceptance by the GoR’s expert Professor Schabas that there was probably executive interference in the Bizimungu case to find evidence of specific positive incidents of judicial interference. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.54in">In 2014 to 2015, I must consider the implications of the trial of Ingabire which HRW found to be unfair.  I bear in mind of course that like Bizimungu, Ingabire was a politician.  She was planning on standing against President Kagame in the Presidential elections in 2010.  Her case was not a transfer or extradition case.  She was not tried by a Specialised Chamber of the High Court; Mutabazi another case relied upon by the defence, was tried by a military tribunal.  Most if not all the examples of unfair trials in Rwanda are in relation to political opponents of the GoR.  </p>

	      <num>521.</num>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.54in">The difference between her case and Bizimungu’s is that there is no evidence  of executive interference in her trial although there is other concerning evidence which I have set out above, evidence that led Amnesty to find that she had an unfair trial.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.54in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman Bold'">T</span>he ICTR Referral Chamber and Appeals Chamber and courts in other countries subsequently and the expert called by the GoR in these proceedings have drawn a distinction between what might be termed political trials and non-political cases.  None of those courts have accepted that there is evidence of executive interference in the judiciary trying allegations of genocide.  They have implicitly accepted that there is interference with the judiciary in political cases.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.54in">I find that opponents of the GoR do not appear to have fair trials in Rwanda.  The problem I have been wrestling with is whether the finding that the High Court does not try fairly those ‘political’ defendants means that these RPs will necessarily not be tried by independent and impartial judges sitting in this Specialized Chamber trying international and cross border crimes. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.54in">The various courts that have sent defendants back to Rwanda for trial and the GoR in this case too, rely on the argument that genocide cases are not political.  The argument from the defence is to the contrary.  The defence say the RPs had high profiles in 1994 and there is a current political will to have them convicted.  In Munyakazi, a pre 2009 case and a defendant who was not returned to Rwanda,  I noted that the ICTR Appeals Chamber described genocide cases as “<span style="font-style:italic">politically sensitive</span>” in the judgment at Paragraph 26. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.54in">I found that the RPs positions in 1994 were not that they were senior politicians on the national stage but within the local areas they were men of standing or importance in the community.  In his affidavit Ngoga has explained the significance of the <span style="font-style:italic">bourgmestres</span>.  Three of the RPs were <span style="font-style:italic">bourgmestres</span>.  There is some limited evidence that one of the RPs was a member of the Akazu, I find if he was, he was not a high profile one and the final RP was a director of an important company in the local area.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.54in">I do not find there is credible evidence that the RPs are political opponents to the GoR in 2015 and I do not find there is any persuasive evidence that the extradition request is driven by political considerations. </p>

	      <num>527.</num>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.54in">I find that the trials of these RPs, if they are returned, nevertheless will be high profile.  The expert witnesses, Dr Clark and Professors Reyntjens and Longman consider that they would be.  Mr Ngoga agreed that this extradition case has a high profile in Rwanda and there was a strong adverse reaction in Rwanda when the High Court in London in 2009 overruled the 2008 district judge’s order referring the case to the Secretary of State.  I would anticipate that an extradition order made in this country would be widely reported in Rwanda and such media attention would continue through any trial in the High Court in Rwanda. The GoR will use the return of the RPs as examples to show that the State’s justice system is recognised internationally as a system which can try defendants fairly.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.54in">What <span style="font-style:italic">Brown and others</span> lacked in 2008 and 2009 was the significant evidence of the trials of the five men transferred or extradited to Rwanda.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.54in">I have read the extensive monitors’ reports and summarised them above. I have also been provided with extensive summaries of decisions given by the High Court in relation to the five transferred, in particular Uwinkindi.  I have had the benefit of Witteveen’s comments about the trials.  I do not agree with the contention of Miss Ellis at her Submissions Page 32, Paragraph 74, that an analysis of the proceedings of the five transferred cases “<span style="font-style:italic">provides further evidence of a lack of judicial independence and impartiality in the face of deep unfairness to the defence</span>”. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.54in">I rely on the fact that in all the many pages of monitors’ reports there is no recurring theme of complaint about the judges’ lack of independence.  In relation to the decisions of the judges there is no evidence in those records of any partiality or anything untowards.  I suppose it is arguable that interference might not be picked up by the monitors but a lack of independence or fairness would be.  I appreciate the following comment relates to procedural issues only but I was struck by the even handedness of the judges when confronted with, for example, applications for adjournments by the defence.  The ICTR monitors make it clear that any defence request for an adjournment is considered carefully by the court and reasonably dealt with (usually the adjournment is granted).  Apart from the problem of representation, and it is difficult to know what the court could do about that, the court’s approach seems to be fair.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.54in">I am concerned, of course, about the effect on judges of comments made by the President and ministers about the guilt of these RPs in the sort of autocratic State that I have found Rwanda to be.  The GoR seems not to respect the presumption of innocence and that might put pressure on the judges if there was no international judge amongst them.  I accepted however the evidence from Professors Longman and Reyntjens, for example, that the quality of the judiciary has been increasing gradually in Rwanda and I have heard nothing which suggests that they are not able to ignore comments made by the President and others in non political cases.  Dr Clark’s evidence was that the most important developments had taken place since <span style="font-style:italic">Brown and others</span> and a number of reforms had been prompted by criticisms made by the ICTR and other jurisdictions.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.54in">The Divisional Court considered it was difficult to consider the independence of judges in the absence of a consideration of the State from which they come.  I have set out my findings about the State at Paragraphs 221 onwards.  I also, however, noted Dr Clark’s evidence that while he accepted there may be justified concerns about political developments in Rwanda, they “<span style="font-style:italic">do not inherently impinge on the delivery of justice for genocide suspects…we must recognize that the Rwandan judiciary to a large extent has a life of its own and must be evaluated in terms of judicial performance and concrete evidence from trials…The Rwandan judiciary has displayed a marked dedication to ensuring the fair trial of extradited suspects and taken concrete measures to fulfil the “checklist” criteria</span>.”.   His view was echoed by Martin Witteveen who had observed a number of hearings and had investigated the independence of the judiciary.  He had no concerns.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.54in">The ‘sea changes’ relied upon by the GoR which I have set out at Paragraph 11-29 inclusive at the beginning of this judgment, would be more significant if there was evidence they were affecting trials in practice.  As far as the independence of the judiciary is concerned the only change which appears to have bedded in is the amendment to the Transfer Law in 2009 that allows three or more judges to be designated to try complex and important cases.  All five of the transferred or extradited defendants in Rwanda either have been tried or are being tried by three judges in the Specialised Chamber of the High Court.  I find their number, of course, makes interference less likely.</p>

	      <num>534.</num>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.54in">One of the new provisions relied upon by Mr Ngoga is the amendment to Rwandan law of 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2011 allowing for international judges to come and try transfer and extradition cases alongside Rwandan judges.  This could be at the request of the accused, his lawyer or the prosecution from Rwanda or elsewhere.  The President of the Supreme Court would decide on the application.  Although Ngoga said in his affidavit that there was no reason why the application would not be granted, Dr Clark thought it unlikely.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.54in">Rwanda is rightly proud of the improvements to its judicial system since the majority of judges and lawyers were killed in 1994.  I am not so sure that an independent country like Rwanda would accept a non Rwandan judge coming in to try one of their genocide cases. I did not accept Ngoga’s evidence and agreed with Dr Clark that Rwanda is a proud country and would no doubt feel patronized if they had to accommodate a foreign judge in these circumstances.  The GoR would find such a move “<span style="font-style:italic">politically unpalatable because of a spirit of self-reliance and independence</span>” as Dr Clark put it.  In any event there is no evidence that any of the returned accused have been aware of the change in the law or if aware that they have applied for an international judge, let alone one being granted.  It must be said were a judge with international experience to sit on any of the RPs trials that would reduce still further any remaining concerns I have in relation to the independence of the judiciary.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.54in">There was no real reason for me to doubt the GoR’s evidence that the acquittal rate is around 20 to 30% in the High Court whilst in the gacaca Courts it had been around 25%.  I accepted that of 238 High Court decisions that were reviewed by the Supreme Court, 219 were upheld (evidence conveniently summarized in the Prosecution Closing Submissions at Page 32, Paragraph 120).   Unfortunately there was no information about the acquittal rate in genocide trials.  Dr Clark, however, did report on a positive note that of a number of genocide defendants that HRW was concerned about in their 2008 report, Law and Reality, three including Biseruka and Twagrimungu were later acquitted.</p>

Reforms since 2003 ensure that candidates for the judiciary take an exam and have to have a law degree and six years’ post qualification experience for the High Court.  The three highest office holders in the Supreme Court and the two highest in the High Court are appointed by Presidential Order but this is approved by the Senate.</p>

He explained the official narrative is that all those who were involved in senior leadership are guilty of genocide.  Although he left the county in 2004 he had been responsible for putting the list of judges together after the introduction of the new constitution and knew the way the system of appointments worked.  He was a measured, credible and impressive witness and Dr Clark accepted he was a respected academic.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.54in">Edward Fitzgerald QC relies on an amendment to the Rwandan Constitution which he says may affect the independence of the judges and this is that since 2008 judges of the High and Supreme Courts are no longer appointed for life but are appointed for a determinate term which is renewable by the High Council of the Judiciary.  This had not emerged by the time of the appeal to the Divisional Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Brown and others</span> (Appendix F, Paragraphs 80 onwards - Decisions on Transfer to Rwanda since 2006).  I accept that security of tenure should ensure independence and impartiality but I find there is no evidence that the change to removal on the grounds of serious professional misconduct or incompetence is being used by the High Council of the Judiciary to remove judges for bringing in the wrong verdicts.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.54in">I noted on a positive note that transparency and fair decisions would be encouraged by the requirement that provided for all hearings to be in public.  The requirement to give reasons for decisions is also protective so it was unfortunate that the defence were unable to find very many cases reported on the internet.  Miss Ellis at Annex 1 to EN’s Reply to GoR Submissions, sets out a chronology of requests made to the GoR in relation to statistics but more particularly judgments emanating from the High Court of Rwanda in genocide cases.  There is fortunately a mass of material now in relation to the five transferred men, particularly in the Rebuttal Material produced by Ms Kabasinga.  Before that only four judgments were found by Miss Ellis and her team. I found it concerning that a witness for the GoR could find the judgments with apparent ease whilst the thorough research by the defence team could not.   </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.54in">I noted that ICTR cases are monitored and there is a mechanism for the return of the defendant in certain circumstances.  Dr Clark was of the view that observation of cases by a wide range of bodies, such as HRW etc has a positive effect.  It sends out a message that the judiciary must operate in a fair and transparent manner.  I am sure that is helpful for all the parties to keep such cases in the international eye.  I would feel more confident in this case if there were such a mechanism in the extradition arrangements with Rwanda.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.54in">Amongst the NGO evidence I was particularly concerned by the Bertelsmann Stiftung Transformation Index 2014 Report which covered a period from January 2011 to January 2013, I have set out what it says at Paragraph 190 of this judgment but I will repeat it here: although the judiciary is formally independent, “<span style="font-style:italic">in reality it is subordinated to the will of the executive in all politically sensitive matters</span>”.  It describes a biased judicial system which enables prosecutions for offences such as genocide ideology to take place and political verdicts result particularly in relation in trials of opposition leaders and critical journalists.  The comments various political authorities think it appropriate to make in relation to on-going genocide trials lead me to have concerns that if returned these defendants would be facing the same.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.54in">The Divisional Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Brown and others</span> wanted evidence from genocide cases being tried in the Rwandan High Court.  I have heard that evidence. The evidence of trials taking place is more current, contemporaneous and detailed than the evidence from experts and others who through no fault of their own have been unable to go to Rwanda for a number of years. Whether it was via the ICTR monitors’ reports, through the judgments of the courts provided by Ms Kabasinga or through Mr Witteveen’s evidence which was particularly helpful, I have been able to see how the judiciary involved in similar high profile genocide cases of transferred defendants are making their decisions.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.54in">Most significantly, Mr Witteveen had been a witness to some of these hearings.  What he had not seen he had read about in the notes the legal officer of the Dutch Embassy had made.  He had had a great deal of experience investigating allegations of genocide before his current tenure in the NPPA.  He had not seen any credible evidence that any authorities had interfered specifically in cases of genocide, nor had he seen any evidence that judges had lost their independence, neutrality and objectivity. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.54in">To conclude, I am drawing a distinction between the way the Rwandan High Court tries cases with a political flavour and the way they try genocide allegations.  This is based on the clear evidence I have seen about the approach taken by the Specialised Chamber towards the five transferred genocide cases.  Having considered all the evidence, I cannot exclude a risk of interference but judging from the transferred defendants the highest risk is from the pressure exerted by GoR ministers’ comments in public and in the press.  I consider any such risk would be reduced by a robust, able and experienced defence team with an ability to investigate the defence case and international monitoring of some sort.  I consider that without both of these the RPs would be at a greater risk of judges behaving partially and being influenced by factors outside the evidence. </p>
