		  <span style="font-size:8pt">There is terminological confusion in all immigration cases since all applications and decisions are made in the name of the SSHD and most claims and cases name the SSHD as the defendant. However, the correct defendant is the Home Office which is the department responsible for immigration and, until recently, all immigration business was in the hands of the UK Border Agency which was an autonomous section of the Home Office. In this judgment, all references to the body responsible for immigration are referred to as “the SSHD” by which is meant the SSHD in her personal capacity and/or the Home Office and/or the UKBA. The SSHD is referred to as such even if the document being quoted or referred to uses the description “Home Office”. See further paragraph 22</span>

This application was made on a SET (M) form appropriate under the Immigration Rules (“IRs”) for an application for settlement by a spouse where his wife was present and had already settled in the UK. He and Laila had signed the form on 2 June 2004 and Yasin had sent it to the SSHD on 12 August 2004 where it was received on 16 August 2004.

A charged application was one for which the appropriate payment had been both paid by the applicant and received by the SSHD. There was no definition of a linked application in the IRs but it is clear from the way that both applications were subsequently dealt with that they had been marked as being linked following a decision by the case worker who had initially processed them that they should always be considered together and that any decision in one of these three cases should always be taken at the same time as the corresponding decision in each of the other two cases. </span>

Yasin and Yakub’s application was decided in two separate decisions dated 9 October 2014 which were served two weeks later. Yasin was granted ILR and Yakub was initially granted one day’s LTR but the SSHD subsequently acknowledged that this grant was a mistake and was in fact for thirty months discretionary leave to remain (“DLR”) outside the IRs. Yusuf’s application was refused in a decision dated 13 November 2014 as part of a composite decision which also ordered his deportation and refused his human rights claim that it was disproportionate to deport him.</span>

On 29 May 2013, the SSHD’s acknowledgement of service and summary defence sought the dismissal of each claim since it had by then agreed to consider “the claimant’s (sic) application” and, absent special circumstances, to make a decision in each case within six months. It was accepted by the SSHD at the hearing that that wording was mistaken and that it should in fact be referring to all three applications. Permission to apply for judicial review was granted by Ms Elizabeth Laing QC sitting as a deputy High Court judge on 23 July 2013 on the grounds that it was well arguable that the lengthy delay in deciding each application was unlawful and that the SSHD had not made an offer to pay the claimants’ costs.</span>

Two of these decisions, to deport him and to refuse his human rights claim, were the subject of an in-time appeal to the First-tier Tribunal (“FtT”) whereas the third decision to refuse his ILR application was not since it carried no right of appeal. However, following the service of Yusuf’s notice of appeal, Yusuf’s legal team discovered that the relevant provisions of the Immigration Act 2014 (“IA 2014”) had come into force on 20 October 2014 and are applicable to Yusuf’s appeal since the relevant decision being appealed post-dated the commencement of those provisions of the IA 2014. As a result, Yusuf is not able to challenge his deportation order in an appeal to the FtT so that his appeal is now confined to his challenge the decision on human rights grounds.   </span>

Yasin and Laila’s marriage became strained at some point prior to their departure from Kenya, possibly as a result of or exacerbated by this racial discrimination, and they separated or at least lived separate lives. Yasin’s evidence given in his subsequent asylum application after he  had arrived in the UK was that he had been persecuted, harassed by locals, verbally abused and the object of stone throwing  and in June 1999 his car had been attacked for ethnic reasons. By 1999, Laila found it impossible to obtain employment and her permission to remain in Kenya as a BOC had become precarious because it was liable to be revoked if her marriage to Yasin broke down irretrievably and was in any event conditional on her and her husband continuing to live in Kenya.

	      <span style="font-size:10pt">Laila, Yusuf and Yakub first went to stay with a family friend on their arrival in the UK and then with Laila’s sister and then with her brother who was living in Reading. Laila found a 3-bedroom house to rent in Wokingham after a few weeks and she obtained her first job in England working as an auxiliary nurse in the Royal Berkshire Hospital. Yusuf and Yakub attended the Maiden Early Secondary School in Reading, Yusuf joining in Year 10 and Yakub in year 8. Yusuf never settled at school and by late 2000 he was truanting regularly. However, he joined the RAF cadets and excelled in that activity. Meanwhile, Yakub did well at school.</span>

There is no document showing which Directorate received this application but it was likely that it was the ICD which was the Directorate that received Laila’s asylum application. A new principal file was established for Yasin and this application was also referred to the ICD to be considered. Although his application and its principal file were wholly separate from Laila’s application and principal file, its contents made it clear that it was linked to and closely associated with Laila’s application. </span>

On 29 January 2001, his asylum application was refused on the basis that he had come to England in an attempt to patch up his and Laila’s differences rather than as a result of his well-found fear of racial persecution. As a result of this letter and Yusuf’s difficulties in settling in England, his truanting and his inability to find employment, Laila re-established contact with Yasin, they patched up their differences and their marriage resumed. Yusuf started to stay with him at weekends. He left school in June 2001 but was unable to join the RAF as a trainee given his lack of immigration status or to find a job.

On 19 March 2002, Laila’s MP wrote to the SSHD on her behalf and in support of her claim and stated that she had left Kenya because she had separated from her husband, that her right to reside in Kenya depended on her living with her husband in Kenya and that he had ceased to reside there.

Instead, it was contended on his behalf that he had established a private and family life in the UK and it would be disproportionate to remove him. The adjudicator dismissed his appeal on the grounds that it would be proportionate to require Yasin to return to Kenya and apply from there to join his wife in the UK given the shortness of the period during which he had established article 8 rights. </span>

The disclosed documents did not include the refusal letter so that it was impossible to ascertain the SSHD’s grounds for that refusal. However, it was possible to see that an application was made on Yakub’s behalf that that refusal should be reconsidered. It was not possible to ascertain whether Yusuf’s application was refused at the same time since the relevant documents have been lost or have not been disclosed but it must have been refused and that refusal must have been reconsidered at the same time as Yakub’s application was refused and reconsidered since the SSHD would not have decided and reconsidered one of the brother’s applications separately from its consideration of the other’s.

If these conditions were met, the BOC was entitled to British citizenship and the SSHD had no discretion to refuse to register that person as a British citizen. Since Laila had applied for registration under section 4B and had not lost any other citizenship or nationality, the SSHD was obliged to grant her British citizenship. This change in the law was particularly intended to provide a solution for those such as her who were BOCs who had been living in Kenya but who had lost the right to reside there and who were, in consequence, effectively stateless unless they were able to settle in the UK. </span>

The nature and timing of this request suggests strongly that the caseworker was minded to grant Yakub ILR. On 26 May 2004, the CCU as part of that security check sent an enquiry to the Immigration and Nationality Enquiry Bureau (“INEB”) about Yakub’s current immigration status and on 4 July 2004 the INEB informed the CCU that Yakub was an overstayer but that he had an outstanding application for LTR that had not yet been finally resolved.</span>

Since the relevant files have been lost, it is not possible to ascertain any further details about the nature and extent of the SSHD’s consideration of these LTR and ILR applications. I conclude that Yusuf and Yakub’s original claims for LTR dated 22 January 2002 were treated by the unit considering them as having been superseded by their claims for ILR and settlement that were based on Laila’s British citizenship and that these ILR and settlement claims were never subsequently decided or withdrawn.</span>

He therefore lived in the family home with Yasin and assisted him in his car repair business once he had left school in the summer of 2003.

Once that consideration started, the caseworker who was undertaking it realised that Laila would be a direct beneficiary of that new statutory once it came into force. At that point, she became entitled to British citizenship, to be registered as a British citizen and to settle in the UK. The SSHD informed her of that entitlement in early March 2003 and invited her to submit an application for British citizenship. She prepared and submitted an application and as part of it also made or was to taken to have made an application for ILR on behalf of her two sons as her dependants. However, although the SSHD received and her application on 16 May 2003, she was only informed that it had been accepted when she received her registration certificate from the SSHD dated 13 October 2003. </span>

Furthermore, he had been arrested on or about 2 March 2003 on suspicion of having committed GBH and assault and for being involved in an affray on 2 March 2003. There is, however, no evidence of the SSHD’s consideration of Yusuf’s applications or of how it would have decided it in the light of his being an adult who had been charged with GBH and affray. It is obvious however that his first application was refused in December 2002 and that that refusal decision was withdrawn by the SSHD, that his first and/or second applications were considered or reconsidered during 2003 at the same time as Yakub’s applications were considered or reconsidered and that no decisions were ever taken in relation to either application. </span>

Only limited evidence about the circumstances of these offences was adduced at the trial but such as was adduced had been known to the SSHD when it took the decision to refuse Yusuf’s application in November 2014. That evidence contained little detail about the nature and circumstances of his offences, of his mitigation or of his current criminal propensities or risk to the public. The evidence that was available showed that he had spent a period time on remand in custody and to have entered guilty pleas at some stage. He was sentenced for GBH, affray and two counts of assault and was given an eighteen-month sentence</span>

He was entitled to release after serving half his sentence but it is likely that he was released earlier by the prison Governor for his good mitigation and behaviour since he was released four and a half months before he had reached the halfway point in his sentence. There was, however, no evidence of how his release date was arrived at. The SSHD never attempted to obtain further details of his offence or the nature and seriousness of his offending behaviour and his mitigation or to obtain copies of relevant documents that would reveal these significant facts. In particular, no attempt has ever been made to obtain a copy of the judge’s sentencing remarks, Yusuf’s pre-sentence report or the witness statements served by the prosecution before his trial. </span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt;color:#000000">Since the SSHD never attempted to ascertain the basis of sentence, it is only possible to reach conclusions as to the mitigation that applied to Yusuf’s case by taking judicial notice of the matters that  a sentencing judge had to take account of and the sentencing guidelines that he had to take as his starting point. It is clear therefore that the sentencing judge must have considered that the nature of Yusuf’s offences was such that a lenient view should be taken about them. The sentencing guidelines in force in August 2004 provided that the starting point for his sentence should have been four years for the GBH. For the affray, charged under section 3 of the Public Order Act, the maximum sentence for affray charged on indictment was three years unless the affray created a significant risk of serious harm. However, given the relatively light sentence that appears to have been passed, it would seem that the affray was only charged on indictment because it was linked to a charge of GBH which had to be charged on indictment. Had Yusuf’s offence of affray been such that it had been charged on its own, it seems likely that it would have been tried summarily by the magistrates and that the maximum sentence that would have been passed would have been a non-custodial community order. </span>

These factors would have led to a discount from the starting point for his sentence but unless there were further mitigating circumstances, the final sentence would still have been significantly in excess of eighteen months in prison. </span>

Given what is known of the circumstances and background to the offences for which he was sentenced, those factors appear to have included the fact that he had been provoked by offensive racial abuse, did not initiate the violent incident, was on the edge of the affray, was not considered to have been part of a joint enterprise and showed genuine remorse</span>

He stated that the target date statement in the acknowledgement letters could conceivably have meant that the SSHD would look at the applications in a timely manner but would not necessarily make a decision on them.

However, this was not explained to them and the existence of this difficulty only came to light when the SSHD disclosed the relevant note on the GCID log in 2014. Yusuf was released from prison on licence on 7 March 2005. He met his son for the first time and found that his partner was pregnant with another child by another man who had refused to have any involvement with this child. However, their relationship resumed and he agreed that he would accept parental responsibility for this child, a boy, who was born on 13 November 2005. </span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt">The SSHD provided no evidence to explain why these two applications were dealt with as enforcement cases when they were in fact settlement cases that were linked to a British citizenship settlement case or whether the thirteen-week estimate of the time within which these applications would be determined was reasonable at the time that it was given. Furthermore, there was no explanation as to why the SSHD did not notify Yasin, Yusuf and Yakub that the original estimate had to be revised or give them a revised long-stop date for the decisions in their cases. It is clear from the SSHD’s letter that provided this estimate that it was based on current working experience within the MM section. If the unit to which the applications had been assigned was experiencing work-flow difficulties, a new and realistic end-date should have been provided and the applicants should immediately have been informed of that new date. There is therefore no evidence to displace the assumption that the failure to take decisions in these two applications by 20 December 2004 occurred because of the inefficient way that the SSHD was processing applications being considered by the MM section at that time and, possibly, to a small degree, because of an increased work flow created by increase in the number of enforcement cases that were arriving within the MM section. It was also caused by the SSHD’s failures to reach decisions in all three of the Saids’ cases in 2003 and in not referring their 2002 applications to the same Directorate as was dealing with Laila’s citizenship application and then linking all their applications together to be decided by that Directorate. </span>

As a result, the ACD undertook a trawl through its records to identify those who appeared to qualify for this one-off grant of ILR and in the period after August 2004 it contacted all potentially eligible family asylum seekers that that trawl disclosed. Laila’s asylum application dated 3 December 1999 was unearthed in about January 2005, possibly as a result of the SSHD’s receipt of Yasin and Yakub’s applications for ILR and settlement on 1 September 2004, and she was written to on about 4 February 2005 and invited to claim asylum for herself and her two sons. The letter enclosed a family questionnaire on which the DHSS had inserted a requirement that it had to be filled out and returned to the ACD by 16 March 2005 and had inaccurately described Laila as being a “British National (Overseas)”. She was in fact a “British Overseas Citizen” at the time of her asylum application but had been granted British citizenship by the Directorate or section within the IND dealing with nationality and citizenship sixteen months before the ACD wrote to her in early February 2005.</span>

That phrase was used as a generic description to describe the newly introduced procedure for facilitating a family group that had claimed asylum and who wished to settle as a family in the UK.  The group had to have included at least one child and must have arrived in the UK before October 2003 and then have claimed asylum and must have continued to reside and still be residing in the UK in 2003. The intention of the policy was to speed up the process of obtaining settlement for those, including those whose asylum applications had failed but who were still living in the UK, who had been living in the UK for some time and whose child or children had settled to the way of life in the UK to apply for ILR and settlement. It was therefore appropriate to describe the situation in this case where all four family members of the Said family had made what on the facts of their case was a single composite family application for asylum albeit that that family application had been made by Laila’s and Yasin’s separate asylum applications on and dated respectively 6 October 1999 and 3 December 1999.</span>

It would seem that Yusuf’s application, filed on his virtual sub-file S1028806, was also sent to the WIP hold. The GCID entry that recorded this temporary move stated that unit LSCU 6 would call for the files from the WIP hold as staff were available to deal with them and that any previous instruction about the cases having to be resolved within thirteen weeks could be ignored. The entry also stated that in the event of another unit calling for the file but not actually dealing with the application, the file should be returned to the WIP hold and that the GCID had to be updated with any decision reached. Yasin and Yusuf were not notified of the changed instruction that the thirteen-week timetable was being ignored due to the backlog of work. This transfer of Yasin’s file to the GCID hold shows that it had not been transferred to the ACD, being that part of the IND dealing with the family exercise, as it should have been so as to be considered with Laila’s and Yasin’s successive family exercise applications.

The earlier application letter had not been dealt with. A caseworker in unit DTS2 was deputed to respond to this letter and that caseworker noted on GCID that he had not been able to read any notes relating to that application since none had been noted on GCID. He then replied to Yasin’s solicitors on 19 December 2005 with a standard family exercise letter that enclosed a family exercise questionnaire with Yasin’s name filled in as the main applicant. The questionnaire was returned by his solicitors on 9 January 2006. On 11 January 2006, Yasin’s MP wrote to the MP’s correspondence address at the SSHD with a request to expedite its consideration of his file. On 17 January 2006, the ACD sent a second copy of the family exercise questionnaire to Yasin’s solicitors, presumably because it was unaware of its receipt of his answers to the first copy of the questionnaire. His MP’s letter was answered by the Director General of the IND on 30 January 2006 who stated that the IND hoped to have completed consideration of “the majority of cases” being processed by the family exercise teams by the end of April 2006.

That caseworker filled out the checklist that was used by caseworkers screening family exercise ILR applications to determine whether they qualified with this disqualifying factor which was the only one to be ticked: “The applicant’s dependant … has failed PNC.” This annotation showed that the SSHD had given family exercise caseworkers instructions to disqualify a family application if its main or any dependent applicant had an unspent conviction, certainly one as serious as GBH although it is not clear whether that instruction included minor convictions such as traffic offences. It was clearly lawful for the relevant policy to require an applicant with an unspent conviction to be disqualified from the fast tracking involved in the family exercise but its existence and scope were   not published by the SSHD as they should have been.

The ACD’s decision letter dated 30 June 2006 asserted that this was the case but this was an illogical and disproportionate stipulation since the application could be resubmitted with the dependant with a  criminal conviction having been omitted from it. Since this aspect of the admissibility criteria was not set out in any publically available or disclosed document, I conclude that this interpretation of the policy was no more than an unjustified internal unlawful unpublished direction. Thus, only Yusuf’s name should have been removed from the application so that consideration of both Yasin’s and Yakub’s applications continued and the applications were decided under the family exercise. </span>

It is also notable that the only ground for disqualifying Yasin’s application was that Yusuf had unspent convictions so that the caseworker accepted that the application was one that otherwise qualified for consideration for the grant of ILR to those included in it. In other words, the application was accepted to be one that was based on a previous family application for asylum even though this had been made in two separate but linked applications that had both been made prior to 2 October 2000. </span>

There did not appear to be any reason for the caseworker to refuse to grant both of them ILR and the right to settle in the UK under the family exercise as Laila’s dependants. </span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt">The whole period amounted to a delay in the determination of the immigration status of Yasin, Yusuf and Yakub. Their cases should have been decided before Laila was invited to apply for consideration under the family exercise. Moreover, she should never have been invited to apply if the SSHD decision was correct that she was not eligible due to her having been granted citizenship. Furthermore, having applied, her application and Yasin’s application should have succeeded in both Yasin and Yakub being granted ILR under the family exercise. This did not occur because of an obvious and significant error by a number of caseworkers in their application of the terms of the family exercise to the facts of their case. Yusuf’s case was delayed by it initially being erroneously transferred to the family exercise when it was already known to the SSHD that he had convictions for GBH and affray. Instead, his case should have remained for consideration for ILR with the unit it had been assigned to in September 2004 in the light of his claimed dependency, his convictions and whether it was proportionate to remove him given his mitigation, remorse and rehabilitation.    </span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt;color:#000000">The delay between 19 December 2004 and 28 November 2006 was caused by the erroneous decision in January 2005 to invite the Said family to apply to be considered under the family exercise and by the subsequent erroneous decisions taken in deciding that none of them were eligible for consideration under that exercise. Superimposed onto those errors was the erroneous decision taken by a Managed Migration caseworker when deciding to treat the 1 September 2004 applications as being subject to the legacy process which was then being set up and directing their transfer to the CRD. The cases were not legacy cases since they did not fall within its terms of reference. Moreover, they had already been transferred to and were being processed by the ACD under the family exercise and as a result should not have been considered for legacy transfer by the MM section at all. A third error was the failure of Managed Migration, having decided that Yasin, Yusuf and Yakub’s cases were legacy cases, then to inform ACD of the need to transfer the applications to the legacy process or to inform the relevant unit within the ACD that it should cease its consideration of them. Finally, neither of the relevant units in the MM section or the ACD concerned with the Said family’s various applications logged what they were doing onto the GCID so that each unit’s actions did not come to the attention of the other one. </span>

Unfortunately, their eventual transfer occurred just as the reconsideration of the Saids’ cases under the family exercise had reached the point when their grant of ILR or DLR under the family exercise appeared to be imminent. A final difficulty was that the further progress of these cases was clearly hampered by the loss of their files which came to light in September 2007 but knowledge of that loss was then buried from view so that no-one else became aware of the loss until 2014.   </span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt;color:#000000">   The decision to transfer consideration of Yasin, Yusuf and Yakub’s cases to the legacy process was erroneous because neither their 1 September 2004 applications nor any previous application after their initial claims for asylum were legacy cases. This was because, although Laila on behalf of Yusuf and Yakub and Yasin on his own behalf had initially made asylum applications which had failed, their positions had changed dramatically once Laila acquired British citizenship. After that had occurred, their subsequent applications for ILR were exclusively based on their dependency on her status as a settled British citizen who was present in the UK. They were, therefore, no longer to be regarded as failed or unresolved asylum seekers but as dependants of a settled British citizen. The transfer decision was disastrous for them since it led to a further delay of seven years whilst their cases languished in the legacy process until they were transferred again, this time to the Older Live Cases Unit (“OLCU”), on 11 September 2013. </span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt;color:#000000">   The cases were not immediately transferred to the Case Resolution Directorate (“CRD”) following the decision to transfer them. The CRD had been set up in 2006 to deal with outstanding and failed asylum applications using the legacy process and the transfer decision was not communicated to the relevant parts of the ACD family exercise process for some months. In the meantime, the relevant family exercise unit made an applicant background check of Yusuf’s PNC on 31 January 2007 which showed, as noted on the GCID also dated 31 January 2007, that he had failed the PNC check. It is likely that a check was also done on Yasin since an internal Applicant Background Check sheet dated 31 January 2007 recorded that a negative check of Yasin’s PNC had been made. The note on the GCID for 31 January 2007 also stated that the file, being file S1028806, had been transferred to the refusal hold. It is to be inferred that what was meant by this laconic reference was that Yasin’s principal file contained as a physical sub-file in Laila’s principal file and the relevant physical and virtual sub-files of Laila’s principal file had been transferred to the refusal hold. However, despite the suggestion that there had been a transfer of files to the refusal hold, there is no record of a refusal decision ever having been made nor that such a decision was ever communicated to Yusuf. It is, however, to be noted that his case was not referred to the CCD despite his adverse PNC and there is no evidence to suggest that this non-transfer arose for any other reason than that the file-holder considered that his criminal record was not serious enough to be considered for deportation.</span>

He had, as he put it, got involved with the wrong crowd.  In this period, he was convicted of two offences of being in possession of prohibited drugs. These were his first two convictions and at the time that he committed these offences he was nineteen years old. His first conviction was on 4 May 2007 for possession of cocaine for which the magistrates imposed a fine of £180 and a forfeiture and destruction of drugs order. His second conviction was on 21 July 2007 for possession of cannabis for which the magistrates imposed a fine of £150 and costs of £70.00 and a forfeiture and destruction of drugs order.   </span>

Following that check, a note was made by a member of Team 67 of the family exercise team that Yusuf had been considered for the family exercise but that he did not meet the criteria for the family exercise as these criteria stood before 12 June 2006 and that his application would fall to be reconsidered at some point in the future under the amended criteria. A GCID entry for 2 October 2007 stated that Yakub had failed the PNC check. There was no evidence about the terms of the change in the family exercise criteria but it is clear that Yusuf’s convictions were considered for the third time and, although these again disqualified him from consideration under the family exercise, his case and convictions were, again for the third time, considered to be insufficiently serious to be referred to the CCD</span>

This arrest was brought to the attention of the SSHD since the police search had revealed that Yakub was an overstayer. He was served with an immigration detention notice. He was bailed by the police on 5 April 2010 and was then released from temporary immigration detention that he had been subjected to following his arrest. On 11 May 2010, Yakub was convicted by the magistrates’ court of being in possession of cannabis and of criminal damage of Nassim’s property. The magistrates imposed two community orders with separate requirements of 80 hours of unpaid work on Yakub and made a forfeiture and destruction of drugs order relating to the cannabis that had been seized. </span>

The letter requested an update of the consideration of their applications following the submission of photographs and a completed IND SAL2 form on 18 January 2011. Soon afterwards on 26 August 2011, the CAAU replied stating:</span>

This letter appears to have alerted the caseworker who had previously decided that Yasin should be granted DLR to the fact that his case was linked with those of his two sons. As a result, nothing further was done to implement the decision in Yasin’s since it was appreciated that the cases of all three had to be decided together. As a result, on 17 May 2012 the caseworker requested PNC checks to be carried out on both sons even though these had already been sought and obtained for each of them on at least three previous occasions.</span>

In consequence, the solicitors wrote a chasing pre-action protocol letter dated 27 July 2012 threatening an application for judicial review unless Yasin and his dependants were granted LTR in line with what the letter described as the legacy criteria. This in turn produced a standard holding reply from the CAAU dated 31 August 2012 that stated that the decisions in relation Yasin and his dependants’ applications submitted on 1 September 2004 would be concluded “in due course”.

Yasin’s application, on the other hand, was for settlement as the dependent spouse of a settled British citizen which had to be determined the part of the UKBA concerned with settlement, citizenship and nationality.  </span>

The CAAU was chased by Yasin’s solicitors on 9 August 2011 which led to the CAAU writing to Yasin’s solicitors and informing them that it had now reviewed his case – and therefore by inference the linked cases of Yakub and Yusuf – and subject to final security checks its decision was to grant him LTR in line with the current IRs.

	      <span style="font-size:10pt">The three cases contained in the two applications dated 1 September 2004 should never have been transferred to the legacy process. The SSHD’s erroneous decision to do so occurred because the various caseworkers concerned with taking and implementing that decision did not check the available files or the GCID to ascertain the Saids’ full immigration history and did not consider whether the cases fell within the legacy terms of reference or whether it was appropriate to transfer them from the family exercise process into the legacy process. These failings were in part caused by the loss of essential files and repeated failures to make appropriate log entries onto the GCID. The cases entered a black hole when they were transferred into the legacy process where they remained unnoticed and undecided for nearly seven years between 28 November 2006 and 11 September 2013. </span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt;color:#000000">The transfer of the cases to the legacy process was a serious error because Yasin, Yusuf and Yakub’s cases and their outstanding applications did not fall within the legacy terms of reference and were not therefore legacy cases at all. Laila on behalf of Yusuf and Yakub and Yasin on his own behalf had initially made asylum applications in 1999 which had failed However, their positions had changed dramatically once Laila acquired British citizenship and their subsequent applications for both the right to settle in the UK and for ILR were exclusively based on their dependency on her status as a settled British citizen who was present in the UK and with whom they were living. They were, therefore, no longer to be regarded as failed asylum seekers but as the spouse and dependants of a settled and resident British citizen. The transfer decision was disastrous for them since it led to a further delay of seven years starting in September 2007 whilst their cases languished in the legacy process until they were transferred again, this time to the OLCU based in Liverpool, on 11 September 2013. </span>

The OLCU was the appropriate unit for these applications to be transferred to since its function was to conclude very old outstanding live cases that did not belong to any other part of the IND.

The third period of delay from September 2013 until 9 May 2014 arose from the failure of the OLCU to start its consideration of these applications for 8 months after they had been transferred to it despite being instructed to decide them as a matter of urgency as soon as they had arrived in the OLCU. </span>

Although the caseworker who decided to submit Yusuf’s file to an EO to determine whether it should be sent to the CCD in Liverpool for that decision, the EO’s decision appears to have been taken without any knowledge of the five previous occasions that caseworkers in units concerned with the settlement and, family exercise applications and the legacy process had reviewed Yusuf’s criminal record and had decided not to refer his case to the CCD. That should have led the EO to consider whether this case had to be referred to the CCD in the light of those previous considerations. It is probable that these steps were not taken because the relevant information was not available to the caseworker because of the loss of vital files and the repeated failures to update the GCID and file accessibly copies of essential correspondence the so that this essential part of the history of both applications were not available to the caseworker.

The LO chased this request up with the CAAU who contacted the OLCU with a request to casework the applications as soon as possible. The OLCU responded with an assurance that they would be caseworked within a 3-month target (i.e. by 9 April 2014). In a subsequent discussion between the CAAU and OLCU 14 to whom the applications had been referred, it was agreed that the decisions would be provided by 6 August 2014. The CAAU posting revealed some misunderstanding of what had been transferred for decision in that it requested the OLCU to consider “the applicant’s (sic) outstanding charged application for LTR as a spouse and his asylum claim”. In fact, what had been transferred was neither a LTR application nor an asylum claim but his outstanding settlement application for ILR as the spouse of a settled British citizen and there had also been transferred both Yakub’s and Yusuf’s outstanding settlement applications for ILR as the dependants of that settled British citizens. </span>

On that date, the OLCU caseworker dealing with the applications wrote to Yasin’s solicitors and asked them to provide his photograph and other necessary documents needed for the consideration of his application. This was the fifth time of asking at least in the course of the protracted history of these settlement applications that a Directorate or unit had asked Yasin to provide photographs and the other documents that are required when an application for LTR or settlement is being considered. On each occasion, all three Saids complied promptly and fully with the request. The solicitors’ response was received by the caseworker on 16 May 2014. This pointed out that all three Saids’ applications were being considered by the OLCU. On receipt of this letter, the caseworker requested a copy of Yusuf’s PCN entry to add to the PCN entries for Yasin and Yakub which were by then in the file. This was received by the caseworker on 20 May 2014 who immediately noticed Yusuf’s 2004 convictions. He ceased work on both applications and referred Yusuf’s case to a more senior colleague who directed that it should be referred to the CCD. As a result, further work on Yasin’s application was put on hold. It is not clear what the basis of this suspension of work was and it ought to have been recorded on the GCID, but was not, why work on the case was being suspended and what should trigger a resumption of work. Presumably, it was intended that work should resume when either the CCD accepted the reference so that the linkage of the two applications was broken or it refused the reference and returned the case to the OLCU to resume the linked consideration of both applications.</span>

Initially, OLCU 14 arranged for the referred file relating to these applications to be obtained from hold 5 where it had been stored since its arrival in September 2013 from the legacy unit previously dealing with it. This was file S1028806/008 which was the only file that had been referred to the OLCU. On Thursday 2 October 2014, Mr David Wiggins, who was an EO in Migration Casework, Complex Case Directorate, was allocated the task of deciding and drafting the decisions for both applicants in Yasin’s application for OLCU 14 by the following Tuesday 7 October 2014 (i.e. within the week asked for by the LO’s email of 30 September 2014). He ascertained from the CCD that it had decided the previous week that Yusuf should be deported. He then rapidly considered the available papers in file S1028806/008 and reached the provisional conclusion that there was ample evidence for both Yasin and Yakub to be granted what he described as “residual ILR … given the errors … and substantial and demonstrable mishandling of the case by the SSHD … which have occurred … over a 10-year period”</span>

He was informed in these discussions that CCD caseworkers referred all spent convictions to the Chief Caseworker in the CCD for consideration as to whether to pursue deportation or removal and that the CCD was considering deportation of Yusuf as a separate matter. These discussions about Yakub’s case continued between Mr Wiggins and the two senior SSHD officials on 6 and 7 October 2014 during which Mr Wiggins was pressed for his decision by LO. On 8 October 2014, the SCW he was in touch with discussed Yakub’s case with the Chief SCW. The result of these various discussions was that Mr Wiggins was advised that he should decide Yasin’s and Yakub’s cases separately, that it was open to him to grant Yasin ILR outside the IRs having refused his application under the IRs and Yakub LTR outside the IRs for 30 months on account of his criminal offending. On 9 October 2014, Mr Wiggins finally decided that Yasin’s and Yakub’s applications under the IRs would be refused but that Yasin would be granted ILR outside the IRs and Yakub 30 months LTR outside the IRs, the difference being explained by Yakub’s criminal convictions. </span>

There was a five-month delay between the caseworker apparently starting the decision-making process and the publication of the decisions. There is no evidence that any effective work was undertaken on these two cases between May and early October 2014. They seem to have been held in abeyance awaiting a decision in Yusuf’s case by the CCD. Since the linkage between these two cases had been broken by the transfer of Yusuf’s case to the CCD on 25 June 2014, it could not have provided any justification for the delay, particularly given the assurances previously made that decisions would be made within six months. Remarkably, the entire decision-making process was undertaken over a period of six working days between 2 and 9 October 2014 after an overall delay of ten years five weeks. This hurried consideration of their applications was entirely caused by the wish to conclude the consideration and produce decisions prior to the judicial review hearing fixed for 16 October 2014 notwithstanding the failure to embark on that consideration prior to 2 October 2014.</span>

There is no evidence as to what files were sent to the CCD or what files, documents and GCID references were considered at any stage of the CCD’s involvement with Yusuf’s case. It would appear from its ultimate decision in his case that the principal document that was considered was Yusuf’s answers given during his interview on 1 September 2014 and his answers to the deportation questionnaire dated 22 October 2014. Thus, much relevant material that had been generated in the ten years during which his application had remained undecided and in the preceding five years since his arrival in the UK were not considered or taken into account.</span>

Its guidelines were not disclosed but it is clear that any conviction involving a custodial sentence fell within the ambit of the CCD and any conviction involving a non-custodial sentence did not. It would seem that  a reference where the immigrant had been subject to a custodial sentence was not mandatory and that caseworkers, certainly in the years prior to 2013, had a discretion as to whether to refer or not.</span>

In the early hours of the following morning a scuffle in the street occurred and although he was not involved in the scuffle, he and many others were arrested on suspicion of being involved in an affray. He was detained in Thorpe Wood police station in Peterborough, interviewed the following day and then released. There is no evidence to suggest that he was in any way involved in the criminal conduct that had led him to be arrested. It is standard practice for the police to carry out a computer search to check whether an arrested person is entitled to live or remain in the UK. This search in Yusuf’s case revealed that he was an overstayer with a criminal record who had served time in prison and had been released some years previously.

He therefore informed a duty officer at the Croydon CCD office that Yusuf was in police custody but was likely to be released imminently. Since his case had been the subject of an internal transfer from the CCD’s Croydon office to its Liverpool office, the Croydon CCD duty officer informed the Liverpool CCD duty officer that Yusuf was in police custody. This information caused the Liverpool CCD office temporary difficulties because it had yet not received Yusuf’s file and was unaware of the details of Yusuf’s case. Time was short because Thorpe Wood police station was about to release Yusuf under the PACE regulations unless he was taken into immigration detention. The upshot was that Croydon CCD, at Liverpool CCD’s request, arranged for an Immigration Officer (“IO”) to interview Yusuf in the police cells in order to obtain details about him that would be relevant in any subsequent consideration of his immigration status and case. It was also arranged that that IO would serve Yusuf with a Notice of Restriction notifying him that he was subject to restrictions as to residence, employment and reporting on his release from the police station and that the Croydon office would transfer Yusuf’s file to the Liverpool office as a matter of urgency. </span>

On 4 September 2014, the Litigation Operations (“LO”) caseworker concerned with his case contacted Liverpool CCD and asked whether the CCD could take a decision as a matter of urgency in Yasin’s and Yakub’s linked cases ‘irrespective of the fact that Yusuf ‘is subject to a deportation order’. The email described Yusuf’s case as ‘a release case’ – that is in CCD terms a case where the subject has served a custodial sentence but has since been released from prison – which ‘meets the deportation criteria’. It also stated that Yusuf was along with his father and one other dependant were making a JR challenge to the delay in making a decision in their ‘LTR and asylum applications’ and that the consideration of both applications had been halted upon the discovery of ‘the conviction [of Yusuf]’ on the PNC despite the fact that a decision should have been made in them by 7 August 2014. A CCD Workflow Assessor replied on 6 September 2014 with the information that CCD Liverpool was still waiting for Yusuf’s files to be sent from CCD Croydon and that CCD Liverpool had only been notified of the case on 1 September 2014. On receipt of the files, the case would be passed to a pre-decision team, team CCL3.  </span>

In fact, he had yet to be considered for deportation and no deportation order or notice had yet been made, his conviction was not subject to the deportation criteria since the SSHD had known about his GBH and other convictions for many years and they had been revealed but not referred to the CCD in the five PNC searches that the SSHD had made in the intervening years.

Soon afterwards, Yusuf was informed that he should attend an asylum screening interview which had been arranged by CCL3 on 25 September 2014 because the CCD caseworker concerned with his case had erroneously considered on reading his file that he had an unresolved asylum application. This belief stemmed from a short passage in a letter written by his solicitors to the SSHD in 2008. The relevant passage does not, when carefully considered, amount to an application for asylum and Yusuf did not attend the interview.

This procedure provided redress by way of an award of compensation to applicants who had made applications for immigration relief to the SSHD and had a complaint as to how that application had been handled. Such a complaint could be addressed to the UKVI internal complaints procedure which had limited powers to award limited compensation for any maladministration that had been shown to have occurred. The claimants through their solicitors submitted complaints on behalf of each of the four Saids on 10 December 2014 and on 12 December 2014 informed the SSHD that the claimants would still be pursuing their respective claims for damages. </span>

In Ms Premji’s witness statement, the claimants formally withdrew their complaints since they contended that the delays and maladministration that had occurred were so extensive that any compensation that might be awarded by the complaints procedure would be wholly inadequate to cover the damages that they were claiming and were entitled to. Moreover, the range and nature of those complaints required a complex investigation of both the facts and the law of a kind which the complaints procedure was wholly inadequate to deal with.</span>

The decision gave no discernible reasons to explain what delay was referred to, the causes of that delay, the maladministration that had given rise to those causes or how the sum awarded had been calculated. Furthermore, although the original complaints had been submitted on behalf of each of the four Saids, the decision only purported to decide Yasin’s complaint. This somewhat contemptuous way of dealing with Yasin’s complaints was compounded by the SSHD ignoring Laila’s, Yusuf’s and Yakub’s complaints, by awarding Yasin a derisory sum to compensate him for the delays and maladministration that had occurred and by subsequently withdrawing the proposed payment on the grounds that the relevant unit had not been informed that Yasin and his two sons had withdrawn their complaints.</span>

Further, in the uncalled for decision sent to Yasin in relation to his withdrawn application under the UKVI scheme, the decision-maker apologise to Yasin for the maladministration that had occurred. The SSHD pleaded that the apology was a sufficient remedy for any maladministration that had occurred. This was not accepted by the claimants since it was not considered to amount to a remedy at all for Laila, Yusuf and Yakub and was both derisory and contemptuous in relation to Yasin’s complaints.

In a subsequent post-hearing skeleton, the SSHD agreed to reconsider the decision in Yakub’s case. The SSHD has not withdrawn this decision and has not indicated the basis on which any reconsideration will take place. Yakub was not prepared to withdraw his claims in relation to the decision since the consideration of the further evidence did not amount to a reconsideration of the decision and the decision itself remains in place and if reconsidered, would not be reconsidered from scratch following the withdrawal of the first decision. </span>

These contentions were strongly opposed by Yusuf who maintained his claim to judicially review the decisions dated 13 November 2014 on a series of cumulative grounds since he was only able to appeal on human rights grounds and the failings of the SSHD in the decision-making process were so extensive that the whole decision should not be allowed to stand and should be re-taken on the correct bases. Those requirements could only be achieved if the first decision was quashed and then retaken in its entirety and only then should the possibility of a limited appeal to the FtT on the limited basis allowed to the claimants be considered.</span>

The claimants claimed that this series of proposals had been put forward at a very late stage as a cynical attempt to avoid a hearing and an investigation of the extensive failings of the SSHD or of an adequate award of damages for the extensive loss and damage those failings had caused.</span>

Yakub’s decision making-process started on Thursday 2 October 2014 and was completed five working days later on 8 October 2014. The decision-maker had had no previous involvement with these applications and he failed to consider much of the extensive ten-year history of these applications or take account of most of the extensive and significant failings and acts and omissions amounting to maladministration that had occurred. He also took account unlawfully Yakub’s spent convictions, failed to consider – as he should have done -  how his application would have been decided and on the grounds that would have been relied on had the decision been taken ten years earlier.

	      <span style="font-size:10pt;color:#000000">In the case of Yusuf’s decision, the decision-making process was even more truncated and was flawed from the outset. The decision that he should be deported was made by the CCD’s Chief Case Worker on 26 September 2014 on the basis of very limited paperwork and after what could have been no more than a few minutes consideration of the case. He had had no previous involvement with Yusuf or his application. The decision was flawed because the decision-maker purported to decide that Yusuf should be deported before it was possible to make that decision. The law required Yusuf first to be served with a Notice of Deportation and a deportation questionnaire and for him to be allowed an opportunity to make submissions and respond to the questionnaire. Furthermore, the decision-maker had first to put out of consideration all spent convictions and to decide the application on its merits and not as an adjunct to and as an automatic follow-up to the decision to deport him. The decision was also flawed because it was taken twice. The first decision by the Chief Case Worker was the determinative decision but in law it was not a decision at all but an instruction to the decision-maker who took the decision on 13 November 2014 what the crucial decisions should be. The determinative decision was therefore not that of the decision-maker since it was prejudged by the Chief Case Worker’s instructions and did not amount to a fresh decision of the decision-maker exercising his own discretion unfettered by the previous decision of the Chief Case Worker. </span>

Historically but inaccurately the SSHD has been regarded as the emanation of the organisation responsible for immigration. The UKBA’s function was essentially to deal with applications from individuals concerning their immigration and nationality status and the enforcement of immigration law by regulating entry and taking removal and other enforcement action against those in breach of immigration law. The relevant part of the UKBA with which this case was concerned was the IND and the various Directorates and sections within the IND and the various units within each such Directorate and section that dealt with Laila, Yasin, Yusuf and Yakub’s various applications between 1999 and 2014 since all those applications are related and each is concerned with their on-going attempts to obtain ILR, citizenship and the right to settle in the UK and the delays, maladministration and inefficiencies that have beset their fifteen-year application process that, even now, has not been completed. </span>

The SSHD may not therefore excuse the failure to disclose any documents within a short time following the granting of permission on the fact that the claim for damages was added by amendment at a late stage following the service of the decisions in each of these three cases. Of necessity, the documents were all adduced into the hearing without being sorted into legible, intelligible and chronological order so that the task of analysing them has been unusually prolonged but it is clear that all relevant documents that the SSHD still has access to have been disclosed, adduced in evidence and considered in reaching the findings of fact. </span>

It follows that the SSHD should certainly have concluded its consideration of, and reached and promulgated its decisions in relation to the claimants’ outstanding applications for ILR and settlement by, the end of 2004. The failure to make these decisions throughout the ensuing ten years was caused by the SSHD and the claimants had no overlapping responsibility for that failure. It follows that Yasin, Yusuf and Yakub each have a claim for the whole period of delay between 1 January 2005 and the date that their respective decision were promulgated. Yusuf and Yakub have further claims for the additional period that is still occurring being the period between the dates of their respective first decisions and of their second decisions once they are made and promulgated. These further decisions will have been necessitated by the setting aside of the first decisions as a result of this judgment and the consequent reconsideration of those decisions. It follows that the two applications should have been decided no later than 20 December 2004. This judgment decides below whether these claims give rise to any cause of action that may be relied on by the claimants and to awards to them of damages, declarations or other just satisfaction. </span>

Counsel were asked whether previous versions of the Rules were available online, either from legal publishers or on the Home Office website. In his post-hearing written submissions Mr Malik told us that he understood that it was possible to obtain from the National Archive website consolidated versions of the Immigration Rules as they stood at any given date. Mr Blundell, however, responded that that was not the case. The Home Office produces consolidated versions of the Rules following each Statement of Changes, and publishes the current version on its website, but previous versions are not displayed and whatever may be available from the National Archive is "not entirely accurate": the only way that a member of the public or practitioner can definitively ascertain the state of the Rules at a given time in the past is by perusal of the Statements of Changes. If that is really the case, it is unacceptable. The Statements of Changes are so frequent and so detailed</span>

In my view it is essential that the Home Office should make available an archive of all previous consolidated versions of the Rules in a form that enables the public and practitioners to see clearly what rules were in force at any given date: if such an archive is not maintained for working purposes within the Home Office (which would be surprising) it will have to be created, though I pity whoever has to undertake the task.</span>

A further deficiency is that it has not disclosed copies of the IRs and any relevant policies in force in 2004 which would have shaped the content of those hypothetical decisions. The Saids’ counsel have only been able to obtain copies of some of these relevant documents from the SSHD archive to which they have added submissions based on their own professional experience of SSHD practice in granting ILR in previous years.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt">The starting point for this historic consideration of the SSHD’s practice in relation to applications for ILR and settlement is Laila’s immigration status. The SSHD has given insufficient weight throughout the ten-year period of its consideration of the claimants’ applications to Laila’s British citizenship and in particular to its historical origins, namely that she was an early recipient of the change in the law brought about by the NIAA 2002. Laila is a third generation CUKC who, like her forebears and other CUKCs in her situation, was born and lived in Kenya but who was the unwitting victim of two historic injustices. Firstly, on Kenyan independence, Laila was denied the opportunity of acquiring dual nationality by the Kenyan Government so that she remained a CUKC whose status in Kenya was precarious since she was only permitted a right of abode in Kenya under Kenyan law whilst her marriage subsisted and she remained living in Kenya. Secondly, when in 1982 the BNA 1982 was passed, she like other CUKCs living in Kenya lost the right of abode in the UK and a new form of status was created for people like her, being that of BOC, to replace their previous status of CUKC. She therefore remained a nominal British citizen with a British passport but with no right of abode in the UK so that she would from 1982 onwards have become effectively stateless if she ceased to live or was no longer allowed to live in Kenya. </span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt">It was because of these twin perceived injustices afflicting BOCs that in 2002 the UK Government added section 4B to the BNA 1982 by section 12 of the NIAA 2002 so as to entitle BOCs with no other nationality to register as British citizens and acquire a right of abode in the UK. Thus, Laila having lost her birth right of the right of abode in the UK in 1982 reacquired that right in 2002. Moreover, she had already moved to the UK with her two sons in 1999 and had been attempting since then to acquire a right of abode for herself and both of them initially through an unsuccessful asylum application and then in an ongoing human rights application. Finally, by the time that she was able to apply to be registered as a British citizen, her husband of many years and who had come separately to the UK at the same time as her and their two sons had been reunited with his family and was also seeking a right of abode with them in an on-going human rights application.</span>

It followed that an applicant on or after that section came into force on 30 April 2003 who was seeking to rely on his or his sponsor’s application for or grant of British citizenship had to bring an application for LTE or LTR under paragraphs </span>

The IRs prior to the coming into force of section 4B of course made no mention of or any separate provision for those applying for or being granted section 4B British citizenship or as dependents of applicants or beneficiaries of section 4B British citizenship. The clear intention of the amendment introduced by section 4B was to give all BOCs, whether located in relevant countries such as Kenya or in the UK who were or who would become effectively stateless in the future, the right to apply for British citizenship and for their dependants following their being granted British citizenship to be treated in any application for LTR on the same footing as dependants of settled British citizens. Since this amended right to claim British citizenship was introduced to remedy an historic injustice, it was in terms one that applied to those who were already resident in the UK – albeit unlawfully – who were both BOCs and effectively stateless since the primary legislation granted the remedy to all qualifying BOCs whether resident in the UK or elsewhere. </span>

It was to be expected that the SSHD would have made provision for dependent applicants of those BOC residents granted section 4B citizenship who were also present in the UK when section 4B came into force since such applicants were not provided for in the IRs but who were clearly within the scope of the new legislation. In other words, it was to be expected that provision for such transitional cases would have been made by way of an IR amendment or by the issue of policy guidance but no such provision was in fact made. Neither Yasin or Yakub therefore qualified for ILR under the IRs even though they were already resident in the UK and were living with and claiming ILR dependency as the spouse or a child of someone who had been granted section 4B British citizenship whilst living in the UK. Moreover, it was to be expected that the categories of those eligible to apply for SET(O) would have been extended to cover those claiming settlement as a result of the dependency on a section 4B British citizen but no such extension appears to have been made.       </span>

The second of these difficulties would have given rise to careful thought. The decision-maker would have needed to consider the full circumstances of the offence and the reasons for an apparently very light sentence as well as the absence of a recommendation of deportation from the sentencing judge, whether deportation was necessary as being conducive to the public good and his risk to the public if allowed to stay in the UK after his release from prison<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="69">

I conclude that, in those circumstances, Yusuf would have been granted limited LTR to take him up to the end of the custodial part of his sentence – probably for a period of one year – at which point his status in the UK would have been considered afresh. When that occurred, I find that the likely outcome would have been a further period of twenty-seven months LTR at which point he could have applied for ILR and settlement. In reaching this conclusion, I take account of the repeated occasions subsequently when SSHD officials considering his case were aware of his conviction and appear to have concluded on each occasion that his case should not be referred to the CCD for consideration for deportation and that he should instead be considered favourably for LTR.   </span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt;color:#000000">Yasin made one witness statement dated 25 November 2014. His general evidence was that he had always been a mechanic in both Kenya and the UK. He initially worked for a series of car repair garages but was never able to hold down a permanent job since he was unable to obtain a driving licence or a MOT qualification given his unresolved immigration status so that he could not test drive or MOT any car. In 2003, he became self-employed and ran his own car repair business based in Peterborough but was never able to grow this due to his inability to test drive, pick-up or drop-off any car. He was unable to afford to employ someone to undertake these tasks and his profit in 2010 – 2011, after some seven years of trading, was £9,709 and for 2011 – 2012 was £8,658. He had declared his income in full throughout to HMRC and paid all income tax due on his earnings. Whilst he was operating that business, Yakub helped him and has taken it over following Yasin’s illness and death. </span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt;color:#000000">Due to his not having any right to remain in the UK, with its consequent inability to earn any significant amount, he was unable to be the bread winner and has been dependant on Laila which, given his cultural background, has been personally humiliating for him. Furthermore, he has been unable to travel and was unable to attend the funerals of neither his mother nor his father nor visit his sister in Switzerland. He has also been unable to watch and participate in his sons’ life progression or in their building a career.</span>

She explained that she initially trained as an auxiliary nurse but because she could not obtain a training position in Peterborough, she trained and worked in Reading. She travelled home to Peterborough every weekend with Yakub. Having qualified in 2006, she could only obtain work in Reading where she worked as a surgical nurse and lived in rented accommodation in Slough during the week and returned home to Peterborough at weekends. Yakub stayed with her until 2010. She bought the family home in Peterborough in June 2008 in her sole name because Yasin could not obtain a mortgage in his name or in their joint names due to his lack of residency status. In December 2010, she moved to Peterborough to be with her family full time, taking agency nursing work doing night shifts. She specialised in surgical, elderly care and community nursing.   </span>

In relation to his conviction, he stated that the affray was not premeditated. He felt and continues to feel shame and embarrassment about his convictions. He has always had considerable difficulty obtaining and maintaining a job as a welder and fabricator. He obtained casual work because it was impossible to obtain employment on a building site due to his precarious immigration status and because, without a driving licence, he could not drive himself from site to site.</span>

When he was arrested on 1 September 2014, he had not been involved in the scuffle that had led to many of those in the vicinity being arrested. He had not informed the Police about Debra and his two children when he was interviewed following that arrest with her because he was out in Peterborough and did not want them to be involved in his problems, particularly as she was living some distance away in Reading.</span>

The third was what the impact of his relocation would be on his children. They were young, in the case of two of them very young and they would be likely to feel a sense of rejection and abandonment. Experience has shown that children who experience such feelings are likely to grow up with psychological and behavioural problems.

	      <span style="font-size:10pt">  This issue must be considered with the procedural chronology in mind. The claimants had been waiting for decisions in their applications dated 1 September 2004 for nearly eight years and had made repeated efforts to obtain those decisions when the first of three pre-action protocol letters was written dated 27 July 2012 threatening judicial review seeking mandatory orders compelling their production if these were not produced within a reasonable time. This elicited an uninformative holding reply. A second pre-action protocol letter dated 10 October 2012 was sent calling for decisions within thirty days. This letter was not responded to. A third pre-action protocol letter dated 10 December 2012 was sent and not responded to. In consequence, a judicial review claim form seeking mandatory orders for the production of the decisions due to the unlawful delay in producing them was filed on 18 April 2013. The acknowledgement of service served on 29 May 2013 did not plead to the allegations of delay. It stated that the decisions would be served within six months in the absence of special circumstances and in consequence requested the court to refuse permission to apply for judicial review without making an offer to pay the claimants costs. However, the court granted permission on 23 July 2013 on the grounds that it was arguable that the delay was unlawful. The SSHD was ordered to serve a detailed defence within thirty-five days accompanied by the disclosure of all relevant documents. </span>

The substantive hearing date of 16 October 2014 was fixed in the early autumn of 2013. On 12 December 2013, in response to a query from Laila’s MP, the SSHD stated that the claimants would receive decisions within six months but this promise too was not complied with. On 25 September 2014, Yusuf was served without prior warning with a Notice of Liability for Deportation and an accompanying Liability for Deportation Questionnaire based on his long-standing conviction and sentence that was imposed on 15 August 2004. The claimants’ solicitor served a skeleton and a hearing bundle prior to the hearing on 16 October 2014 without the SSHD having served grounds of defence. Limited but incomplete disclosure was provided just before the hearing. </span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt">When the hearing was called on, counsel instructed on behalf of the SSHD informed the court and the claimants that decisions had been made in Yasin and Yakub’s cases although these decisions had not been formally served. Yasin learnt that he had been granted ILR and Yakub that he had been granted DLR for one day although it was stated that that was a mistake and the decision was in fact to grant him DLR for thirty months. The court was also informed that a decision was being prepared in Yusuf’s case. At the hearing, the claimants’ counsel informed the court that Yusuf wished to apply for permission to amend his claim to add a claim seeking judicial review of the decision to serve a Notice of Liability to Deportation which she contended was served in an attempt to avoid the consequences of the continued non-service of a decision in his case. She also indicated that Yakub was minded to apply to amend his claim to challenge the grant of only twenty-four months DLR once the decision in his case had been formally served on him. It was finally intimated that the claimants would also be applying for permission to amend to claim damages under the HRA for the abuse of their article 8 rights as a result of the long delay that had occurred. </span>

The SSHD has, furthermore, made two firm assurances that the judicial review claims are no longer necessary since the decisions will be forthcoming but those assurances were not fulfilled. In making those assurances, the SSHD had, or should have, reviewed the entire history of delay and obtained and reviewed all surviving and accessible documents including copies of all GCID logs relating to the Said family. </span>

The application is not made too late, indeed it was served pursuant to my procedural directions and it could not have been made any earlier since it is heavily dependent on the SSHD’s disclosure and the decisions in the LTR applications and was served as soon as possible after those documents had been served. The terms of the amendments are adequately pleaded in a full amended grounds document. The nature of the claim is clear and is supported by witness statements providing much evidence of the claimants’ case as to the effects on each of them of the delay that occurred. The evidence in support of their claims as to the causes and length of delay is mainly to be found in the documents disclosed by the SSHD at a very late stage in the prolonged procedural history of this case. </span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt">The claims themselves cannot be said to have no prospects of success, they should at the very least be tested in a consideration of whether permission should be granted. The particular objection to the claims for damages that can be determined at this stage was that a claim for damages may not stand alone in a judicial review claim, it may only be made as part of and ancillary to a claim for one of the judicial review remedies. The answer to that objection is that both Yusuf and Yakub have, albeit by amendment, on-going claims for judicial review. Moreover, all three claimants’ original claims remain on the pleadings and have yet to be disposed of so that the amendment to claim damages is ancillary to existing claims even if those claims are no longer being pursued in their unamended form. Finally, the claim for damages is not made as an ancillary claim to a claim for judicial review relief but as a stand-alone claim for damages under the HRA which is being heard in the Administrative Court since it raises similar issues and evidence which must in any event be considered in the judicial review claims properly brought in this court. </span>

For the same reason, if the claims should be stayed, that order should only be made in a considered judgment after full argument.</span>

At the hearing on 19 December 2014, I directed that there should be a rolled-up hearing that would address the applications for permission as part of the decision-making process at the substantive hearing. Usually at a rolled-up hearing, the Administrative Court considers the substantive issues and makes a rolled-up decision in which it first decides how the substantive hearing would be decided if it took place and then, if it decides that judicial review should be refused, then decide whether permission should be granted and the substantive application dismissed or whether the case for a substantive review decision was so weak that permission should be refused.  </span>

That exercise could, and often should, be reflected in a declaration setting out what the legal basis for the new decision should be and/or what the errors of law were that led to the setting aside of the old decision. </span>

These declarations would therefore be ancillary judicial review remedies if either decision was set aside. Furthermore, the declarations would form part of the permissible range of remedies available when awarding damages under the HRA. For these reasons, the claims are arguable. </span>

That provision is not, however, applicable to these claims for damages. Firstly, the claims are advanced as claims for breach of statutory duties and not as judicial review claims. Secondly, the claims are strictly speaking not claims for damages but for just satisfaction, the remedy prescribed as the appropriate remedy by the ECHR and the HRA where there have been contraventions of the ECHR which are not capable of being addressed by conventional claims for damages. Thirdly, the remedy is not being sought alone since there are two claims for judicial review of decisions of the SSHD and an outstanding claim for judicial review remedies – including a declaration – that has yet to be disposed of by order in the Yasin’s case.  </span>

In particular, it was contended that the claimants had not properly set out or particularised their claims, witnesses whose statements had been tendered should be made available for cross-examination, no evidence had been adduced to address the claim that substantial harm had been caused by the delays and there was insufficient time for the SSHD properly to prepare for the hearing and to meet and respond to the claimants’ cases.</span>

The chronology and timetable for this claim shows that the SSHD withheld discovery relating to the nature, extent and causes of delay, all of which have been in issue since the original claim was first advanced, until a few days before the substantive hearing of this case. Furthermore, it is unusual for cross-examination to be permitted as part of the judicial review procedure even where damages are claimed for maladministration and breaches of the HRA. The SSHD had made no application for cross-examination and, as has been made clear in a number of cases, cross-examination of witnesses is not necessary when assessing damages for breaches of article 8 rights save in exceptional cases where the facts cannot otherwise be fairly determined</span>

The SSHD particularly complained about the lack of particularisation of the claimants’ case relating to the loss and damage it is alleged was caused to them by the delays that occurred. This complaint was ill-founded since the pleadings were supplemented by detailed witness statements from each member of the Said family including Laila. These statements provided sufficient detail of causation, they were not statements requiring cross-examination and they will be capable of elaboration or rebuttal in any event since additional evidence will be allowed if there is a further hearing to address the quantification of damages which I have directed will be held-over until after the handing down of this judgment.</span>

The first is a consideration as to whether a claimant will obtain something that will benefit him or be of practical utility for him if his claim succeeds. This consideration may arise at the outset when permission is being considered or it may arise prior at the substantive hearing if it is contended that the claimant’s situation has changed in that he has since the claim was filed achieved or been granted what he is claiming or that his claim no longer has practical utility for him due to his changed circumstances. In such cases, the court has a discretion to refuse permission or to dismiss the claim. The second strand is that the claimant has, or has already used, a suitable alternative remedy.

	      <span style="font-size:10pt">It is helpful to consider in this case a widespread practice of the SSHD in immigration cases. This practice is to serve a formal acknowledgement of service with a summary defence which merely states that the SSHD will reconsider a disputed decision or will take a delayed decision within a stipulated timescale, usually three months from the date of the order refusing permission, absent unforeseen circumstances which make that timescale impossible to achieve. This is a useful practice in most cases and it is encouraged by a costs regime authorised by the Court of Appeal whereby the claimant should be awarded his costs of preparing and serving the claim if the reconsideration or service of a decision provides what is sought in the claim absent conduct from the claimant which does not justify such an order. However, the SSHD on occasion abuses this practice by requiring the claimant to agree to the withdrawal of the claim with no order as to costs as a precondition of the reconsideration or delivery of a decision. When that occurs, a claimant is usually entitled to refuse the offer in an open letter which makes it clear that he would accept an order whereby he withdraws the claim on terms that the promised decision or reconsideration is provided within the stipulated timescale and his costs will be paid or referred to the court for determination. </span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt">In this case, the SSHD made an open offer to provide decisions within six months in its acknowledgment of service dated 29 May 2013 but, nonetheless, the court granted the claimants permission to proceed to a full judicial review in a decision dated 23 July 2013, within that six months’ timescale. This was because the SSHD had not offered to pay the claimants’ costs and in the light of the enormous delay that had occurred and the pre-action inaction by the SSHD all of which pointed to the claimants having good prospects of success at the substantive hearing. Despite that permission, the SSHD failed to provide decisions within six months and, having made a further open statement in a letter dated 12 December 2013 that decisions would be provided within six months of that letter, again failed to provide them within that timescale. Decisions were finally provided on 9 October 2014 (albeit not served for a further two weeks) in Yasin and Yakub’s cases and on 13 November 2014 in Yusuf’s case.</span>

Yasin’s costs of the original claims for the whole period of the judicial review up to the final order in relation to the original claim also remain for determination since the SSHD has not made an open unconditional offer that all such costs would be paid. Instead, the only open offer was made prior to the adjourned hearing that such costs would be paid up to the date of the decision and that Yasin should pay the SSHD’s costs from that date to the date of the order. Yasin’s costs claim may possibly also include a claim for indemnity rather than standard basis costs in the light of the SSHD’s non-compliance with court orders and the delays that it has caused.</span>

This is because the original claims for mandatory orders have not been dismissed and, although each decision has now been provided, each claimant is claiming declaratory relief as just satisfaction and as an adjunct to their respective claims for damages. They are also claiming their costs, possibly on an indemnity basis, arising from their pursuit of these original claims which, ultimately, have led to these decisions being provided without a mandatory order being necessary.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt">This issue arises in relation to the decisions in both Yusuf and Yakub’s cases albeit that it principally arises in Yusuf’s case. In essence, the issue is whether the SSHD was entitled to take account of Yusuf’s convictions that led to his receiving an eighteen-month prison sentence and his three earlier driving offences when considering and deciding his application for LTR even though those convictions were spent and similarly, whether it was entitled to take account of Yakub’s seven offences and one community sentence enforcement order even though these, or most of them, were spent. This issue should have involved a simple application of a statutory transitional provision but it is in fact bewilderingly complex due to the need to consult poorly drafted legislation spanning interlocking statutory provisions in the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 (“ROA 1974”), the UK Borders Act 2007 (“UKBA 2007”) and LASPO as well as paragraph 322(5) of the IRs.  </span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt">These extracts from the ROA 1974, UKBA 2007 and LASPO show that since 1974, a person convicted and sentenced for offences that involved a relatively modest custodial sentence or a non-custodial sentence were to be rehabilitated after a period of time after the completion of their sentence. At that point, their conviction became spent so that from then on, no reference could be made to the fact of their conviction or to its circumstances save in limited situations in some cases. The purpose of rehabilitation was to facilitate a convicted person whose crime was not of the most serious to return to normal life so that, apart from the statutory exceptions, their crime and conviction were expunged from view or consideration. Initially, the maximum sentence that these provisions applied to was a custodial sentence of thirty months and the period before rehabilitation was ten years from conviction. However, experience suggested that this maximum severity of sentence was too short and the rehabilitation period was too long and the length of sentence was increased to forty eight months and the rehabilitation period reduced to forty-eight months from the date the sentence was completed. These changes to the ROA 1974 were introduced by LASPO.   </span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt">Until 2007, the only circumstances giving rise to a person being deported as a result of having been convicted or of their criminal tendencies and danger to the public was pursuant to the IA 1971 and a decision by the SSHD that their continued presence in the UK was not conducive to the public good. However, the law was transformed by amendments to the IRs in 2006, by the UKBA in 2007 and by LASPO in 2014. The effect of the UKBA 2007 was that ordinarily, a sentence of one year or more would invariably lead to deportation unless that would amount to a disproportionate interference with their private or family life. More recently, the statutory regime was amended so as to require that any consideration of an applicant’s immigration status or application should take account of all their convictions whether or not these were spent or they had been rehabilitated. This significant inroad into the ROA 1974 was given effect to by the amendments to the then existing statutory regime that were introduced by LASPO as part of the group of amendments to the ROA 1974 relating to the length of qualifying sentences and of the rehabilitation periods for those sentences. </span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt">This change, which required consideration of a spent conviction as part of an immigration application, gave rise to the need to consider what statutory transitional exception to the new regime should be provided for those whose convictions were spent or who had been rehabilitated before the LASPO changes were introduced. Broadly speaking, it was decided that a person whose conviction had been spent prior to LASPO taking effect could only be exempt from the removal of the effects of rehabilitation if a relevant immigration decision had been made or an application remaining for decision was outstanding prior to LASPO taking effect. Thus, any consideration of someone’s immigration status after 1 October 2012 when LASPO took effect had to take account of that person’s previous convictions. LASPO provided limited transitional exceptions to that change, the relevant ones in these cases being that the conviction had to have become spent before 1 October 2012 and the consideration had to be of an application for ILR or LTR made before 1 October 2012 that had not been decided by that date.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt">Unfortunately, the transitional provisions distinguish between an application for ILR or LTR and a decision to deport. Only the former is subject to the transitional exemption. The complication in Yusuf’s case is that he was subject both to a consideration of his application for ILR which is clearly caught by the transitional exemption and to a decision to deport him on the grounds of his criminality revealed by his convictions for GBH,  affray and assault which is not. The issue, in short, is whether the requirement that all convictions even if spent must be taken into account when considering and deciding on deportation can trump the prohibition on their being taken into account when a an ILR application is being considered at the same time. Since it is mandatory to take Yusuf’s spent convictions into account when considering whether he should be deported and also mandatory that they should not be taken into account when his ILR application is being considered, and since the legislation does not provide a clear answer to the question of how these two competing regimes should be applied when they are both applicable at the same time, the resolution of this issue is far from simple. </span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt">From the outset, Yasin and Yusuf’s separate applications dated 1 September 2004 were linked and considered together. The first written notification that the SSHD had of Yusuf’s conviction and sentence was in Laila’s family exercise application dated 10 March 2005 when she informed it that Yusuf had been charged with GBH. On 20 June 2006, the SSHD informed Yasin that his subsequent application under the family exercise that had included Yusuf as one of the members of the family was refused because of Yusuf’s conviction. This decision must have been preceded by a PNC check which would have revealed the existence and details of this conviction. A second PNC check was made by the family exercise unit considering Yasin’s application on 31 January 2007 and, on receipt of the PNC details, the family exercise application was again refused as a result of the knowledge that Yusuf had served an 18-month sentence. On 31 July 2007, the family exercise team carried out a third PNC check on Yusuf and then recorded on the GCID that his conviction was such that he did not meet the criteria for the family exercise but that his application would be reconsidered in the future under the amended criteria that had been introduced on 12 June 2006. The criteria being referred to appear to have related to the disqualification from the family exercise of applicants, in this case Yusuf, who had previous convictions. 18 March 2008, an official in the CRD which was the Directorate dealing with legacy cases which these applications had been wrongly referred to, reviewed Yusuf’s file and concluded that he would probably qualify for LTR under IR 395C. That official, it is to be assumed, would have been aware of his criminal conviction given the 3 separate previous occasions when his PNC had been checked and copied onto the file and, in the light of that knowledge still considered that he would qualify for LTR.</span>

On 14 October 2013, following the transfer of the applications from the CAAU to the OLCU, the OLCU reviewed Yakub, and it is to be inferred Yusuf’s PNC results and concluded that consideration of Yakub’s case and it is to be inferred also Yusuf’s case should proceed. On 12 December 2013, the SSHD assured Laila’s MP that all three cases would be decided within 6 months. On 9 January 2014, a note on Yasin’s file which had been placed there by an official in the OLCU stated that the cases of all three Saids were JR cases and therefore had to be treated as a priority.</span>

On 20 May 2014, an OLCU caseworker was working on Yusuf’s file and noticed that he had been convicted of GBH in August 2004. There is no evidence that that caseworker was aware of any of the history of the SSHD’s consideration of his case. The GCID recorded that the caseworker had noted that Yusuf’s case had not been considered by the CCD despite his 2004 conviction and sentence with the result that the OLCU decided to send his file to the CCD for it to check. The file was passed to the CCD intake team and an initial assessment was undertaken on 25 June 2014. This led to an Executive Officer within the intake team deciding to accept ownership of Yusuf’s application and that his file should be sent to the CCD based in Liverpool. This decision had the effect of splitting into separate Directorates consideration of Yasin and Yusuf’s linked applications with the result that Yasin’s and Yakub’s application remained in the OLCU for decision whilst Yusuf’s application was transferred to the CCD for decision.</span>

Officers within the Liverpool CCD arranged for Yusuf to be served with a Notice of Restriction on learning that he was not to be charged and was to be released from custody, and also arranged for him to be interviewed by an immigration officer prior to his release. The Appeals and Litigation Directorate, who were involved because Yusuf’s judicial review substantive hearing was imminent, directed the CCD to deal with and decide Yusuf’s application as soon as possible.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt"> The CCD therefore took steps to reach an early decision in relation to his application for LTR and as to whether any action should be taken in relation to his criminal conviction. On considering his application, a caseworker noted Yusuf’s convictions and, on 16 September 2014, prepared a LASPO minute which merely recited the previous convictions and referred the minute to the CCD chief caseworker Mr Kenny Welsh. This was the only document that Mr Welsh was shown. On 23 September 2014, he read the minute and then noted briefly that the CCD should seek to deport. As a result, on 24 September 2014, a senior officer in the CCD referred Yusuf’s file to a caseworker with the instruction that the CCD would decide Yusuf’s application for LTR by refusing it using IR paragraph 322(5) and that Yusuf’s deportation should be pursued. As a result, the first step towards deportation on conducive grounds was taken on 25 September 2014 when the CCD served Yusuf with a Notice of Intention to Deport. On 3 October 2014, an internal note stated that the CCD was looking at a foreign criminal whose offence had not been picked up by Criminal Casework but it has now come to the CCD’s attention “via an application for ILR”. </span>

To understand that question, it is necessary to walk through a statutory line of mirrors. The starting point is that the ROA was amended by LASPO so as to reduce the rehabilitation period for sentences covered by that Act. Yusuf’s convictions thereby became spent earlier. As a result, from 2010 onwards, sections 5(1) and 5(5) prohibited any reference to Yusuf’s convictions in any consideration of or decision about his SET application. However, LAPSO disapplied the effect of sections 5(1) and 5(5) from immigration decisions so that spent convictions could be referred to in those limited circumstances. As a yet further gloss, however, section 141(9) provided that disapplication of sections 5(1) and 5(5) does  not affect “any applications for immigration decisions made but not finally determined” on 1 October 2012. </span>

The even shorter and even harder issue then arises as to whether sections 5(1) and 5(5) are to continue to apply to the SSHD’s consideration of deportation and, if not, how the convictions should be dealt with in the consideration of Yusuf’s LTR application and the separate consideration of whether Yusuf should be deported given that the CCD was considering both questions simultaneously.  </span>

Moreover, section 141(9)(b) was irrelevant because the convictions were irrelevant to the deportation decision and they played no part in it. The decision was taken because it was decided to serve a notice of intention to deport which was a decision that was taken after 1 October 2012 which was not an application for an immigration decision so that it fell outside the transitional provisions altogether. </span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt;color:#000000">The SSHD’s powers with regard to the deportation of those who have been convicted are derived from sections 3(5) and (6) of the IA 1971, sections 32 – 33 of the UKBA 2007 and paragraphs 322 and 398 - 399B of the IRs. These complex provisions have transformed the prospects of a foreign criminal remaining in the UK following a conviction or convictions resulting in custodial sentences. Such a criminal will be, or is very likely to be, deported save on human rights grounds or where their circumstances are very compelling. There is no time limit for initiating deportation and no restrictions on the power to deport are imposed in relation to a foreign criminal who has LTR at a time when deportation is being considered. It follows that even if the claimants’ contentions are successful, it would be open to the SSHD to initiate deportation proceedings immediately after it had granted LTR in a transitional case albeit that there would be very strong or even compelling article 8 grounds for resisting an order where the conviction was of long standing and there were no other significant factors pointing to deportation.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt;color:#000000">These powers of deportation suggest that the SSHD’s contentions have some force since, on its contention, deportation powers are distinct from decision-making powers. However, there are strong competing considerations since the situation where there might be a conflict between a decision-making exercise following an application for LTR and a decision to initiate and enforce deportation on conducive grounds is unlikely to occur save in this rare and one-off situation were the transitional powers maintaining sections 5(1) and 5(5) of the ROA are to apply to an undecided application which had been made prior to 1 October 2012. Since it would always be possible for the SSHD to avoid the application of sections 5(1) and 5(5) in transitional cases by initiating a separate consideration of deportation, the transitional protection apparently provided by section 141(9)(b) of LASPO would be illusory if the SSHD’s contentions are correct.  </span>

There is no rule of law which precludes an application for LTR being decided by, and as part of, a decision-making process culminating in deportation. It is therefore possible that the consideration of spent convictions during a consideration of whether a foreign criminal should be deported is not permitted in the limited number of transitional cases where that consideration arises as part of the decision-making process to decide an outstanding application for LTR.  </span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt;color:#000000">There are very powerful arguments for concluding that the deportation decision in Yusuf’s case was taken as an integral part of the decision-making process involved in deciding his SET application. From 2005 onwards, his criminal conviction was considered on at least seven occasions by the SSHD and on each occasion it appears to have been decided that although he had a significant criminal conviction for GBH, it should not be referred to the CCD for consideration for deportation – the CCD being the only Directorate that could order a foreign criminal to be deported. The SSHD then promised on two occasions on 29 May and 12 December 2013 that it would decide Yusuf’s application for LTR within 6 months and the application was finally referred to the CCD for decision in May 2014. The CCD then decided the application as a matter of urgency having been asked to do so by the OLCU. It then informed itself that it was deciding his application by deciding to deport him and in its decision dated 11 November 2014 it refused Yusuf’s application for ILR under paragraph 322(5) of the IRs due to his criminality arising out of his convictions which were spent. </span>

The two were considered and decided together. In doing so, the SSHD inevitably made reference to the spent convictions when considering Yusuf’s application and his defence to the use of the IRs to deport him was hampered because he could not defend himself by showing that removal was disproportionate and his circumstances for resisting deportation were compelling without revealing his spent conviction which he was entitled to keep out of the decision-making process since it was also concerned with his application for permission.</span>

His conviction was considered on many occasions and on each occasion, the decision-maker concerned was aware of his convictions and must have decided that they were not sufficient or appropriate to be referred to the CCD. The CCD’s decision dated 13 November 2014, reached without reference to or consideration of the ten years decision-making that had preceded it, erroneously concluded that his convictions had only come to light when he was interviewed by the police during the evening of 31 August 2014 following his arrest on suspicion of being involved in an affray. In fact, the SSHD had been fully conscious of these convictions for over nine years prior to the decisions involved in the referral of Yusuf’s case to the CCD and the CCD’s deportation decision being taken and had apparently consciously decided on each of the many occasions that it had obtained details of them not to refer them to the CCD. </span>

It could then, as a separate exercise, if it believed that it was still appropriate to do so, decide whether to deport him or not since that decision would then have been a stand-alone decision. Inevitably, that decision would have had to have taken account of the fact that Yusuf had only just been granted ILR and that he was subject to a spent conviction that had been imposed ten years previously and that he had not been convicted of any crime since then. Alternatively, the SSHD could subsequently and on a separate occasion have initiated a consideration of whether Yusuf should be deported and, indeed, it still can do so and could do so once Yusuf’s application decision has been retaken if the decision dated 13 November 2014 is set aside. </span>

That procedure infringed the prohibition imposed by section 5 of the ROA. It involved caseworkers making reference to those convictions as part of their decision-making process. That procedure also involved the unlawful reference of Yusuf’s application to the CCD which only had jurisdiction to consider it if it had satisfied itself that Yusuf had qualifying convictions.

Finally, the course of action adopted by the CCD deprived Yusuf of the ability to show that his deportation was disproportionate and that his circumstances were exceptional since, to rely on these arguments, he had to draw attention to his convictions even though he was entitled to have them left out of account since his application was being considered at the same time as his possible deportation.</span>

It therefore no longer had the option of first deciding to deport him and then concluding that that deportation decision obviated the need to decide the LTR application save in a formal manner consequently to the deportation decision. What the OLCU did was to refer both Yusuf’s original application and a consideration of whether he should be deported to the CCD with a request for it to undertake both matters simultaneously and as part of the same reference. His application should not have been transferred to the CCD at all since that Directorate was principally concerned with whether a foreign criminal should be deported on account of his criminal history. Thus, the OLCU’s decision to refer his application to the CCD because of his convictions and the CCD’s preliminary decision to accept that reference involved caseworkers in both Directorates processing his application in an unlawful and prohibited consideration of his spent convictions.  </span>

In the light of these considerations, it would then have had to have considered whether it was conducive to deport him. If so, it would then have had to decide in a separate decision whether to deport him, whether the IR exceptions to deportation were applicable, whether deportation would infringe his article 8 rights to a private and family life and whether his circumstances were compelling enough for him not to be deported.   </span>

His PNC print out also referred to an appearance before the magistrates on 20 January 2014 for failure to comply with a community order. That was not a separate conviction albeit that it was related to a previous conviction and involved the magistrates revisiting one of his previous sentences. Having revisited it, the magistrates imposed an enforcement order and extended the time within which he had to comply with the community order dated 11 June 2013 and also imposed a costs order. </span>

But for the extension order, the last sentence would have been spent and the rehabilitation period would have ended on 11 December 2013.

These amendments are contained in Paragraph 276ADE of and Appendix FM to the IRs which set out the criteria that a decision-maker should apply to any consideration of whether an applicant qualifies for LTR on the basis of their family or private life. Broadly speaking, these amendments imposed a detailed and structured decision-making process subject to stringent guidelines into any consideration of an applicant’s family and private life that had to be followed save in certain exceptional and defined circumstances.

Broadly speaking, the case of anyone who was not a British citizen who had committed all but the most minor of offences defined by the nature and length of the sentence passed ordinarily had to be referred to the CCD to determine whether they should be deported or removed from the UK. This enforcement regime had been introduced gradually since 2000 so that, by 2014, it provided for automatic deportation or removal for most offences committed by a foreign criminal where a custodial sentence has been passed and most criminality save in the most exceptional circumstances. Furthermore, subject to the transitional provisions in LASPO already considered, any consideration of an immigration application or of a foreign criminal’s case by the SSHD whether generally or by the CCD should take account of all offending whenever it had occurred including spent convictions.</span>

It follows that, had those relaxations occurred, the resulting decisions would have been taken under the IRs without involving a consideration of their human rights. It must also follow that, ten years later, the case for relaxing the rules is very much stronger and as a first step in the decision-making process, such a relaxation should have been considered by the decision-maker in Yasin’s and Yakub’s cases. If such a relaxation was decided to be appropriate, the decisions would then have been taken under the IRs and they would not have involved at that stage recourse to article 8 and should have been taken without involving the provisions of paragraph 276ADE or appendix FM. Only if the decision had been that the provisions of paragraphs 277 and/or 298 should not be relaxed or, if relaxed, that ILR would not be granted would and should there have been recourse to article 8 or the provisions of paragraph 276ADE and appendix FM.</span>

Secondly, his application was originally made on the basis that he was a dependent child but his dependency had ceased and is very different now that he is an adult from his child dependency at the time when the application was made. Thirdly, he now has a partner and they have two children and both his partner and their children’s interests need to be considered. These considerations are not ones that ordinarily arise when a dependent child is being considered. </span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt;color:#000000">    The answer to this conundrum is relatively straightforward on the facts of this case even though the decision should have been taken ten years before it was taken. I have already pointed out that the first question to be resolved was whether IR paragraph 298 should have been relaxed in his case since, if it was not, the application could not have been made under the IRs at all. Thus, since Yakub ceased to be a child in 2005, it would be necessary to relax the requirement of dependency in addition to the requirement that has to be relaxed relating to his immigration status when the application was made since a twenty-eight year old adult is not ordinarily dependent on his parents.  However, Yakub appeared exceptionally to have remained dependent on his parents in a factual sense until Yasin died in January 2015 and, and since January 2015, on Laila. The decision-maker could therefore proceed under the IRs having relaxed the qualifying requirement and also the dependency requirement unless he considered that Yakub was no longer dependent on his parents. If the application was considered under the relaxed IR requirements, it would not have been necessary to consider the interests of Yasin’s children or the relationship that he has with his partner in this somewhat artificial consideration of his SET(M) dependency application under the IRs. If, however, that IR consideration led to an adverse decision that refused to consider that Yakub remained dependent on his parents or refused him ILR, his case would then have had to have been considered under article 8 when his relationship with his partner and children and their interests and his family and private life would have had to have been taken fully into account.</span>

In those circumstances, fairness required the decision-maker to draw to the attention of each applicant that he was minded to apply the provisions of paragraph 276ADE and appendix FM and to consider the various other matters including whether his case involved exceptional circumstances and whether he had lost all connection with Kenya and to invite each applicant to supplement their original applications with up to date details of their private and family lives, of their children and partners and of any other relevant matter.

Yasin therefore had LTR for the entire period between 18 September 1999 and 22 October 2002. The decision-maker considered that it was unclear whether Yasin had any remaining family in Kenya but the totality of all four Saids’ evidence had clearly stated that none of them had any surviving family there. More significantly, he did not consider whether the application should be considered under the IRs having first relaxed them to accommodate Yasin’s exceptional situation. In consequence, he was only able to grant Yasin thirty months LTR for the interference with his private life as a result of the insurmountable obstacle of him returning to Kenya given that Laila was a settled British citizen but was able to enlarge this to a grant of ILR on account of SSHD inaction, the destitution of the family during their wait for decisions and Laila’s British citizenship. </span>

However, his Estate still have an outstanding claim for damages arising from the breaches of his article 8 rights occasioned by the SSHD’s maladministration of his application. In those circumstances, and given the shortcomings in the reasoning of the decision disclosed in the file note of the decision-maker, and also given the history of the application and of the decision-making process set out above, it is clear that Yasin was entitled to bring his claim for judicial review, that it was solely because he brought that claim that he obtained a decision of his application and that it is appropriate to grant him relief by way of just satisfaction even though the decision was finally served not long before the substantive hearing. The appropriate relief is by way of a declaration, which is also appropriate to facilitate the consideration of his outstanding claim for damages.</span>

Although the SSHD has extensive discretionary powers with regard to the acceptance of applications for, the decision-making concerned with and the granting and variation of LTR, these powers must be exercised in accordance with the immigration statutory regime comprising statutes and statutory instruments, IRs and policy statements. Once an application has been concluded by a decision, that decision can only be varied or withdrawn in accordance with the terms of that regime and, ordinarily, the SSHD cannot unilaterally withdraw a decision to grant LTR save in pursuance of powers set out in the IRs and fleshed out in policy statements. It may additionally review or vary the terms of the LTR that has been granted and it can also issue a fresh grant of LTR pursuant to a further application.

He contends that the decision was unlawful and fundamentally flawed on a number of inter-related grounds. He claims that the part of the decision granting him 30-months LTR should be set aside and retaken and that he should also be granted a declaration that the original decision to grant him 30-months LTR was unlawful. The declaration should recite that the decision should be reconsidered in its entirety in a lawful manner which does not dismiss the original application but which reconsiders the length of his LTR. It should also recite that the original decision was unlawfully delayed for ten years and that it should not take account of any of his convictions that were spent at the date of the reconsideration. He therefore does not seek to disturb the finding that he is entitled to LTR, his objective is to obtain a fresh decision granting him ILR instead of the 30-months LTR that he was granted. </span>

The decision then considered whether Yakub qualified for LTR on the basis of his family and private life, whether there were any exceptional circumstances that might qualify for a grant of leave and whether his removal from the UK would breach his rights under article 8 of the ECHR. The decision-maker took account of his offending in deciding he did not meet the requirements to be met for LTR as a partner and refused his application under the various relevant provisions of the IRs concerned with the grant of LTR as a partner, a parent or on account of  his private life and also on the grounds that his circumstances were not exceptional, However, the decision-maker Mr Wiggins decided to grant him 30 months LTR outside the IRs due to the length of time he had spent in the UK and the SSHD’s failure to consider his application in a timely manner.  </span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt">.   The decision is flawed at each stage of the decision. As has already been found, the decision was taken in a great hurry and the principal reason that it differed from Yasin’s decision and only granted Yakub thirty months discretionary LTR rather than discretionary ILR was because of his offending behaviour. Much of the history of the application and many of the examples of maladministration identified in this judgment were not considered. Furthermore, as the SSHD now accepts, Yakub’s spent convictions should not have been taken into account. It is noteworthy that, when the decision is reconsidered, he will have no unspent convictions and that in October 2014, he had only one minor unspent conviction which was either in fact spent on was on the point of becoming spent. The decision-making process was also flawed in the following respects.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt">The decision wrongly asserted that the application was submitted as ‘dependent children (not paragraphs 296 – 303)’. This was an error since the application was submitted on an SET(M) application form and was made on the basis that Yakub was a dependent child of his applicant father and his mother who was a settled British citizen. As has been seen, this application was primarily under IR paragraph 298  albeit subject to the need of the decision-maker to consider waiving the requirement that Yakub had to have limited LTR at the time of the application. The decision-maker did not give any thought to whether he should exercise his discretion to consider the application under the IRs. Instead, he merely asserted that Yakub did not qualify for leave within the rules. </span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt">The application was not considered on the basis of his relationship with Nassim even though she had been his partner for over five years and they have two young children. This was because, so it was asserted, Yakub had not submitted an application on that basis. However, until evidence of the relationship and of the two children had been submitted and, in any event, the application that was being considered was full and sufficient – albeit by the standards of 2004 – and no further application was sought or expected. In contrast to this somewhat churlish reasoning, it is to be noted that the SSHD decision-maker in March 2003 volunteered to Laila that she should consider applying for registration as a British citizen and, without that helpful but correct intervention, it may have been some years before Laila appreciated that she had become a beneficiary of the change in the law. In relation to the assertion that there was no information about Nassim, the decision-maker was incorrect and, in any case, the decision-maker could and should have sought but did not seek any additional information that was needed about Nassim before the decision was finalised.  That relationship was clearly a volatile one and unusual and, to the conventionally-minded, dysfunctional albeit that it had settled down by the date of the decision. However, the evidence suggests that it had been strained as a result of Yakub’s precarious immigration status over many years and the consequent and on-going stresses and uncertainties that that caused. Moreover, it now appears to be a strong one and there is clearly close and loving contact between Yakub’s two sons and his father, paternal grandmother, uncle and cousins.</span>

In fact, Yakub has two children, the decision-maker had information about Nassim and their two children and, in any event, he could and should have sought further information due to the ten-year delay between the application being submitted and the decision being taken. </span>

It is clear from these comments and from the content of emails sent by the decision-maker to the LO file-holder and further comments to be found in his file note that the principal, if not only, reason for not treating Yakub in a similar way to Yasin and granting him ILR was as a result of his convictions which it was considered had rendered him unsuitable for ILR. Only one of these convictions should have been considered and that is also now spent. Moreover, without belittling the seriousness of four cannabis and one cocaine possession convictions and a battery and a criminal damage convictions, three of these resulted in two small fines and three in low level community-based orders and all but the last conviction were spent. The finding that Yakub was unsuitable for ILR on the basis of those facts was not a reasoned decision and was unsupported by a risk assessment, probation reports, pre-sentence reports or any other information about the convictions and their factual circumstances was unlawful since it was supported by the unlawful consideration of spent convictions and was also unsupported by appropriate evidence and was therefore unjustified since it had been taken without considering material that should have been considered. Yakub should at the very least have been asked for information about these convictions and permitted to make representations about them before they were taken into account. </span>

This was particularly so since the decision accepted that had the application been considered by 2007, his life would probably have taken a different and non-criminal path. The decision also appeared to accept Yakub’s evidence that he would have had no family members to return to had he left the UK to return to live in Kenya.</span>

Although none of them were applied to Yakub, each of them was equally applicable to him. Furthermore, the decision-maker justified his grant of ILR to Yasin by reference to “the mishandling by the SSHD” with the consequence that Yasin’s application “has been outstanding for 10 years”. These deficiencies were equally applicable to Yakub although the decision-maker’s words were wholly inadequate to describe the SSHD’s catalogue of maladministration, errors of judgment, administrative shortcomings, high-handedness, indifference and lack of feeling over a twelve-year period between May 2003 and January 2015. </span>

	      <span style="font-size:8pt">“Exceptional” does not mean “unusual” or “unique”. Whilst all cases are to some extent unique, those unique factors do not generally render them exceptional. For example, a case is not exceptional just because the criteria set out in EX.1 of Appendix FM have been missed by a small margin. Instead, “exceptional” means circumstances in which refusal would result Appendix FM 1.0 Family Life (as a Partner or Parent) and Private Life: 10-Year Routes April 2015 47 in unjustifiably harsh consequences for the individual or their family such that refusal of the application would not be proportionate under Article 8. If the family could all go to the country of return together but they choose to separate, this will not in itself constitute exceptional circumstances. However, the decision maker should not usually make a decision that forces a family to split if there is no criminality to add weight to the public interest in removal. Cases that raise exceptional circumstances that warrant a grant of leave outside the rules are likely to be rare. Where considering whether there are exceptional circumstances, the decision maker should consider all the circumstances relating to the applicant and their family members which have been raised, including as regards wider family members beyond their partner and child (or parent where the applicant is a child). In determining whether there are exceptional circumstances, the decision-maker must consider all relevant factors raised by the applicant and weigh them against the public interest under Article 8.”</span>

It is well-known that for an alternative remedy to be suitable and therefore able to preclude a judicial review of a public body’s decision or decision-making process, the remedy should provide substantially the same or better remedies.

Since the further IA restrictions had been introduced, he had lost the right to challenge any part of the decision on the grounds that it is not in accordance with the law. Thus, his appeal could only be brought against the deportation decision on the sole ground that it was disproportionate and in consequence an infringement of his article 8 rights.</span>

These changes have been supplemented after they were introduced by additional sections 117A – 117D of the NIAA 2002 that were introduced by the IA 2014 and they add to the legislative regime involving the deportation of foreign criminals introduced by the IA 1971 which was extensively added to by the UKBA 2007.</span>

The principal circumstance is where the SSHD deems that his deportation is conducive to the public good. Automatic deportation is provided for those who are sentenced to more than twelve months imprisonment as a result of section 32 of the UKBA 2007 which came into effect on 9 July 2008 but subject to a transitional provision that that section does not apply to convictions and sentences that were completed before that date, an exception that covers Yusuf’s spent convictions since he was released from prison on March 2005 and his sentence was completed on 20 February 2006. </span>

It is also worth remembering the structure of the HRA which, in section 6 prohibits a public authority from acting inconsistently with ECHR rights which applies to the SSHD as well as the Administrative Court and the FtT. Section 3 of the HRA imposes an obligation to construe legislation so far as possible in a way which is compatible with ECHR rights and section 3 requires a court or tribunal must take into account relevant jurisprudence from Strasbourg.</span>

It would appear that the changes in 2012 and 2014 were drafted without any or any adequate consideration of the relatively few foreign criminals whose qualifying sentences were for terms of imprisonment of one year or more but which were not subject to the provisions of the UKBA 2007.</span>

Since he was not in consequence subject to the automatic or mandatory presumption that he continued presence in the UK was not conducive to the public good so that he should be deported that would have arisen had his eighteen-month sentence been completed after 1 August 2008, the SSHD first had to decide in a stand-alone or one-off decision that was based on all relevant facts whether his continued presence in the UK was not conducive to the public good. Only after such a balancing exercise had led to the conclusion that he was non-conducive would he have become liable to be deported and a notice of liability to be deported could have been served. Given the facts of his case, a non-conducive decision was not a forgone conclusion and such a decision would have required a detailed review of all relevant facts and an explanation as to why, despite those facts, he was nonetheless liable to be deported.</span>

The relevance of that potential dichotomy in his case related to his family and private life and, in particular his relationships with Karen and Debra and his four children, his family life with his parents and Yakub and his private life including his employment and the other incidents of a protected private life such as access to health services, pension arrangements, social welfare and such matters as a driving licence and obtaining a mortgage. The decision-maker could place little or no weight on these matters when taking both the initial liability and final deportation decision if the new provisions applied to either of these stages. This is because little or no weight may be placed on a relationship with a partner or with children or on the incidents of a private life for any period when Yusuf was unlawfully present in the UK or on the delay that occurred in reaching a decision on his settlement application or that he would have been granted a favourable decision had his application been decided without any, or any significant unlawful delay or that the SSHD had repeatedly been made aware of his criminal offending and had on each occasions decided not to refer his case to the CCD.</span>

That provision suggests that the provisions of the amended IRs are applicable but against that, it might also be said that they are not ones that should affect the non-conducive decision since that decision does not involve consideration of an article 8 claim.</span>

I do not propose to decide that question however since it is my view that there is a short answer to this conundrum which is that the restrictions contained in the new provisions were not applicable to either stage of the decision-making process. It must be remembered that Yusuf is only susceptible to deportation under the relatively recent regime created by the IA 2014 and the post 2012-versions of the IRs because the SSHD unlawfully and without justification delayed taking the decision in his settlement application for ten years. It would be both unfair and incorrect in principle for the SSHD now to rely on a restrictive interpretation of article 8 that was first promulgated many years after the settlement application should have been decided and in circumstances where, had it been decided earlier, would have produced a favourable decision for Yusuf. </span>

Equally, the requirement that the public interest did not require the removal of a person who was not liable to deportation where that person has a genuine and subsisting parental relationship with a qualifying child and it would not be reasonable to expect the child to leave the United Kingdom was applicable to both Yusuf and Yakub throughout the relevant ten-year period given the unlawful and lengthy delay that they were subjected to.  </span>

In those circumstances, it was grossly unfair and unlawful for the SSHD to rely on the restrictions contained in the statutory code created by the new provisions introduced since 2005 which it could not have relied on had the decision been taken as it should have been before 21 December 2004. In particular, Yusuf should have been entitled to  rely on a family life with his children and his partner Debra and his previous relationship with Karen even though the code of new and amended provisions states that no or only limited reliance may be placed on relationships with a partner or children that occurred at a time when the applicant had no LTR and was an overstayer. Furthermore, he should have been entitled to rely on his private life that had been both built up and interfered with in the same ten-year period.</span>

Thirdly, the deportation decisions should have been taken without being subject to the restrictions arising from the new measures introduced by the code provided for in the 2012 amendments to the IRs and the amendments to the NIAA introduced in 2014. </span>

As a result of that criminality, his deportation was considered to be conducive to the public good and he was liable to deportation since paragraph 396 of the IRs provided that there was a presumption that the public interest required the deportation of someone who was liable for deportation</span>

The decision then examined the evidence that had been received by the CCD and concluded that that showed that he met the requirements of the exception to deportation on the basis of family life with a child or with a partner or the family life exception. </span>

It can be seen that the CCW appeared to direct the caseworker who would take and draft the decision that Yusuf was liable to be deported and should be deported and that the CCW should take deportation action to ensure that he was deported. These directions were issued and handed out before Yusuf had been served with the notice to deport or had been given the opportunity to make submissions and submit documents to the CCD. Thus, when the decision-maker came to make his decision, he was faced with a clear instruction as to the decision he was to come to and had no option but to produce a structured decision giving effect to those instructions. It is not clear whether and to what extent he took account of Yusuf’s submissions and evidence but these would seem to have been irrelevant since the decision was, by the time these were in the hands of the decision-maker, already a foregone conclusion. </span>

For example, significant evidence was overlooked in deciding that Yusuf was liable to deportation, in deciding that he did not have a family life with his children and partner, or a private life or that there were no obstacles to his re-integrating into Kenyan society or that there were no very compelling circumstances why he should not be deported.

The issue was developed in post-hearing written submissions which included the SSHD providing a copy of the BFCP and a brief witness statement explaining it. I dismissed the application with reasons in the draft judgment which was not handed down at the handing down hearing because of the long list of suggested editorial corrections that I was provided with at a late stage. I received a detailed application for permission to appeal from the SSHD’s counsel which adumbrated the SSHD’s submissions in greater detail than had previously been possible. I considered that although my decision to dismiss the stay application remained good, my reasons for reaching that conclusion had not been fully or adequately set out in the draft judgment.

Moreover, they are not merely based on complaints of maladministration but are also based on significant and extensive breaches of the claimants’ human rights. As an example of the inappropriateness of this procedure for these disputes, it was submitted without any evidence from the decision-maker to explain how the decision was quantified and on what it was based that it had been made in error although its nature was not identified. The decision purported to resolve Yasin’s complaint which had previously been withdrawn two days after it had been made on the grounds that the procedure was inappropriate to resolve his complaints. The proposed decision involved the offer of the derisory sum of £500 to Yasin for the entire 10-year period covered by his complaint and it did not even consider the complaints of either Yusuf or Yakub. </span>

The five claimants are each eventually successful asylum seekers who suffered unacceptable delay through maladministration in the provision on behalf of the Secretary of State of the status papers to which their successful asylum application entitled them. They began these judicial review proceedings with the main purpose of obtaining these papers, and in each case that has now been accomplished. They also claim damages, compensation or just satisfaction for the consequences of the delay, asserting that their rights under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Article 1 of the First Protocol had been violated. Speaking generally, they claimed that the effects of not having status papers included that they were unable to work, unable to claim full welfare benefits, unable to travel abroad, and unable to have bank accounts or driving licences, and that if might delay their ability to apply for British citizenship. The respective delays in the provision of status papers were 10½ months, 5½ months, 9 months, 10 months and 7 months. Mr Drabble QC, representing them, reckoned that 4 months was the longest unobjectionable period, after which there would be at the very least a legitimate complaint of maladministration attracting compensation. The amount of individual pecuniary loss claimed is in the order of £1,800 calculated by reference to the full period of the delay less 28 days when the benefits of an asylum seeker continued to be payable. Mr Drabble reckoned that 500 Euros was the kind of level of non-pecuniary award which the European Court of Human Rights in Strasburg might award for an established breach of Article 8 of this kind. We are told that the costs of both sides in these proceedings so far are in the order of £110,000.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:8pt;color:#000000">     It was entirely legitimate to start these proceedings with the main practical aim of obtaining the requisite status papers. That has long since been achieved. The conduct of the proceedings on behalf of the Secretary of State was initially inept. But by the time the matter came for hearing before Treacy J on 5</span>

	      <span style="font-size:8pt;color:#000000"> May 2010, the Secretary of State had in each case openly admitted that the delays had been unacceptable, apologised and set in train an internal complaints procedure with a view to assessing and paying compensation. The Secretary of State had also taken administrative steps to see that delays of this unacceptable kind were avoided for the future. Treacey J held that the position was very much improved. The claimants did not in the main co-operate with the operation of the complaints procedure, contending, no doubt on advice, that irrespective of compensation and notwithstanding the Secretary of State's acceptance of the substance of their complaints and apologies, they were entitled to findings by the court that their Article 8 rights had been violated. The Secretary of State has understandably not been prepared to accept this, since the question whether in a particular case rights under Article 8 have been violated is fact specific, and it would be a question for investigation whether in the case of each individual a necessary minimum level of severity of interference with private or family life had occurred. It was not appropriate for administrators who were not trained lawyers to be asked to make admissions of this kind. Nor was it necessary, since to categorise admittedly unacceptable delay as a violation of Article 8 would have no material effect on the level of compensation – Mr Drabble did not contend that it would – and it could not seriously be contended that characterising admittedly unacceptable delay as a violation of Article 8 would be of any material benefit at all to the claimants.</span>

Treacy J's judgment may be found at [2010] EWHC 1015 (Admin) and it may be referred to for greater detail than this judgment need contain.

But its existence and availability are sufficiently known for it to handle over 10,000 complaints a year. The written guidance is very detailed. It provides for dealing with complaints concerning delay in the delivery of a service. It provides for the assessment and payment of actual financial loss of the kinds said to have been suffered in these cases. It provides for apology and explanation and for non-financial loss where maladministration has directly caused a person exceptional distress, embarrassment, inconvenience, damage to health and so forth. The compensation provisions therefore cover all the main matters of which these claimants complain. There is provision for a review of a first decision. The procedure is not independent, but it does provide a structured means of addressing complaints, which ought to be used in appropriate cases, of which these are examples. It is capable of providing everything material which these claims aim to achieve by a much more economical means than court proceedings. If the complainant is dissatisfied with the outcome, there is the possibility of the case being referred at the instance of a Member of Parliament to the Parliamentary Ombudsman.</span>

The judge related the facts and observed that the offers of compensation could be viewed as generous, since, even if the claimants were to succeed in showing that the delays were unlawful and that there was a breach of Article 8, an award of damages would not necessarily follow. The claimants have their status papers, which must be regarded as the primary aim of the litigation. The judge accepted submissions with reference to </span>

The issue before the court would be fact specific. The judge noted with reference to Rule 54.4 of the Civil Procedure Rules that courts will not normally grant permission to apply for judicial review where there is an adequate alternative remedy which the claimants could use or could have used, and that permission may be refused where the claim is academic. It was true that cases referred to involved statutory complaints schemes, but that was not necessarily determinative. </span>

In response to Mr Drabble's submission that the claimants had a good prospect of establishing unlawfulness and breach of Article 8 which the Secretary of State's letters did not acknowledge and that they were entitled to the vindication of a declaration by the court, the judge was doubtful whether there was any significance to the claimants in the difference between a judicial declaration and the acknowledgement made in the letters. It would be wholly disproportionate to permit the proceedings to continue merely to obtain a judicial declaration. If obtaining a declaration was paramount, it would be hard to see when alternative dispute resolution could ever be used. The judge did not consider that the legal principles were seriously in issue. It was their application to the facts which would be the battleground. … </span>

Both sides must be acutely conscious of the contribution which alternative dispute resolution can make to resolving disputes in a manner which both meets the needs of the parties and the public and saves time, expense and stress. It was too narrow an approach to suppose that complainants were entitled to proceed with the claim for judicial review unless a complaints procedure on offer technically constituted an alternative remedy which would fulfil all the functions of judicial review. The court should not permit, except for good reason, proceedings for judicial review to proceed if a significant part of the issues between the parties can be resolved outside the litigation process. …</span>

	      <span style="font-size:8pt;color:#000000">13.     In our judgment, the judge was entirely correct to decide that the continuation of these proceedings is pointless and disproportionately expensive. Although there may be circumstances in which inviting the court to declare that a person's Article 8 rights have been violated is justified by a legitimate need to establish that and for vindication, the circumstances of the present cases do not begin to provide such justification. The claimants' status papers have long since been issued. The Secretary of State has openly accepted that the delay was unacceptable maladministration and has apologised without reservation. Steps have been taken to rectify the administrative deficiencies which led to the delays. A properly structured complaints procedure is available and has been set in motion to assess compensation. Establishing that the admittedly unacceptable delay resulted, if it did, in a violation of Article 8 rights will not materially enhance the existing law, will not enlarge the ambit of compensation, will not assist in the disposal of other cases, and will not provide the claimants with greater vindication or comfort than they already have. It would constitute an egregious accretion of human rights paraphernalia to a body of learning which is already at risk of overburden, whose real value to the law would be minimal and to the claimants nil. The money already spent on these proceedings after the Secretary of State conceded the case has been disproportionate. To spend further money would be horrendous, to use Lord Woolf's expressive adjective.”</span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt">This decision was reached in the context of a judicial review claim seeking a mandatory order for the provision of status papers that the claimants required in order to pursue an asylum claim. The provision of these papers had been delayed for periods varying from six months down to one and a half months delay that had occurred due to the admitted maladministration of the SSHD. The actual period of delay in each case was four months longer than these various periods but it was accepted that that further period did not amount to maladministration but no admission had been made that the claimants’ article 8 rights had been violated. The claimants also claimed damages and a declaration that their article 8 rights had been violated. By the time the case reached the judge for a substantive hearing, the status papers had been provided and each claimant had been granted asylum. Furthermore, in the light of the admission of delay for the entire period of claimable delay due to maladministration, the SSHD accepted that each claimant was entitled to damages of £1,800. Each claimant had also received a formal apology and the SSHD had taken steps to improve its administration of the process of providing status papers to asylum seekers. The claimants still wished to maintain a claim in the outstanding judicial review for a declaration that their article 8 rights had been breached. It was in that context that the judge stayed the claimants’ surviving claims for compensation and a declaration of breach. </span>

What is clear that the procedure is not available for a complaint of maladministration that cannot be resolved in writing within a very short timescale, that is complex or that presents difficulties of law, factual ascertainment or those more suited to an adversarial dispute resolution process. Moreover, only modest claims for human rights breaches may be claimed and then only in exceptional circumstances and where such claims are within the overriding guidelines relating to speed of resolution, complexity and difficulty. Similarly, only modest and simple claims for the financial impact of delay may be claimed and then only in exceptional circumstances. The claims brought by each claimant falls outside the jurisdiction of the BFCP on each of these various exclusionary principles and are, in consequence, not within the procedure at all. This appeared to have been acknowledged by the SSHD’s Customer Services Operations since it only sought to decide Yasin’s complaint and, after deciding it, it withdrew its decision on the grounds that it had been made by mistake. The failure to consider Yusuf and Yakub’s applications and the mistake it acknowledged in initially deciding Yasin’s application both show that it appreciated that these complaints were outside its jurisdiction. </span>

A further consequence has been the failure to provide decisions in their respective applications for ILR for ten years, stress, anxiety and being subjected to a decision-making process that has lost significant files, placed their applications in the wrong Directorates and many other acts of maladministration. These breaches of article 8 have caused them significant direct loss including legal expenses, pension entitlement, lost wages and to significant general damages.

The SSHD then invited the claimants to submit complaints to the BFCP which the claimants initially did but then withdrew because they were advised that the procedure was wholly inadequate to deal with their complaints. Undeterred, the SSHD then and without warning purported to decide Yasin’s complaints without also attempting to decide those of Yusuf and Yakub. The decision in Yasin’s case offered the derisory and contemptuous sum of £500 without any explanation of how that sum had been arrived at. The SSHD then instructed its counsel to submit that that decision had been withdrawn because it had been mistakenly given.

In ECHR terms, the claim arises out of article 8 and the meaning to be given to the three essential ingredients of the alleged failures – “private life”, “family life” and “interference by a public authority” – must be given meanings that accord to the meanings ascribed to them by the jurisprudence of the ECHR which the Administrative Court is required to apply.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt">In ECHR jurisprudence, the notion of private life is broad and not susceptible to exhaustive definition. In general terms, an individual’s private life which the state must show respect for comprises his or her moral and physical integrity which includes his or her self-fulfilment, the formation and maintenance of relationships with others, self-fulfilment and the ability to develop as an individual without restraint or interference. In short, the protected right is the protection of the right of and the ability to develop self-fulfilment, personal autonomy, human dignity and freedom of thought, word and deed. </span>

The right that is protected is the right of individuals to live together as a family, to develop and maintain family relationships and to be able to support and be supported by other family members and by the collective of close family members. The concept of family extends to all who constitute an individual’s family. Any personal relationship, including unmarried partners, adopted children, step children and children in an informal relationship with an adult akin to a close blood relationship.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt">The notion of the state showing respect for these rights is also somewhat nebulous. In general terms it involves the state or any public authority interfering with an individual’s private or family life in a way that was not reasonably necessary in a democratic society for the protection of others or was not in accordance with the law. The interference may result from acts or omission to act. The state is permitted a wide margin of discretion or “appreciation” in deciding what it can or cannot do. Thus, failures to take steps, for example, to regularise an individual’s status by way of citizenship or the right to reside within the territory of the state that an individual is entitled to does not constitute a failure to respect that individual’s protected right merely because the action was delayed due to staff shortages resulting from a lack of resources. The state has limited resources and is permitted a wide margin of discretion as to how to allocate them. However, the state must allocate its resources in accordance with its own system of regulation and with reasonable fairness so that, for example, it should not deal with those waiting to use its scarce resources in a random order or in a way that gives preferential treatment in an arbitrary manner.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt">In the context of the Said family and their claims in this case, these concepts may be readily crystallised. The state in the form of all those that the SSHD was responsible for was concerned with applications for the right to settle in the UK by three individuals whose applications for settlement were inherently bound up with the status of their wife or mother who was a British citizen with the right of settlement who was living in the UK and who had no right to live in any other country. The three individual claimants were seeking similar rights and were entitled to their applications to be dealt with as rapidly as was reasonably possible and in a manner that accorded with the law. This entitlement arose particularly acutely, in the context of their private and family life, because they were denied many of the necessary ingredients required to enable them to develop and maintain the basic freedoms inherent in those protected rights. They were not permitted to work whilst waiting for their applications to be determined, they could not open bank accounts, borrow money, obtain a driving licence to enable them to travel for work or pleasure, leave the country for family or recreational reasons, or earn sufficiently to enable them to develop their skills and complete their education and training or their business and home life. The resulting struggle to live their lives caused immeasurable harm to the development and maintenance of their life together as a family and with their partners, children and grandchildren. The stress created by the waiting and by the uncertainty and by the worry arising from the repeated unsuccessful attempts to regularise their status were clearly very considerable and extended over many years.</span>

On his case, he was arbitrarily and unfairly threatened with deportation in a way and for reasons that were unlawful and erroneous. Until his status is finally resolved by either the grant of LTR or by deportation, the extent of the interference with his private or family life will remain uncertain. It is clear, however, that the delay before deportation proceedings were initiated and the manner in which they have so far been proceeded with both give rise to a substantial claim even if he is ultimately deported. To a much lesser extent, the same applies to Yakub and the delay in dealing with his settlement application and in its processing since until it is known whether or not he has been granted ILR, the extent of his claim remains uncertain.  </span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt"> The SSHD has characterised these claims as being claims for delay in deciding the claimants’ leave applications and have summarised the causes of that delay as being failed applications for asylum and under the family exercise, the claimants’ unlawful immigration status, serious backlogs of asylum cases and a lack of exceptional circumstances. The SSHD has also, somewhat dismissively, accepted that there was maladministration without identifying that maladministration or its consequences. These descriptions of the claimants’ complaints are cursory, dismissive and wholly inaccurate and are further examples of its disrespect for the claimants’ family and private life. The claimants’ claims are in fact based on the extensive number of acts and omissions by the SSHD over the entire period between 2002 and the present. Each of these many acts and omissions amount individually to maladministration, many were unlawful, negligent, highhanded, thoughtless, arbitrary or dismissive and each showed disrespect to one or more of the claimants’ private or family life. It is the case that the consequences of these acts and omissions included a collective and unlawful failure to provide the decisions by 20 December 2004 so that, in general terms, these were delayed by ten years. But that delay is not of itself the claim that is brought but the fact that, because of the delay, the claimants’ immigration status remained unresolved, was unlawful and of a kind that significantly interfered with their private and family life directly as well as indirectly as a result of the stress, inconvenience, worry, uncertainties and emotional upheaval that this interference caused.</span>

Firstly, there is no right to damages for maladministration and the claimants have no other cause of action available to provide them with a remedy for all the unlawful acts and omissions that have occurred. Secondly, one purpose of the award of “just satisfaction” is to provide a remedy for breaches of the ECHR which are not otherwise remediable. Thirdly, the nature and extent of the SSHD’s breaches and of their adverse consequences are unprecedented and the direct and indirect loss they have caused is also unprecedented. Finally, the economic consequences are very significant. These include extensive legal expenses incurred over the entire period of complaint for which there has been no recovery and no liability to reimburse. They also include extensive loss of income over a ten-year period, loss of state pension rights due to a large contributions deficit, loss of the ability to accrue private pension rights, loss of welfare benefits relating to their employment status, parental status, health and social care and a range of other direct and indirect losses which, if not too remote, are also extensive. </span>
