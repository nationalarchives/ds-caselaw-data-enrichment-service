If a local authority proposes to close a school, it must first—that is, before publishing a formal proposal to that effect—consult on that proposal.  Upon the conclusion of the consultation, the local authority must then (a) formally publish the proposal in accordance with the Code, and (b) publish a report on the consultation it has carried out.  When the proposal is formally published, there will be a 28-day objection period.  At the conclusion of that period, the local authority must determine whether its proposal is to be implemented, and within seven days after the determination publish a summary of the objections received and of its response to the objections.  In exercising its functions—whether at the pre-publication consultation stage, or at the stage of publication of proposals and reporting on the consultation, or at the stage of determining the proposals and reporting on the objections—the local authority is required to act in accordance with mandatory requirements of the Code and to have regard to relevant guidelines contained in the Code.</p>

As mention of some of the case-law will make clear, the Code largely reflects existing standards and principles of public law.  It brings them, however, into a systematic structure that is designed to involve affected parties in a very real way in decisions that are likely to have significant effects on their communities.  The Code in no way divests the appointed decision-making bodies—in this case, the defendant—of their ultimate role in the process.  It does, however, go a long way to ensuring that the decision-making bodies must give to the public a full and meaningful opportunity to engage in the process.  Concrete examples of the process in the present case will illustrate what this means in practice.”</p>

It currently has 48 full-time and 4 part-time pupils on roll (Sept 2014) and projections do not anticipate pupil numbers increasing significantly in the future.  Clun Primary school has the capacity to accommodate 115 full-time pupils but low pupil numbers means that the school has a surplus capacity of 53%.  Coupled with this the school has a higher than average cost per pupil at £4,472.  The cost of maintaining a small school with significant surplus places does not represent efficient use of educational resources or the effective delivery of education and improved outcomes.  The proposal will remove some £286k of backlog maintenance responsibilities and, over a 5 year period, deliver potential revenue savings of £568k through per pupil funding and leadership efficiencies.</p>

Ynysfach Primary is an effective school which has secured good levels of learner outcomes in key performance indicators.  Children moving from Clun Primary to Ynysfach Primary will not be disadvantaged educationally, and will find benefit in some aspects of the move, for example having a larger group of friends, wider extra -curriculum provision and greater opportunities for team games and sporting activities. </p>

With a combined roll of 155 full time and 31 part time, there is sufficient capacity at Ynysfach Primary school to accommodate pupils from Clun Primary school without the need for additional accommodation or building works.  Class sizes and organisation are for the school’s leadership to determine.  As such, capital build does not form part of this proposal.  Building repair and maintenance requirements will be dealt with as part of the Council’s programme for maintaining schools and from the school’s delegated budget responsibilities. </p>

We have never seen the financial data to support the proposal for closure.  There has been no risk assessment of the route although the Road Safety Officer for the authority has been repeatedly requested for one.  This should have been a prerequisite of the proposal.  Our pupils are being denied breakfast club.  Our pupils will be denied early learning provision since it depends on whether their parents can afford to have the means to transport the children to Ynysfach school nursery for the half day programme.  Clun children currently participate in hourly programme of activities after school but they will be denied access to these because of transport constraints.  The cost saving of federalism has not been addressed or provided.  NPT draft document reveals flawed arguments on closure.  It appears to have been selective and misleading in making the case to close.  The situation has been exacerbated by neighbouring schools touting their vacant places. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.80in;margin-right:0.40in">Peter Jenkins Chair of Governors at Clun Primary school states: The Authority has failed to assess the walking route prior to the proposal being brought forward.  The proposal to transfer pupils from Clun Primary to Ynysfach Primary does not meet the criteria set out by the Welsh Government (although the authority has consulted Estyn on the issue, the gap in the standards of education is too great. Core data information, is there a procedural failure by the authority or just a reluctance to provide information.  The proposal does not provide equivalent provision (education or property).  Costs per pupil, teaching cost is a large part of the budget and you get what you pay for.  If you want the best you have to pay for it it’s the children that will benefit.  Estyn’s conclusion “Clun Primary provides good value for money”.  Information for Parents Handbook 2015/2016 – the authority fails to follow its publication to parents and does not respect the right of education in their local community.  The authority has failed to observe the Welsh Assembly’s directive not to reduce the education budget by moving budget allocation from education to transport.  Some pre planning or pre determination on the part of the Authority to improve the status at Ynysfach while allowing Clun’s to deteriorate.  The Authority has failed to provide for projected pupil numbers from 2017.  There is a fundamental omission in the (Community Impact Assessment) report because the school serves the villages of Clyne and Melincourt.  I therefore submit that the authority has failed in the process. Transport costs, the information presented by the Authority is inconsistent and therefore the whole report is in doubt.  Local Development Plan, this is a significant issue to ignore and not to include in the decision making process.  The Authority have not considered the cost of change of school uniforms, they have assumed that this will be covered by the parents in a community when 25% of pupils are entitled to free school meals (another hidden cost).  Savings could be generated by federating; the authority did not provide financial information to justify the reason not to federate. </p>

It is the case that at Clun Primary the most recent building condition assessment for the school assesses the school to be a grade ‘B’ and states that whilst areas internally and externally are generally in fair to good condition, the Kitchen Block is fitted with gas fired heaters that are past their life expectancy and the heating distribution system throughout has reached the end of its lifespan and will require replacement.  Backlog maintenance and accessibility costs amount to some £458k (2014 re-survey). </p>

This reflects the fact that the school consists of two large buildings, and that work is needed to replace some items which have reached the end of their life expectancy.   </p>

However, the Council will be working with Clun Primary school and the teacher associations/trade unions to secure the re-deployment of staff.

For comparative purposes the budget share savings resulting from the Council’s proposal to close Clun Primary school and transfer the pupils to Ynysfach Primary school is also shown in this table.  These savings represent expenditure savings to the Council and, as such, would be available for reinvestment in the general budget for schools. </p>

Under a federated governance (and particularly if this is accompanied by a single leadership structure) there are potential teaching and learning benefits, staff development opportunities and efficiencies that can arise.  A federation also provides the opportunity to co-ordinate curriculum provision and to improve school performance and enhance educational experiences. </p>

In the case of Clun Primary school the school would receive a high level of small school protection in its budget allocation.  Because of this, federation would not address the significant cost inefficiency in maintaining a small, high per pupil cost school nor, compared to a single school, would it necessarily achieve efficiencies through removing duplication, for example, in a federation both schools would be inspected separately by Estyn and there would be separate expenditure trails to manage and audit. </p>

It has implemented a Strategic School Improvement Programme that will help ensure that the right schools are in the right places and that they are capable of delivering an education fit for children and young people in the 21st Century.  The Strategic School Improvement Programme informs the planning and decision making processes that will enable the Council to secure first class schools, delivering high standards of teaching and learning - for now and into the future.  At the heart of the programme is the delivery of quality educational experiences that encourage and support pupil development - experiences that meet the aspirations of young learners, enhancing and enriching their lives and their life opportunities. </p>

As a result of this there will be changes which will involve opening new schools, closing existing schools, merging or amalgamating schools, federating schools and promoting new initiatives that support collaborative working between schools.  The changes will be necessary to improve standards of education, reduce surplus capacity, reduce large building repair bills and ensure the right schools in the right places for both English and Welsh medium education together with provision for those pupils with additional learning needs. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.07in">In a federation schools are managed by a single governing body which takes decisions about such matters as staffing structures and expenditure.  Under a single leadership and governance there are potential teaching and learning benefits, staff development opportunities and efficiencies that can arise from a federated arrangement.  A single governing body will be able to pool resources, share staff and facilities.  A federation also provides the opportunity to co-ordinate curriculum provision or teaching and learning strategies for the benefit of the pupils and staff to improve school performance and enhance educational experiences.  Likewise, these benefits could be delivered at a single site school. </p>

Whereas this provides the opportunity for efficiencies in school based expenditure, for example employing one head teacher rather than two releases a significant amount of money to be used elsewhere at the schools, Pontrhydyfen Primary school would continue to be supported by higher than average per pupil costs.  As such, there would be no opportunity for financial reinvestment into the overall central budget for schools.  In a federation, schools remain separate legal entities retaining their name, registered pupils and budget.  Because of this, the federation would not address the significant cost inefficiency in maintaining a small, high per pupil cost school nor, compared to a single school, would it necessarily achieve efficiencies through removing duplication, for example both schools would be inspected separately by Estyn and there would be separate expenditure trails to manage and audit. </p>

It contended that 5 of the options would produce savings which were greater than proposed by NPTCBC. It went on to say that “these are by no means the only options or combinations (e.g. Pontrhydyfen and Cwmafan, Pontrhydyfen and Bryn and Cwmafan, Pontrhydyfen and Cwmafan and Tonmawr etc etc.) that should have been detailed within the proposals and which could still be considered fully by the LEA (and which we at Pontrhydyfen are in no way excluding and would be equally keen to consider if they save Pontrhydyfen School); but rather represent examples of workable solutions that can easily (be) achieved by working together.”</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.00in">Schools receive funding based on pupil numbers. The more pupils in a school, the more money will be available for the head teacher and governing body to be able to resource the school both with staff and physical resources. One key factor in improving standards of education in schools is the quality of the teaching that children receive, and with the greater resources available the more opportunities will exist to train and support staff often from within the school itself. Larger schools build teams of staff who can share expertise and good practice, and who can work in partnership to improve aspects of curriculum delivery to meet the needs of the children in their care. Schools with more than one class in each year group can divide their workload, and shared teaching is possible which means staff can teach to their particular strengths, which can further benefit pupils.    As Estyn report in ‘School Size and Education effectiveness’ December 2013 ‘In large and medium sized primary schools, it may be more likely that staff have a wider range of expertise and knowledge of specific themes, topics and subjects that can enrich the curriculum for pupils’. </p>

In every school there is an agreed order for children to access dining facilities, however large or small a school may be. In a larger school such as Cwmafan Primary, management systems have been set up to ensure that children can access the facilities with the minimum of disruption, and the avoidance of  waiting in queues for any length of time, for example by serving lunch for different groups over specific time periods. This is very common practice in schools across the authority, and is seen as good pupil organisation and management.  </p>

Extra children will not have an adverse impact on these systems and the space available can easily accommodate the numbers of children affected by this proposal.  The kitchen facility was built with the potential to supply meals to schools within the Afan Valley in case of kitchen failure elsewhere, and will have no difficulty in managing to provide extra meals. </p>

The greater range of ages within a class however makes teaching far more difficult and often means that more able children are disadvantaged.

The proposal states there is potential and flexibility for a change of room usage to ensure sufficient classroom capacity to accommodate pupils who would otherwise attend Pontrhydyfen Primary School. However, the proposal does not discuss any associated costs. This capacity issue is relevant to families because younger siblings of pupils presently attending Pontrhydyfen Primary School may find it difficult to gain admission to Cwmafan Primary School in the future.

The proposal has considered reasonably well an overview of the outcomes, provision and leadership and management in Cwmafan infant and junior schools and Pontrhydyfen Primary School. The overview is a reflection of the most recent Estyn inspection reports and the local authority’s view and categorisation on the quality of leadership, and outcomes at the schools. The proposal’s summary of outcomes at all three schools is concise and clear. It is Estyn’s opinion that impact of revised admission arrangements will lead to very little disruption to pupils’ learning. However, the proposal does not evaluate the potential impact of transferring from one school to the other on pupils well enough or describe how the local authority will manage this process. The proposal fairly identifies that there will be very little impact upon transition arrangements to secondary school.

Applying the formula for measuring the capacity of schools shows that the current usage of rooms at Cwmafan Primary School provides for 398 full-time places and 96 part-time places. Use and designation of rooms is determined by individual schools in conjunction with the Council. Excluding rooms set aside for nursery provision, the schedule of accommodation for the present Infant and Junior school buildings shows 12 class bases; 6 in the Infant school building and 6 in the Junior school building. However, there is a range of rooms of suitable size within the combined footprint of the school that could be re-designated as class bases without the need for capital build or structural adaption. </p>

Many of the questions and points raised during the consultation period have not been addressed or answered either fully or in most cases not at all.  The views of the pupils, parents, grandparents and the general public have not been considered at all whilst reaching the present decision, including the social and economic impact it will have on the families of Pontrhydyfen.  The only bus trial was carried out midmorning when school traffic conditions are not being replicated and do not in any way consider the chaotic and dangerous situation that presently exist. - <marker name="tab"/>The bus route and the plans for the car park behind the school needs to be robustly looked into before any decision can be made.  The lack of nursery provision and the proposal to charge parents for a possible bus space one-way is disgusting.  You are purposefully causing a barrier to children accessing education.  This will result in children needing to catch up with their peers who have the advantage of living in Cwmafan and being in a learning environment already for 1 / 2 years. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.64in">The local authority has indicated in its proposals to provide transportation for pupils of statutory school age currently attending Bryn primary school but no such reassurances have been given to pupils attending Pontrhydyfen primary school unless they reside outside the 2 mile radius. This will impact upon pupils who live in Oakwood and who will be required to walk to school from the age of 5 (statutory) along the B4286 which will require them to cross that road at least once without any indication of safe crossings being made available.  These pupils will also have to cross other busy roads in Cwmafan where no school crossings exist. I do not consider the Sustrans route (cycle route along the old Swansea Bay &amp; Rhondda Railway Line) safe due to its’ lack of lighting for winter months and the many secluded areas that exist along that route.  Concerns over where pupils will be ‘dropped off’ and ‘picked up’ from particularly if regular bus stops on Depot Road are to be used.  A robust provision of nursery education helps our young people develop and creates a strong educational ethos both in pupils and families.  This decision could place additional burdens upon families as they strive to ensure their children are able to benefit from the nursery education provision available with the authority.   Closure will result in young families being asked to find funding for transport and to make their own arrangements to collect them from school at the end of the nursery session.  This could result in children not attending nursery provision.  If the decision is to transfer all pupils to Cwmafan Primary School then the pupil numbers would significantly exceed Cwmafan’s current capacity any building works at Cwmafan would result in the loss of facilities and possible overcrowding in play areas.  The full detailed cost needs to be made available to all prior to any final decision being made.  The significant amount of work coupled with the additional costs of bus dropping off point improvements and transport costs cast serious doubts over any suggested savings.  Federation as an option – federate Bryn Primary School, Pontrhydyfen Primary School and Tonmawr Primary School, or federate Pontrhydyfen Primary School and Tonmawr Primary School alongside a federation between Cwmafan Primary School and Bryn Primary School. </p>

The proposed route for the children to walk is dangerous, the track is unlit, slippery when wet and runs along a fast flowing river.  The busy road has long stretches of unpaved areas.

The additional traffic expected to impact on Cwmafan because of this proposal and the separate proposal to close Bryn Primary should amount to two buses, timed to arrive at no later than 8.40am to minimise any further disruption in the area with parents dropping off pupils for the start of the school day.  </p>

Additionally alongside the consultation report a 53 page document reviewing alternative options has been made available, outlining potential advantages and disadvantages, staffing considerations, financial implications both potential savings and costs including estimated additional works and transport as appropriate, and an officer comment explaining why the options are not the preferred choice.  These include various combinations including building a new school, amalgamation of Tonmawr and Pontrhydyfen primaries, a federation of Bryn, Pontrhydyfen and Tonmawr primary schools and a federation of Bryn, Pontrhydyfen, Tonmawr and Cwmafan primary schools.   </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.64in">It is contended, therefore, that the option of federation, in all relevant combinations, has been fully considered.  In a federation schools are managed by a single governing body which will take decisions about such matters as staffing structures and expenditure.  Under a single leadership and governance there are potential teaching and learning benefits, staff development opportunities and efficiencies that can arise from a federated arrangement.  A single governing body will be able to pool resources, share staff and facilities.  A federation also provides the opportunity to co-ordinate curriculum provision or teaching and learning strategies for the benefit of the pupils and staff to improve school performance and enhance educational experiences.  Likewise, these benefits could be delivered at an amalgamated school.  In a federation, schools remain separate legal entities retaining their name, registered pupils and budget.  Because of this, the federation would not necessarily achieve efficiencies through removing duplication, for example both schools would be inspected separately by Estyn and there would be separate expenditure trails to manage and audit. Federation is not recommended as it is considered that in this instance the benefits from a federation do not outweigh the benefits gained through the proposal to close Pontrhydyfen Primary school and make arrangements for the pupils to receive their education at Cwmafan Primary school. </p>

The two examples cited are the amalgamation of Velindre, Ysgol Hendre and Bryncoch PRU, and the Federated Schools of the Afan Valley.  There are fundamental differences in these two examples when compared to the federation/amalgamation options that have been put forward in this case.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.64in">Velindre, Ysgol Hendre and Bryncoch PRU offer specialist provision for mainly secondary pupils with a range of challenging needs including social, emotional and behavioural difficulties, children with autistic spectrum disorder, and with moderate or severe learning difficulties.  This federation came into existence due to the specialised nature of the schools involved and the recognition that current practice within the authority needed to adapt as a result of changes in demand for places and the needs of the children currently being educated in the county borough.  It was considered the best model for the schools in this instance but clearly operates under very different circumstances to those of a mainstream primary school. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.64in">The Federated Schools of the Afan Valley also operates in a distinct way due to the nature of this particular federation.  This involves 4 primary schools and one secondary school, and has a management composition to reflect this structure.  Within the federation there is one overall head teacher with 2 phase leaders (for primary and secondary) who do not have a substantive teaching commitment.  The responsibilities of these individuals are substantial and are above those expected of a deputy or assistant head teacher in a primary school.  There are also 4 lead learners who are mainly based in each primary school, and who perform the role similar to that of a deputy head teacher, and includes a reduced teaching timetable. In the secondary sector there are approximately 6 TLR holders, and an Additional Learning Needs Co-ordinator operates across all the schools, again with limited teaching responsibility.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.64in">The Review of Alternative Options document included estimated financial modelling based on the appropriate number of staff with the appropriate level of teaching commitment that is deemed necessary to ensure the effective delivery of the primary curriculum.  It is not dissimilar to that currently operating within the Federated Schools of the Afan Valley within the primary sector, although clearly the extra management support from the secondary sector would not be present or affordable.  In conclusion it can be seen that a more cost effective and sustainable model can be achieved through the closure of Pontrhydyfen and the transfer of pupils to Cwmafan. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.64in">As stated in the consultation documentation and related reports, with any school closure there will be changes to current staffing arrangements and this proposal will impact on school staff employment.  Closure of Pontrhydyfen Primary school will mean that existing staff contracts need to be terminated and, in view of the requirement for notice of redundancy to be given by 31st May to take effect on 31st August, notice has been issued to staff. Had this not been done then teaching contracts would have continued to 31st December 2015 even if Cabinet decided on 10th June to implement the proposal to close the schools on 31st August. To support staff, the management of change process applies.  Officers from the Council have met with staff and commenced the necessary processes to ensure staff are able to access their statutory rights and entitlements.  Should the proposal not be implemented then offers of new employment upon existing terms and conditions will be made to as many staff as the schools’ budgets permit.  The Council has a proven track record for supporting staff in such situations, working with the teacher associations/trade unions to secure, as needs arise, alternative employment for staff. </p>

However it is possible that future changes in the budget formula could make many schools at risk of financial difficulties and it is a matter that Cabinet Members needed to be aware of. Pontrhydyfen Primary is currently in a deficit situation (despite having a part time head teacher for most of this academic year), and while a recovery plan has been agreed it is still possible that next year the situation could worsen.  Redundancy processes which may or may not be taking place at other schools would be the responsibility of the leadership at that school and has no part of this proposal. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I start with three matters of general observation. Firstly, the closure of a school in a small community will often raise great concern, as one would expect. Parents like those of the children at these two schools want the best for their children, and can form strong bonds with the school and its teachers. As this case shows with clarity the prospect of change and of their children having to go to another larger school has excited considerable concern. It is quite natural that a parent’s view of what is best for his or her child may not coincide with the views of the Education Authority where the closure of a school is concerned.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">But secondly, resources are not infinite, and the Education Authority must do what it can to achieve the appropriate educational standards within such resources as exist. It had to grapple with the fact that these two schools are operating at well below capacity, and that there was evidence that the removal of pupils to larger schools could achieve better educational outcomes for them. In dealing with questions and objections, the Council is a under a duty to provide the relevant information which has informed their proposals. But there are some limits. Thus, a description of the work which needs to be done as backlog maintenance is appropriate. The supply of detailed costings, as though one were drawing up a schedule of works, is not, and would place too great a burden on an authority.  </p>

Despite the fact that NPTCBC now contend that such costs are irrelevant under the Code, when the Consultation and Objection process were under way, it went to the trouble of identifying them repeatedly as a cost which could be incurred. I do not accept that that was an error, nor that they are irrelevant under the code. As a matter of fact any redundancy payments made to an employee at a school to be closed is a cost incurred as a result of the closure, which must come out of the education budget. I agree with Ms Hannett that the words in the Code</p>

In the Consultation Document it was identified that there would be an additional transport cost, and some capital spent on roadworks. The annual revenue cost was identified as of the order of £ 25,000 per annum, as was set out in the Consultation Report. Later work identified that the provision made (the 49 seater bus) could accommodate all children attending Pontrhydyfen within the catchment who lived further from Cwmafan than Pontrhydyfen.

I shall now address the point raised concerning section 31(3) (C) and (D) of the SCA 1981. I have no doubt that when considering whether NPTCBC acted lawfully at the time of its decision, it would be wrong to consider evidence of what has subsequently occurred. But what I am bound to do, is to consider whether, if the costs of redundancy had been taken into account, it is highly likely that  the decision would not have been substantially different. While I accept that it would have been sensible to assume that some of the employees at the two schools would have been re-employed, the fact of the matter is that no assessment was made at the time. I therefore consider it appropriate to look at the worst case figures. Even if one assumed that everyone would be made redundant, and that the potential redundancy costs were of the same order as that which would be paid to the deputy head teacher, the figures produced at the hearing, which were not the subject of challenge, show that there would still have been savings as a result of the proposal, plus some but unspecified amount for the disposal of the buildings. One must not lose sight of the fact that the reasons for the proposals were not only based on costs. These are two schools operating at well below capacity, where there was quite a substantial amount of material, relied on by NPTCBC, that the quality of educational provision would be improved as a result of the proposals. </p>
