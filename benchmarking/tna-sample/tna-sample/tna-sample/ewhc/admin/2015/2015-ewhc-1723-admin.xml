Henceforward, any person who legitimately acquires content (music, film, books) can copy that work for his or her own private use without infringing copyright. It can be copied onto other formats or stored in the cloud provided it is for private, non-commercial use. It can now be reproduced without even the theoretical risk of that person being pursued as an infringer of copyright. That purchaser cannot, however, under the exception, copy that content and give it to a family member, friend or colleague and cannot copy it for any commercial use.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">A report prepared for the European Commission in May 2014 by the economic consultants CRA, “Assessing the economic impact of adopting certain limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights in the EU – analysis of specific policy options” (“the CRA Report”), pointed out that different solutions had been adopted in different Member States. As of the date of that report (which was a few months before the coming into effect of the new section 28B in the UK) the authors pointed out that no exceptions for private copying existed in the UK and Ireland; and that in Malta, Cyprus and Luxembourg private copying was treated as <span style="font-style:italic">de minimis</span>.  In those Member States where an exception for private copying had been introduced the exception generally stretched beyond personal private copying and covered, for instance, copying to family and friends and by way of gifts, i.e. a wider variety of non-commercial copying.  The CRA Report recorded that 21 out of the 28 EU Member States had chosen to introduce private copying exceptions coupled to schemes for compensation funded through levies (ibid, page 87, fn136). In such States government backed or imposed levy schemes had in the main been introduced by way of the imposition of a levy charged on consumers of blank media (CDs, DVDs, Blu-Ray discs etc) and equipment (MP3 players, printers, PCs, etc).  The levies were structured differently but in the main, followed two principal routes. First, the imposition of a charge based upon a percentage of the manufacturing or import price implying that the harm sustained by rightholders was a function of the price of the media or device.  Secondly, a charge which increased with the memory capacity of the products upon the assumption that the greater the memory or storage capacity the greater the potential for private copying. Revenues collected were then distributed to rightholders via collecting societies albeit that the manner of re-distribution varied greatly.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In the UK pressure to introduce a personal use exception started to increase. In 2010 the Government launched a review (under the auspices of Professor Ian Hargreaves) into intellectual property generally; one recommendation of the resultant report was the introduction of a relatively broad based exception for private own use copying. However, there was also a strong view expressed that levy systems were bureaucratic and not necessarily conducive to efficiency or even innovation.  This was of course a controversial view and one that (as many commentators recognised) tended to split along predictable and partisan lines with content creators disagreeing and content acquirers and copying device sellers agreeing.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is right to record that the Government had a strong predisposition which it set out clearly in the consultation document.  It was that levy schemes were generally a bad thing. Consumers did not wish to pay a levy which was akin to a tax on an activity which they strongly believed was legal or ought to be legal; and, therefore, any new exception to copyright should not be accompanied by a levy or compensation scheme.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">However, given the framework for analysis under the Directive, which <span style="text-decoration:underline">conditioned</span> any exception to copyright for personal use which caused harm to rightholders upon payment of compensation, the Government’s room for manoeuvre was significantly constrained. The Government therefore placed its cards upon the table and stated that, to avoid having to introduce a compensation scheme, it intended <span style="font-style:italic">only</span> to create an exception which either caused no (zero) harm to rightholders or <span style="font-style:italic">de minimis</span> harm and this meant that the exception would be strictly limited to private own, non-commercial, use by legitimate <span style="font-style:italic">bona fide</span> purchasers of content.  In this way the Government sought to reconcile its desire to introduce a personal use exception with its parallel desire to avoid having to introduce a burdensome compensation scheme.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This issue in law thus became crystallised: Would the introduction of a limited private use exception cause no more than minimal or zero harm? The Government’s provisional view was that if a strictly limited exception of this kind was introduced then there would <span style="text-decoration:underline">in fact</span> be zero or <span style="font-style:italic">de minimis</span> harm.  This conclusion was however based upon two economic premises which are at the heart of a number of the Grounds of challenge advanced in this litigation. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The first premise was that the <span style="text-decoration:underline">only</span> relevant “harm” that would, in principle, need to be compensated for was the risk to rightholders of lost, duplicate sales i.e. the only harm for which compensation would be due were the sales that were lost as a consequence of legitimising what were hitherto unlawful acts. As to this the Secretary of State concluded that whilst consumers considered that they should be entitled to copy content they had acquired they were not, to any material degree, prepared to go out and purchase duplicate copies in order to be able to achieve multiple use. In other words there was no automatic correlation between the desire to copy and lost sales; if the former was constrained the latter would not necessarily occur. And as such if a limited exception to copyright was introduced this would not impact upon duplicate sales.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The second premise was that either fully, or very substantially, sellers of content had <span style="text-decoration:underline">already</span> priced-in to the initial sale price the fact that consumers treated content that they purchased as fair game when it came to copying for personal use; in other words when a purchaser acquired content the seller had already factored into the price an assumption that the consumer would in fact copy that work even if it was, in law, unlawful so to do.

The Defendant instructed the Intellectual Property Office (“IPO”) (an Executive Agency within the Defendant) to conduct a series of detailed impact assessments. The Defendant accepted that, ultimately, the question whether any material “harm” of the type referred to would flow from the introduction of the new exception to copyright would turn upon “<span style="font-style:italic">empirical evidence</span>”. The IPO instructed external consultants to conduct empirical analysis into the extent to which post-sale copying was already factored into initial pricing.  Research was conducted in the music, film and book sectors with a control conducted in the software sector (it being a control because software is outside the scope of the Directive).</p>

The explicit justification was that the value of the copying that would occur under the new exception had been and would in the future be built into the initial price.  As such there was no “harm” to rightholders for which a compensation scheme would be required. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In this judicial review the Claimants challenge the assumptions adopted by the Defendant as both legally and factually incorrect and flawed, and they also challenge the inferences and conclusions drawn from the evidence actually collected.  They also attack the procedure adopted in the consultation submitting that the Secretary of State was so determined to introduce the copyright exception without any compensation scheme that he predetermined the consultation and closed his mind to the evidence and generally acted unfairly in that consultative process.  Finally, the Intervener submits that the economic effect of the introduction of section 28B (which is to confer a quantifiable advantage upon the “tech-industry”, and in particular cloud service providers) is contrary to Articles 107 and 108(3) TFEU which prohibit certain types of State aid which have not been notified to the EU Commission.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">A precursor to all of these disputed issues arises from the Claimants’ submissions that I must adopt either a merits (right/wrong) review or an intense judicial review to decide whether the Secretary of State acted lawfully.  The Secretary of State submits, to the contrary, that this is a traditional judicial review and he enjoys the widest possible margin of appreciation and that the Court simply has no jurisdictional competence to adjudicate upon many of the issues arising. This disagreement raises some important points of principle about the approach that I should adopt to the issues, not least because they reflect different types of dispute: some are pure points of law; others are by their nature hard-edged questions of fact; and others have a far greater element of evaluative judgments attached to them. The issue is complicated further in that some are issues of EU law whilst others are matters of domestic law.</p>

In my judgment it is sufficient therefore to result in the decision being rendered unlawful.  However, this has potentially complex implications for section 28B.  It does not necessarily result in that section being struck down.  It is, in theory, possible for the Secretary of State to re-investigate the issue in order to address the evidential gap which now prevails.  If he does this then one possible outcome would be that the gap that I have identified is plugged and the present decision becomes justified.  Another outcome might be that following further investigation the gap in the evidence remains un-plugged in which case the Secretary of State could either repeal section 28B or introduce a compensation scheme. A third possibility is that the Secretary of State simply decides to introduce a compensation scheme without more.</p>

Existing differences in the exceptions and limitations to certain restricted acts have direct negative effects on the functioning of the internal market of copyright and related rights. Such differences could well become more pronounced in view of the further development of trans-border exploitation of works and cross-border activities.

The acts of reproduction concerned should have no separate economic value on their own. To the extent that they meet these conditions, this exception should include acts which enable browsing as well as acts of caching to take place, including those which enable transmission systems to function efficiently, provided that the intermediary does not modify the information and does not interfere with the lawful use of technology, widely recognised and used by industry, to obtain data on the use of the information.

When evaluating these circumstances, a valuable criterion would be the possible harm to the rightholders resulting from the act in question. In cases where rightholders have already received payment in some other form, for instance as part of a licence fee, no specific or separate payment may be due. The level of fair compensation should take full account of the degree of use of technological protection measures referred to in this Directive.

Although differences between those remuneration schemes affect the functioning of the internal market, those differences, with respect to analogue private reproduction, should not have a significant impact on the development of the information society. Digital private copying is likely to be more widespread and have a greater economic impact.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In November 2010 the Government commissioned Professor Ian Hargreaves (assisted by a review team) to conduct an independent review of intellectual property and growth in the digital market. The review team was tasked to express a conclusion as to whether the current intellectual property legal framework was sufficiently well designed to promote innovation and growth in the UK economy. Professor Hargreaves concluded that the relevant framework was falling behind that which was required and he was of the view that the UK could not afford to permit an outdated legal framework to impede emerging business sectors. Chapter 5 of the Report (“the Hargreaves Report”) was entitled “Copyright: Exceptions for the Digital Age”. In paragraphs [5.27ff] Professor Hargreaves addressed the question of private copying and format shifting. He observed that EU law permitted Member States to introduce exceptions for private copying provided that fair compensation was paid and he noted that in other EU Member States private copying exceptions were supported by levies on copying equipment. He observed:</p>

This was predicated upon two principal conclusions both of which are relied upon by the Secretary of State but, in varying degrees, challenged by the Claimants. First, that private copying was “<span style="font-style:italic">…part of the normal use of devices</span>”; and secondly, that since rightholders were well aware of consumer behaviour that the benefit of unrestrained private copying was “<span style="font-style:italic">…already factored into the price that rights-holders are charging</span>”.

We see no economic argument for adding an extra charge to these devices in order to authorise reasonable private acts which are part of the normal use of devices. Indeed, without that copying, normal use of those devices would be largely restricted to playing music or films bought online. We are not aware of strong evidence of harm to rights-holders done by this kind of private copying in the normal course of using digital equipment to play works. There is considerable evidence of overall public benefit from consumer use.</p>

He cited by way of illustration the evidence of Mr Martin Brennan who invented the Brennan J7 Music Player which enabled consumers to store music from CDs which they had purchased onto its hard disk making them easily accessible for playing from one point. Professor Hargreaves stated that it was hard to see this product as an undesirable innovation. However, the Advertising Standards Authority had ruled that advertisements for the Brennan J7 should include a warning that using it involved copyright infringement. Mr Brennan made the following submission to the review team:</p>

However, the exception should be drafted on a sufficiently narrow and limited basis to ensure that it caused no significant harm to rights-holders and, in consequence, did not “<span style="font-style:italic">…give rise to a requirement for payment of compensation</span>”.</p>

Accordingly, the amount of time during which evidence could be collected was limited. Nonetheless, the conclusion arrived at was that the exception in Article 5(2)(b) of the Directive should be implemented but in a manner which limited the exception to those areas where copying was already taken account of in initial pricing decisions and that, as a concomitant of this, no compensatory mechanism or levy scheme should be introduced. This was an important conclusion and provided an analytical blueprint which was adopted by the Government subsequently and which was ultimately reflected, albeit in modified form, in the new section 28B CDPA 1988.</p>

Mr Saini QC drew this to my attention for a number of reasons. First, because (cf. Rogers Report page 15, paragraph 3.1) the authors cite economic literature which distinguished between economic harm (to rightholders) and consumer value. The point made was that the fact that consumers valued the ability to copy content did <span style="text-decoration:underline">not</span>, at least necessarily, equate to economic harm to content producers. Consumers might extract incremental value by copying content but absent the ability to copy the consumer would not necessarily go out and purchase a duplicate of the copyrighted product. Hence the subjective value attached to copying by the consumer did not without more translate into lost sales on the part of the producer. This is relevant to the conceptualisation of “harm” for the purpose of Article 5(2)(b) (See Issue II at Section G below).</p>

It will shift outwards if copyright exceptions are increased (as consumers are assumed to gain, hence their valuations increase), and shift inwards if exceptions are reduced.</p>

In economic papers, such as Liebowitz (1985) and Boldrin and Levine (2002, 2004), there is an argument that the “first sale” of a work (e.g. book, song, etc) can embody the entire subsequent flow of revenues from copying and re-selling that work. This is a much stronger argument, which can be used to argue against strong intellectual property rights. In short, the “first sale” argument assumes that the initial buyer has a good ability to on-sell the work (hence the first sale price is high and generates a good return to agents and creators).</p>

These costs, including the costs of negotiating and paying for licences, are likely to prevent new businesses, particularly innovative start-ups, entering the UK market for cloud-based services. Moreover, if such services are licensed, consumers may have to pay copyright owners twice for the same right to copy content – once at the point of sale, and again via a subscription to private cloud storage. Certain cloud and music services are already licensed in the UK, although the extent to which these licences relate to the narrow act of private copying under consideration, as opposed to value-added services, is currently unclear. It seems reasonable that people should be able to copy content they have bought, to a private cloud to the same extent that they are able to copy it to a personal device. But we would not want to undermine the ability of copyright owners to charge for value-added services based on the provision of content. We would welcome evidence on the impact of existing copyright law on the development and provision of cloud services, and the potential impact of a private copying exception on future developments in this area”.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“7.44 Some economists liken copying within a private circle to shared uses of traditional media, such as private sharing of books or family television viewing. Someone buying a television for their family home will be prepared to pay more for it as it will benefit their whole family. In a similar way, it may be possible to factor the value of family copying into the purchase price of content, compensating for potential harm to copyright owners. To the extent that this behaviour already occurs, it may already be factored in to prices to some degree.</p>

Sharing a work by copying it results in multiple independent copies that can be used in parallel, and may replace sales. It is unclear whether harm caused by sharing, however limited, can be fully compensated through the price mechanism. The extent to which consumers consider copying for family to be reasonable behaviour is also unclear. In view of these uncertainties, an exception, that permits copying of content within the private sphere, is not currently the Government’s preferred option. However, the Intellectual Property Office intends to commission research into pricing of creative content to further explore this issue”.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">To accompany the Consultation the IPO conducted an initial impact assessment which considered the various options for implementing a private copying exception. Option 0 (i.e. zero) was “do nothing” such that private copying remained illegal; Option 1 (the strongly preferred option) concerned the introduction of a narrow private copying exception permitting copying content legally owned by an individual to another medium or device owned by that individual for their own personal use; Option 2 was to introduce the private copying exception but permitting copying by an individual’s family or domestic circle; and Option 3 would cover content which could be copied and which did not need to be legitimately owned or purchased by the individual performing the copying. This assessment was published at the time of the Consultation so consultees were able to see the more detailed reasoning underpinning the “predisposition”.</p>

This “initial assumption” was based upon an economic analysis set out in an “Evidence Base” which was summarised in pages 6-10 of the assessment. On page 10 the following was stated:</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“Private copying is already widespread, and infringement is not pursued, suggesting any costs to copyright owners and benefits to consumers are already priced in to the purchase price of content. We expect any additional costs not already priced in to be minimal or zero, and capable of being compensated through the purchase price. As such there will be no overall economic cost to copyright owners. In addition to our upcoming consultation on the issue, the IPO is commissioning research to investigate the relationship between the prices charged for content and the permissions to copy which are included”.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This conclusion (that all additional copying was, and could be, compensated through the purchase price) was said to be supported by economic literature in particular: the Rogers Report; the Kretschmer Report; and, and an article by Hal Varian “Copying and Copyright” (2005) in the Journal of Economic Perspectives.</p>

To this end independent research would be commissioned:</p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“The issue of harm from a private copying exception needs to be addressed and the consultation document is looking for evidence on this issue. Currently, theoretical arguments by Hal Varian (developing Liebowitz’s concept of “indirect appropriability”)…shows that if sharing takes place, a producer is likely to sell fewer units of the work. In the above examples the potential harm to copyright owners is generally assumed to be through lost sales caused by sharing. The less sharing is possible, the less there is potential for harm.</p>
	  </content>
	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">However, since a consumer derives greater value from content they are able to do more with, a producer could charge more for it. Varian says “…if willingness-to-pay for the right to copy exceeds the reduction in sales, the seller will increase profit by allowing that right”. In a free market, demand and supply will settle on a price for goods where consumer and producer surplus are maximised. It is possible that both consumers and producers will benefit from permitting private copying – consumers from being able to do more with content and producers from being able to charge more.</p>
	  </content>
	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">There is also evidence that the value of copying is already built into purchase prices. For online goods such copying is usually licensed and so included in the price where the retailer (e.g. Amazon) and copyright owner licence the buyer to use the digital file in certain ways including how they can copy and store the file. For example iTunes UK limits the number of devices an electronic music file can be copied to while Amazon UK allows an unlimited amount of copies to be made for personal use. The lack of difference between the prices of content on different MP3 download sites with different terms of use suggests that the ability to copy content does not impact on purchase price to any significant degree. However we will be commissioning economic research in order to test these assumptions during the consultation period”.</p>

During this period the IPO hosted a series of events in London and throughout the UK to encourage interested parties to express their views. The Consultation stimulated 471 responses from a range of organisations large and small. Mr Robin Stout, a Deputy Director of Copyright Policy at the IPO, produced Witness Statement evidence in these proceedings in which he explained that during the course of policy development in excess of 250 meetings on copyright exceptions occurred which, inevitably, included those representing the interests of copyright holders. He observed that the position adopted by the Third Claimant in these proceedings (UK Music) was not wholly representative of the views expressed by its membership. During meetings with HM Treasury some members of UK Music felt that they could accept a narrowly defined private copying exception without levy upon the basis that this largely reflected current reality. He observed that the responses received demonstrated distinct divergences of views but he accepted that a particular topic of concern was the actual <span style="text-decoration:underline">extent</span> to which the proposed exception would have an impact upon the incomes of rightholders.</p>

As noted…below, we were given no evidence that such storage was being licensed and were told that within broader licences such storage was usually “zero-charged”. Rather, the concern of the industry seemed to be to extract licence revenue from non-storage “value added” cloud services such as iTunes Match, and to use the ambiguity surrounding the liability of dumb lockers to persuade cloud providers to adopt such value added licensing agreements”.</p>

The Select Committee Report (published 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2012) endorsed the approach posited in the Consultation in relation to format shifting and concluded that a copyright exception premised upon personal use or use within the private sphere was likely to be the most practicable and justifiable solution.

In particular he addressed what he describes as a “serious error” in research submitted by Sussex University (i.e. the report of the independent researchers). He stated that at the time of the final Report he articulated his concerns about the quality of the data internally and suggested that it might be more helpful to publish a summary of the research but in the event the decision was taken to publish the research in full. The Updated Impact Assessment of March 2014 explained why, contrary to the researcher’s conclusions, the Defendant considered the results of the research to be consistent with the pricing-in theory. In essence, the independent researchers’ conclusion that CDs allowed “no copies” was inconsistent with practice in the market. Mr Stout discussed the erroneous assumption that the researchers had operated upon with the economists working on the issue and they agreed that as CDs were free from technological copy protection measures they should be treated as if copies could be made of them and, accordingly, having similar copying utility to a MP3 album. He observed: </p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">The pricing-in hypothesis is described in Box 1. Essentially, a copy of content that can be format-shifted has greater utility than one that cannot. In theory, this will shift the demand curve and a rights holder can charge a higher price for this copy (or sell more copies at the same price), and capture revenue they otherwise would have lost. Liebowitz illustrates this point using the example of someone who buys an audiocassette copy of a musical work to play in the car as well as a CD copy of the same work to play at home. A private copying exception would permit them to buy the CD copy and make their own audiocassette copy instead of buying two copies. The buyer of the CD will value it more, as it is more useful to them, which means the seller of the CD will be able to charge more for it, indirectly capturing the value of the CD and the audiocassette in the price of the CD alone. The utility of copying thus raises the demand curve for content. The outcome is that right holders do not lose income from such copying. Liebowitz describes certain situations in which the rights holder is able to capture more value by permitting such private copying than they could by restricting it”.</p>

When DRM-free copies were introduced they were priced at a higher price ($1.29) than copies which could be copied to a more limited extent due to DRM ($0.99). Thus, tracks that could be copied onto 10 devices (already quite permissive) were priced 30% higher when restrictions were removed to allow any copying for personal non-commercial use, in reflection of their added value to consumers.

We do not consider this to be the case. “Pricing-in” does not simply mean a producer will be able to charge more for more useful product.

Therefore, another approach to research in this area could be to look at impacts on consumer demand and sales of copies. As noted by contributors to the Government consultation, without format shifting it is becoming increasingly difficult to play CDs on portable devices, as MP3 players (including mobile phones) become widespread, and demand for portable CD players declines. This suggests that many people buying CDs do so with the expectation that they will format shift in order to play their CDs on a portable device, and that sales of CDs (and prices) would be lower if they could not do this (for example, if CDs came with copy-protection). A consumer survey on purchasing considerations would be a way to investigate this effect.</span>

	      <span class="A6" style="font-size:12pt">Two further ways to examine the effect of pricing in were suggested by stakeholders. One was to compare the price of an average digital download album and the price of an average CD album. As the licence attached to a digital download album (licensed for unlimited copying for personal, non-commercial use) permits greater copying than the CD album (not licensed for personal copying), some stakeholders argued that the digital album ought to cost more if there was pricing in. We do not think this conclusion is consistent with the pricing-in theory, however. CD copying for personal, non-commercial use is widely considered to reasonable and takes place regardless of copyright. Therefore, the value of being able to make private copies from CDs is likely to already be factored in to the market, and should be similar to the value of making copies from MP3s.</span>

More than in any other type of content there was real difficulty in interpreting the small print in the terms of different suppliers and formats. Often the terms were confusing (for our researchers let alone ordinary consumers) and in some cases internally contradictory.

This could be because private copying for personal use is so widespread in the sector that it is already largely or fully priced in. Consumers and producers of music appear to expect that music will be copied for personal non-commercial use, and all downloads are explicitly sold on these terms; so we would expect to see little variation in prices compared to other types of content, particularly those which physically restrict and permit different degrees of copying such as film downloads and eBooks.</p>

As explained above, the current law on private copying, and the terms of use attached to copies, are unlikely to factor strongly in purchasing decisions as most consumers are either unaware of them, or ignore them because they consider them unreasonable.</span>

This is explained by differences in the price premiums charged in bundles for different formats. So when an additional standard DVD or Blu-Ray disc is added, the average price of film bundle is negative or statistically insignificant; the price rises with an additional digital copy (£3.33), 3D Blu-Ray discs (£4.30) and Ultraviolet licences (£5.42). Ultraviolet is particularly interesting as it offers a very broad license with options to watch films on multiple devices, with up to five copies in some cases, and a possibility to share the license with up to five other people. These regressions explain 28% of the variation in price, and running the same tests for the natural logarithm of prices (testing to see if there is a percentage change in the average price) produces much the same results with the same explanatory power”.</span></p>

The premium for a physical book is of course likely to be explained by manufacturing costs and the value consumers place on physical features, rather than the number of copies that can be made from it. The number of allowable devices does not appear to influence the price, and regression analysis on the price does explain 34% of the variation in price. That said, while the number of copies for e-books appears significant, it could be driven by Amazon’s strategy to offer lower cost books (similar to Amazon results for software), and the number of copies allowed may have no bearing on this. Similarly differences between retailer and publisher can change the copy permissions on individual books, but these conditions are usually only available on purchasing each book, and so not useful for analysis without further publisher figures”.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The researchers drew their conclusions from in excess of 1,000 observations contained upon their database. The type of software spanned the full gamut from operating systems, productivity, utilities, design and publishing, photography, finance, music and audio and others. For each the database identified whether the delivery mechanism was download with or without a back-up disc, and CD/DVD. The average price of the product was logged as the average number of copies and the average price per copy. The analysis showed that products sold through direct download permitted a larger number of copies than those sold on a physical medium. The researchers correlated the relationship between copying and price. Their conclusion (cf. page 14 figure 2a) was that: <span style="font-style:italic">“it is clearly observable that the price increases with the number of copies allowed</span>”. To confirm their conclusion the researchers conducted a regression analysis using as the dependent variable the natural logarithm of price as opposed to the price itself. This was because an analysis of the frequency distribution of price showed that it was “<span style="font-style:italic">very skewed</span>” (page 15) indicating that distribution was not symmetrical. The researchers concluded that calculating the natural logarithm of price was one potential solution for this type of asymmetrical price distribution. The regression analysis using the logarithm of price as the dependent variable showed a more normal distribution of product <span style="font-style:italic">“…with a better defined bell shaped distribution thereby solving the skewness”</span>. The researchers then applied three different regressive models using a variety of variables (cf. page 24). One model (Model 3) added a quadratic term to the regression (i.e. number of copies squared) to capture a decreasing or increasing marginal effect. This had the result of demonstrating that the price per copy appeared to decrease with an increase in the number of copies. The inclusion of the quadratic term enabled the researchers to test if this effect was influencing the price of software. The conclusion which emanated from this analysis, which might (from a common sense perspective) not be viewed as particularly surprising, was that software producers charged users to make a single additional copy of the software but the additional, incremental price gradually reduced with the increase in the number of copies permitted. In other words, this reflected the fact that the value to consumers of the right to copy decreased as the number of copies increased:</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“…analysis suggests that software producers charge a price that reflected the possibility of making additional copies.

The control thus supports the basic economic intuition which is that wherever they can vendors will seek to capture the value of such copying as is taking place on the part of consumers, irrespective of whether that copying is legal. The researchers did not, however, go further and provide an answer to the question whether pricing-in was so endemic that it obviated the risk of “harm” remaining uncompensated for.</p>

A number of possible explanations for these ambiguous results were posited. In particular, the analysis could have been affected by a series of omitted variables.

Moreover, other potentially relevant factors were theoretically measurable but difficult to collect in practice (such as advertising expenditure, promotional campaigns, etc). Finally, and perhaps most pertinently, all the stores sampled permitted the possibility to copy digital music on to a CD or other portable device for personal use and the exact number of copies could not be quantified since the limit was defined as “personal use”.

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“Overall, the analysis on the impact of the number of copies on price for a sample of digital and CD albums has produced puzzling results. These could be explained by a number of factors. First, the analysis is probably affected by an omitted variable issue. The R2 shows the percentage of the variability in the dependent variable (price) which is captured by the model. The models estimated using price as dependent variable capture approximately 40% of price variability (and much less in the case of price per track). Second, a main problem with music recordings is that music is essentially an “experience” good whose value depends on several factors. Some of these factors are latent and intangible (such as tastes, fads, consumers’ subjective preferences, etc.) and are very difficult to measure. Third, other factors are technically measurable but very difficult to collect (such as advertising expenditures, radio plays, promotional campaigns, etc.). The fourth factor pertains to the variability of the explanatory variables. All the stores sampled allow the possibility to copy the digital music into a CD or into a portable device for personal use (with the only exception of 7Digital, which does not explicitly mention the possibility of burning a CD with the purchased music, already noted above). This creates a problem as it is not possible to control for both the copying possibilities and the store at the same time because these variables would overlap. Moreover, the exact number of copies cannot be quantified since the limit is ‘personal use’.</p>

It is evident (cf. pages 12-16) that the analysis was easier to conduct than in the case of music because here the researchers were able to determine average prices. This analysis led to the following conclusion:</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“The product price and average price per disc follow a very similar pattern. The relationship between number of copies and price appears to be a positive. But this result holds only up to four copies. An increase in the number of copies seems to be associated with an increase in the product price. However, the average price dramatically drops when the copies are equal to five. One plausible explanation for this could be related to the fact that the only kind of product allowing five copies is iTunes digital films. In the case of digital films it is possible to create an exact copy of the movie with virtually no additional costs, while in all the other cases, one additional copy means one additional physical medium. Therefore, according to figure 1 above, film sellers seem to establish a price that incorporates the possibility of having one or more additional physical copy of the films, and not for the option of making more digital copies”.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The authors tested whether the number of copies exerted an impact on product price by performing regression analysis of the film data set. They applied two models with different variables in each. This produced interesting results. In particular, it revealed that film publishers operated sophisticated pricing regimes which reflected the formats included within the bundle of rights. For example, digital copy, Blu-Ray 3D, and UltraViolet digital copy exerted a positive effect on price; but this was not so evident in relation to DVDs or ordinary Blu-Ray. The authors concluded:</p>

Table 10 (cf. page 16) showed that, expressed in this way, the results were more or less the same as those generated using normal regression techniques (albeit with some minor differences). The researchers thus found evidence of pricing-in but were not able to say whether it was so widespread as to lead to only minimal or zero residual harm. The end conclusion to this was expressed in the following terms:</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“In parallel with traditional films, which come with only one licence (e.g. Blu-Ray and DVD), the film industry has found different ways to allow users to have more than one copy of the films they purchase. Examples can be found in the sales of digital films (which could be copied on to a number [of] devices), by bundling multiple formats in the same package (which may also include a complementary downloadable digital copy), or through new kinds of licences, such as UltraViolet. We found a positive relationship between price and film copies. In particular, since different types of formats have different impacts on price, we can conclude that film stores charge users not simply to have more copies, but to have the opportunity to choose from a higher variety of available choices”.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In relation to the publishing industry (books) the researchers conducted similar forms of analysis to that in relation to films, music and software. The results highlighted a number of obvious differences between physical books (which have significant production costs) and eBooks which do not. They observed that there was a price premium for physical books which was explained by manufacturing costs and the value consumers placed on physical features rather than upon the number of copies that could be made from it. In relation to digital books they observed that all of the book sellers that they examined in the sample permitted users to make copies of the books. There was not however a great deal of information enabling them to compare and contrast prices for digital books with and without copying rights. From a statistical perspective they concluded that the analysis of the relationship between book prices and the number of copies allowed produced “<span style="font-style:italic">indeterminate results</span>” (cf. page 21). In relation to digital books these were, almost universally, allowed to be copied for a specified number of times. To this extent, the copying right was, inevitably, already factored in to the initial price. There was however little information which enabled the researchers to examine the relationship between price contingent upon variables in the number of times that a book could be copied.</p>

As an alternative it was submitted that insofar as the Defendant had a discretion it was very limited and consequentially the review to be performed by the Court was very intensive. The Defendant, to the contrary, submitted that this was an area where the Secretary of State had a very broad margin of appreciation because, in particular, it was evident from Article 5(2)(b) and the recitals to the Directive that in determining where harm lay the Member State was permitted and required to take into account the complex socio-economic balance which existed between consumers and copyright holders. It was submitted that this meant that Member States enjoyed a very wide margin of appreciation which, in turn, implied a high degree of deference on the part of the Court. Mr Saini QC went so far as to say that the Court was not “competent” to determine whether the Defendant had erred or not. There is, accordingly, a sharply defined difference of view as to the approach to be applied between the parties.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">First, the Directive demanded a standard of protection for rightholders which could only be guaranteed by close scrutiny by the courts of decisions affecting those rights. The general policy of the Directive is reflected in Recital (9) which provides that harmonisation “<span style="font-style:italic">must take as a basis a high level of protection, since such rights are crucial to intellectual creation</span>”. Further, Article 5(2)(b) was a derogation from a basic norm and therefore had to be interpreted narrowly and strictly, implying rigorous judicial control. Article 2 required Member States to secure to rightholders “<span style="font-style:italic">the exclusive right to authorise or prohibit direct or indirect, temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and in any form</span>” of their works. That exclusive right is subject only to the exceptions in Article 5. Recital 32 makes clear that those exceptions are exhaustive: “<span style="font-style:italic">This Directive provides for an exhaustive enumeration of exceptions and limitations to the reproduction right […]</span>”. Recital 42 emphasises the need for Member States to arrive at a “<span style="font-style:italic">coherent</span>” application of the exceptions and limitations. Article 5(5) provides that exceptions must only be applied in certain cases, not conflicting with normal exploitation and not unreasonably prejudicing the legitimate rightholders’ interests. The Claimants submitted that: “<span style="font-style:italic">Those constraints forbid a relaxed approach to the assessment of a Member State’s compliance with the requirements of the Copyright Directive. The starting point is that the Copyright Directive requires a high degree of copyright protection and that the ability of a Member State to depart from that high standard is tightly constrained</span>”.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly, the Directive incorporated a <span style="text-decoration:underline">presumption</span> that the introduction of <span style="text-decoration:underline">any</span> exception under Article 5(2) to the exclusive Article 2 rights caused harm to the rightholder and accordingly Member States could <span style="text-decoration:underline">only</span> avoid introducing compensation schemes if they had cogent evidence demonstrating an absence of harm. This followed from Articles 5(2)(b) and Recital 38 which provided that a private copying exception could only be established, “<span style="font-style:italic">on condition that” </span>rightholders receive <span style="font-style:italic">“fair compensation”.</span> Article 5(5) limited the scope of any exception to copyright protection to “certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work or other subject-matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the rights-holder”. Recital 35 made clear that, unless some other payment to rightholders has already been made, making no payment to rightholders after the establishment of a private copying exception is permissible only in the exceptional case of a particular activity where the prejudice to rightholders is <span style="font-style:italic">“minimal”</span>. The Claimants cited the Court of Justice in Case C-467/08 <span style="font-style:italic">Padawan</span> [2010] ECR I-10055 (“<span style="font-style:italic">Padawan</span>”) at paragraph [44] which held that: “<span style="font-style:italic">…copying by natural persons acting in a private capacity must be regarded as an act likely to cause harm to the author of the work concerned</span>”. It followed that the introduction of an exception must itself be presumed to cause harm to rightholders. The Court also noted at paragraph [57] that Recital 35 mentioned, as a valuable criterion for the determination of the level of fair compensation, not only ‘harm’ but also ‘<span style="font-style:italic">possible harm</span>’ – from which it followed that harm may be relevant even if it is not proven to have occurred.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Thirdly, this is a case of “jurisdictional fact” given that proof of <span style="font-style:italic">de minimis</span> harm is a pre-condition of the introduction of a copyright exception which is unaccompanied by a compensation scheme. English law recognises that in cases of precedent or jurisdictional fact the Court will determine on a definitive basis whether the condition precedent exists, or not. The assessment of harm is not therefore a matter for the discretionary judgment of the authorities of a Member State absent full verification of the correctness of that decision by the Court. The Claimants relied upon Recitals 6, 31, 32 and 38 which they said must be construed as supporting the conclusion that the appraisal of harm was a hard edged question and a decision by a Member State on this was justiciable as to its merits. Support is also said to arise from paragraph [36] of <span style="font-style:italic">Padawan</span> where the Court, in answer to the first question referred, held that ‘fair compensation’ is an autonomous concept of EU law which had to be interpreted uniformly in all the Member States that had introduced a private copying exception:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Fourthly, the conclusion that the issue is a hard-edged question for the Court is supported by the fact that copyright is internationally acknowledged to be a property right. Articles 16.2 and 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms of the European Union (“the Charter”) require intellectual property to be protected and require ‘effective protection’ of rights conferred by EU law. There is no effective protection of intellectual property rights <span style="text-decoration:underline">if</span> those rights can be abrogated upon the basis of a decision on a question of fact which is incapable of being properly reviewed, save in the case of irrationality. In addition under TRIPS, and under the Berne Convention ‘Three-Step Test’ (which TRIPS enshrines and which is also given effect to in Article 5(5) of the Directive), the decision to introduce an exception without compensating rightholders engages international obligations going beyond those recognised in the Directive itself. Finally, Article 1 Protocol 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights (“ECHR”) is engaged since a property right is being expropriated without compensation and this curtails the discretion of the State to take expropriating decisions without very careful scrutiny by a reviewing court. The Claimants refer to case law under the ECHR where the Strasbourg Court decided expropriation cases on the merits, e.g. <span style="font-style:italic">Sporrong and Lonnroth v Sweden</span> (1982) 5 EHRR 35.</p>

Most issues of policy in this area were predetermined by the Member States (participating in the Council of Ministers) and by parliamentarians in the European Parliament when they adopted the Directive. At that stage decisions were taken as to the scope of the Directive including as to the economic sectors to be covered. The decisions then taken also addressed whether there should be exceptions to the core right (in Article 2) to prohibit unauthorised reproduction and, if so, in what field(s) and for what activities and, critically, whether if exceptions were to be introduced they were mandatory or optional.  Policy decisions were also made at that time as to whether if exceptions were implemented they should be subject to a right of compensation or not. For illustration should copying by libraries or archives be subject to compensation? Each of these issues involved large issues of policy. These “big picture” issues are now no longer on the table.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In this case the Defendant acknowledged that EU law “<span style="font-style:italic">limited</span>” the scope of his discretion and that he therefore had to address his mind to a narrow <span style="font-style:italic">de minimis</span> issue: See Updated Impact Assessment page 21 (bottom paragraph). However, this does not lead to the conclusion that a merits review follows. This is not like the <span style="font-style:italic">de minimis</span> principle which is applied under other equivalent tests in EU law such as Articles 101 and 102 TFEU (the competition provisions) where decades of experience have enabled regulators to reduce the <span style="font-style:italic">de minimis</span> principle to near-mathematical market share and value thresholds. In Article 5(2)(b) the concept is much more elusive. The <span style="font-style:italic">de minimis</span> concept is not defined in the Directive. The Court of Justice has ruled that where the Directive does not define a matter Member States have a discretion (see case law cited at paragraphs [194] – [198] below) to choose their own parameters. The Secretary of State thus had a certain margin of appreciation to select a sensible <span style="font-style:italic">de minimis</span> threshold. In defining <span style="font-style:italic">de minimis</span> a Member State must strike a “<span style="font-style:italic">fair balance</span>” between the competing interests of consumers, rightholders and manufacturers of copying devices: cf. Recitals 31 and 35. All of this means that even within the confines of a narrow legal issue there are still choices to be made by the Secretary of State and that the Court should exercise caution in second guessing those choices. Yet these are still choices to be exercised within relatively tight bounds, in particular because the property rights of natural and legal persons are at stake and because this is an exception from a basic norm and because if harm exceeds a <span style="font-style:italic">de minimis</span> level compensation <span style="text-decoration:underline">must</span> be paid. In large measure I accept the submissions of the Claimants on these points but to the effect that the factors they rely upon limit the Member State’s discretion but not to the extent of making the judicial review a merits exercise (See paragraphs [128] – [134] above). On the sliding scale of margins of appreciation this is not a case of “<span style="font-style:italic">high level policy and economic, social and political judgments</span>” (<span style="font-style:italic">R(Rotherham MBC)</span> [2014] EWCA Civ 1080 at paragraph [57] <span style="font-style:italic">per</span> Lord Dyson MR).

In my view the mere fact that the decision was taken on the back of “economic” evidence is not, in and of itself, decisive. It is an error to suggest that simply because the subject matter of a decision, or the evidence used to justify it, is “economic” or “technical” that courts should recoil in terror and move gratefully into judicial reticence mode by reference to “margin of appreciation”. If this were the judicial default position Courts would find it hard indeed to hold in favour of Claimants in clinical negligence cases where, almost invariably, the case turns upon complex scientific evidence. In <span style="font-style:italic">R(Rotherham MBC)</span> the Supreme Court recognised the dangers of “<span style="font-style:italic">judicial timidity</span>” ([2015] UKSC 6 paragraph [65] <span style="font-style:italic">per</span> Lord Neuberger). Decisions of the utmost importance to individuals, to companies and to society are routinely “economic” and “technical” and errors in those decisions should be as much susceptible to judicial review as other equivalent but less technical decisions. There should be no lacuna in judicial review simply because the nature of the decision under challenge is a difficult one. </p>

There is a wealth of difference between the court exercising proper supervisory jurisdiction over an “economic” decision and a court acting as the decision maker itself. Courts are well able to: ensure that the decision maker has collected sufficient relevant evidence to meet the needs of the decision to be taken; ensure that the inferences that are drawn from the evidence are rational and reasonable and within the boundaries of that which may properly be inferred; and assess whether errors that are made are material to the final decision. Equally a court will ensure that, where appropriate, a proper procedure has been followed to collect and review the economic evidence and that affected persons have been treated fairly.</p>

A corollary of this was that the national court had to determine the issues arising on a merits basis since it was only upon that basis that the Courts could guarantee effective protection to the directly effective rights contained in Article 5(2)(b). Mr Kennelly (for the Intervener) also relied upon the direct effect of Article 5(2)(b) as part of the State aid argument (See e.g. paragraph [294] below).

The fact, referred to by the commission, that the Directive envisages as one possibility among others that such a system may be financed entirely by the public authorities cannot mean that the Member State can be identified as the person liable for unpaid claims. The payment obligation lies with the guarantee institutions, and it is only in exercising its power to organise the guarantee system that the State may provide that the guarantee institutions are to be financed entirely by the public authorities. In those circumstances the State takes on an obligation which in principle is not its own.</p>

It is open, for instance, to Member States to pay compensation themselves. However, it is also open to them to impose the payment obligation upon third parties such as device manufacturers or even, through a sales levy, upon consumers. Recital 35 leaves it to Member States to determine the “<span style="font-style:italic">form, detailed arrangements and possible level</span>” for fair compensation. The recital also makes clear that in deciding upon compensation Member States must take account of “<span style="font-style:italic">the particular circumstances of each case</span>” and are responsible for “<span style="font-style:italic">evaluating these circumstances</span>”. Recital 35 thus confers on Member States a role in factual appreciation which is insufficiently precise to have direct effect.

In principle, direct effect is primarily concerned with creating a <span style="font-style:italic">locus</span> for an affected person to seek private law relief from the Courts (see paragraph [152] above). Typically, this would be an individual rightholder seeking a financial or other remedy from an infringer in civil proceedings. But, in the present case, the Claimants and the Intervener are all representative bodies who have been accorded <span style="font-style:italic">locus</span> before the High Court in public law judicial review proceedings and they are entitled to seek relief from amongst the wide range of remedies available to the Court if they prevail. As such, recourse to direct effect is otiose as a route to <span style="font-style:italic">locus</span>. So far as it is contended that <span style="text-decoration:underline">if</span> Article 5(2)(b) is directly effective this entitles the Claimants to a hard-edged merits review, this is a separate issue. There is agreement between the parties that <span style="text-decoration:underline">if</span> the Claimants prevail they are entitled to remedies which are effective, proportionate and dissuasive (see paragraph [39] above; Recital 58 and Article 8 of the Directive). The actual process by which this Court analyses the issue and selects proper remedies is one however which is <span style="font-style:italic">prima facie</span> determined by domestic law (the principle of the “<span style="font-style:italic">procedural autonomy</span>” of national law) subject to the well known principles of “<span style="font-style:italic">effet utile</span>” and non-discrimination. In many instances it will be appropriate for a national court to apply a merits review to a directly effective right. But in my view there may be circumstances where something less intense may apply yet still amount to an effective remedy. This might, for instance, arise where a party seeks to enforce direct effect via public law proceedings in a case where some degree of discretion remains vested in the Member State (see, for example, paragraph [284] below).</p>

This area of law is relevant to the Claimant’s submissions as to the adequacy of the consultation process, to its complaint about predetermination of the result and to its complaint that the Secretary of State simply did not draw proper or rational conclusions from the evidence.

In <span style="font-style:italic">R(Osborn) v Parole Board</span> [2014] AC 1115, Lord Reed JSC (at paragraphs [67] and [68]) explained that the purpose behind the requirement that a consultation should be fair was that it was liable to result in better decisions because the decision maker received all relevant information which was properly tested; and because it avoided the sense of injustice which a person who was subject to the decision might otherwise feel.  In the present case the Secretary of State was not obliged under the Directive to consult.  However, his chosen end result of a copyright exception absent compensation was by its very nature bound to be highly controversial and risked, if he got the decision wrong, denying many persons and companies rightful compensation.  It is hence easy to see why fairness compelled that he should conduct a detailed consultation. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The fourth “Sedley” principle is that the product of consultation must conscientiously be taken into account by the decision maker. This reflects two broader principles (which apply also outside the context of consultations). First, a decision must be based upon a reasonable or rational view of the evidence it is said to be based upon. This is a principle of long standing: see e.g. <span style="font-style:italic">R v Deputy Industrial Injuries Commissioner ex p. Moore</span> [1965] 1 QB 456 at page 488 (CA) <span style="font-style:italic">per</span> Diplock LJ; <span style="font-style:italic">Mahon v Air New Zealand Ltd</span> [1984] 1 AC 808 (PC) pages 820, 821; see also the commentary in “Judicial Review – Principles and Procedure” (Auburn, Moffett, and Sharland) (2013) paragraphs 20.09ff pages 454, 455 (“Auburn”).  If the final decision adopted bears no sensible relationship to the evidence relied upon then the reasoning is unreasonable or irrational but, in a consultation context, it may be said also that the “product” of the consultation (the evidence) has not “conscientiously” been “taken into account”. The second broader principle is that the outcome of the consultation must not be predetermined. If it is then the decision maker will not have acted “fairly” (the <span style="font-style:italic">leitmotif</span> of the principle governing consultations) and will not have “conscientiously” taken into account the evidence. The law focuses upon actual predetermination but also the appearance of predetermination though commentators point out that the issue of the appearance of predetermination is very much harder to establish in the case of administrative or “political” decisions than in the case of judicial decisions since the former involve decision makers who are entitled to have strong predispositions whereas Judges should not (or at least should keep them firmly to themselves): See generally <span style="font-style:italic">Auburn</span> (ibid) paragraphs [8.84ff].</p>

The experts translated this into a £2.4 billion loss in revenue for the period 2006-2012. The experts also concluded that consumers would be willing to pay £0.72 more to make one licensed copy of a CD. When the total number of CDs sold between 2006-2012, together with the likely number of digital copies that consumers would be expected to make of those CDs, was taken into account the experts assessed the potential value that consumers would be prepared to pay for such copying as between £100 million and £624 million.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The correct meaning of “harm” is thus a threshold issue which is fundamental to this litigation.  In the analysis below I have reached the conclusion that the Secretary of State acted lawfully in adopting the “lost sales” test. However, if I am wrong in this then the entire consultation was, as is now conceded, based upon a flawed legal premise and would be unlawful. I have also concluded (section I below) that the actual reasoning which led to the new copyright exception was flawed for reasons unrelated to the meaning of “harm”.  However since that particular flaw could, at least in principle, be cured by the further collection of adequate evidence, it is conceivable that the present copyright exception could be maintained. However, if I am wrong in my conclusion about relevant “harm” no amount of repair work to the consultation and decision making process could save it from being quashed and set aside in its entirety upon the basis that it was permeated through by an error of law. This is relevant to the question of relief that I have posed in the Conclusion section of this Judgment at section K below. </p>

The Claimants submitted that it was evident from a reading of the documents leading up to the decisional Updated Impact Assessment and also from the pleadings, submissions and witness statement evidence submitted in this litigation by the Secretary of State that he had taken the view that the harm to be made subject to compensation was <span style="text-decoration:underline">only</span> that which flowed out of such <span style="text-decoration:underline">new</span> and <span style="text-decoration:underline">incremental</span> copying as would arise out of the new copyright exception.  In other words the Defendant had, in effect, written-off as legally irrelevant, <span style="text-decoration:underline">all</span> that vast body of illegal copying which had historically occurred.   It was for this reason that the Claimants thus labelled the Defendant’s reasoning the “<span style="font-style:italic">incrementalist approach</span>”.  They used this phrase in contra-distinction to what they submitted should have been the correct legal principle which they called the “<span style="font-style:italic">legitimisation approach</span>” which was harm which flowed from <span style="text-decoration:underline">all</span> that copying which was now <span style="text-decoration:underline">legitimised</span> but which hitherto had been illegal.

This is a real and important issue and it is encapsulated in the disagreement about the meaning of “<span style="font-style:italic">harm</span>”.  In my view when the Defendant was, throughout the documents, referring to incremental sales he was referring to <span style="text-decoration:underline">this</span> debate.  I do not accept that, fairly read, the Secretary of State was purporting to say that in the computation of harm he simply wrote off as irrelevant all historical, unlawful copying.  His point was quite different - it was that as a matter of fact not every act of past unlawful copying led to actual loss or harm.  He based this upon economic literature which drew the distinction between a consumer’s willingness to engage in unlawful copying and that same consumer’s preparedness to go out and buy a duplicate (incremental) copy. I have referred to this evidence in Section D above; see e.g. at paragraph [57].</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">First, a growing body of consistent judgments of the Court of Justice establishes that the concept of “harm” is an “<span style="font-style:italic">autonomous</span>” concept of EU law which is unrelated to national law. A central point raised by the Claimants is that in domestic (common) law enforcement proceedings one basis for the calculation of damages is the fees that would be obtained in a hypothetical licence. Thus “<span style="font-style:italic">harm</span>” should be understood to take account of <span style="text-decoration:underline">every</span> act of copying undertaken by an infringer (the “licensing test”), and whether or not the consumer would have made a duplicate sale is therefore not the correct optic through which to view the right to compensation. The difficulty with this argument is that in classifying the concept of “<span style="font-style:italic">harm</span>” as an “<span style="font-style:italic">autonomous” </span>concept of EU law the Court has rejected the notion that harm should be defined by reference to the sorts of remedies that would be awarded in national courts. Indeed, conspicuous by its <span style="text-decoration:underline">absence</span> from Recitals 31 and 35 is any reference to the concept of being harm being defined by reference to national remedies. It would have been straightforward had “<span style="font-style:italic">harm</span>” been intended to have been defined by reference to remedies in domestic civil law for that to have been spelled out in the recitals, but it was not. </p>

These are that the advent of digitalisation has led to a market where device sellers and consumers assume they may copy and where rightholders have not sought private law remedies against infringers. It is a particular feature of this case that there is a widespread consensus that the law has signally failed to keep up with market reality and with reasonable consumer expectations and indeed has been brought into disrepute by its condemnation as illegal of activities which are now accepted by consumers as lawful and which in actual fact form the basic commercial premise upon which copying and storage devices are actively sold throughout Europe.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This view is not just a view expressed by those with an economic interest in seeing the exception introduced (device manufacturers and consumers); it is also a view widely acknowledged by content suppliers. The reality (at least in the UK, but it would seem elsewhere in the EU as well) is that copyright holders do <span style="text-decoration:underline">not</span> use the courts to obtain relief against the widespread infringing activities of consumers. Civil redress is not seen as a rational or logical response by the industry to market developments. A compensation scheme based on judicial remedies would thus fail to reflect how the world has changed with digitalisation. This supports the argument, advanced by the Defendant, that it is not relevant to look to national law remedies as a determinant of the meaning of “<span style="font-style:italic">harm</span>”. As a means of rewarding and protecting content creators civil redress has in this particular context failed. As such there is no reason why “harm” should be defined and determined by the entirely theoretical prospect of obtaining judicial compensation based upon lost licence fees. In my view “<span style="font-style:italic">harm</span>” should be understood in a wider context which takes account of actual consumer expectations and the very specific evolved features of the markets which are covered by the exception. The Directive (and indeed the construction placed upon the Directive by the Court) makes clear that compensation is to be assessed for loss or prejudice or harm “caused” by the copying activity in question.  The Defendant in his assessment of causality has applied a real world counterfactual, i.e. one in which civil claims are <span style="text-decoration:underline">not</span> pursued against <span style="font-style:italic">bona fide</span> purchasers of content who engage in subsequent copying. I have explained elsewhere in this judgment why I consider this to be a rational decision upon the evidence: See section H below. Against this counterfactual the loss sustained is not that which could hypothetically be obtained from a court but is measured in terms of lost duplicate sales. This conclusion is, in my view, consistent with the clear recognition in Recitals 31, 35 and 38 that the exceptions to copyright and the related compensation provisions are closely connected to actual, real-world, developments in the digitalisation of markets.</p>

The Advocate General was of the view that the significant number of discretions conferred upon the Member States to create exceptions to copyright meant that Member States enjoyed “<span style="font-style:italic">considerable flexibility in the transposition of the Directive</span>” (ibid paragraph [43]). The Advocate General also referred (in footnote [12]) to literature which analysed the Directive as an attempt to reconcile continental and civil law concepts of copyright protection with common law concepts. The Advocate General described this as “<span style="font-style:italic">the greatest challenge</span>” of the Directive. This highlights the conclusion that the concept of “<span style="font-style:italic">harm</span>” is not one with its roots in national law; it is a blended or hybrid concept drawing inspiration from civil and common law traditions and, as such, should not be defined by reference to remedies available in specific Member States, such as an account of profits or a right to licence fees, etc.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Fourthly, all of the above points support the conclusion that since “harm” is not a defined notion it is one about which Member States have a discretion, albeit one supervised by the Court of Justice. This is a key point because it indicates that there may be more than one test for “harm”, and that the real question is whether adoption of a “lost sales” test is within the discretion of the Member State. In Case C-463/12 <span style="font-style:italic">Copydan</span> (5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2015) (“<span style="font-style:italic">Copydan</span>”) the Court of Justice did not itself define harm but instead ruled that as a matter of EU law a discretion was conferred upon Member States to define the issue: See ibid, paragraph [62]. The Claimants submitted that there was an inconsistency in the Court on the one hand ruling that the concept of “harm” was an autonomous concept of EU law but then remitting it to the discretion of the Member States. I do not agree.  There is no such inconsistently. For the Court to remit the issue to the discretion of the Member States is <span style="text-decoration:underline">not</span> the same as remitting the issue to national <span style="text-decoration:underline">law</span>; and it does not in any event mean that Member States have <span style="font-style:italic">carte blanche</span> to introduce (or not) <span style="font-style:italic">any</span> scheme that they please.  Member States thus do not have to define harm by reference to existing national law or judicial remedies and they may choose some other metric.  But the discretion remains a fettered one.  For example Member States could not refuse to implement a compensation scheme where the harm was more than “<span style="font-style:italic">minimal</span>”; and equally they may not choose a solution that offends against general principles of EU law such as the principle of non-discrimination or proportionality (see in this regard <span style="font-style:italic">Copydan</span> paragraph [62] cited below); and further (as case law demonstrates) because the issue of compensation is an autonomous EU law issue the Court of Justice retains jurisdiction over a range of technical questions such as what sorts of acts attract the compensation duty, and who pays, etc.</p>

The Court concluded as follows. First, it noted (ibid paragraph [57]) that the object of the Directive was to harmonise “<span style="font-style:italic">only certain aspects of the law on copyright and related rights</span>” and that the general scheme of the Directive was circumscribed by a number of provisions which disclosed an intention on the part of the EU legislature to grant “<span style="font-style:italic">a degree of discretion to the Member States in the implementation</span>” of the Directive. Secondly, the Court stated that Article 5(2)(b) incorporated two different discretions:</p>

In <span style="font-style:italic">Stichting</span> (ibid) the Court pointed out that where the Directive was silent as to a matter (such as <span style="text-decoration:underline">who</span> paid compensation) then Member States had a “<span style="font-style:italic">broad discretion</span>” (paragraph [23]). It appears that the Court took the same view of “<span style="font-style:italic">…the notion and level of fair compensation”</span> (ibid, paragraph [24]). In <span style="font-style:italic">Copydan</span> Advocate General Cruz Villalon stated that Member States creating copyright exceptions “<span style="font-style:italic">…have the greatest latitude to adopt provisions derogating from the charging of fair compensation where the harm is minimal</span>” (ibid paragraph [99]); and the Court (ibid paragraph [62]) referred to Member States having “<span style="font-style:italic">…the discretion…to set the threshold for such prejudice</span>”. There are thus indications that the discretion is broad. In other cases however the Court itself has been more circumspect. It has recognised that a broad discretion might undermine consistency and hinder the internal market. In <span style="font-style:italic">ACI Adam</span> (ibid) at paragraphs [21] – [24] the Court, when referring to the “<span style="font-style:italic">scope of those exceptions and limitations</span>” (i.e. in Article 5(2)) emphasised that they were derogations from “<span style="font-style:italic">a general principle established</span>” by the Directive (i.e. in Article 2) and that accordingly they “<span style="font-style:italic">…must be interpreted strictly</span>” and not in a manner conflicting “<span style="font-style:italic">with a normal exploitation</span>” of the work or in a manner which would “<span style="font-style:italic">unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the rightholder</span>”. Viewed overall, Member States do have a discretion with regard to the nature, extent and modalities of the exception and the concomitant compensation right; but it is one which needs to be exercised carefully and with proper regard to the rightholders’ interests. In my judgment, unless I can say that the choice of a lost sales test for computing harm is outwith the scope of the Member States’ discretion I should not interfere with it. And for the reasons that I have already given I consider it to be a perfectly rational option for the Defendant to adopt.</p>

Yet the Court of Justice has made clear that a <span style="font-style:italic">de minimis</span> exception does arise in Article 5(2)(b) despite its express omission from the terms thereof. It is therefore important to see what additional guidance is available from the recitals and in particular Recital 35. This identifies a series of considerations which are matters which Member States may take into account when determining the nature of the scope of the <span style="font-style:italic">de minimis</span> exception. Mr Saini QC, for the Secretary of State, dissected Recital 35 into its constituent parts.

The Court acknowledged that the specific subject matter of copyright included ensuring for the rightholder protection of the right to exploit commercially the marketing or the making available of the protected work by the grant of licences in return for payment of remuneration (ibid, paragraph [107]). However, the Court then sought to impose a limit on the ability of the rightholder to maximise revenue by reference to a benchmark of “reasonable remuneration”:</p>

Support for this conclusion is found in Article 5(5) of the Directive which links the exceptions to the “normal exploitation” of the work and where the legitimate interests of the rightholder are not “unreasonably” prejudiced. These considerations support an understanding of Article 5(2)(b) through the optic of the law on the specific subject matter of copyright. The judgment acknowledges that a right to maximise revenue cannot, without more, be assumed to be part of the specific subject-matter of copyright and introduces a species of reasonableness test which, in the context of the present case, lends some support to the conclusion that Member States have a margin of discretion as to the choice of relevant thresholds for “harm” and need not choose a metric which maximises rightholder value.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“In my opinion, to determine the 'harm' sustained by rightholders because of the copies made within the scope of the private copying and the reprography exceptions one needs to look at the situation which would have occurred had the exception not been in place. In particular, one needs to assess the value that consumers attach to the additional copies of lawfully acquired content that they make for their personal use. It would allow the estimate of losses incurred by rightholders due to lost licensing opportunities ('economic harm'), i.e. the additional payment they would have received for these additional copies if there were no exception. I think it is fair to say that, in the majority of cases, this amount would neither reach the level comparable to the value of the initial copy nor would it be so negligible that it could be completely ignored.</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">Although such a definition of 'harm' is, at its most basic level, not contested by the majority of stakeholders, it seems that views on its practical implications diverge. Some stakeholders are of the opinion that once 'harm' is defined uniformly in the above manner, it would still simply refer to the number of copies made by consumers under the private copying exception, and all of them would need to be fully be taken into account when setting the levies. For others, the definition of 'harm' outlined above implies that the customers' willingness to pay for additional copies decreases proportionally to their number and that, therefore, the hypothetical licence-fee(s) which the rightholder would have obtained - had there been no exception - decreases with each additional copy made. Such an approach also seems to imply that, in many instances, the value of each additional copy could be so small that the 'harm' sustained by the rightholders should be considered as minimal, with no compensation obligation arising. Accordingly, it would be necessary to assess not the <span style="font-style:italic">actual </span>number of copies made but rather the <span style="font-style:italic">hypothetical </span>(lower) number of copies that could have been licensed in the absence of the exception.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">It seems to me that, since the main rationale underlying the private copying exception is linked to the practical difficulty of the licensing of copies made by consumers for their private use, it is fair and reasonable to compensate rightholders precisely for lost income opportunities, e.g. via the licence agreements they would have concluded if there were no exception. Moreover, in my view it would be justified for the level of compensation to reflect the actual value attached by consumers to such additional 'private' copies. The latter also depends on the form in which the copyright protected content is copied (analogue/digital). For instance, the value a consumer attaches to the fact that he can copy a book (instead of acquiring a subsequent copy of it) is different from the one he attributes to the possibility of copying a CD on multiple devices being in his possession. In any event, I am far from saying that these additional copies would cause minimal 'harm' and would not need to be compensated. But I equally think that measuring all the copies actually made by virtue of the exception without taking into account the consumers' willingness to pay for these copies if there were no exception could lead to compensating to a greater degree than EU law actually requires.</p>

I am also not convinced that the “main rationale” behind Article 5(2)(b) is linked to “practical difficulties” in licensing. The recitals to the Directive paint a far broader picture than this.

In my view there was a proper basis in economic and legal logic for choosing to adopt this basis in the United Kingdom. The decision taken by the Secretary of State was a rational one which is consistent with EU law. My conclusion is therefore not that the licensing test is wrong in principle; but only that the issue properly falls within the discretion of the Member States and the choice of the sales test was a lawful choice.</p>

In the 2012 Assessment and in the Updated Impact Assessment the Defendant relied upon early academic literature by Professor Stan Liebowitz for the proposition that where pricing-in occurred there might be no loss from subsequent unauthorised copying. However, in the course of the litigation the Claimants relied upon a newly commissioned expert report from Professor Liebowitz (“Report regarding Indirect Appropriability”, November 2014) in which he qualified and explained his earlier analysis. Professor Liebowitz explained that whilst pricing-in might have some application in this market sector it would never enable all the relevant “harm” to be captured:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The first point is that in relation to an issue such as this the actual distinction between a merits review and a judicial review might be more apparent than real.  The extent to which courts will adjudicate upon technical or expert issues varies according to context. For instance courts are routinely required to determine, on a merits basis, clinical negligence cases where the case frequently turns upon the assessment by the court of complex, scientific and medical expert opinion. But even in such merits cases the test actually applied by courts is a hybrid judicial review type test.  The Judge does not “decide” the science; on the contrary the judge hears expert evidence and then applies an approach which is akin to a public law rationality challenge.   The approach adopted in law to determine these cases has a strong public feel about it.  The test is known as the “<span style="font-style:italic">Bolam</span>” test.  It essentially accepts that there may well be a number of different competing medical or scientific theories in a case and there may also be a range of quite different yet reasonable views. In such cases the court only rejects a Defendant’s view if it is outwith that reasonable range.  If the Defendant’s case rests upon a theory or body of expert opinion that is within the range the Defendant will succeed even though the Claimant’s case <span style="text-decoration:underline">also</span> rests upon expert evidence which is reasonable and within the range.  A Court must assess the evidence itself and cannot delegate, in effect, the judicial task to experts and case law lays down various criteria that the court must consider when reviewing the expert evidence. But the judicial task is essentially to review the evidence to determine whether the Defendant’s approach was within the range of reasonable options: See by way of an illustration of the articulation of this principle and its interrelationship with expert evidence - <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">C v North Cumbria University Hospitals NHS Trust</span><span class="apple-converted-space" style="color:#000000"> </span>[2014] EWHC 61 at paragraphs [20ff].</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">First, it is clear from evidence before the Court that there was a reasonable literature base upon which the Defendant was entitled to rely for support for the pricing-in theory.   Indeed, the Defendant relied upon Professor Liebowitz as only one amongst a number of experts and economists who advanced the theory of pricing-in. Thus in the Updated Impact Assessment (ibid., page 215) the IPO refers to the theory “<span style="font-style:italic">first proposed</span>” by Professor Liebowitz <span style="font-style:italic">“… and since developed by others</span>” (such as Hal Varian “Copying and Copyright”, Journal of Economic Perspectives 19:2 121-138).  In the course of argument Mr Saini QC referred to the CRA Report (see paragraph [6] above) and to other literature and expert analyses which endorsed the pricing-in theory as applicable in the relevant economic sectors and where the authors came to the conclusion that pricing-in was in principle capable to some degree of eliminating “harm”.  In this body of literature there was no qualification that this could “only” arise where there was an ability to price discriminate. I have in the course of this case reviewed a number of different pieces of literature and in my view it is clear that many experts agree with the broad thrust of the reasoning behind the Defendant’s reliance upon pricing-in. In these circumstances it was within the Defendant’s margin of appreciation to accept the theory as <span style="font-style:italic">prima facie</span> applicable to the facts of the present case. It is not a rogue theory nor one that is generally rejected by experts.  Indeed it seems to me that a Court would be entitled to come to this view even if a merits approach was adopted.  This might be an area where there is quite properly room for more than one legitimate view.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly, I turn next to a concern that I have about the price discrimination qualification. I have difficulties with this argument at two different levels. First, the concept seems divorced from the way in which prices are set in most normal markets for non-fungible goods. As such it is divorced from reality and not the sort of argument that is so powerful and compelling that could result in the Defendant being required to reject pricing-in as a theory of relevance. Secondly, it implies a legal concept of “harm” for the purpose of Article 5(2)(b) which assumes that sellers must be able to extract the very last gram of value from the copyright. However, in my view, the concept in law is not so purist or absolutist; “harm” as understood in Article 5(2)(b) is a broader concept which balances the interests of rightholders and users and incorporates notions of “fair balance” (cf. Recital 31). It is also a concept which should reflect market realities: see generally paragraphs [191-192] and [200] above. In most normal, everyday, markets sellers simply do not have the ability to engage in price discrimination and do not do so yet it is never said that they do not have the ability to gain a reasonable or fair value for their products. I thus have difficulty in accepting that an ability to price discriminate should be a <span style="font-style:italic">sine qua non</span> to the ability for seller to use pricing–in to capture relevant “harm”.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Professor Liebowitz’s criticism of the decision is that a content seller cannot extract full value <span style="text-decoration:underline">unless</span> that seller knows how frequently the consumer will use (i.e. copy) the content <span style="text-decoration:underline">and</span> hence the extent to which it is valued by the consumer.  If the seller knows this he can differentiate in price as between consumers and (it is assumed) obtain more revenue. He argues, in effect, that because there is a substantial informational asymmetry between seller and buyer about these matters the seller does not know how, in effect, to pitch the level of the price and as such is not able to recover the full value of the copyright protected work.  At one level this is probably correct because if a seller were possessed of perfect information that seller might be able to modulate prices so as to extract the very last penny of profit.  However, the argument does not reflect the real world where in virtually all normal markets there is informational asymmetry and sellers of non-fungible goods (presumably not fungible goods, which get consumed and hence not copied or replicated) typically do not know how many times customers will use their product or how they (subjectively) will be valued and they do not thereby have the chance to price discriminate as between different consumers or groups thereof in order to capture the maximum value attributable to those factors. Almost every item sold by a department store is sold without the vendor knowing how often the chair or lawn-mower or cup and saucer will be used or whether, on purchase, the new owner will like the item or come to hate it. In other words normal markets do not operate upon the basis that when the vendor comes to set price and hence extract value that vendor has perfect foresight about rates of future usage. Yet sellers to a degree price-in predictions of subsequent use; a product that is stronger and more durable will generally attract a higher value to reflect those attributes, than one that is more fragile and less likely to bear continued usage. In the present case, as reflected widely in evidence submitted to the Hargreaves review team and to the IPO during the consultation, vendors have a clear understanding of when consumers are likely to copy the work and when they can use DRM to limit that copying. To an extent the informational asymmetry can be plugged by market research and other normal data and information collecting techniques. I do not perceive any systemic inability to price discriminate as suggesting any form of market failure.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr de la Mare QC, for the Claimants, argued that the analogy with ordinary goods was not an apposite one since there was no issue of copying which arose in those cases, for instance with a lawnmower.  But in my view this does not address the concern that I have. Professor Liebowitz’s argument rests upon an inability to price discriminate to reflect a variable rate of usage.  This is the same conundrum that other vendors of ordinary household goods face.  A music download might be played once or a hundred times (if copied); and the same goes for the usage of a lawnmower (where usage is not predicated upon copying): the problem vendors face of not being able to link price to usage is hence as much an issue for the lawnmower seller as it is for the content seller. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The third matter that I consider relevant focuses upon the procedure adopted by the Secretary of State which led to the adoption of the pricing-in theory. Where a decision maker adopts an economic principle which has been the subject of wide ranging consultation then a challenge based upon analysis which could have been, but which was not, advanced during the consultation must carry far less weight in the subsequent review exercise, including in one conducted with relative intensity.  In this case Professor Liebowitz’s pricing-in theory was canvassed during the Hargreaves review (see e.g. paragraphs [50], [56] and [58] above) and was squarely set out at the beginning of the consultation (see paragraphs [66ff] above) and it was hence a legitimate target for any of the many, invariably sophisticated, consultees to shoot at. The attack, based upon the new reports by Professor Liebowitz and Compass Lexecon / FTI, on pricing–in was advanced after the consultation had finished and after section 28B had been adopted and necessitated an application to be made to me to admit the evidence. Mr Stout, who gave written evidence on behalf of the Minister, explained that evidence was actively sought on, <span style="font-style:italic">inter alia</span>, pricing-in but that <span style="font-style:italic">“…the response was limited”</span>.  In assessing the lawfulness of the decision to adopt pricing-in I cannot ignore the fact that all of this analysis could have been advanced during the consultation itself and the fact that it was not is a factor weighing against a conclusion that the Secretary of State erred.  In my view this answers also the criticism made by the Claimants that the Defendant should have verified the theory with Professor Liebowitz himself; this point lacks credibility.  Professor Liebowitz was only one of the economists whose writings were relied upon by the Defendant. If the consultees were able to consult him after the event <span style="text-decoration:underline">they</span> could equally have done so before it. If they wished to persuade the Defendant that he was in error in relying upon Professor Liebowitz’s analysis then they could have sought his opinion at the outset of the consultation and presented it during the consultation.  Even where the margin of appreciation is relatively narrow it is, in my view, a relevant consideration that the decision maker put his basic economic theory on the table at the outset and asked for views upon it.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Fourthly, the ability of any court to conduct an intensive review will depend also upon the evidence put before it by the parties.  In this case the manner in which the attack on the economic logic of the decision has been advanced makes it difficult to accept. If a Court is to overturn an economic assumption made by a decision maker then it has to have before it <span style="font-style:italic">all</span> of the evidence that the decision maker considered so that it can be assessed in the round. It cannot be open to a Court to reject the Defendant’s assessment if only a small portion of the relevant evidence is relied upon for that challenge.  By its nature - and especially in relation to an issue which splits an industry and stimulates partial submissions reflecting defined economic interests - if only that portion of the evidence which reflects but one side of the argument is put before the court then it will, inevitably, appear to be a powerful and coherent body of evidence which is inconsistent with the decision maker’s reasons.  However, that might be for the very reason that it is only a portion of the evidence that was before the decision maker.  To then say that there is a coherent body of evidence that contradicts the decision is true but an inapposite conclusion since it does not necessarily indicate that the impugned decision was outwith the decision maker’s proper discretion. In this case submissions inviting rejection of the Defendant’s economic pricing-in theory have rested upon only a small portion of the actual evidence before the decision maker. I have now read the contrary evidence.  Submissions made have not focused upon why these other experts are wrong nor have they sought to weigh the pros and cons of competing economic theories.  </p>

In many consultations many hundreds of submissions and documents may be tendered. A court, assessing one piece of evidence, cannot readily, or even at all, replicate the assessment process conducted by the decision maker without also examining the totality of the evidence that was taken into account. And so it is likely to be only in rare circumstances that a court would accept as sufficient to grant relief submissions advanced on the back of only a portion of the evidence before the decision maker. For this to occur the evidence in question would have to be singularly compelling in its probative quality (and hence material to the outcome) and there would have to be evidence that the decision maker ignored it or gave it insufficient weight. </p>

So, if the evidence had suggested that (say) 93% of harm was obviated by pricing-in then the court might well conclude that it had no remit to quibble as to whether 95% or 97% should be treated as the relevant <span style="font-style:italic">de minimis</span> threshold.  But the conclusion might be very different if the evidence either fails to address what is to be understood by <span style="font-style:italic">de minimis</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">at all</span> or suggests an answer that (say) between 40-50% of rightholders would be deprived of compensation if the exception were introduced.

The Court is concerned not to pick holes in infelicitous or badly chosen language but, rather, with seeking to understand and review the true substance of the reasoning. The courts have adopted this approach in relation to reports of the Competition Commission (<span style="font-style:italic">Tesco Plc v Competition Commission </span>[2009] CAT6 at paragraph [79] (“<span style="font-style:italic">Tesco</span>”)); and officers’ reports in the context of planning (e.g. <span style="font-style:italic">South Somerset District Council v Secretary of State for Environment</span> [1993] 1 PLR 80 <span style="font-style:italic">per</span> Lord Justice Hoffmann at page 83). In the present case, the critical and final reasoning is found in the Updated Impact Assessment of March 2014. Evidence before the Court demonstrates how that reasoning evolved over time.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Sixthly, a court needs to exercise care in placing too much store by witness statement evidence from decision makers, prepared for the purposes of litigation. In many cases claimants submit that the challenged decision should stand or fall upon its own merits and after the event (“boot strapping”) attempts in witness statements to add new or supplemental reasons, caveats or “spins” must be ignored: See, for example, <span style="font-style:italic">Ermakov v Westminster City Council</span> [1995] EWCA Civ 42; <span style="font-style:italic">Lanner Parish Council v The Cornwall Council</span> [2013] EWCA Civ 1290 at paragraphs [61] and [64]; and <span style="font-style:italic">per</span> Ouseley J in <span style="font-style:italic">Ioannou v Secretary of State for Communities &amp; Local Government</span> [2013] EWHC 3945. In the present case, a different approach has been adopted by the Claimants who submitted that the Defendant’s witness statement evidence should be taken to reflect the reasoning of the Defendant and that it disclosed errors of law and evidence of predetermination. In my view, the reasoning the Defendant accepted has been set out comprehensively in the Updated Impact Assessment of March 2014 and it is to that document that I must primarily turn to identify the Defendant’s reasoning.</p>

In my judgment, the Defendant was entitled to infer and accept, as a starting point for analysis, that: (i) not every consumer who engaged in unlawful copying would have purchased a duplicate copy of the copyrighted work absent that copying; and (ii), that pricing-in is a rational and normal pricing strategy for vendors, producers and suppliers to adopt in circumstances, such as the present, where there is uncontrollable copying of the product being sold and where the market has evolved upon that basis. The Defendant did not arrive at these inferences upon the basis of an evidential vacuum or by speculation (see below). He drew these economically intuitive inferences upon the basis of other facts that he was entitled to accept. These were set out in the Hargreaves Review Report and recorded in documents promulgated as part of the subsequent Consultation and which are also found in research documents and other academic literature and are set out in the Updated Impact Assessment.

It is therefore appropriate to distinguish between speculation and the drawing of inferences. Speculation and the drawing of inferences are quite different things. A decision maker can properly draw inferences from facts through ordinary processes of deductive reasoning and by applying common sense. Speculation, however, is the forming of conclusions for which there is no evidential foundation and which are neither self-evident nor common sense. This is not a mere semantic quibble. In criminal trials, for instance, where juries are required to find facts, it is universal practice to direct juries to distinguish between speculation (which they cannot and should not do) and the drawing of inferences upon the basis of facts they accept (which they are entitled to do).</p>

That perfectly sensible conclusion might go some way to answering the requisite legal question but it does not go all the way.

In the iTunes example, upon introduction downloads were priced at a higher price than content which could be copied to a more limited extent due to DRM. The reasoning states that this appeared to show strong evidence of pricing-in, as theory predicted. However, subsequently, the differential pricing exercise was abandoned by iTunes and this led, in the assessment, the IPO to say that accordingly:</p>

It is contained within the quotation at paragraph [100] above (5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> paragraph therein). Here, the IPO, having downplayed the relevance of the iTunes incident, states that in relation to other download formats, such as video, these continued to use DRM to restrict the number of copies that can be made and responses to the Government’s Consultation suggest that rightholders expect in consequence to charge more for formats which physically permit more copying. They cite (in footnote 45) by way of example evidence tendered by the British Screen Advisory Council. This illustration arises in the film market but not the music market.

The Defendant points out here that one approach to research could be to examine the impact on consumer demand and sales of copies. The tenor of the observation is that such information could have significant probative value. However, no such survey was ever commissioned. In the course of the hearing Mr Saini QC, in response to my question, confirmed that this was so but he could not, on behalf of the Defendant, explain why. Mr Mill QC, for the Claimants, pointed out that prior to the adoption of the decision (but after the Consultation closed) the Claimants submitted a summary report prepared by Compass Lexecon / FTI which did address this particular evidential lacuna but this is nowhere referred to in the reasons in the assessment. For present purposes it suffices to record that evidence the Defendant accepted would have been relevant and potentially valuable was not collected. This particular reference in the assessment is not, therefore, “evidence” in any rational or meaningful sense that could be relied upon to justify the challenged conclusion.</p>

No such comparative exercise was, however, conducted. This was because the Defendant concluded, upon the basis of generalised objections, that it would not be useful. Once again, I am not in this analysis concerned to appraise the Defendant’s reasons for not pursuing this evidence. I am concerned only to identify what the “evidence” base for the conclusion that harm would be minimal or zero was. Accordingly, as with the survey of consumer perceptions, no price analysis was undertaken and, again, this cannot amount to “evidence” in any ordinary sense of that word which can be relied upon to justify the decision.</p>

As to this, evidence was submitted by the MPAA (see paragraph [110] above) which included a summary report by Law and Economics Consulting Associates (“LECA”). This was submitted prior to the promulgation of the Updated Impact Assessment and it is evident from the disclosed documents that it was accepted as being relevant and admissible to the Defendant’s on-going investigations. LECA purported to present new evidence that undermined the Government’s conclusions that private copying would not inflict serious harm on the film and TV sector and which suggested that the proposed copying exception could reduce revenues in the UK film and TV industry by as much as 15%. However, of far greater relevance in my view was the alleged identification of key errors in the interpretation of the data relied upon in the Updated Impact Assessment. In other words MPAA focused upon evidence that the Defendant accepted as relevant and probative and submitted that it had been misconstrued. It is a criticism that can fairly be said to go to the core of the Defendant’s reasoning on film. LECA identified the claim in the 2012 Impact Assessment that “<span style="font-style:italic">private copying for personal, non-commercial use is already widespread</span>”. LECA submitted that their own assessment of the underlying sources of this statement demonstrated, to the contrary, that private copying for personal, non-commercial use was not <span style="text-decoration:underline">in fact</span> widespread. LECA found that only “<span style="font-style:italic">…around 1% of film and TV buyers engage in private copying of the type covered by the proposed new law, and that the most common reasons people give for not copying are that they were satisfied with the product purchased and that there is a current law against it</span>”. LECA pointed out that for the assumption that illegal private copying was widespread the Defendant had relied upon a report published in 2010 by Consumer Focus which was itself based upon a Kantar Media Survey commissioned in 2009. The Consumer Focus survey had been specifically identified and relied upon by the IPO in the 2012 Impact Assessment. For example in that assessment the following was stated:</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">To further assess the Government’s assumptions, we used a Freedom of Information request to obtain the actual raw data direct from Consumer Futures. That data underlies the Consumer Focus Report from 2010. Our review of this survey data shows clearly that the extent of illegal private copying is much more limited than assumed by the Government. The Government’s own survey showed that the proportion of the population copying DVDs or CDs for personal use as a whole – for example (i.e. not limited to specific devices) – is not extensive. Only 28% of the total population surveyed engaged in making copies of CDs or DVDs for personal use (561 out of 2026 surveyed). This is far from widespread. Instead, as outlined below, our recent survey properly measured private copying of the type covered by the proposed new law. It showed that less than 3% of the population were engaged in such behaviour, much less than the 28% measured in the Kantar Media study. Thus the Government’s claim that private copying for personal, non-commercial use was widespread exaggerated the result from the Government’s own data (28%) – and relied upon a measure which was in any event inflated and which failed to accurately measure the behaviour in the first place (less than 3%)”.</p>

This is copying based upon purchases made historically, pre-digitalisation. The point was made by consultees during the consultation process that this was a category of harm for which compensation was required. This covered for instance purchases of vinyl records from (at least) the 1960s onwards; and CDs from the 1980s onwards.  The copyrighted work deployed in the course of argument to illustrate the Claimants’ point (because it was no doubt speculated that it would appeal to the Court) was Pink Floyd’s “<span style="font-style:italic">Dark Side of the Moon</span>” released in March 1973.  When this was first released there was, of course, no material scope for purchasers to copy the album (save possibly by playing it and simultaneously recording it through the air onto a tape cassette, generating a passable but tinny sounding rendition) and hence the basis upon which it could be said that there was pricing-in of subsequent copying was absent.  However, “old vinyl” records were now very popular not least because record players were now sold with in-built copying facilities (such as USB ports etc). <span style="font-style:italic">Dark Side of the Moon</span> could now be copied extensively from old records with excellent results. The Claimants also adduced evidence to the effect that between 1983 and 2000 about 1,506,741,000 CDs where shipped into the UK with a trade value exceeding £7 billion and that it was during this period that copying became more prevalent.  They accordingly submitted that in any evaluation of the extent to which pricing-in could capture all relevant “harm” an assessment had to be made of the modern copying of old vinyl records and CDs where, on no proper basis, could it be said that pricing-in occurred. However, there was no evidence that such as assessment had ever occurred.</p>

He submitted instead that any vendor of content even in pre-digitalisation days would have priced-in “such copying as would occur over time”.  With respect, this is no answer to the criticism which is made.  The Defendant’s case on pricing-in takes as one of its core factual premises that it is digitalisation that has made copying endemic and that pricing-in would not exist but for digitalisation. But no such premise can be taken to hold true pre-digitalisation. The truth is that the Defendant simply did not think of this category of relevant harm during the consultation and hence it is not included in the Updated Impact Assessment as part of the reasoning for the conclusion that pricing-in obviates harm. I am unable to say that, had it been investigated, it would have turned out to be material; but the point cannot be discarded without proper investigation. In my view this is another area where the inquiry was incomplete.</p>

That level of exactitude might not however be possible in the present case (of paragraph [143] above) but the Defendant has not examined whether this is so. Nonetheless, since the test in law is framed in terms of a <span style="font-style:italic">de minimis</span> threshold it assumes that Member States will be able to determine when it is met, or not. In my view, the Secretary of State will need to consider both the global sums which might be uncompensated for; but also the scale of the sums likely to be payable to individuals. If, for instance, the Secretary of State concluded that there were a very large number of rightholders who would be due some minor payment I do not consider that the fact that the sum total of all outstanding payments might appear to be a significant figure necessarily means that the <span style="font-style:italic">de minimis</span> exception would not apply. I consider that the Secretary of State is also entitled to take proportionality into account; if the payments due are overwhelmingly trivial then it might be disproportionate to set up a system that may be complex and bureaucratic, and which was criticised in the Hargreaves Report, simply to administer the payment out of a large number of very minor payments. At all events, what is lacking from the Updated Impact Assessment is any articulation of what is meant or understood by the concept of <span style="font-style:italic">de minimis</span> in the context of harm flowing from the copyright exception. Given the fundamental importance of this concept this is a material failing.</p>

This is why it lies within the competence and discretion of the Defendant to use a proper combination of quantitative and qualitative analyses (for instance surveys) in order then to draw inferences.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">First, the Secretary of State was entitled to have a strong predisposition. The distinction between a predisposition and predetermination is well understood in the law. A decision maker may consult upon an issue that he has a firm view about. Indeed, if the decision maker’s cards are laid squarely upon the table consultees are fully informed as to that predisposition and have the clearest possible target at which to aim their submissions. A strong predisposition is not, therefore, inimical to a fair consultation assuming, of course, that the decision maker is prepared to keep an open mind and be willing to change his or her views if the evidence and submissions tendered are properly persuasive.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly, the Secretary of State was not in law obliged to introduce the copyright exception and was entitled, if he concluded that a compensation scheme was the price that would have to be paid for the exception, simply to revert to the <span style="font-style:italic">status quo</span> and not introduce an exception at all.  Accordingly, a strong predisposition to push through a copyright exception without a compensation scheme was a lawful position for the Defendant to adopt. The Defendant consulted upon four options, one of which (Option 0) was “do nothing”, i.e. not introduce a copyright exception and another option (Option 1) was to introduce an exception <span style="text-decoration:underline">only</span> if it led to minimal or zero harm and thereby did not necessitate the introduction of a compensation scheme. In my judgment, these options were lawful. Under Article 5(2) of the Directive each Member State has a discretion to create an exception; but they are not obliged so to do. Hence, in leaving open the option to refrain from introducing any exception, the Defendant was doing no more than reserve his right under Article 5 to decide <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> to introduce an exception. Choosing Option 0 would not therefore have been inconsistent with EU law; and choosing Option 1 was lawful provided the exception could be introduced without more than <span style="font-style:italic">de minimis</span> harm to rightholders.</p>

Indeed there was no evidence at all of the actual thought processes of the Secretary of State in 2014 when the decision was taken to introduce the new section 28B. The only evidence before the Court of “internal” thought processes were certain emails disclosed by the Defendant in the course of the litigation emanating from civil servants. The Claimants submitted that these emails were consistent only with the conclusion that the possibility of introducing an exception with provision for fair compensation had been finally rejected long before the Consultation concluded.  In my judgment, the emails prove no such thing. There were two emails which were relied upon both authored by officials from within the IPO.

However they also show that <span style="text-decoration:underline">if</span> the evidence (or the law as laid down by the ECJ) demonstrated that there would be harm through the introduction of an exception then the officials would need to put to the Minister the option either to pay the compensation or not introduce the exception at all. For the reasons set out above, this was a lawful choice to place before Ministers. It certainly does not evince any form of predetermination as to the outcome, by the Secretary of State.  It is of course also obvious that officials do not necessarily speak for a Minister and it cannot be inferred simply from the recitation of the views of officials (in 2012) that these reflect the views of the ultimate decision maker (in 2014).  For it to be possible to attribute the views of officials to those of a Minister there would have to be evidence indicating that the internal views expressed by the officials accurately reflected the Minister’s view and  had been acted upon by him when the decision was taken. These emails do not provide that evidence.</p>

I accept that one component of a conclusion that a decision maker has unlawfully closed his mind, fettered his discretion, and predetermined a matter, might in principle be a finding that unwarranted inferences were drawn from evidence. However, in the present case the conclusions as drafted and set out in the Updated Impact Assessment would have indicated to the Minister when he read them that he could legitimately proceed to introduce the copyright exception without a compensation mechanism. The fact that (as I find) the Defendant erred in this regard does not prove predetermination or the appearance thereof. It suggests only that the Defendant erred in accepting the reasons in the Updated Impact Assessment. It will thus be rare for inferences of this type to amount to conclusive evidence of predetermination. The evidence may suffice to mount a rationality challenge but it does not, necessarily, prove predetermination. Mr Mill QC confirmed that the Claimants did not allege bad faith on the part of the Defendant. The emails relied upon show the thought processes of officials, not the decision maker. The Defendant has given disclosure of relevant internal documentary material and had there existed evidence that the Minister had, for instance, expressed the position that he would proceed with the copyright exception regardless of the evidence, then that would have been disclosed.  But there is no evidence that the Minister did anything other than accept the conclusions in the Updated Impact Assessment. Ultimately, in the absence of any evidence that the Defendant <span style="font-style:italic">in actual fact</span> prematurely closed his mind to any evidence which undermined Option 1, I cannot accept the submission that the outcome was predetermined.</p>

Article 108(3) TFEU imposes upon Member States an obligation to inform the Commission of plans to grant or alter aid and it prohibits the implementation of proposed measures pending such notification. It has been long established that Article 108(3) TFEU is directly effective. As such, it may be relied upon before domestic courts as a ground for impugning the legality of a legislative measure said to constitute unnotified and hence unlawful state aid. In such a challenge the court must form its own view as to whether the impugned measure or act does, or does not, involve the grant of an aid within the meaning of the Treaty: see, for example, <span style="font-style:italic">R v Customs &amp; Excise Commissioners ex p Lunn Poly Limited</span> [1999] 1 CMLR 1357 at paragraphs [22] – [24] <span style="font-style:italic">per</span> Lord Woolfe MR.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The analysis to be undertaken of “aid” by a Court may involve the consideration of a number of quite different components. In my judgment the question whether there is aid “through State resources” is an objective question for the Court and does not involve the conferral of any margin of appreciation upon the decision maker. The facts which must be considered by the Court do not involve any evaluative judgment on the part of the Defendant; the Court simply has to identify the manner in which the advantage allegedly comes about and then assess the nature of the link between the advantage and the State budget in terms of the closeness and strength of the nexus. The relevant facts are fixed and within a relatively narrow compass. It is possible that the Court, in another case involving other component parts of the definition of “aid”, might need to adopt a more limited review. So, for instance, if the issue was whether the market investor test was satisfied and it could be shown that on one reasonable analysis the test was met a Court might be loathe to substitute its own view for that of the decision maker. I do note in this regard however that the Court of Justice has stated that even where the analysis of whether “aid” exists is “technical or complex” the Court (<span style="font-style:italic">in casu</span> a judicial review by the General Court of a decision of the Commission) must conduct a “comprehensive review”: see e.g. Case C-487/06P <span style="font-style:italic">British Aggregates Association v Commission</span> [2008] ECR I-10515 paragraph [114]. I emphasise however that no such complex technical or economic issue arises on the facts of the present case and I do not therefore express any view on how a Court would address other more complex components of “aid”.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The nub of the dispute between the parties arises in relation to the Intervener’s submission that there has been an aid “<span style="font-style:italic">through state resources</span>” (cf. the second condition above). A large number of legislative measures will have winners and losers. The administrative practice of performing impact assessments means that Government will routinely endeavour to estimate in monetary terms the economic advantage accruing to the winners. That advantage is invariably an inherent part of the legislative instrument. It would not therefore ordinarily be treated as a revenue opportunity foregone by the State and it is artificial to seek to categorise it as revenue foregone by arguing that the State should have charged the winning category of persons in order to negative the advantage and that the omission to do so is therefore lost revenue. The question in this case is whether the advantage to the “tech-sector” identified in the Updated Impact Assessment can be said to amount to revenue foregone by the State and therefore aid “through State resources”? The particular issue is whether the advantage which has been identified is so closely connected to State resources that, contrary to the normally expected position, it can properly be said to flow through the State’s budgetary resources and hence constitute “aid”. As I explain below the Court of Justice has developed two tests for drawing the line between advantages which are and are not “aid”. The first test focuses upon the strength of the link between the alleged advantage and the State’s budget; the second test starts from the premise that an advantage does arise but then asks whether it is inherent in a legislative or regulatory scheme designed to meet another purpose.</p>

The Intervener submits that, notwithstanding the relatively small scale of the benefit, it was treated as being significant having been specifically identified in the assessment under the heading “Key non-monetised benefits”. The Intervener submits that the economic advantages which technology firms are accorded by operation of the new copyright exception are not benefits they would receive under ordinary market conditions.

There is no cost or expense which has been absorbed by the State by reason of the failure to impose a levy. Indeed, it is strongly doubted whether any charge could ever have been imposed under Article 5(2)(b) since such charges are levied to fund compensation to rightholders not negative collateral advantages to third parties.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Thirdly, the Secretary of State advances a broader point: if the mere fact that a legislative measure exerted positive effects for particular industries meant that they became State aid then virtually any beneficial legislative intervention would be prohibited, at least without the prior consent of the European Commission. It is commonplace for legislative measures to create benefits for some and detriments for others; but State aid laws are neither designed nor intended to prohibit such measures by reason of these obvious and often inevitable effects. The Defendant relies upon the principle, well established in case law, that the legislative allocation of financial burdens or benefits as between private undertakings does not amount to the character of State aid nor does the fact that this may result in reduced tax receipts by the State.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">State aid issues arise in public law litigation not infrequently.  Article 107 TFEU is an important provision of law but it has acquired a reputation as an argument of last resort because it is often thrown in at the end of a long list of other arguments and is not always given the level of attention that is required if the arguments are to be made good. The present case is an illustration.  The Intervener did not seek its own judicial review; it joined the Claimants’ but with its own discrete argument.  As such it has had to be content with life as an Intervener which has strictly limited the evidence and arguments it can advance. The Defendant for his part was confronted with these arguments late in the day, shortly before the hearing, and has therefore chosen to contest the issue on a limited battle ground. In the event this strategy has succeeded. But I have doubts as to whether other conditions of the definition are in fact met.  In particular, I am not clear that there is “aid” or (whilst recognising that the thresholds in law are relatively low) whether even if there is “aid” that the benefits and advantages said to amount to the “aid” are sufficiently large and focused to be liable to distort competition, or, affect inter-state trade. It seems to me to be at least arguable that the benefits identified are so remote and diffuse that they do not amount to “aid” and/or that they would exert no sufficient impact on the market or trade between Member States.  The market is vast and international and at best the benefits amount to circa £26m per annum spread throughout that market in ways that might well not be such as to cause any discernible alteration in competitive or commercial behaviour. Whether this is so or not would require some detailed (and possibly expert) analysis and this has not arisen in this case. The consequences of a Court applying Article 107 TFEU may be very serious and should not be so applied, by a side wind, without that Court having undertaken a proper analysis of all the factual conditions precedent. Had I therefore agreed with the Intervener on the point in issue I would not have granted relief in relation to this piece of important legislation upon that score, without first being fully satisfied that Article 107 TFEU was properly engaged in all its facets.</p>

In the present case, an advantage granted by the national legislature, that is, the tradability of NO<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">x</span> emission allowances, could entail an additional burden for the public authorities in the form of an exemption from the obligation to pay fines or other pecuniary penalties (see, to that effect, Case C-295/97 <span style="font-style:italic">Piaggio</span> [1999] ECR I-3735, paragraph 42). By establishing the ‘dynamic cap’ scheme, the Kingdom of the Netherlands gave to the undertakings covered by the measure in question the possibility of buying emission allowances in order to avoid the payment of fines. In addition, the consequence of that system is the creation, without real consideration supplied to the State, of emission allowances which, because of their tradable character, have an economic value. It must be concluded that the Member State could have sold such rights, or where appropriate put them up for auction, if it had structured that scheme differently (see, in that regard, paragraphs 63, 64 and 86 to 96 above).</p>

Thus, the General Court’s conclusion in paragraph 75 of the judgment under appeal that the undertakings concerned are free to sell their emission allowances even though they are linked to a maximum ceiling, is not called into question by the arguments submitted. As the Advocate General considered in point 87 of his Opinion, the Member State, by conferring on those emission allowances the character of tradable intangible assets and by making them available to the undertakings concerned free of charge instead of selling those allowances or putting them up for auction, foregoes public resources.</p>

With regard to the arguments concerning <span style="font-style:italic">PreussenElektra</span>, the General Court correctly distinguished that judgment from the present case. According to that judgment, legislation of a Member State which, first, requires private electricity supply undertakings to purchase electricity produced in their area of supply from renewable energy sources at minimum prices higher than the real economic value of that type of electricity, and, second, allocates the financial burden arising from that obligation amongst those electricity supply undertakings and upstream private electricity network operators, does not constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) of the Treaty.</p>

On the contrary, in the present case, as the Advocate General stated in point 92 of his Opinion, that foregoing of resources cannot be considered as ‘inherent’ in any instrument designed to regulate emissions of atmospheric pollutants by an emission allowance trading scheme. Where it has recourse to those instruments, the State has in principle a choice between allocating those allowances free of charge or selling or auctioning them. Furthermore, in the present case there is a sufficiently direct connection between the measure in question and the loss of revenue, a link which did not exist between the imposition of the obligation to purchase and the possible diminution in tax receipts at issue in the case which led to the judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">PreussenElektra</span>.

The Intervener’s argument is that because there is an advantage it is to be treated as a gift or a <span style="font-style:italic">gratis</span> advantage which has been wholly unearned and unwarranted.  It flows from the State and could very easily have been negatived by the State charging the benefited class for that advantage. Such a charging scheme could have been introduced under Article 5(2)(b) or the European Communities Act 1972.  As such because the advantage has not been charged for it reflects revenue foregone.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">However, in my view, this is exactly the sort of hypothetical, remote and indirect diminution in revenue that the Court of Justice has been keen to avoid becoming ensnared within the State aid rules. I reject the submission that there is revenue foregone because the State could have imposed a levy in order to neutralise the advantage, or because the State is said to be “liable” for breach of Article 5(2)(b) and in consequence, the liability represents “<span style="font-style:italic">…a clear and concrete risk</span>” to the budget. These are not, in my view, the sorts of linkages which the Court of Justice would view as remotely sufficient. The Intervener sought to draw an analogy with the facts of <span style="font-style:italic">Netherlands (Emissions Trading Scheme) </span>in which the Court held that there <span style="text-decoration:underline">was</span> a revenue foregone and hence<span style="font-style:italic"> “aid”.  </span>But in truth the facts of the present case could hardly be more different. In that case the Court found as fact that the disputed emissions trading scheme in the Netherlands resulted in revenue foregone because the state had instituted a formal market in emission credits specifically conferring “<span style="font-style:italic">allowances</span>” which the Court felt able to categorise as “<span style="font-style:italic">intangible assets</span>” (see paragraphs [102]), not least because it was a specific object of the emission credit scheme that these assets should have two valuable characteristics.  First, they were capable of being traded in a formal market (cf. paragraphs 88ff) and were intended thereby to have an “<span style="font-style:italic">economic value</span> (cf. paragraph [106]).  Secondly, these credits were the deliberate act of the State in establishing the dynamic cap scheme which enabled undertakings to “<span style="font-style:italic">avoid the payment of fines</span>” i.e. they served as fiscal or penal exemptions. There was thus revenue foregone because the State gave away for no consideration valuable, tradeable, assets which were capable of being used to offset financial charges which would otherwise have accrued to the State. The present facts do not even come close to exhibiting the closeness and formality of the connection between the advantage and foregoing of State resource which arose in the <span style="font-style:italic">Netherlands</span> case. The other side of the coin (relied upon by the Secretary of State) is <span style="font-style:italic">PreussenElektra</span> where the linkage between the advantage and the debit to the State budget was held to be too indirect and remote to amount to an advantage through state resources. In my judgment comparing and contrasting the facts of <span style="font-style:italic">Netherlands (Emissions Trading Scheme)</span> with the facts of <span style="font-style:italic">PreussenElektra </span>enables a clear line to be drawn between the sorts of advantage conferred by the state which do and do not amount to revenue foregone and an advantage conferred through State resources. In the present case the alleged aid is no more than an estimation of a diffuse advantage spread across a wide class with no clear shape or definition or formality to it. The facts of the present case fall some considerable distance away from the Article 107(1) TFEU line and do not have the characteristics of anything that could be said to amount to revenue foregone by the State.</p>

It is on a par with the sorts of benefits and burdens that much legislation in the commercial or consumer sectors, when introduced, results in.  If the Intervener’s case was correct then many pieces of legislation would be capable of amounting to an “aid” simply because they conferred a collateral benefit upon a definable category of natural or legal persons who were in business. In my view the present case is – again – exactly the sort of case that the Court of Justice has become astute of the need to take outside of the State “aid” rules and which it has done through the rule that benefits which are “<span style="font-style:italic">inherent</span>” in general legislative measures do not create “aid” simply because the benefit might in some loose way be described as revenue foregone by the State.</p>
