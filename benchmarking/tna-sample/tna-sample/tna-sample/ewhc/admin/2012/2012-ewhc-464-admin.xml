	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Dr Lawrence is a consultant psychiatrist practising from 96 Harley Street in London. In September 2010 a Fitness to Practise Panel (‘the FTPP”) of the General Medical Council (“the GMC”) conducted a hearing into allegations that, in the course of his psychiatric and psychotherapeutic treatment of Patient B, a married woman in her late thirties/early forties, between December 2005 and June 2007 Dr Lawrence acted in various ways which were said to have been inappropriate, not in the best interests of his patient and an abuse of his professional position. The most serious allegations were that he attempted to pursue an emotional relationship with Patient B, encouraged her to believe that he wanted to pursue an emotional relationship with her, revealed to her sexual fantasies he had about her, told her she was attractive, spoke of meeting her socially and told her personal information about himself. It was alleged that his conduct was sexually motivated. It was also alleged that Dr. Lawrence should have heeded the advice of his supervisors to stop treating Patient B and, further, that when Patient B fell pregnant in the summer of 2006 and was considering a termination of pregnancy, he should have referred her to someone else for counselling.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Following a three week hearing the FTPP made a series of adverse findings of fact against Dr Lawrence, although not all the allegations were found proved. It found that his fitness to practise was impaired and by way of sanction directed that his name be erased from the Medical Register.</p>

In view of the volume of material and complexity of issues raised in the appeals against (a) and (b), it was agreed at the hearing in front of me that those appeals should be argued and determined before consideration of the appeals against (c) and (d).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">At the outset of the hearing Mr Booth who appeared for Dr Lawrence admitted on his behalf the allegations in paragraphs 1, 2.a., 2.b.ii., 2.b.iii., 2.c.ii., 2.d.i. and 2.d.ii.  Thus he admitted telling Patient B personal information about himself and telling her that she was attractive, that he continued treating her even though his supervisors had advised him to stop doing so and that he did not refer Patient B to another therapist for counselling about whether to undergo a termination. It was not admitted and indeed was denied that any of those acts and omissions was inappropriate, not in the best interests of his patient, an abuse of his professional position or sexually motivated as alleged in paragraphs 4 and 5. Indeed Dr Lawrence denied any sexual motivation and denied that he attempted to pursue an emotional relationship with Patient B or that he encouraged her to believe that he wanted to pursue such a relationship.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Patient B was referred to Dr Lawrence by Mr Guy Thorpe-Beeston, a consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist in December 2005 after she had suffered a miscarriage in traumatic circumstances. Dr Lawrence first saw her on 30 December 2005. He treated her with medication for her depression and one to one psychotherapy. He also recommended her for group therapy sessions which she attended on a regular basis. Those group sessions were facilitated by a combination of Sue Sutcliffe, Dr Lawrence and, in the early days, Kay Dowd. Ms Sutcliffe and Ms Dowd were colleagues of Dr Lawrence who practised at 96 Harley Street.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">At some point in 2006 it is common ground that Patient B became aware that she was becoming attracted to Dr Lawrence. He asked her about it and she revealed her attraction to him. It is also common ground that, as described by Dr Kennedy, the GMC’s expert, this is a well recognised and not uncommon phenomenon in psychotherapy known as “erotic transference”.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In early July 2006 Patient B discovered that she was pregnant. She was ambivalent about whether or not to go through with the pregnancy. She revealed her ambivalence in both group therapy sessions and one to one sessions with Dr Lawrence. She did not ask to be referred elsewhere. She rejected Dr Lawrence’s suggestion that she might want to see Sue Sutcliffe instead of him. However Dr Lawrence did not tell Patient B that he would no longer be able to see her for one to one sessions and he did not refer her to another therapist for counselling about whether to undergo a termination. On 6 September 2006 Patient B underwent a termination of pregnancy performed by Mr Thorpe-Beeston, Dr Lawrence, in his capacity as Patient B’s psychiatrist, having previously signed what is known as the “pink form” to state that in his opinion the procedure was clinically indicated. </p>

This email was discovered by Dr Lawrence only after the hearing was well under way and Patient B had already given evidence. He relied on it as corroborating his evidence that he had not, as alleged by Patient B, reciprocated her expressions of attraction to him but had rather sought to make her realise that there was no realistic possibility of a relationship between them.

He presented Patient B’s case in supervision on a regular basis. His supervisors expressed concern for his vulnerability in the light of the reported persistence of Patient B’s erotic transference and her reported unwillingness to recognise it as such and they therefore advised him that he should stop treating her. Dr Lawrence explained to them why he felt that it would be preferable for him to continue treating Patient B and his supervisors accepted that reasoning. </p>

It was not disputed by Dr Lawrence that in January 2000 he was found guilty of serious professional misconduct by a Professional Conduct Committee (“PCC”) of the GMC. The PCC found that he pursued an emotional and sexual relationship with a vulnerable female patient and on three separate occasions had sexual intercourse with her at her home. This was found to have been a gross abuse of trust. The PCC also expressed concern about Dr Lawrence’s failure to maintain any or any adequate records of his large number of consultations with the patient from December 1996 to April 1998, having seen only one piece of paper which recorded two consultations. As a result Dr Lawrence’s registration was suspended for twelve months.</p>

The PCC on that occasion expressed serious concern at evidence that Dr Lawrence’s breach of trust had been a calculated and deliberate course of conduct in respect of a vulnerable patient. However it also heard that he accepted the gravity of what he had done and expressed remorse together with an assurance that he had come to terms with what he saw to be the flaws in his personality that led to that behaviour. It expressed itself as impressed by the measures he intended to put in place if restored to the register but decided, in the light of his previous calculated and serious breaches of professional standards and their concerns, to extend the period of suspension for a further twelve months both to mark the seriousness of his original behaviour and to give him time to provide evidence to convince the PCC that he was in a position to give an appropriate psychiatric service to his patients and that the circumstances giving rise to his previous behaviour could not recur in the future.</p>

It also noted that he had taken steps to establish a formal and professional approach to note taking and record keeping. It was satisfied that there was no indication that he posed a continued risk to the public in resuming unrestricted practice and therefore decided that it would be unnecessary to make any further direction concerning his registration.

At that session Patient B sought clarification from Dr Lawrence about his feelings. She said that Dr Lawrence told her that it was appropriate that they continue to work together but that they both had to accept that nothing could happen between them at the end of her therapy. In the course of that discussion Dr Lawrence revealed to Patient B details about his personal life including about his divorce, his sole care of his four children and his new partner. On 27 June 2007 Dr Lawrence sent a letter referring Patient B whom he described as being extremely angry with him to Maggie Chapman, a psychotherapist. </p>

Dr King-Lewis referred Patient B to Dr Jeanie Speirs, a consultant psychiatrist. Dr Speirs saw Patient B on 3 July 2007 and agreed with the GP’s suggestion of referring her to Suzi Barnett, a psychotherapist and counsellor. Dr Speirs diagnosed Patient B with a clinical depressive illness of moderate severity but found no evidence of psychosis or a personality disorder. Patient B saw Suzi Barnett for 37 one hour sessions from 5 July 2007 until 12 September 2008. One of the matters they worked on together was her relationship with Dr Lawrence, Patient B describing her feelings about him and his conduct towards her in detail. In the course of those sessions Ms Barnett used hypnosis, but according to her not when discussing Dr Lawrence. On 25 September 2008, shortly before leaving London for Australia with her husband, Patient B wrote a letter of complaint to the GMC about Dr Lawrence’s alleged treatment of her.</p>

The FTPP ruled in favour of the video link. Patient B duly gave evidence via video link from Australia over two long mornings on 7 and 8 September 2010. The FTPP then heard oral evidence from Suzie Barnett and ruled in the face of another contested application that it should have regard to the typed, non-contemporaneous and non-chronological notes made by Ms Barnett after she had re-read and then destroyed her manuscript original notes. A witness statement from Dr Speirs was read to the FTPP as agreed evidence. The GMC’s last witness was Dr Rodger Kennedy, an expert consultant psychiatrist.</p>

The application failed save in one respect, namely that the FTPP found that there was insufficient evidence to find paragraph 4(a) of the allegations proved in respect of paragraph 2(c)(ii). That is to say the FTPP found that there was insufficient evidence to find that the fact, which Dr Lawrence admitted, that he continued with his psychotherapeutic sessions with Patient B even though his supervisors had advised him to stop treating her was inappropriate. The FTPP held on this point: “However, he also told the Panel that it would be wrong to stop treating a patient unless the patient was psychotic. That was not the case with Patient B. In the light of Dr Kennedy’s evidence that it was not unreasonable for Dr Lawrence not to follow the advice of his supervisors and to continue treating Patient B, the Panel has concluded that the evidence does not demonstrate this conduct was inappropriate.” The FTPP nevertheless left open the possibility that to have continued treating Patient B in the face of that advice was not in her best interests and/or was an abuse of Dr Lawrence’s professional position.</p>

The FTPP found that Dr Lawrence did not attempt to pursue an emotional relationship with Patient B and did not try to persuade her to continue therapy with him in June 2007 when she asked him for a referral to another therapist. It did however find that he encouraged Patient B to believe that he wanted to pursue an emotional relationship with her. It further found that he had told her of a sexual fantasy which he had about her, that he spoke of meeting her socially and that he continued with his psychotherapeutic sessions with Patient B after he had become emotionally involved with her. The FTPP went on to find that the essential factual matters found proved were sexually motivated and in most respects inappropriate, not in Patient B’s best interests and an abuse of his professional position.</p>

In particular there were some allegations in which it was common ground between them that something was said by Dr Lawrence but there was a dispute as to the words used and the tenor of what was said, intended and understood. Thus in relation to the allegation about revealing sexual fantasies Patient B said that in around September 2006 Dr Lawrence told her that he had sexual fantasies about her in which he would come and visit her once or twice a year wherever she was living in the world and that her husband would be aware of the arrangement. </p>

She remembered it quite clearly. Dr Lawrence accepted that he did refer to the scenario that he would follow Patient B wherever in the world she was and her husband would know, albeit there was a difference between him and Patient B as to when it was said. However he denied having said to Patient B that it was a sexual fantasy of his. His explanation for having referred to Patient B’s husband knowing of the arrangement was that it was said deliberately to show Patient B the preposterousness of the suggestion that there could be any acting out of the fantasy which he said Patient B had admitted to him of the two of them having a sexual relationship. He said it was designed to demonstrate to her the impossibility of such a relationship and that the inclusion of the reference to her husband was designed to emphasise the impossibility. He said that that part of the scenario was designed to follow Patient B’s fantasy to its logical conclusion.</p>

According to Dr Lawrence this was said in response to Patient B’s suggestion that they meet in a hotel and was a clumsy attempt to show her the impossibility of them having a sexual relationship. Patient B accepted that Dr Lawrence’s remark about having sex in the office was an attempt by him to present to her the logistical difficulties which would be involved in them having an affair and that he described it as inappropriate. She also accepted that he was referring to difficulties not only of a practical nature but in the relationship itself.

The FTPP said that it considered implausible Dr Lawrence’s explanation of the element where Patient B’s husband would be aware of the sexual relationship as demonstrating the impracticality of him having a sexual relationship with Patient B. The FTPP made no findings of fact in relation to Dr Lawrence’s comment about having sex in the office. It did, however, find that one of the ways in which he encouraged Patient B to believe that he wanted to pursue an emotional relationship with her was by behaving towards her in a flirtatious manner. </p>

She said he replied with a very big smile on his face “are you having erotic thoughts about me?” She said that she replied that she was and in answer to a question whether she felt shy about telling him that she said that she did. At the next session she apologised for what she had said to which she said that Dr Lawrence responded that her thoughts were very welcome.

The difficulties were associated with practicalities but also with the very nature of the relationship itself. Because of the nature of the relationship it was obviously one where they could not be seen out together.

She did not recall initiating the idea of booking a hotel room and turning up under assumed names for a sexual relationship with him but accepted that she might have done.

Where do you see this going?” and was shocked by her response which was “well we could book a hotel room in assumed names and find out whether we get on as well together physically as we do emotionally.” His response was to say “at least you don’t want to have sex on the floor on the consulting room.” He was shocked. It was a spontaneous response but meant to convey the impossibility of her suggestion and to diffuse the situation. He needed to let her know that the suggestion was preposterous and impossible and inappropriate. The complicated thing was to say it in a way which was not to do with her being unattractive or not desirable because that was her belief system. So it had to be impossible because it was impossible and not because she was not desirable. He acknowledged that it was a clumsy intervention as was his remark “So are you suggesting that I could come and visit you where you are in the world and your husband would know about it and we would have a sexual relationship?” He said both statements challenged her perception that those ideas were anything other than fantasies.</p>

She also said that in May 2007, in response to a text message from her complaining that he had not responded to text messages asking if she could arrange another appointment, Dr Lawrence rang her, apologised for not contacting her and said that the reason was because all he could think of was ringing her up to ask her out for a drink. When she told Dr Lawrence in April 2007, before receiving documents from the GMC about his prior suspension, that she had discovered, by googling the GMC website, about his previous history, Patient B said that they discussed it.</p>

His reference to having wanted to ask her out for a drink from her perspective was Dr Lawrence clearly indicating that he was interested in her and still wished to see her at the end of the therapy. Given the similarities of how he acted during his sessions with the previous person she began to have doubts that what he was saying to her was real and genuine. She raised those doubts with him at a very difficult session which ended very badly in June 2007.</p>

She said that Dr Lawrence said that despite suspecting his own motives for continuing to see her and despite the fact that his supervisor had advised him not to see her he thought that they could continue to work together but that they both had to move on and accept that nothing could happen at the end of her therapy. Patient B said that she asked Dr Lawrence why he had led her on the way he had. At that point she said that he took her hand, which was the first physical contact they had ever had, and said that she deserved someone more than what he could give her. He said that his life was not his own. He was trapped in a cage and he then went on to describe his personal situation.</p>

Having checked the waiting room to see that nobody was in it, he came back out and said that he would like to visit her at the end of her therapy after a suitable period of time and said that this could not be about her yearning anymore and that he was now part of it.

He denied telling Patient B in July 2006 that he wanted to see her at the end of her therapy and denied using the word sadly when saying that she would be over him by the end of her therapy. He also denied having told Patient B that he suspected his own motives for continuing to see her and that he had said that they both had to move on as distinct from her having to move on. His position was that he had not been leading Patient B on. As to Patient B’s suggesting that he told her that she deserved someone more than what he could give, Dr Lawrence said that he did say things along those lines. However he thought that she misconstrued what he was saying. He had been saying for many weeks that she needed to direct her desire to an object which was available, that directing her desire toward an unavailable object was definitely bound to be disastrous and that he would probably have used the word deserve. </p>

The comment did not involve him personally, did not hint at his feeling and was a way in which the person could imagine that they could be perceived as attractive. He accepted that when Patient B disclosed her erotic feelings for him in May 2006 he described them as welcome, although he did not think he used the word very. He said that any feelings she brought into the therapy rooms were welcome. He accepted that it might be a little dangerous for him to have said that but it was a dangerous job and it is also dangerous to shame patients. He denied encouraging Patient B to believe something which was not true. Asked why he did not give her an answer that made it clear that what she was describing was a symptom of transference, Dr Lawrence said that he did talk to Patient B at length about the fact that her feelings were transference feelings. His use of the expression “not wishing to add fuel to the fire” was designed to say: “I don’t want to encourage your emotion but let us explore and listen to your emotion and look at it.” He denied that his remarks at that session were calculated to give Patient B the impression that her erotic thoughts were reciprocated in some way. He accepted that if he had smiled when saying those things that would undoubtedly give an impression of encouragement but said that he did not think that he did smile and was not encouraging her.</p>

Dr Lawrence denied all that. He accepted that after she revealed her erotic feelings towards him, he sought to encourage her to discuss those feelings, but only in a professional therapeutic context for the purpose of making her realise that they were an expression of erotic transference and helping her to understand the feelings which she had had throughout her life which were entirely unrelated to him. He denied saying that he found her attractive, that he had yearnings for her, that she reminded him of his first  love, that he encouraged her to think that he wanted a sexual relationship after the end of the therapy. While he accepted that he told her that she was attractive he insisted that this was said in a purely therapeutic context for the purpose of trying to increase her self esteem which she estimated to be low.</p>

The FTPP accepted Patient B’s evidence that Dr Lawrence said that he had thought about asking her out for a drink and that when the therapy was over he would like to see her after a suitable interval had elapsed. It found that although he did not actually pursue an emotional relationship with Patient B he did encourage her to believe in the possibility in having such a relationship. He did that by amongst other things telling her that she was attractive, behaving towards her in a flirtatious manner, telling her that when this was all over he would like to meet her and by divulging his fantasy that he would visit her anywhere in the world and have sex with her. The FTPP found that his pattern of encouragement led Patient B to believe that he wanted to pursue an emotional relationship with her. </p>

It made a distinction between a normal caring professional therapeutic relationship and an emotional relationship. It considered that Dr Lawrence became over involved with Patient B. It found that his encouragement, leading her to believe that he wanted an emotional relationship, his disclosure of information to her about his family and personal relationships, that he told her that she reminded him of his first love all indicated an inappropriate and unprofessional level of emotional involvement. It noted the text message he sent her on 15 July 2006 while he was on holiday which included information about his children and his whereabouts. It referred to Dr Lawrence’s evidence that he imparted personal information in order to help Patient B therapeutically but considered that it was more likely to be a demonstration of his wish to encourage her ongoing interest in him and to gratify his own needs.</p>

Thus in finding that Dr Lawrence’s revelation to Patient B of sexual fantasies he had about her was an abuse of his professional position, it declared itself satisfied that he revealed his sexual fantasies about Patient B for his own reasons and self gratification.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In finding that Dr Lawrence telling Patient B personal information about himself was inappropriate, the FTPP noted the expert evidence of Dr Kennedy and Dr Denman that there may be occasions when it is appropriate for a therapist to reveal personal information to a patient, for example in response to a direct question. However it found that it was inappropriate and unnecessary for Patient B’s therapy/treatment for him to tell her that she reminded him of his first love and that he wished he had slept with more women, both factual allegations which Dr Lawrence had denied. In finding that conduct to be an abuse of his professional position the FTPP considered that, in the light of Patient B’s vulnerability, any disclosure by Dr Lawrence of such personal information fuelled her emotional attachment to him and encouraged her to be sympathetic and supportive to him and as such was not in her best interests.</p>

However it noted that Dr Kennedy told the FTPP that whereas it would have been appropriate to continue therapy if the allegations against Dr Lawrence were untrue, if they were true it could be evidence that he became obsessed with his patient and would not let go. The FTPP considered that Dr Lawrence should have recognised his emotional involvement with Patient B and should have realised that it was not in her best interests to continue sessions and should not have continued with them. It was of course Dr Lawrence’s testimony that he did indeed seek to work with Patient B through the experience of her erotic transference and that he never became emotionally involved with her.</p>

It noted that Ms Dowd told the FTPP that she expressed her concern about his continuing professional relationship with Patient B on a number of occasions and that Ms Sutcliffe also confirmed that the supervision group advised him to stop treating the patient.

Its judgment was that his ability to counsel her was compromised by his own emotional involvement with her. It found further that he should have been aware that her feelings for him could have impaired her ability to rationally think through her decision. Although Dr Kennedy considered that counselling in the group sessions was enough, the FTPP recorded that his answer was predicated on the allegations against Dr Lawrence not being true. It therefore concluded that he should have referred Patient B to an independent professional such as her GP. However the FTPP did not find proved the allegation in paragraph 4(c) that Dr Lawrence’s failure to refer Patient B to another therapist for counselling about whether to undergo a termination was an abuse of his professional position. It concluded that he did not prevent Patient B from seeking independent counselling or advice and, although he should have taken positive steps to facilitate Patient B obtaining further counselling about it, the FTPP did not consider that by failing to do so he was thereby abusing his professional position.</p>

In doing so it stated that it interpreted “sexually motivated” in a broad sense which included achieving gratification of sexual feelings. It accepted Mr Booth’s submission that, had he wished to pursue a physical sexual relationship with Patient B, Dr Lawrence had ample opportunity. There was no suggestion from Patient B that during his therapy he pursued a physical sexual relationship with her. The FTPP said that it was careful not to use its knowledge of his previous suspension as evidence proving the facts. However, in reaching conclusions on the balance of probabilities, it stated that it took the view that the previous allegation found proved against Dr Lawrence in 2000 made it less improbable that he might have sought to pursue an emotional or sexual relationship with Patient B. The FTPP stated that it considered that Dr Lawrence’s behaviour towards Patient B was intended to encourage her feelings for him and that his conduct was motivated by his wish to gratify his sexual feelings. In finding the allegation of sexual motivation proved in relation to the revelation to Patient B of Dr Lawrence’s sexual fantasies about her, the FTPP noted the evidence of Dr Kennedy and Dr Denman that there would be no situation in which it would be appropriate for a psychotherapist to reveal his own sexual feelings towards the patient.</p>

She left London for Australia on 1 October 2008. On 22 August 2009 Patient B in an email to the GMC asked if she would be required to provide evidence at the hearing which was then scheduled for 15 March 2010 and if so what form it would be i.e. whether a written statement would be sufficient. On 26 August 2009 the GMC replied by email stating that it was understood that Patient B was now living in Australia so that the GMC would propose to try and arrange a video link for her to give her evidence from a location near her in Australia. There was no reference in this email to Patient B being a vulnerable witness. That suggestion was made for the first time by the GMC to Dr Lawrence’s solicitors on 9 September 2009 when it was asserted that that entitled her to give her evidence by video link. On 22 September 2009 Dr Lawrence’s solicitors objected to the proposal that she should give her evidence by video link and did not accept that she might be a vulnerable witness.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The GMC’s application was supported by a letter dated 19 August 2010 from Dr Virginia McAndrew, a consultant psychiatrist practising in Australia. She expressed the opinion that the family disruption involved in Patient B giving evidence in London, which would involve travelling without her husband and leaving her young child at home in Australia, was likely to be a significant source of stress for Patient B. In the UK she did not have suitable personal or emotional connections to support her during the time away from her family while she gave evidence. She considered that for Patient B to travel to the UK to give evidence was very likely to have an adverse effect on the quality of her evidence. Separately she expressed the opinion that whilst her current mental health was more robust than it had been six months previously, the degree of autonomic arousal and potential distress which giving evidence face to face in Dr Lawrence’s presence might cause Patient B were likely negatively to impact on her ability to focus and to present her evidence clearly. She also thought it possible that such a confrontation might have a detrimental effect on her current mental health. She recommended that Patient B should not be required to present her evidence face to face in Dr Lawrence’s presence.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Witness B in a witness statement dated 31 August 2010 said that she wished to give evidence via video link from Australia. She said that the prospect of giving evidence for the hearing was very stressful not only because of the nature of the hearing but because it brought back memories of some very difficult and sad times for her and she anticipated feeling vulnerable during the hearing. That was particularly so if she was required to discuss the termination she had while under Dr Lawrence’s care. She said that she did not have family or close friends in the UK who were aware of the case and who would be able to provide support for her if she had to travel to the UK to give evidence in person. She would have to stay on her own in a hotel which would add to her feeling of isolation. By contrast if she were to give evidence via video link from Australia she would have her husband and close friends around her who knew about Dr Lawrence’s alleged behaviour during her treatment and the impact she said that it had had on her. They would be able to offer her emotional and practical support during and after the hearing. She also had professional care in Australia which she could access as necessary to support her during the hearing. She was concerned that travelling to the UK to give evidence in person would make a difficult task even more difficult. It would place extra stress on her during a time when she would be feeling very vulnerable and she was concerned that she would find it difficult to cope on her own. Providing evidence by video link would enable her to focus on her testimony without the stress of recovering from a very long flight or worrying about the impact her absence would have on her family. She added that it was her son’s sixth birthday during the period scheduled for the hearing and she did not want to be away from home on his birthday. The fallout from her treatment from Dr Lawrence had had a significant impact not only on her but also on her husband and son and she did not wish to add to that by being away on her son’s birthday and causing him distress. </p>

In Response to Patient B’s statement and Dr McAndrew’s letter Dr Reveley said that she understood that it would not be necessary for Patient B to meet Dr Lawrence face to face if she gave evidence in person because she could be shielded in some way. She said she had considered whether Patient B was unable to give evidence in person because of any psychiatric condition. However it appeared from medical notes which she had seen that Patient B was currently mentally well and therefore in her opinion in the normal course of events would be able to give evidence in person. In her opinion there was no reason from a purely psychiatric standpoint why Patient B should not travel to the UK to give evidence. She had considerable sympathy with Patient B’s difficulties in relation to her work and family commitments. However in her experience video evidence was seldom as satisfactory as a face to face interview and Patient B’s personal comfort had to be set against the gravity of her allegations and the potential repercussions for Dr Lawrence whose livelihood and career were at stake.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In response to Dr Reveley’s letter Dr McAndrew wrote a further letter to the GMC dated 4 September 2010 emphasising that her principal concern about Patient B being required to travel was the absence of social and emotional support which she would have. She said that when she first met Patient B on 5 May 2010 she formed the opinion based on her clinical examination and Patient B’s history and notes that she had a Major Depressive Episode (DSM IV) in Partial Remission. She understood that Patient B had had a relapse of her depression some months before, associated with the anticipation of the GMC hearing being scheduled for March 2010. Professor Olio who had treated her earlier had increased her medication and organised for her to have psychological therapy to assist with that. That management plan in combination with the deferral of the GMC hearing preceded Patient B’s psychiatric improvements. At their next meeting on 15 August 2010 Patient B denied being depressed and appeared clinically non-depressed. Dr McAndrew considered her Major Depressive Episode to be in Remission. However she conveyed significant affective anxiety when asked to expand on the upcoming GMC hearing process. Given her history of Major Depressive Disorder and of relapse in anticipation of this particular stressor, Dr McAndrew said that she considered Patient B to be vulnerable to relapse in the context of giving evidence to the GMC hearing. </p>

Section 51 provides that a witness other than the defendant may, if the court so directs, give evidence through a live link in certain criminal proceedings including a trial on indictment. A direction may not be given unless the court is satisfied that it is in the interests of the efficient or effective administration of justice for the person concerned to give evidence in the proceedings through a live link. In deciding whether to give a direction under section 51 the court must consider all the circumstances of the case including in particular the availability of the witness, the need for the witness to attend in person, the importance of the witness’s evidence to the proceedings, the view of the witness, the suitability of the facilities at the place where the witness would give evidence through a live link and whether a direction might tend to inhibit any part of the proceedings from effectively testing the witness’s evidence.</p>

It did not explicitly answer that question. It did however conclude that the head of charge 2(b)(i), namely that Dr Lawrence revealed sexual fantasies which he had about Patient B to Patient B, is essentially of a sexual nature albeit that the alleged behaviour is emotional rather than physical in character. It further found at that stage that heads of charge 2(b)(iii)-(vi) might in their context be of a sexual nature but that matter would be resolved by the evidence.

She would also be likely to experience anxiety in giving evidence.

Eady J’s experience led him “to believe that there is in most cases very little, if any, actual disadvantage or prejudice to either side when that means is adopted” and that “my experience is that the process of cross examination takes place as naturally and freely as when a witness is present in the court room.””.</p>

It was said to be apparent from the disclosed emails that until very shortly before the FTPP hearing commenced the GMC was approaching the mode of receipt of Patient B’s evidence as an issue of logistical convenience rather than an issue involving a truly vulnerable witness. It was submitted that the evidence had been created to fit the terms of Rule 36 rather than this being a case where the complainant had requested special measures at the outset.

That was in my view a realistic, indeed inevitable concession. Ms Callaghan, who appeared in front of me on behalf of the GMC, was in my judgment right to submit in her skeleton argument that the language of Rule 36(1)(e) provides no basis for the contention that a complaint “of a sexual nature” must involve an allegation of sexual touching. The natural and ordinary meaning of “sexual” is “relating to sex”. In circumstances where it was alleged that Dr Lawrence disclosed sexual fantasies to Patient B and was sexually motivated in his conduct towards her the allegation was plainly of a sexual nature. </p>

She submitted that the bar is cleared in both respects. As to the former she submitted that the evidence as to the effect on Patient B of giving evidence in London did not go beyond inconvenience and stress. Any possible adverse effect on the quality of her evidence arising out of the sexual nature of the allegations could be adequately avoided or mitigated by the use of screens at the hearing. The use of screens would avoid the need for Patient B to be face to face with Dr Lawrence while she gave her evidence. The FTPP in its determination had not addressed this point even though it was raised at the hearing, despite the fact that it did mention that Dr McAndrew had said that the anxiety demonstrated by Patient B at the possibility of giving evidence face to face in Dr Lawrence’s presence might negatively impact on her ability to focus and to present her evidence clearly. The inference was that the FTPP had given inappropriate weight to that evidence.</p>

The FTPP took into account the matters relied on by Dr Lawrence and in particular his submission that it would be difficult to assess body language and demeanour over a video link. It was entitled to be satisfied on the basis of its own experience of video testimony that it would be able to make observations on body language and demeanour using a video link and in that regard to take account of Lord Slynn’s observation in <span style="font-style:italic">Polanski</span> at paragraph 43 that “evidence by video link is both an efficient and an effective way of providing oral evidence both in chief and cross examination.” The FTPP was entitled to exercise its discretion in favour of receiving evidence by video link.</p>

Although in her witness statement she had expressed concerns about the prospect of having to meet Dr Lawrence face to face and Dr McAndrew in a letter dated 1 September 2010 to the GMC had recommended that she not be required to present her evidence face to face based on the inflection in her voice and her clear increase in anxiety as she contemplated having him in eyesight whilst giving evidence, neither the concerns expressed by Patient B in her witness statement nor the opinions expressed by Dr McAndrew were confined to the effect on Patient B of giving evidence face to face with Dr Lawrence. </p>

The central issue in that case was a conflict of evidence as to what had been said at an interview on 27 April 1998 in which it was alleged by the GMC that Dr Southall accused Mr. M of drugging and murdering her ten year old son who had died by hanging nearly two years earlier. Dr Southall admitted that he had probed the circumstances of Mrs M’s son at that interview and accepted that Mrs. M might have perceived that he was accusing her of murder but maintained that he did not in fact do so. He was supported by the evidence of the social worker who was in the case and present at the interview. Having heard evidence from Dr Southall, the social worker and Mrs M and others to whom she spoke in the days that followed recollecting with the aid of notes conversations over eight years earlier the FTPP in that case accepted the evidence of Mrs M and, as found by Leveson LJ, although it did not explicitly say so, must have rejected that of Dr Southall and the social worker. </p>

I have already expressed the view that Ms Lambert was right to concede that the condition in Rule 36(1)(e) was satisfied in this case. I am also clearly of the view that the condition in Rule 36(1)(b) was satisfied. Dr McAndrew formed the opinion based on her clinical examination and Patient B’s history and notes that when she first met her in May 2010 she had a Major Depressive Episode (DSM IV) in partial remission. It was not challenged by Ms Lambert that a major depressive episode is a mental disorder within the meaning of the Mental Health Act 1983. The fact that it was only in partial remission in May 2010 suggests that as at that time Dr McAndrew’s opinion was that witness B had a mental disorder in May 2010. Dr McAndrew expressed the opinion, based on her understanding that Patient B had had a relapse of her depression some months earlier associated with the anticipation of the GMC hearing then scheduled for March 2010 coupled with her conveying of significant affective anxiety at their meeting on 15 August 2010, that Patient B was vulnerable to relapse in the context of giving evidence to the GMC hearing.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In other words it was Dr McAndrew’s opinion that if Patient B gave evidence at the GMC hearing there was a real prospect of a relapse to a Major Depressive Episode. Since Rule 36(2) is designed among other things to enable the FTPP to allow a witness with a mental disorder, the quality of whose evidence is likely to be adversely affected as a result of that disorder, to give testimony via a video link, it is in my judgment clear that a witness who the FTPP considers will or is likely to have a mental disorder within the meaning of the Mental Health Act 1983 at the time they are due to give evidence is “a witness with a mental disorder within the meaning of the Mental Health Act 1983” within the meaning of Rule 36(1)(b). The Rule is concerned with the effect of mental disorder on the quality of a witness’s evidence. The time at which the quality of evidence is liable to be affected by any mental disorder on the part of the witness is the time at which the witness gives his or her evidence. It would in my judgment not only be contrary to but defeat the purpose of the Rule 36 if the FTPP were not to have the power to allow a witness to give testimony by video link in circumstances where a mental disorder which was in remission at the time an application to use a video link was made would, on the evidence before the FTPP at the time of the application, be likely to return at the time of and by reason of the witness being required to give evidence at the hearing such that it would adversely affect the quality of their evidence. Further and in any event it appears from Dr McAndrew’s opinion that Patient B was still suffering from depression in August 2010, it being only in partial as distinct from complete remission.</p>

It is clear that in reaching that conclusion the FTPP did not rely on the evidence of Patient B and the opinion expressed by Dr McAndrew as to the effect on Patient B’s evidence of giving it face to face with Dr Lawrence. It explicitly concluded that the quality of her evidence would be likely to be adversely affected by the anxiety she would be likely to experience in giving evidence if she were to travel to the UK to do so since she would be deprived of the emotional support of her family and home life and would experience a period of separation from her young child. </p>

That is to confuse the evidence as to the anticipated effect on Patient B’s evidence of giving evidence face to face with Dr Lawrence and the evidence as to the anticipated effect on the quality of her evidence of dealing with sexual allegations without the emotional support of her husband and friends in the UK where she would have no equivalent emotional support. </p>

It is in my view apparent that the FTPP was exercising the discretion conferred on it by Rule 36(1). That is apparent from the sequential way in which it considered first whether the criteria in Rule 36(1)(b) and (e) or either of them were satisfied, secondly whether the quality of Patient B’s evidence was likely to be affected thereby and thirdly whether it should exercise its discretion to allow the evidence to be given by video link. It may also be that the FTPP considered that it had discretion to permit Patient B to give her testimony by video link by reason of the discretion conferred on it by Rule 34. That may be the explanation of the reference to it accepting that it had inherent jurisdiction to manage the receipt of evidence by video link.</p>

There is no reason to suppose that the FTPP considered that such a direction could not have been given in criminal proceedings in respect of Patient B’s evidence. Accordingly given that under Rule 34(1) the FTPP had a discretion to admit Patient B’s evidence by video link provided it considered it fair and relevant to the case before it, it did not need to consider whether, in addition, it was desirable to do so pursuant to Rule 34(2). There is no question but that Patient B’s testimony whether given in person or by video link was relevant to the proceedings before the FTPP and it is plain that the FTPP considered that it was fair to allow it to be adduced by video link.

The FTPP made an explicit finding in the light of the extensive submissions by both parties that it considered it desirable to receive Patient B’s evidence via video link. Accordingly whether or not the evidence would have been admissible in criminal proceedings, the FTPP had a discretion to allow it to be adduced under Rule 34 provided that it considered it fair to do so.</p>

Moreover the FTPP found, as I have also held it was entitled to find, that the stress involved in her giving evidence in the UK would increase the risk of a relapse of her disorder.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The principal factor relied on by Dr Lawrence as pointing against it being fair or appropriate to permit the use of video link was the central importance to the case against Dr Lawrence of Patient B’s evidence and the fact that much of the case turned on a straight conflict of evidence between Patient B and Dr Lawrence as to what he said and how he behaved and how she understood his words and behaviour in sessions where no one else was present. Given the particular importance likely to be attached in such circumstances to the impressions made on the members of the FTPP by Patient B and Dr Lawrence and their view of the demeanour of the two principal protagonists, it was submitted that Dr Lawrence would be put at an unfair disadvantage if the FTPP were disabled by the use of a video link from being in a position to form as clear a view of the demeanour of Patient B as it is would be able to form of the demeanour of Dr Lawrence in the witness box. The element of unfairness it was submitted was exacerbated by the potentially disastrous effects on Dr Lawrence’s career and reputation in the event of Patient B’s evidence being preferred to his.</p>

There is a public interest in serious allegations against medical practitioners being properly investigated and, if they are found to be true, in such further steps, if any being taken as are necessary to protect the public and maintain confidence in the medical profession. The main purpose of disciplinary proceedings is to protect the public by upholding professional standards of competence and integrity on the part of medical practitioners, identifying departures from those standards and dealing with such departures appropriately. There may be cases where the conflict between that duty and the requirement of fairness to the medical practitioner against whom allegations are being investigated gives rise to very difficult judgments in the exercise of the FTPP’s discretion.

It did not consider time pauses, slowing of the pace of cross examination or potential difficulties with documentation to be significant factors. In my view there is nothing to suggest that it was wrong to be so satisfied. On the contrary as it pointed out support for that conclusion is to be derived not only from the speech of Lord Slynn in <span style="font-style:italic">Polanski</span> but also in the experience of Eady J referred to by Lord Slynn which led him “to believe that there is in most cases very little, if any, actual disadvantage or prejudice to either side when [evidence by video link] is adopted and his experience that the process of cross examination takes place as naturally and freely as when a witness is present in the courtroom.” (Paragraph 43 of the speech of Lord Slynn).</p>

Thus Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead held that a direction that Mr Polanski’s evidence in that case might be given by means of video conferencing, or “VCF” in short, would not prejudice Conde Nast to any significant extent. “If anything, as Simon Brown LJ observed, any prejudice would more likely be suffered by Mr Polanski by reason of the lessened impact of his evidence and celebrity status on the jury.” (Paragraph 13). There is an echo of this in the conclusion of the FTPP that if there were to be difficulties with the quality of video testimony which might cause it to give less weight to Patient B’s evidence that would tend to weaken the GMC’s rather than Dr Lawrence’s case.</p>

Eady J, an experienced judge, said that cross-examination takes place “as naturally and freely as when a witness is present in the court room.” Thomas LJ [2004] 1 WLR 378,402 paragraph 60 said that in his recent experience as a trial judge, giving evidence by VCF is a “readily acceptable alternative” to giving evidence in person and an “entirely satisfactory means of giving evidence” if there is sufficient reason for departing from the normal rule that witnesses give evidence in person before the court: [2004] 1 WLR 387, 402.” (Paragraph 14).</p>

If indeed there is any disadvantage it may be to the person asking for the video link evidence and it is not established that the Defendants would be adversely affected by the use of video link evidence.” (Paragraph 45). Baroness Hale of Richmond held that in that case the Defendants would suffer no prejudice from the Claimant’s evidence being given by means of a VCF. (Paragraph 69). She went on to say that the technology used in giving evidence by VCF is good so that there is little disadvantage to the other party, as Eady J said in his ruling. She did say that that disadvantage has not been entirely eliminated and referred to paragraph 2 of the Video Conferencing Guidance set out in Annex 3 to Practice Direction – Written Evidence at section 32 PD. 33 of the Civil Procedure Rules where, after the advantages of VCF had been enumerated, it was stated that:</p>

She stated that Patient B’s therapy with her could be seen in two parts: (1) to address the distress she felt following the treatment she received whilst under Dr Lawrence’s care and (2) to address the underlying depression which was the original reason for consulting Dr Lawrence. She stated that the notes she takes in sessions “are in shorthand and are intended as an aid memoire for me and as such would make little [or] no sense to others”. She stated that as agreed with the GMC Investigating Officer she had typed them up in a more structured manner for the purpose of the complaint but that they did not cover the entire content of the 37 sessions.

Ms Johnson submitted that the notes which she wished to admit were predicated on the original handwritten contemporaneous notes. It was right to say that it was not done in chronological order but rather in topic order, subject by subject. However the underlying material was Ms Barnett’s original notes.

It first announced that it had decided to accede to the GMC’s application to admit what it described as the medical records of Patient B from Ms Barnett, by which I took it to refer to the notes to which I have been referring, subject to it being satisfied, on Ms Johnson’s questioning of Ms Barnett when she was called, that it could be satisfied that they did represent her contemporaneous record. </p>

The first was the hand written notes which were a combination of speed writing handwriting and short hand which she wrote specifically for herself as a clinician. The latter she described as being not Hansard notes of what goes on in the session, but rather reminder notes for her so that when she went into the next session she could be thinking of the process that the client was going through. She had all her pages of handwritten notes and was going to send them in to the GMC. However she said that that seemed to her like a mockery since she could not understand how anybody was going to make any sense of them. So she rang the investigating officer at the GMC and asked him what he would like her to do with them. She said that she told him that she could either send the original session by session notes or she could write it up as a report which would make it much easier to see what she was doing and if she had any specific notes that actually were Patient B’s specific words she could put those in italics so that one could get a flavour of both the process, what was in her mind when she was working with Patient B and the specific words which Patient B was using. She said that she was asked to do the latter if she had the time. The typed up notes were thus “predicated” on the contemporaneous notes. Apart from what she described as her experience, she said that she relied on no other material for the purposes of the typed document.</p>

Asked why she had done so, she said that if she had time to go back and write all her other original clinical notes up in the way she had written up her notes on Patient B she would be absolutely delighted to throw away her original handwritten  notes because the typed notes would be much easier to understand.

She also submitted that it was wrong to admit them on the ground that some of what Patient B was recorded as having said might have been based on hypnosis. This was a reference to evidence given by Ms Barnett in the course of her substantive evidence after the typed notes were admitted. In that evidence Ms Barnett had said that during parts of some of the sessions she had used hypnosis on Patient B as a therapeutic tool. She had been at pains to emphasise that she only used hypnosis when dealing with Patient B’s underlying depression and not at all when discussing with her complaints about Dr Lawrence’s alleged behaviour towards her. She had however said that when she did use hypnosis she would interweave it into that part of a session in which she was dealing with Patient B’s depression so that Patient B might come in and out of hypnosis. Ms Lambert submitted that that being so it is possible that Ms Barnett’s compartmentalisation as between those parts of a session dealing with Patient B’s depression and those parts dealing with her complaints against Dr Lawrence may not have been as clear cut as Ms Barnett asserted and that that assertion could not be tested.</p>

It was common ground between the parties that evidence of recent complaint is relevant and admissible under the Criminal Justice Act 2003 both as to consistency and as to the truth of the complaint. Rule 34(1) and (2) empowered the FTPP to admit the notes if it considered them fair and relevant to the case and, if they would not be admissible in criminal proceedings, or if it considered their admission desirable.

That is not to say that the question of the use of hypnosis by Ms Barnett does not fall to be considered in the context of the separate ground of appeal, to which I shall refer later, that the FTPP should have attached little or no weight to Ms Barnett’s evidence as a whole.</p>

It was always open to Dr Lawrence, as the FTPP expressly said, to submit in closing submissions that the FTPP should attach little or no weight to the notes and one ground on which such a submission could be made would be that they were unreliable by reason of doubt or uncertainty as to whether the factual allegations recorded as having been made by Patient B had been influenced by hypnosis. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">At the stage of considering admissibility, the first question for the FTPP was whether the statements recorded as having been made by Patient B to Ms Barnett were actually made. On that question in my view the issue of hypnosis was irrelevant. Any issue as to hypnosis went to the question whether, assuming that statements attributed to Patient B were made by her, they were unreliable on the basis that they were or may have been influenced by hypnosis. That issue was as relevant to any oral testimony that Ms Barnett would in due course give as to what Patient B told her as it was to her written record of what she said Patient B told her. In my judgment those matters fell to be considered by the FTPP at the conclusion of the evidence in the context of deciding how much if any weight to attach to the notes and Ms Barnett’s testimony in so far as they revealed what Patient B told Ms Barnett.</p>

This was echoed in Ms Lambert’s submission that, although the notes were admissible, it was unfair of the FTPP to admit them under Rule 34 (1) because Mr Booth had been deprived of the opportunity to cross-examine Ms Barnett by reference to her hand written notes, and in her acknowledgement that she would have had no objection if the new notes had been made earlier and that the challenge relied on the fact of the original notes having been destroyed.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgment the fact that Ms Barnett’s original notes had been destroyed did not make it unfair to admit the typed notes. It was not suggested by Mr Booth in cross-examination that Ms Barnett had destroyed them in bad faith and it is clear on the transcripts that it did not occur to her that the original handwritten notes would be of any interest to anyone. Her evidence was that the typed notes contained no factual information other than what had been contained in the original handwritten notes and that where the original notes recorded the actual words used by Patient B to her that was shown in the typed notes by the use of italics. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In my view the assertion by Ms Barnett that the statements attributed to Patient B in the typed notes reflected those which she had recorded in the handwritten notes was a sufficient basis to entitle the FTPP to consider that it was fair to admit them. It would be open to Mr Booth when testing her substantive evidence to suggest to Ms Barnett that those statements were or may have been inaccurately transcribed or recorded in the typed written notes and subsequently to submit to the FTPP that for that reason it should pay little or no weight to them. It would also be open to Mr Booth to cross-examine Ms Barnett by reference to any discrepancy between statements attributed to Patient B in the typed notes and Patient B’s oral testimony. In fact, as appears in my subsequent discussion of the weight which the FTPP was entitled to attach to Ms Barnett’s evidence as to what Patient B told her, there was a marked similarity between Patient B’s account in her oral testimony and that appearing in the typed notes and in Ms Barnett’s oral testimony.</p>

There was no suggestion that they would not have been admissible in criminal proceedings under section 120 of the Criminal justice Act 2003. The question for the FTPP was not one of admissibility but one of fairness and the exercise of discretion. As to Mr Booth’s submission in the skeleton argument for the appeal that the decision to admit the typed notes was perverse and plainly wrong because Ms Barnett had drawn on her overall experience of Patient B in creating the document rather than simply transcribing her actual notes, in my view it is tolerably clear from reading the typed notes which parts are intended to record what Patient B said to Ms Barnett and which parts were intended to record Ms Barnett’s views. There is no reason to doubt her evidence that the typed notes contained no other facts. </p>

That challenge was developed with varying emphasis on different points both orally and in writing. As to the latter, the challenges were set out initially in detailed Grounds of Appeal and a skeleton argument, both settled by Mr Booth, and subsequently in two further written submissions by Ms Lambert which focused principally on the FTPP’s approach to issues relating to erotic transference and its reliance on its own self avowed expertise. The former were developed in opening and curtailed reply submissions by Ms Lambert over a period of several days.</p>

The principal evidence on which she relied for that submission was Patient B’s email to Dr Lawrence dated 11 September 2006, which Ms Lambert submitted was inconsistent with her evidence that Dr Lawrence had by that time acted towards her in the inappropriate manner alleged, and secondly the oral testimony of Susan Sutcliffe and Kay Dowd. Ms Sutcliffe and Ms Dowd were professional colleagues of Dr Lawrence who participated with him in a peer supervision group at his practice at 96 Harley Street. Ms Sutcliffe (and to a very limited extent Ms Dowd) in addition participated with Dr Lawrence in holding group therapy sessions attended among others by Patient B. They both gave evidence for Dr Lawrence at the hearing. Particular reliance was placed by Ms Lambert on Ms Sutcliffe’s evidence that she considered Patient B to be deluded and Ms Dowd’s evidence that Dr Lawrence reported to the supervision group that Patient B was refusing to acknowledge that her feelings towards Dr Lawrence could be emotional transference and that she had begun to say that perhaps Dr Lawrence also had the same feelings towards her.</p>

That is to say that there came a point during the course of her therapy sessions with Dr Lawrence when Patient B developed sexual and erotic feelings towards him which were not based on genuine feelings referable to his actual qualities but instead involved the projection onto him by Patient B of internal feelings reflecting her own inner world and past experience.</p>

No agreed phrase was used at the appeal to describe this latter alleged state of mind. For the sake of convenience I will refer to it as reciprocal erotic transference, while emphasising that that is not a technical or scientific term or one which was used by any of the factual or expert witnesses. The same is true of the expression “erotic transference in the narrow sense”.</p>

As to the second impugned statement Ms Lambert submitted that the FTPP’s conclusion was against the weight of the agreed expert evidence, was unsupported by any expert evidence and was not open to the FTPP to make. Ms Lambert submitted that one or both of these errors on the part of the FTPP was of such fundamental importance that it affected and tainted the FTPP’s factual findings which must for that reason alone be regarded as unsafe and should be overturned.</p>

She was a good witness who gave clear, considered and balanced answers. There was evidence of recent complaint in 2007 from the records of her general practitioner, Dr King-Lewis and those of Dr Speirs, Consultant Psychiatrist. There was subsequent supportive evidence from the notes and oral evidence of Psychotherapist, Suzi Barnett. The Panel noted such differences or variation in Patient B's account as submitted by Mr Booth but found them minor or of little significance when weighing the evidence of Patient B as a whole and in assessing her credibility. The Panel did not consider Patient B to be deluded as to the events in 2006 and 2007. It did not find her to be motivated by anger or a desire for vengeance. The Panel accepts her evidence that she took time to reflect because she did not want to be motivated by such considerations as anger or revenge. This was also demonstrated by the circumstances of her raising the matter generally with the GMC and by her own evidence that she did not want to make a complaint. Patient B wished the GMC to be aware of the events that occurred while she was under your care and indicated her willingness to be a witness, should a further complaint, by another person, be made against you. The Panel heard that the GMC nevertheless decided to pursue the matter.</p>

The Panel in reaching that view has also taken into account the admitted statement of Dr Speirs and the other correspondence relevant in time to the events.

He has had a relationship with somebody else. I was right all along, the intimations were not imaginary. I am going to carry on in this and perhaps there might be some possibility of a real relationship” this would go along with her poor self image”. I interpose to observe that in my view this submission was consistent with Ms Lambert’s first submission that the question of whether a woman with low self esteem would unless encouraged be unlikely to fantasise that she was attractive to another was not a live issue and had not been the subject of expert evidence.</p>

He introduced a series of questions addressed to Dr Kennedy, the GMC’s expert psychotherapist, about the concept of transference by explaining that he was a psychiatrist but not a trained psychotherapist. “I am certainly not analytically trained – so I have a grasp of some of the concepts but probably somewhat tenuous in places.” A measure of his self avowed lack of expertise in the area of erotic transference appears from his second question to Dr Kennedy: “The question then I want to ask you about transference in this case is how does one as a therapist, as a psychiatrist, distinguish between transference that has a sexual content – what has been referred to in this case as erotic transference – and sexual attraction between patient and therapist.”</p>

There was she submitted a live issue in the case as to the extent to which Patient B was suffering from a mental disorder and if so whether it could cause her to fabricate evidence and, she submitted, it was acknowledged that Patient B’s mental disorder included depression and low self esteem. It was therefore appropriate for the FTPP to consider the extent to which if at all Patient B’s mental disorder, including her low self esteem, could cause her to fabricate her evidence or misperceive events. Ms Callaghan submitted that the expert evidence was clear that a mental disorder would not be likely to cause Patient B to fabricate her evidence. Although Dr Kennedy did refer to Patient B’s low self-esteem in one passage of his evidence, he was not, on a proper reading of that passage, expressing any view on whether a patient with low self esteem might experience reciprocal erotic transference in the context of psychotherapy.</p>

Further she submitted that the FTPP was entitled to make the observation in the first impugned statement without relying on any expertise because it is a matter of common human experience.

First she submitted that irrespective of whether the impugned passage represented a consideration of self esteem in conjunction with mental illness generally or with erotic transference the passage demonstrated that the FTPP decided a vital aspect of the case in a manner that was procedurally unfair. Expert advice given to or emanating from within a Panel should be aired openly in the presence of the parties if it is to form the basis of a finding of fact. Without that procedural safeguard the hearing and the resulting decision is unfair, contrary to natural justice and flawed.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Ms Lambert submitted that the obvious and natural reading of the first impugned statement is that a specialist Panel chaired by a psychiatrist applied its expert knowledge to the issue identified in the statement in order to reach a conclusion on an important factual matter. This was in effect taking expert opinion evidence in private as the parties had not been given an opportunity to adduce evidence or make submissions to agree or rebut the position adopted by the FTPP. Ms Lambert did not dispute that the FTPP was entitled to rely on its expertise to raise this point on its own initiative.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Ms Lambert submitted that the need for such openness was particularly pronounced in this case for three reasons. First the finding of fact made by the FTPP was central to its overall finding that Patient B was a credible witness and that her account should be accepted over that of Dr Lawrence. This was the central issue in the case. While it may not be necessary for a Panel to express all elements of its reasoning in public, where the matter at stake is of significant detriment to one of the parties it must do so. </p>

Fantasies by their nature are ways of escaping reality or imagining an alternative existence. There is no self-evident reason why a woman (or man) of low self-esteem would not be capable of constructing a fantasy in which he or she was attractive to another. Indeed a layman might feel that such a person would be more likely to include an element of attractiveness to others in his or her imagined world. In any event where a Panel seeks to make a complex and contentious finding such as this on its own expertise its duty to allow open submissions and (where necessary) evidence applies with still greater force.</p>

The practice that has developed is that where a Panel member is concerned by a matter within his expertise he will raise this in questions to the relevant witnesses, generally after a brief introduction setting out his professional experience on the point in question. The FTPP in the present case had ample opportunity to do this. The fact that it did not was said to compound its error.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">First the FTPP deliberately chose to preface its finding with the word “expertise”. It did so in the context of it being a Panel chaired by a mental health professional making a specific finding on a mental health issue, as part of GMC proceedings against a mental health registrant. Both the context and the obvious reading of the sentence made it overwhelmingly likely that the simple interpretation is the correct one: namely that the FTPP was drawing on its own special knowledge of mental health issues to draw its conclusion. Had it come to its finding in the manner suggested by Ms Callaghan it could have used a plethora of alternative formulations such as: “From its own experience of hearing such cases…”, “From its knowledge of similar cases...”, “From its general experience…”, “Those who have heard cases such as this are entitled to conclude…”.

The reason that the High Court shows particular deference to the findings of specialist panels is not because they are used to hearing cases involving ill-defined issues (for example “sexual matters”) or concerning particular groups (for example “vulnerable women”) but because the Panel has an expert knowledge base that the “lay” judge lacks. Thus in <span style="font-style:italic">McKeown v British Horse Racing Authority</span> [2010] EWHC 508 it was said that I referred to the decision of the specialist panel because they knew about horse-racing while I did not (see for example [193], [194], [206]): it was not because the Panel was used to dealing with jockeys facing serious allegations of dishonesty involving gambling.</p>

The fact that such information is not included on the profiles of the panellists given to the parties whereas their individual professional expertise and experience is set out in some detail was said further to indicate that it is that expertise that makes them a specialist panel. </p>

There would be a real danger in applying imperfectly recollected expert evidence from a previous case to the instant case, or alternatively assuming that all vulnerable women respond in a particular way to certain types of behaviour. Such an approach would not do justice to the range, nuance and sophistication of expert opinion or to the range of particular circumstances in which women may become vulnerable, for example because of domestic abuse or addiction or mental illness.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Even if the FTPP was unambiguously referring to its expertise in hearing cases involving sexual issues and vulnerable women, it was submitted that there was no proper evidential basis for the finding. It was far from self evident or a matter of general experience or common sense. A judge could not take judicial notice of such a matter and a lay tribunal considering the issue in the absence of expert evidence would not be entitled to come to the conclusion at least without giving cogent and full reasons. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">If in the impugned parts of the determination the FTPP was not rejecting agreed expert evidence but purporting to draw upon broader life experience generally then although it is possible that the members had experience of women with low self-esteem it was submitted that it was highly unlikely that they had experience of women with low self esteem who were also experiencing erotic transference and certainly not within a therapeutic context. Given the key significance of the effect of the two elements of low self esteem and erotic transference potentially to distort perception the FTPP should have raised the issue in open session and invited the parties to make submissions and in due course given full reasons for their determination.</p>

At the very least the words are and thus the impugned finding itself is ambiguous. Even if there is a real possibility that the FTPP was in fact referring to their expertise in hearing similar cases that does not remove as  a possible alternative interpretation that for which Dr Lawrence contended, namely that it was drawing on the mental health expertise of its chairman. If the impugned finding is ambiguous it is still open to challenge on the basis of the improper use of private expert opinion / evidence for the reasons given above.</p>

The Court simply cannot know what submissions might have been made, what expert evidence might have been given and what the effect of such evidence and/or submissions might have been on the FTPP.

Given that it was common ground that Patient B had low self esteem and that it was a live issue in the case whether, and if so to what extent, Patient B’s mental state (including depression and, as submitted by Ms Callaghan, low self-esteem) impacted on her perception of events, it had been open to Dr Lawrence to call expert evidence to demonstrate that her low self-esteem could have caused her to misperceive Dr Lawrence’s actions. The fact that he did not do so suggested that there was no real possibility of expert evidence demonstrating that the FTPP was wrong.

Ms Lambert submitted that there was no real difference between the experts concerning the existence of erotic transference affecting Patient B and the clear association between that condition and the misperception of those erotic feelings being reciprocated. The expert evidence she submitted demonstrated that Patient B’s evidence might be unreliable as it resulted not from things actually said or felt by Dr Lawrence but from her misperception of those things resulting from the erotic transference that she was experiencing. That erotic transference was capable on its own of causing Patient B to believe that Dr Lawrence had feelings for her was clear she submitted from the evidence of Dr Kennedy, Dr Denman and Dr Reveley.

The use of the conditional tense “would” showed that the sentence was a rejection of even the possibility of erotic transference having been the sole cause of Patient B’s belief that Dr Lawrence had feelings for her. That was inconsistent with and hence a rejection of the expert evidence of all three experts.

Memory is not a fixed thing.  Remembering something, people often make this mistake, thinking that memory is like a DVD, a memory is a definite fact that is the way it is.  Memory is not like that.  Memory is influenced by emotion.  It is influenced by other people.  It is influenced by the context in which you experience it and so somebody who has an erotic transference can see things differently.  This is illustrated – I read the transcripts of Dr Kennedy, I think I am right, he said that a patient who had an erotic transference towards him saw him as tall and blonde and Nordic.  I have never seen Dr Kennedy but presume he is not so. He is saying that that is an example of how people’s perceptions and memories can be altered”.  In considering the possibilities which she considered in connection with Patient B’s account, Dr Reveley stated at Day 8/59 D “At the end of my report I outlined the three possibilities which I felt were in the running, as it were.  There are possibilities like psychosis or personality disorder, which I felt were not in the running, but the three possibilities I would put in the running are that her allegations were associated with anger and a wish to punish or she may have been mistaken in the context of an erotic transference or her version of the events may be accurate and as she says”.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There was evidence from one of the experts (Dr Reveley) that a possible explanation of Patient B’s allegations is that Dr Lawrence did not behave in the way alleged and that Patient B may have been mistaken in her perception of what he said and did towards her in the context of erotic transference. There was evidence from another expert (Dr Denman) that there is an early recorded case of a patient who experienced erotic transference who believed that her therapist was reciprocating her feelings and actions. And there was evidence from a third (Dr Kennedy) that he had personal experience of a patient who mistakenly attributed to him imaginary negative feelings towards the patient which were not based on reality. Thus all three provided some support for Ms Lambert’s submission that Patient B’s evidence might be unreliable because it resulted not from things actually said or felt by Dr Lawrence but from her misperception of those things resulting from the erotic transference that she was experiencing.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Dr Reveley came closest to expressing the view that erotic transference is capable of leading to reciprocal erotic transference, albeit as a matter of inference rather than in so many words. Her view that people who are experiencing certain emotions in relation to someone can see things differently and in particular that somebody who has an erotic transference can see things differently was in my view expressed in sufficiently open ended terms at least to permit of the possibility of reciprocal erotic transference. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The context in which she expressed that view was in my view one in which she was addressing narrow rather than reciprocal erotic transference. Thus she cited as an example of what she was talking about Dr Kennedy’s example of a patient who had an erotic transference towards him seeing him as tall and blond and Nordic when she inferred he had none of those characteristics. That was in my view an example of narrow rather than reciprocal erotic transference in that it fell short of falsely attributing to the therapist feelings towards the patient which in fact the therapist did not have. By falsely attributing to the therapist physical characteristics which he did not possess the patient demonstrated that she was experiencing narrow erotic transference, the imaginary characteristics of the therapist explaining why she projected onto him the false feelings of attraction which are the characteristic of narrow erotic transference.</p>

In my view Dr Reveley was there expressing the view that one possible explanation for Patient B’s allegations against Dr Lawrence was that they were not based on things actually said or done by Dr Lawrence but rather were the result of “mistakes in the context of an erotic transference”. Whether she intended thereby to express the view that what I have called reciprocal erotic transference is a recognised phenomenon in psychotherapy or merely that one consequence or aspect of narrow erotic transference is that the patient can have a mistaken view of anything including a mistaken belief that the therapist did or said things reflecting attraction to her on his part and that in her view it is possible that this is what occurred in this case she did not make clear. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In the first passage of Dr Kennedy’s evidence relied on by Ms Lambert, set out in paragraph 181 (i) above, it is  in my view likely that, although he described erotic transference in the therapy setting as one when the patient starts attributing to a therapist “feelings” which do not belong to the therapist as such but belong to the patient’s own inner world, he was not thereby intending to refer to what I have as described as reciprocal as distinct form narrow erotic transference. That is for three reasons. First in that passage he was in my view seeking to describe erotic transference in general terms and Ms Lambert’s interpretation would be plainly inapplicable to narrow erotic transference, a phenomenon which she accepted exists. Second the reference to feelings must be seen in the context of the following sentence in which he cited the example of a patient who was convinced that he was tall blonde and Nordic. That was plainly an example of narrow rather than reciprocal transference. Third Dr Kennedy’s explanation of the Nordic example was that the patient “projected” onto him all kinds of things that were not to do with him and were based on the patient’s fantasies of him as distinct from the reality. Again that is in my view plainly a reference to narrow erotic transference and the inference in my view is that in the passage relied on by Ms Lambert Dr Kennedy used the word “attributing” as synonymous to “projecting”. For the same reason I agree with Ms Callaghan’s interpretation of Dr Kennedy’s answer to the chairman in the extract of his evidence cited in her submissions which I have quoted above.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In the second passage relied on by Ms Lambert Dr Kennedy in my view expressed the view that Patient B experienced narrow erotic transference but said nothing as to reciprocal erotic transference. As to the third passage, it is arguably consistent with Dr Kennedy recognising the possibility of reciprocal erotic transference. How might a patient’s narrow erotic transference get out of hand and lead to “this building” i.e. fitness to practise proceedings, unless by means of narrow erotic transference leading to reciprocal erotic transference in the mind of the patient who then makes a false complaint of improper conduct against the therapist based on a misperception of the therapist’s feelings and attitude to the patient? Possible answers might be that things could get out of hand in the sense of prompting an improper response on the part of the therapist as is alleged to have happened in this case or that a patient experiencing narrow erotic transference whose overtures are rebuffed by the therapist might make a false complaint out of spite. If that is what Dr Kennedy had in mind the passage would not be evidence that he was of the view that narrow erotic transference can lead to reciprocal erotic transference. If that is not what he had in mind then the passage might be evidence that he was of that view.</p>

The reference to the possibility that the incident might have caused Patient B to reinterpret what had been going on might suggest that before the Google search she had realised that Dr Lawrence did not reciprocate her feelings of sexual attraction. That would also be consistent with Dr Kennedy saying that it might have caused her to think that “the intimations were not imaginary”, the inference being that before the Google search she had realised that any idea that Dr Lawrence was attracted to her was purely imaginary. On the other hand the suggestion that it might have caused her to think “this might be somebody I could have a relationship with… I was right all along…” suggests that Dr Kennedy considered it possible that prior to the Google search Patient B had indeed believed that Dr Lawrence found her attractive albeit not without doubts on the matter, and that the Google search might have confirmed to her that her previous belief that he found her attractive was correct.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The fifth passage relied on by Dr Kennedy is in my view supportive of Ms Lambert’s submission that Dr Kennedy was of the view that erotic transference can be reciprocal as well as narrow. The patient who, wrongly it is to be inferred, believed that Dr Kennedy was going to hit her would appear to have gone beyond narrow negative transference and entertained a mistaken belief that her therapist had negative feelings towards her. Dr Kennedy cited this as an example of the opinion that negative transference reactions can be somewhat similar to erotic transference reactions. However in so far as the passage supports Ms Lambert’s submission it is indirectly and by inference rather than expressly or directly since it was dealing with negative rather than positive transference.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I accept Ms Callaghan’s submission that Dr Kennedy did not give evidence in terms that the process of erotic transference could by itself cause a patient to believe mistakenly that the therapist is reciprocating her feelings. I also accept that he did not give evidence that Patient B’s erotic transference actually caused her to believe that Dr Lawrence reciprocated her feelings and that he was clear that if Patient B’s version of events was accepted then Dr Lawrence had behaved inappropriately and unprofessionally. I also accept Ms Callaghan’s submission that Dr Kennedy must have considered that, despite suffering erotic transference, Patient B was capable of being believed on the question of whether Dr Lawrence was behaving towards her in a professional and appropriate was. However I do not accept her submission that if he had considered that erotic transference can make a patient misperceive the therapist’s actions towards her he would not have expressed himself in such clear terms. That seems to me to be a non sequitur. The fact that Dr Kennedy, just as Dr Reveley, did not exclude the possibility that Patient B’s evidence may have been correct accurate and uninfluenced by any kind of mistake induced by erotic transference is in my view entirely neutral on the question of whether Dr Kennedy was of the view that it was possible that  by reason of reciprocal transference Patient B’s evidence was in fact incorrect and influenced by mistake induced by erotic transference. As appears from my analysis of the passages of Dr Kennedy’s evidence relied on by Ms Lambert, in my view the effect of his evidence was neither positively to suggest that Patient B may have been experiencing reciprocal transference nor to exclude that as a possible explanation of her evidence. But it did provide  some support for the proposition advanced by Ms Lambert that Patient B’s evidence might be unreliable because it resulted not from things actually said or felt by Dr Lawrence but from her misperception of those things resulting from the erotic transference that she was experiencing.</p>

Her reference to the Briar episode in which a patient became so infatuated with the therapist that she developed a false pregnancy by him is consistent both with Dr Denman citing that as an example of narrow erotic transference and of her citing it as an example of reciprocal transference. As to the former it could be argued to go no further that showing that the extent of the narrow erotic transference was so great and the patient’s false sexual fantasies about the therapist were so great that she falsely imagined herself having sex with him and becoming pregnant thereby. As to the latter it could be interpreted as the patient’s fantasy extending to a false belief that the therapist shared her feelings of attraction to the extent of having had sex with her. Ms Callaghan accepted that it is to be inferred that in the Briar episode the patient <span style="font-weight:bold">did</span> believe that her therapist was reciprocating her erotic feelings and actions. She thus in effect accepted that the example cited by Dr Denman was a case of reciprocal erotic transference, although she emphasised that that was just one case.</p>

In my view Dr Denman’s evidence did not support either submission. By citing the Briar episode she did however  in my view provide some support for the proposition that it is possible that a patient experiencing erotic transference can mistakenly believe that the therapist reciprocates his/her feelings of sexual attraction.</p>

He was not analytically trained and said that his grasp of some of the concepts was tenuous in places. Even if he had expertise in the field of psychiatry as to whether a woman with low self-esteem unless encouraged would be unlikely to fantasise that she was attractive to another, he plainly did not have expertise on the question whether that unlikelihood was or might be affected by the phenomenon of erotic transference. Nor, on Ms Callaghan’s interpretation of “from its own expertise”, would the fact, if it were the case, that the members of the FTPP had experience in hearing cases involving vulnerable women constitute an expertise on which they would be entitled to rely in considering whether, whatever may be the likelihood or unlikelihood in other contexts, there was such an unlikelihood in the context of the erotic transference which it was agreed between the parties and by all three experts existed in this case at least in the narrow sense. Further I do not accept Ms Callaghan’s submission that the FTPP’s conclusion was one which, in the absence of evidence on the point, any lay tribunal was entitled to reach as a reasonable conclusion on likely human behaviour.</p>

Ms Johnson relied on Dr Speirs’ impression that Patient B normally had a robust personality and was a stable person. She contrasted that evidence with Ms Sutcliffe’s evidence that Patient B was deluded which in turn she contrasted with Dr Reveley’s evidence that there was no evidence of Patient B suffering from a delusional disorder. Finally she said that there was clear evidence from Dr Reveley that there was nothing about Patient B’s psychiatric being or in relation to her mental state that made her predisposed to making a complaint. As can be seen Ms Johnson made no reference to any of the medical or expert witnesses having identified low self esteem as constituting part of Patient B’s mental illness. Nor did she identify as one of the explanations for why Patient B should be regarded as an unreliable witness which she anticipated would be advanced on behalf of Dr Lawrence either the fact that she was woman with low self esteem or an argument that such low self esteem formed part of her mental illness or that such low self esteem might have caused her to fabricate her evidence. Nor did Ms Johnson advance a positive case, in response to any suggestion that Patient B’s evidence was the result of delusion associated with erotic transference, that such an explanation was unlikely to be correct because Patient B was a woman with low self  esteem and a woman with low self esteem unless encouraged would be unlikely to fantasise that she was attractive to another.

That reason was identified by Mr Booth as Patient B’s purported perception at the time, “both in the context of her depression and a recognised erotic transference.” The only evidence cited by Mr Booth in support of that sixth reason was Dr Reveley’s evidence which I have quoted that people who are emotionally emphasising or experiencing certain emotions in relation to someone can see things differently and her reference to Dr Kennedy’s evidence about the patient who thought that he was blond, tall and Nordic. Those were both references to erotic transference rather than depression and neither suggested that low self esteem can cause someone to fabricate evidence. There is nothing in that passage of Mr Booth’s submissions which referred to Patient B’s low self esteem or submitted that it was part of her mental illness or suggested that it might have caused Patient B to fabricate her evidence. </p>

The failure of the FTPP to afford Dr Lawrence that opportunity and its inclusion of that finding in its Determination was in my view a material procedural irregularity. It was unfair to Dr Lawrence and contrary to a fundamental principle of natural justice that a court or tribunal will only make findings of fact in respect of matters on which the parties have been afforded a fair opportunity to make submissions and/or to seek to adduce evidence as appropriate.</p>

The FTPP’s finding would in my view have been equally unfair whether made by a court or a tribunal comprised exclusively of lay members or one which did not purport to base its finding on any expertise of its own or by a tribunal comprised of experts who were entitled to base their findings on their expertise. The unfairness consists in the fact of making a finding of fact on a matter which had not been canvassed by the parties in argument or by the witnesses in evidence and thus which Dr Lawrence and his legal team  could not reasonably have anticipated might form a material part of the FTPP’s findings of fact or the process of reasoning by which it decided whether the allegations against Dr Lawrence were proved or not.</p>

By doing so the FTPP in my judgement raised a wholly new reason, not advanced by the GMC, why any suggestion that Patient B’s evidence reflected not the reality of Dr Lawrence’s words and conduct but rather a fantasy on her part was unlikely to be correct. </p>

At the conclusion of the hearing and after closing submissions, the FTPP retired to deliberate taking with them the medical assessors appointed in the case. When they returned the medical assessors summarised the advice that they had given to the FTPP in private: both assessors referred to the appellant being “vulnerable to relapse”. The FTPP refused an application to recuse themselves and gave a determination in which they concluded that the appellant’s fitness to practise continued to be seriously impaired and imposed stringent conditions on her registration. The appellant appealed under section 40 of the 1983 Act on the ground, among others, that “contrary to natural justice and article 6 of the Convention she was deprived of a fair hearing in that the Panel relied upon the (inadmissible) opinion of experts whom she could not cross examine and whose opinions were given in private; in so doing the Panel rejected the opinions of those specifically nominated by the health committee to opine upon the issue of fitness to practise”.</p>

The assessors are not parties to the case before the Panel. Nor are they members of the Panel. Where their advice may be adverse to the practitioner's case, it is particularly important that it is given in the presence of the parties, before the Panel deliberates on its determination, and in circumstances in which the parties have an opportunity to address that advice. Otherwise, the suspicion may be created that the advice given in private was not precisely the same, or was not given in the same manner, as that announced in public, or that the assessors have exercised influence on the decision of the tribunal.

The Court of Appeal heard three appeals against decisions of the High Court on appeal from the Special Educational Needs Tribunal. In one of the cases, the local authority proposed that twin boys with learning difficulties should attend School A, whereas the parents contended that they were under a duty to place them at School B. A tribunal that included two members with particular experience of special educational needs and special schools held that neither School A nor School B was appropriate, but also found that there was <span style="font-style:italic">“provision suitable for [their] needs in England”</span> and that such a school represented the preferable solution in the case. The determination that there was an appropriate (and unnamed) school other than Schools A and B was made outwith the evidence presented by the parties and the parties were offered no opportunity to comment on the factual basis underlying it. The parents appealed on the ground (among others) that this determination was procedurally unfair. In the High Court Dyson J held that the specialist tribunal were not bound to act only on the evidence that was placed before them and hence the tribunal was entitled to reach this determination. That decision was in turn challenged in the Court of Appeal. </p>

As explained below that error was in my view compounded in this case by the fact that although the FTPP considered that it had the relevant expertise upon which it was entitled to rely in finding that a woman with low self esteem would be unlikely unless encouraged to fantasise that she was attractive to others it did not in my view in fact have such expertise. </p>

In my judgment Ms Lambert’s suggested interpretation is more likely to be correct than Ms Callaghan’s for the reasons she gave which I have set out and with which I agree. It is however impossible to be sure because the FTPP in its Determination failed to explain what it meant by its expertise or to give any particulars from which it would be possible to assess whether its expertise qualified it to make the finding in the first impugned statement.</p>

Either way the effect of the impugned first statement was that even if in other circumstances erotic transference in the narrow sense might be capable of causing someone to entertain a fantasy that their therapist found them attractive and reciprocated their sexual feelings, that would be unlikely to occur in the case of a female patient with low self esteem.</p>

I agree with Ms Lambert that the proposition is neither self-proving nor obvious and did not reflect an observation concerning likely human behaviour according with experience and common sense. As Ms Lambert submitted, fantasies by their nature are ways of escaping reality or imagining an alternative existence and there is in my judgment no self-evident reason why a woman with low self esteem would not be capable of constructing or likely to construct a fantasy in which she was attractive to another. In any event the problem would remain that the FTPP was in my view bound to give Dr Lawrence the opportunity of seeking to adduce evidence and/or make submissions to persuade the FTPP that its conclusion was wrong. </p>

It was thus a finding on the nature and scope of the phenomenon of erotic transference in general terms. It follows that it was not a factual finding as to what actually occurred in this case based on the FTPP’s evaluation of the conflicting factual evidence. What then was the finding based on?

In principle that would leave it open to the FTPP to conclude that, while the effect of the expert evidence was that it was possible that erotic transference could on its own have caused Patient B to perceive that Dr Lawrence had feelings for her, it was not satisfied that the factual evidence proved that that is what is likely to have actually happened. However as I have said in my view the wording of the second impugned statement makes it clear that it was not based on the FTPP’s assessment of the factual evidence in the case. The FTPP could in theory have rejected the expert evidence as I have interpreted it and concluded that it did not even support the proposition that  it is <span style="font-weight:bold">possible</span> that narrow erotic transference on its own may have caused Patient B to believe that Dr Lawrence had erotic or sexual feelings for her, in which case a fortiori there would have been no support in the expert evidence for the proposition that it was likely to have done so.

As appears from my analysis above the expert evidence was not straightforward on the crucial question of whether and if so to what extent narrow erotic transference is capable of causing a patient to entertain false beliefs and perceptions that the therapist has reciprocal erotic or sexual feelings towards the patient.   In my view on this issue the evidence of Dr Reveley goes further in favour of Dr Lawrence than that of Dr Kennedy and Dr Denman albeit it derives some support from both of them. It may be that the FTPP rejected the evidence of Dr Reveley and/or Dr Denman and/or Dr Kennedy on this point and/or interpreted it differently to me and/or accepted or preferred the evidence of Dr Kennedy as interpreted in the way contended for by Ms Callaghan. If so there is no clue in the Determination, which is entirely silent both as to the reasons why the FTPP made the second impugned statement and as to which parts if any of the expert evidence  relevant to this issue it accepted, which parts if any it rejected and in either case why.</p>

It may or may not in that context have concluded that the evidence of Dr Kennedy and/or Dr Denman supported and/or was to similar effect as that of Dr Reveley in terms of a possibility.</p>

On that footing its finding would have been legitimate. However the language of the second impugned statement does not support that interpretation of what it meant. The conclusion is expressed in terms which suggest that it was an opinion of the members of the FTPP rather than an opinion of the experts with which the FTPP agreed or from which the FTPP drew an inference.

That, as I have indicated, would be an impermissible approach. Regrettably the absence of reasons or explanations as to how it reached its second impugned conclusion makes its impossible in my view to rule out the possibility that that is what happened. Although my conclusion that the second impugned statement is flawed does not depend on it, my view is that this is the most likely explanation of the thinking that lay behind the second impugned statement. It would explain why the second impugned statement is not said by the FTPP to derive from its interpretation of and/or findings as to the expert evidence on erotic transference and also explain why the FTPP did not feel the need to go into the expert evidence on this point in the Determination even though as I have found that evidence supported the proposition that erotic transference is capable of causing  patients in psychotherapy to believe that the therapist has feelings towards them. </p>

My reading of the expert evidence is that it gave support to the proposition that erotic transference is capable by itself of causing a patient to believe that the therapist has erotic or sexual feelings towards the patient. In my judgment the FTPP was under a duty to assess the expert evidence and consider whether it supported Dr Lawrence’s case in that regard. If, having assessed it, the FTPP interpreted the expert evidence in the same way as I have done, it was in my judgment then under a duty to take into account, when assessing the factual evidence, the fact that erotic transference is capable of causing a patient to have such false beliefs. Having concluded, on the hypothesis that the second impugned statement was based on the first, that whatever may be the possibilities in the case of other patients, erotic transference is unlikely to cause a female patient with low self esteem to believe that her therapist has feelings towards her, there is an obvious risk that the FTPP either considered it unnecessary to reach findings as to whether the expert evidence supported the proposition which I have found it does, or that it did interpret the expert evidence in the same way that I have but nonetheless concluded that it was irrelevant in this case because Patient B was a woman with low self-esteem.

However the complete absence of any explanation as to how or why the FTPP reached the finding it did in the second impugned criticism makes it impossible for Dr Lawrence to know whether it failed to take into account important relevant evidence on which his case relied. If anything the inference to be drawn from the absence of any further reference in the Determination to the expert evidence on erotic transference as a factor relevant to resolving the dispute between Patient B and Dr Lawrence would point towards the inference that the FTPP did not take that evidence into account in weighing the disputed factual evidence. </p>

Thus, although it is said that this case is no more than a simple issue of fact (namely, did Dr Southall use the words set out in the charge?), the true picture is far more complex. First, underlying the case for Dr Southall was the acceptance that Mrs M might perfectly justifiably have perceived herself as accused of murder with the result that the analysis of contemporaneous material some eight years later is of real importance: that the evidence which touched upon this conversation took over five days is testament to that complexity. Furthermore it cannot be said that the contemporaneous material was all one way: Dr Corfield's note (and, indeed, her evidence) supported the case that it was (or at least could have been) Mrs M's perception alone. Ms Salem's note (accepted by Mrs M as 100% accurate so far as it went) did not support the accusation and her evidence was that if those words had been said, she would have recorded them. I am not suggesting that a lengthy judgment was required but, in the circumstances of this case, a few sentences dealing with the salient issues was essential: this was an exceptional case and, I have no doubt, perceived to be so by the GMC, Dr Southall and the panel. </p>

Perhaps because of the nature of the case, the panel did, of course, provide a few sentences of reasons but, in my judgment, they were simply inadequate and did not start to do justice to the case. On the specific findings of fact, although entitled to conclude that Mrs M was a clear, honest and credible witness, they do not specifically deal with the suggestion that she perceived herself to have been accused and so represented herself as having been accused which, when upset (as she described) would be entirely understandable and could itself explain why (if it be the case) that she so reported the interview over the days that followed. Let me make it clear that I am not making such a finding but merely concluding that Dr Southall was entitled to know why that possibility was discounted. </p>

In relation to Dr Corfield, said to support Mrs M because of the comment "they didn't do toxicology quite possibly you drugged him first", the panel totally ignored the thrust of her evidence, recounted above, which was entirely supportive of the perception theory and did not deal with how that evidence impacted on the words she wrote or, in relation to her and Mrs Parry (whose evidence also included at least one conditional phrase), how Mrs M's perception might have been reflected in what she said in the days that followed. As for Dr Southall's report, the categorical denial would be no less categorical if Mrs M perceived herself as being accused as if she was accused. </p>

Further, once providing some reasons, in my judgment, the panel did have to say something about Dr Southall who gave evidence on this topic for some days. If (as must have been the case) they disbelieved him, in the context of this case and his defence, he was entitled to know why even if only by reference to his demeanour, his attitude or his approach to specific questions. In relation to Ms Salem, the position was worse: to say that the panel "did not find her evidence to be wholly convincing" is not good enough. If she did not make a note of the specific challenge of murder (which she said she would have done), it must have been the panel's view that she decided, at the time of the interview, that she would not do so and so have entered into an implicit agreement with Dr Southall to cover up an overly oppressive interview. That is nothing to do with not being wholly convincing: it is about honesty and integrity and if the panel were impugning her in these regards, it should have said so. </p>

Finally, I express concern about the way in which the panel approached their task by reference in the sanction remarks to their extreme concern that Dr Southall formed the belief that the circumstances of M1's death needed to be investigated by him. It is entirely legitimate to conclude that the panel there demonstrated that the approach to the interview had concerned them and it is not fanciful to suggest that it may have informed their approach to the factual dispute. If that is correct, their approach was not one based on evidence: it had not been the subject of expert evidence or specific charge and, in my judgment, was not one upon which they were entitled to form a view. I do not criticise the panel for that: it is how the matter was put in cross examination and doubtless in the submissions; it is certainly reflected in the submissions to Blake J, in his judgment and in the GMC's skeleton argument for this court. </p>

In that regard, when Blake J said that the panel were entitled to have regard to the extent to which Ms Salem could be said to be independent of Dr Southall, he also fell into error. First, there was simply no evidence to justify the conclusion that it was inappropriate for the social worker in the case to be present when Dr Southall interviewed Ms M: that itself required expert evidence of appropriate practice. Secondly, it is unclear how it is said that this was a "matter to which the panel could have had regard"; if it be to suggest that it permitted the panel to reject her evidence as untruthful, again in the absence of evidence condemning the practice, I respectfully disagree. To that extent, also, this determination is open to criticism. </p>

It is unnecessary for the purposes of this judgment to decide how far such an exercise can go although, without the panel identifying which arguments in a complex case it accepted, however briefly that exercise is undertaken, it does not appear to me that an assumption can be made that all the submissions advanced by one side found favour with the panel simply because it concluded in favour of that party. The difference between this case and that of a criminal trial is that the judge's summing up is an impartial analysis of fact and argument for both sides; submissions by the parties are not. </p>

This does not mean that the judgment should contain a passage which suggests that the Judge has applied the same, or even a superior degree of expertise to that displayed by the witness. He should simply provide an explanation as to why he has accepted the evidence of one expert and rejected that of another. It may be that the evidence one or the other accorded more satisfactorily with facts found by the judge. It may be that the explanation of one was more inherently questionable than that of the other.

Although in <span style="font-style:italic">English v Emery Reinbold </span> Lord Phillips cited with approval Bingham LJ’s requirement that a coherent reasoned opinion expressed by a suitably qualified expert should be the subject of a coherent reasoned rebuttal, in my view it is implicit that a similar approach is necessary if, in order to enable the parties and the Appellate Court to understand the reasoning and basis on which the court or tribunal has reached its decision it is necessary to know which part or parts of certain expert evidence were accepted and/or rejected.</p>

In reaching that conclusion I have, of course, taken into account the FTPP’s review of the factual evidence, its clear indication that it preferred the evidence of Patient B to that of Dr Lawrence and the factors it identified in the Determination on the facts. However, for the reasons I have given, it is clear in my view that the FTPP’s conclusion in the second impugned statement was not based or dependent on its review of and views as to the factual evidence. At its lowest it is in my view certainly not clear that it did so. Nor, as appears from my analysis above, can the basis on which it reached its conclusion in the second impugned statement be readily inferred from other parts of its determination. The question of what, if any, effect erotic transference may have had on Patient B and in particular on her evidence as to Dr Lawrence’s words and conduct towards her was one of central importance in the case. That is reflected in the extensive references to erotic transference in the evidence of the three expert witnesses. It was also recognised in my view by the FTPP, as is implicit in the fact that it felt it necessary to pose and answer the question whether erotic transference would be likely, on its own, to cause Patient B to believe that Dr Lawrence had feelings for her.</p>

The fact that he did not do so she submitted suggests that there is no real possibility of expert evidence demonstrating that the FTPP was wrong in its first impugned statement. As I have indicated the premise on which that submission was based, namely that the question whether Patient B’s low self esteem impacted on her perception of events was a live issue in the case, is in my view a false premise. </p>

He was satisfied that it was clear that the panel would have come to the same decision both on impairment of fitness to practise and sanction if it had adjusted its statements of its reasons to refer specifically to the expert’s evidence and to explain why it did not accept it. (Para 40). In reaching that conclusion Sales J considered that the FTPP was well entitled to draw upon its own experience and judgment in forming this view whether the practitioner presented a present risk to his patients. The experts’ expression of opinion as to the risk posed by the practitioner carried in his view little weight attributable to any special expertise on his part. The question on the possibility of a recurrence of misconduct by the practitioner was a matter of the ordinary assessment of the likelihood of human behaviour in relation to which a psychiatrist’s expertise conferred no special privileged insight. The assessment of risk of any particular form of future behaviour is the sort of task that courts and tribunals regularly perform without needing to refer to expert psychiatric evidence.

In fact I would put it higher. In my view it is likely that that is what occurred.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The starting point of course is that put in broad terms the FTPP preferred the evidence of Patient B to that of Dr Lawrence and found her a more impressive witness than it found him. That is a matter to which great weight must be attached. It is not, however, in my view determinative of the question to be answered. In particular it cannot be ignored that in weighing up the strengths and weaknesses of respectively Patient B and her credibility and reliability on the one hand and the evidence and factors relied on by Dr Lawrence as undermining her credibility and reliability on the other, the FTPP must be assumed to have started from the assumptions, based on its findings in the two impugned statements, that, (a) for reasons unconnected with Patient B herself, it was inherently unlikely that a woman in her position with low self esteem would fantasise without encouragement that she was attractive to Dr Lawrence and that (b) it was not likely that narrow erotic transference on its own would be likely to cause her to believe that he had feelings for her. If, as I have found, it was not entitled to make the first assumption and, as I have found may have been the case, it was not entitled to make the second assumption, it follows that its assessment of the factual evidence including the reliability of Patient B and the other factual witnesses including Dr Lawrence was and/or may have been tainted. Chief among them of course was Patient B and the reliability or unreliability of her testimony. But it was not confined to her.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Thus for example Ms Sutcliffe gave evidence that her observations of Patient B over a period of time led her to believe that she was deluded. The FTPP rejected that evidence. Dr Lawrence denied that he acted and spoke in the way alleged and the FTPP rejected that evidence. Ms Dowd, who the FTPP found a more reliable witness of events within her knowledge than Ms Sutcliffe, gave evidence that Dr Lawrence reported to the supervision group that Patient B “was refusing to really acknowledge that this could be transference and really being fairly resistant and blocking to that idea, and had begun to really say that perhaps Dr Lawrence also had the same feelings towards her, at which point we felt that it would be in his best interests to cease working with the  client.” . On its face Ms Dowd’s evidence supported the possibility that Patient B was indeed fantasising that Dr Lawrence reciprocated her erotic feelings towards him.</p>

She further accepted that the burden of persuading this court on a Section 40 appeal to overturn findings of fact which were based to such a large extent on assessment of credibility is heavy and hard to discharge. However she submitted that the FTPP was not entitled wholly to disregard key evidence which might run counter to the conclusions which it drew from its assessment of the demeanour of the witnesses or to dismiss that evidence without a reasoned foundation, particularly since it knew that Dr Lawrence had previously been sanctioned for having inappropriate sexual relations with a patient. His entitlement to know the reasons why the FTPP found the allegations against him proved was particularly important given the risk that the FTPP might think that there is no smoke without fire. </p>

The central part of the appeal was thus a hybrid. The FTPP was not entitled to make the findings it did. No reasonable panel could have reached the conclusions which it did and it was therefore plainly wrong. Alternatively the FTPP failed to discharge the duty to give sufficient reasons for its findings to enable Dr Lawrence to understand why it had reached them. That duty was greater than in the normal run of GMC disciplinary hearings because this was a case involving peculiar complexity and a number of difficult aspects including the subtleties of erotic transference, the important differences of nuance as between the evidence of Patient B and Dr Lawrence and the apparent rejection by the FTPP of expert evidence on psychotherapy.</p>

During that period Patient B had 37 one hour long sessions with Ms Barnett, who said that one of the main components of the therapeutic discussion was Patient B’s relationship with Dr Lawrence. The relationship had thus been “workshopped” as Ms Lambert put it over a long time. Moreover a significant number of those sessions included the questionable use of hypnosis. The inference was thus that Patient B’s complaint might reflect her perception, rather than the reality, of what had been said by Dr Lawrence to her, particularly as she had suffered from erotic transference. Patient B’s evidence might therefore have been influenced by her therapist and the process of therapy might have altered Patient B’s perception of what Dr Lawrence had actually said. </p>

Second Ms Lambert relied on the treatment of the evidence of Ms Dowd and Ms Sutcliffe in the determination.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In response Ms Callaghan submitted that on its face the email dated 11 September 2006 was open to two interpretations. One interpretation was entirely consistent with Patient B’s account of the chronology of the relationship. It was not possible to reach a concluded determination as to its meaning just by reading it. It was not clearly inconsistent with Patient B’s evidence in her earlier oral testimony and her explanation of its contents in her oral testimony when recalled on 13 September 2010 was plausible. In his closing submissions Mr Booth had made detailed submissions on the alleged inconsistency between the email and Patient B’s attempt to explain it when recalled on the one hand and her earlier testimony that the relationship had gone beyond mere flirtation to the point where Dr Lawrence had made explicit inappropriate comments to her on the other. Ms Callaghan submitted that it is thus obvious that the FTPP rejected Mr Booth’s submissions on the email and accepted Patient B’ account of it. It is to be inferred that the FTPP considered that the email did not undermine Patient B’s testimony or her credibility and that was a conclusion which it was entitled to reach. Although it did not expressly refer to the email in its Determination, there was no basis for the suggestion that it failed to take it into account when assessing credibility or reaching findings of fact. It clearly had the email in mind and did not consider it inconsistent with Patient B’s account.</p>

In the words of Leveson LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Southall v GMC</span> [2010] EWCA Civ 407 at [47], “It is very well established that findings of primary fact particularly if founded upon an assessment of the credibility of witnesses are virtually unassailable.” Reliance was also placed on the remarks of Lord Rodger in <span style="font-style:italic">Gupta v GMC</span> [2002] 1 WLR 1691 which were cited with approval in <span style="font-style:italic">Southall</span> at [47], to which I shall refer below.</p>

It preferred the evidence of Patient B over that of Dr Lawrence, finding her a “good witness” whose evidence was “clear, considered and balanced”, and “generally consistent.” By contrast it found Dr Lawrence’s evidence generally unreliable. It concluded that at times he gave “implausible and unconvincing” explanations for his conduct, and found that the way in which he gave his answers on some important issues was “unsatisfactory, giving the appearance of [his] being evasive and not providing a true explanation of the reasons for [his] conduct”. It observed a difference between the way he gave his denials of some of the allegations and that in which he gave alternative explanations for words which he agreed he had actually said. It also found that his body language when giving evidence at times indicated considerable unease.</p>

The FTPP had the benefit of hearing live evidence form both of them over the course of a number of days and had an excellent opportunity to assess their respective characters, demeanour, credibility and reliability. It also heard extensive submission from the parties as to the credibility and reliability of the two main witnesses and received careful legal advice from the Legal Assessor as to how to approach credibility.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The FTPP concluded that it preferred the evidence of Patient B to that of Dr Lawrence on the key issue and that she was a generally impressive witness whereas he was not. It provided detailed reasons for reaching that conclusion. It carefully considered the factors that might undermine her credibility and reliability. For example it noted differences or variations in Patient B’s account but considered them minor or of little significance when weighing the evidence of Patient B as a whole and in assessing her credibility. It did not find her to be motivated by anger or revenge. It found no evidence of mental disorder which would cause her to fabricate her evidence. It carefully considered what impact erotic transference might have had on her perception of events. There was thus no possible basis for the Court to interfere with the FTPP’s conclusions on credibility, particularly given that the Court did not have the benefit of seeing the witnesses give evidence.</p>

It was only necessary for the FTPP in this case to resolve those factual issues which were relevant to the heads of charge. It was not necessary for it expressly to address the email dated 11 September 2006 because it was not directly relevant to any of the factual allegations in the heads of charge. Thus the FTPP only needed to address it in its reasons if it considered it inconsistent with Patient B’s testimony. The FTPP’s function was to decide if each charge against Dr Lawrence was proved (see Rule 17) and thus it only needed to resolve issues relevant to the heads of charge. Dr Lawrence was entitled to know why he lost the case. He could be in no doubt about that. The FTPP found him an incredible witness and Patient B a credible witness. It is obvious that the FTPP both considered the email and accepted Patient B’s account of it and rejected Mr Booth’s submissions on it. It was thus not important because the FTPP, it is to be inferred, did not find it inconsistent with Patient B’s testimony. Dr Lawrence in those circumstances was not entitled to know why the FTPP found the email to be unimportant. </p>

He had not gone in to any discussion about <span style="font-weight:bold">how</span> he viewed they would see each other at the end of the therapy. At the session they had gone beyond Dr Lawrence saying that he wanted to see her and he was now starting to move forward and looking at how they could do that. He was asking what she envisaged as to the future of the relationship which she could not answer because she did not know the motive behind his question. She did not know if he was asking whether she wanted to leave her husband or wanted just to have an affair with him. She could not answer that at that stage.

That was not what she had meant by the word “rebuffed”. She felt that he had been rebuffing her in a different sense, namely that the issues raised about her previous relationships might have made him question whether a relationship would make him happy in that somehow she was not capable of being in a relationship. She was very confused as to what he wanted from her. At times it seemed he wanted something more than what they had discussed and she did not want that and had never said that she did.

As she had already testified she was able to recall the approximate date of that discussion because she had sent him a text message on 16 September 2006, her son’s birthday, saying “Did you mean what you said about your SF? If so I think it could work.” She also stated that at a session on 29 September 2006 she told Dr Lawrence that she did not know what he wanted from her and that she would like it if they had a sexual relationship at the end of her treatment. She directly asked him if that was what he wanted. He said that he held her gaze, blushed and smiled and nodded “yes”. He then said “I am quite shy you know.” From her perspective that exchange clearly indicated that he wanted to continue to treat her and also wished to see her for a sexual relationship after her treatment had finished. In answer to questions from the chairman, Patient B said that she no longer had the text message because she did not keep text messages and no longer had that phone. She was able to pinpoint her memory of sending the text to the exact date of 16 September 2006 because it was her son’s birthday. She also confirmed her recollection of Dr Lawrence saying he wanted a sexual relationship and holding her gaze blushing smiling and nodding “yes”.</p>

The reference to vibes having not just been in one direction is capable of giving some support to Patient B’s evidence that he had behaved in a flirtatious way which reciprocated her sexual overtures to him. The statement that Dr Lawrence had never said anything about his views “on this issue” is not in my view necessarily inconsistent with him having spoken to Patient B of his growing feelings of attractions towards her. Nor is it inconsistent with him having told her in July 2006 that he would like to visit her at the end of her therapy, that this could not be about her yearning anymore and that he was now part of it. The reference followed a statement in the email that Patient B felt quite angry that Dr Lawrence expected her to be able to say “where/how she saw things going”. It does not seem to me necessarily to follow that that was a reference to whether she saw Dr Lawrence visiting her at the end of her therapy. It is in my view consistent with a number of possible explanations such as that in fact given by Patient B in her 12 September 2010 email and her oral testimony, namely that it was about how they would develop a relationship rather than whether they would do so. It was also capable of referring to whether she contemplated an affair or something more long lasting.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I also note the inconsistency between the reference in the email to Patient B having left their session feeling “pretty upset and angry” and the references in Dr Lawrence’s notes of the session: “good. V good… optimism back plus looking forward to things.” One possible explanation for that inconsistency could be that Dr Lawrence’s notes were not only inaccurate but deliberately so for the purpose of creating a false paper trail. Although, if that were the case, that would not of itself provide an interpretation of the 11 September 2006 email other than that contended of by Mr Booth and Ms Lambert, it does however underline the fact that the existence of documentary evidence supporting one side’s case or undermining that of the other is not necessarily always dispositive of the veracity or reliability of the relevant witnesses without the benefit of testing explanations given by the author as to what was intended by particular expressions or statements.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I accept that the 11 September 2006 email was a piece of evidence capable of providing powerful support to Dr Lawrence’s case and undermining the reliability of Patient B’s testimony. It does not however in my judgment, at any rate on its own, constitute such powerful evidence that the FTPP was obliged for that reason alone to find the allegations against Dr Lawrence not proved. It was not of such a character in my view that it was incapable of being reconciled with the testimony which Patient B had given up to that point nor were the inconsistencies relied on by Mr Booth and Ms Lambert so compelling that the passages said to be inconsistent with it were incapable of alternative explanation.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It follows therefore that in my view the FTPP was entitled and indeed bound to continue with the case and in particular to allow Patient B to be recalled to give her explanations of the email. Indeed it is not without significance that it was Mr Booth who, rather than submitting that in the light of the email there was no case to answer, applied for Patient B to be recalled so that she could be cross-examined about it.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Of course that is not the end of the matter because it is not possible to decide on Dr Lawrence’s challenge to the FTPP’s findings of fact without reference to the question of the demeanour of Patient B and indeed Dr Lawrence when giving their oral testimony in front of the FTPP. An appeal to the High Court against the decision of the FTPP under section 40 is by way of re-hearing. (see Practice Direction 52, paragraph 22.3 (2).) However it differs from the hearing in front of the FTPP in that, as regards oral testimony, the Court is limited to a  review of the transcripts (unless unusually there has been an order for oral evidence), whereas the FTPP has had the advantage of seeing the witnesses give live evidence (in this case partly by video link). The conclusions reached by the FTPP as to the reliability and veracity of witnesses is thus informed not only by the content of the testimony but also by the manner in which it is delivered. In that critical regard the court is in a different position to that of the FTPP.</p>

There may be circumstances in which for example critical evidence has been ignored or is of such a character that logic or common sense or both demonstrate(s) that the view reached by the FTPP must be wrong. The court will always be astute to assess whether that has in fact occurred in any particular case if invited to do so.</p>

This reluctance to interfere is not due to any lack of jurisdiction to do so.

The Court of Appeal in that case dismissed an appeal from the decision of Blake J dismissing an appeal brought by Dr Southall against a decision of the FTPP which found him guilty of serious professional misconduct. The central allegation was that at an interview on 27 April 1998 Dr Southall accused Mrs M of drugging and murdering her ten year old son who had died by hanging nearly two years earlier. Dr Southall admitted that he had probed the circumstances of Mrs M’s son’s death and accepted that she might have perceived that he was accusing her of murder but maintained that he did not in fact do so. </span>

The panel heard Mrs M (albeit over a television link) and were in a position to assess her evidence; they similarly heard all the other witnesses. Although I do not for one moment minimise the difficulty in seeking to assess what happened at an interview some 8 years prior to the hearing where the issue between the parties is so narrowly defined (namely the difference between making of an accusation of murder and asking questions which could create the perception of being accused of murder), provided that it can be shown that the issue has been addressed correctly, I would not be prepared to interfere with the findings of the panel.

She said that she had known him since 1996 and socialised with him as one does with colleagues. Ms Johnson put it to Ms Sutcliffe that she was quite close to Dr Lawrence given all their years of working together which Ms Sutcliffe confirmed. She was shown an email from her to Dr Lawrence which she signed: “do take care. Sue [x]”. Ms Johnson said that she was not suggesting anything inappropriate but asked if this was indicative of a close personal working relationship. Ms Sutcliffe confirmed that it was. She said that they work in a very supportive field and it is not unusual. She also said that she would often say the same thing in emails to other practitioners or indeed to her friends. She said that after Patient B’s letter to Dr Lawrence in September 2008 indicating that she contemplated making a formal complaint, she discussed Patient B with Dr Lawrence in supervision four or five times at least. She could not remember discussing it with Dr Lawrence outside the environment of the supervision but she would probably have spoken of it in passing shortly before the hearing.</p>

However she emphasised that the knowledge you have of someone working in a group is very revealing because it is not only their relationship with you as the therapist but it is the relationship with other group members which can sometimes give a bigger picture. Patient B’s one to one treatment with Dr Lawrence was never discussed in the group therapy. </p>

She thought that she genuinely misinterpreted the circumstance around her. She said that that was an impression that she certainly experienced in the group and was reinforced by her response to her termination which Ms Sutcliffe felt did not bear any real relevance to what was going on at the time.

He asked if Ms Sutcliffe was suggesting from her own observation of Patient B that she had false beliefs that could not be confirmed or whether she was suggesting that she was simply in denial about certain matters. Ms Sutcliffe responded: “I think both”. Asked what the false beliefs were she said that the relationship with Dr Lawrence was one of them but that did not happen in the group sessions. Sticking to her own observation Ms Sutcliffe said that in the group she felt that the relationships Patient B talked about with her husband did not really relate to the reality of the circumstances that she was reporting. With regard to her termination she certainly felt that Patient B was really seriously deluded in the sense of the impact that it would have on her. She felt it was stronger than denial. She thought she was actually deluded that she would be able to survive that.</p>

That was that Patient B was refusing really to acknowledge that this could be transference and really being fairly resistant and blocking to that idea and had begun to really say that perhaps Dr Lawrence also had the same feelings towards her.  At that point Ms Dowd said that they felt that it would be in his best interests to cease working with the client and they expressed that to Dr Lawrence quite clearly.  She said that the supervision group did not feel that the client was at any risk. Ideally it would be best for any client to stay with the practitioner to work through it because the therapist is the best person to do that with because it is not a reciprocal relationship.  </p>

She said that there were two attempted referrals of Patient B. The first was to Ms Sutcliffe which was discussed in group supervision which she believed he did and Patient B refused.  The second time at the end of the therapy was to a woman called Maggie Chapman.  From May to July 2006 Ms Dowd said that Dr Lawrence brought Patient B’s case to supervision every time they met.  Ms Dowd said that she learnt from Dr Lawrence in supervision and from Ms Sutcliffe from the group sessions that Patient B had become pregnant and was considering a termination.  She said that she was very shocked against the backdrop of a woman who had failed IVF, had had a miscarriage under terrible circumstances, was now pregnant and wanted to abort.  Ms Dowd said that the feelings that Dr Lawrence presented to supervision about Patient B’s wishes was one of exasperation.  It was at this time that his dislike of Patient B started through what she described as his counter transference.  He said that this seemed to be a client whom you could not penetrate, into whose life you could not speak sense.  </p>

Patient B said she did not think she was going to pursue it but asked about the course and anything else that was available.

Ms Dowd’s impression was that Dr Lawrence’s therapy did not seem to have any positive effect.

Ms Dowd said that Dr Lawrence reported to the supervision group that Patient B had Googled him and found information about his previous findings at the GMC of which she was already aware.  She was able to place that as the last Friday before Christmas 2006 because she recalled it was the same day that she lost her debit card and tried to admit a patient who had a bipolar manic episode.

Moreover if Dr Lawrence had in fact said and done the things alleged by Patient B he was taking a big risk by telling the supervision group that Patient B was saying that he reciprocated her feelings. If the supervision group had insisted on Patient B being referred to Ms Sutcliffe or another therapist Patient B might have revealed the truth, (as, on that hypothesis, in fact happened in July 2007 when Patient B was referred to Dr Speirs and Ms Barnett when the therapeutic relationship with Dr Lawrence came to an end).  </p>

Dr Reveley expressed the opinion that Patient B had no Delusional Disorder.  She confirmed that she used Delusional Disorder with a capital D and a capital D.  She said that that is a form of psychosis in which the individual develops erotomania, a delusional fixation of an erotic or romantic nature on somebody.  Ms Lambert submitted that the FTPP fell into error by treating Ms Sutcliffe’s evidence as though it were a formal diagnosis of Delusional Disorder.  Dr Reveley was a consultant psychiatrist qualified to make a formal diagnosis of a psychosis.  Ms Sutcliffe was not.  She made it plain in answer to the Chairman’s question that she felt both that Patient B had false beliefs that could not be confirmed and that she was in denial about certain matters.  Because of this mistake Ms Lambert submitted that the FTPP wrongly failed to give Ms Sutcliffe’s evidence proper weight in deciding whether it was likely that Patient B’s evidence of improper conduct on the part of Dr Lawrence was a misinterpretation on her part of what was really going on.</p>

Not only did this support the conclusion that Patient B was experiencing erotic transference in the narrow sense but, just as with Ms Dowd’s evidence of his reporting of Patient B showing signs of reciprocal transference, it was a high risk thing for Dr Lawrence to do if he was abusing his professional position by exploiting Patient B’s erotic transference for his own gratification.</p>

The fact that Dr Lawrence recommended Patient B to speak to Ms Dowd with a view to going on a course to gain further insight into erotic transference (a fact corroborated by Patient B’s subsequent call to Ms Dowd) is again conduct which would be a very high risk on the part of Dr Lawrence if in fact he had expressed feelings of growing attraction towards Patient B and said that he wanted to visit her after the therapy.  Equally the fact that Patient B did ring Ms Dowd to enquire into courses on gaining insight into erotic transference is on its face curious behaviour on the part of a patient who has been the object of inappropriate sexual remarks by her therapist.</p>

First the evidence was so strongly undermining of Patient B’s credibility and supportive of Dr Lawrence’s case that it was plainly wrong to prefer her testimony to his and, having regard also to the 11 September 2006 email, plainly wrong to find the allegations against Dr Lawrence proved.  Second it wrongly discounted their testimony failed to give it proper weight and/or ignored it.  Third they failed to refer to key parts of it and/or to explain whether they accepted or rejected critical parts of it and if the former how they reconciled the accepted testimony to their findings and if the latter what their reasons were for rejecting it.

As to Ms Dowd’s evidence that Dr Lawrence reported to the supervision group that Patient B had begun to say that perhaps he had the same feelings towards her as she had to him, it is to be inferred that either the FTPP did not place weight on that testimony because it was not corroborated by Dr Lawrence (who might have been expected to mention it if it happened) or by Ms Sutcliffe or that it accepted Ms Dowd’s evidence and concluded that it meant that Dr Lawrence in making that report had been covering his tracks.

As to the question of Patient B’s alleged delusion, it was common ground that Patient B did not suffer from a Delusional Disorder. Dr Reveley said so in terms. There was no reference to clinical delusion in the witness statement of Dr Speirs and it was not suggested by Dr Kennedy or Dr Denman. Dr Speirs had been a Consultant Psychiatrist for about twenty three years. Patient B was referred to her by her GP, Dr King-Lewis, in a letter dated 2 July 2007 and she saw her the next day. She said that she was suffering from a clinical depressive illness of moderate severity, but made no reference to any Delusional Disorder. </p>

She did not feel either from the history or from Patient B’s current state that she had at any time been psychotic. There was no evidence that she had a personality disorder. She came across as of sound judgment and was very consistent in her account and therefore she had no reason to doubt her. She appeared to be a straight forward patient who was clinically depressed and extremely vulnerable. Dr Speirs’ witness statement was read to the FTPP as agreed evidence. Ms Johnson had urged the FTPP in closing submissions to treat Ms Sutcliffe’s evidence with a degree of caution, partly because of her qualifications, partly because she had only attended sixteen group sessions over an eighteen month period, and partly because there was a risk that she might have conflated information gleaned from group therapy sessions with information gleaned from Dr Lawrence in the supervision. There was clear evidence from Dr Reveley that there was nothing about Patient B’s psychiatric being or in relation to her mental state that made her predisposed to making a complaint. </p>

Nowhere in his testimony did he say that he had reported to the supervision group that Patient B claimed he had feelings towards her. Nor was it in his contemporaneous notes.

I also remind myself that the advantage enjoyed by the FTPP which this Court does not have, in that, having heard and seen the witnesses give their evidence, the FTPP is in a better position to judge their credibility and reliability, is very significant in a case where the witnesses’ credibility and reliability are in issue. Where the FTPP has observed the witnesses and weighed their evidence its decisions on matters of fact are more likely to be correct than any decision of this Court which cannot deploy those factors when assessing the position (per Lord Rodger in <span style="font-style:italic">Gupta</span>). This is plainly a case in which the credibility and reliability of the witnesses was not only in issue but lay at the heart of the case.

While I see the force of that submission it is again unfortunate that the FTPP did not spell out what inferences if any it drew from the fact, which it chose to highlight, that Ms Sutcliffe and Ms Dowd had a close working relationship with Dr Lawrence through working at 96 Harley Street and as part of a peer supervision group. </p>

Did it for one or either of those reasons discount the testimony of Ms Dowd and Ms Sutcliffe and find it to be for that reason unreliable? The reference to Ms Dowd being more reliable than Ms Sutcliffe might point against such an interpretation but it is not in my judgment conclusive, particularly since the following sentence in the Determination, emphasising the limited opportunity for Ms Sutcliffe and Ms Dowd to form first hand impressions of Patient B and their dependence on what  Dr Lawrence told them of what happened in the one to one sessions, was clearly intended to be a reason for attaching only limited weight to their testimony. </p>

Again we do not know. Either way it is impossible to know what role, if any, Ms Dowd’s evidence on Dr Lawrence’s report to the supervision group played in the FTPP’s thinking, its assessment of the evidence of Patient B and Dr Lawrence and its findings of fact. It is impossible to know whether it considered the evidence irrelevant or relevant. If the latter it is impossible to know whether it accepted or rejected it and if it accepted it how it reconciled such a finding to its finding as to the reliability of Patient B and the unreliability of Dr Lawrence and its ultimate findings that the allegations against Dr Lawrence were proved. In particular it is not possible to know whether it concluded that Dr Lawrence had been trying to cover his tracks by laying a false trail. If it rejected the evidence it is impossible to know whether it was because the FTPP considered Ms Dowd to be mistaken or whether it considered her evidence unreliable as having been influenced by a direct or indirect, conscious or subconscious attempt to assist Dr Lawrence because of their close working relationship.</p>

It would also have enabled Ms Johnson to put to him squarely, if so advised and instructed, that if he did say it, he was covering his tracks.

In that context I note that although Ms Sutcliffe said that Dr Lawrence told the supervision group that he felt that Patient B was “fantasising about the relationship” and that he was exploring the level of the erotic transference that he felt was taking place with Patient B and that the supervision group suggested that that was possibly something that would make him vulnerable, she did not say that Dr Lawrence reported that Patient B was beginning to say that Dr Lawrence had the same feelings towards her. On the other hand it is perhaps intrinsically less likely that Ms Dowd would mistakenly mention a potentially crucial comment made by Dr Lawrence if he did not make it than that Ms Sutcliffe forgot it or that it did not occur to her to mention it in answer to particular questions during her testimony.</p>

As already mentioned, Patient B did explicitly accuse Dr Lawrence of being a clever and manipulative man whose written records including his email messages and his notes of her therapy sessions, which made no reference to their email exchange, were worded very carefully so as to ensure that he protected himself and could not be held to account if his records were ever examined. Some support for that contention was capable of being derived from the discrepancy between the positive impression of Patient B’s mood contained in Dr Lawrence’s note of the 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2006 session and the reference to her being very angry and upset in her email of that date.

It is not logically inconsistent with Dr Lawrence having said to Patient B in May July and September 2006 the things which Patient B asserted that he did and which Dr Lawrence asserted that he did not.

Although, as a I have said, Dr Lawrence was entitled to know whether the FTPP did find that allegation true, in the present context of Ms Lambert’s primary submission that the evidence was so strong that the FTPP findings on fact were plainly wrong, in my judgment Ms Dowd’s evidence, even taken together with the other points relied on by Ms Lambert, do not demonstrate that.

It would not necessarily follow from the fact that Patient B was deluded in her interpretation of past relationships or the impact of events on herself that her account of how Dr Lawrence behaved was incorrect.  Indeed that would seem to follow from the fact that, while it was common ground among the experts that Patient B was experiencing narrow erotic transference and to that extent was deluded about her own feelings of attraction towards Dr Lawrence, they did not in my judgement say that it was for that reason likely that she was also experiencing reciprocal erotic transference, i.e. that even though she was deluded about her own feelings towards Dr Lawrence it was not for that reason likely that she was also deluded about his feelings towards her.</p>

On the other hand there was in my view at least some overlap between Ms Sutcliffe’s description of Patient B’s apparent delusion and the definition of Delusional Disorder given by Dr Reveley. See for example her confirmation that she meant deluded in both senses raised by the chairman of the FTPP, that is to say that she felt both that Patient B had false beliefs that could not be confirmed and that she was in denial about certain matters.  </p>

However, although she held a certificate, a diploma and two degrees (in what subjects was not clear), unlike Dr Speirs she was not a psychiatrist. There was no suggestion that she was formally qualified to make a clinical diagnosis of Delusional Disorder. If the only issue for the FTPP to decide in order to reach a conclusion whether Ms Sutcliffe’s evidence was correct was whether Patient B was suffering from a Delusional Disorder the FTPP in my judgement would plainly have been entitled to prefer the evidence of Dr Speirs to that of Ms Sutcliffe.</p>

First, it found Ms Sutcliffe a less reliable witness of events within her knowledge than Ms Dowd.  Second, it chose to draw attention to the fact that apart from the group sessions and what they might have inferred through them, Ms Sutcliffe and Ms Dowd only had Dr Lawrence’s reporting of the issues and outcomes of the one-to-one sessions.  Third, the FTPP chose to draw attention to the close working relationship between Ms Sutcliffe and Ms Dowd on the one hand and Dr Lawrence on the other.  Can it safely be ruled out that the FTPP’s apparent rejection of Ms Sutcliffe’s evidence as to Patient B’s delusion was influenced by one or more of these factors and if not is the rejection tainted by one or more of them?</p>

There were, according to Ms Johnson, no fewer than 16 such sessions spread over a period of 18 months.  That is to be contrasted with the single consultation on 3 July 2007 which formed the basis of Dr Speirs’ formal diagnosis.  Of course the FTPP were entitled to take into account the fact that neither Ms Dowd nor Ms Sutcliffe could give direct evidence as to what took place in the one-to-one sessions.  It does not follow, however, that they, and in particular Ms Sutcliffe, were not in a good position to form a view as to Patient B’s state of mind from their own direct observations of her. </p>

The FTPP was of course entitled to form its own view as to the reliability of Ms Sutcliffe’s evidence and to find her to be a less reliable witness of events within her knowledge than Ms Dowd.  However, if in its view the testimony of both Ms Dowd and Ms Sutcliffe was affected by a desire to assist Dr Lawrence, in my judgment it was incumbent on the FTPP to spell that out.  </p>

By emphasising the obvious fact that Ms Sutcliffe, like Ms Dowd, had no direct knowledge of what took place between Patient B and Dr Lawrence in the one to one sessions, it appears to have overlooked or given insufficient weight to the fact that Ms Sutcliffe was in a position in the course of sixteen group therapy sessions over an eighteen month period to observe Patient B very closely and to form a clear impression of her state of mind. In apparently concluding, as it was entitled to in my view, that the opinion of Dr Speirs that Patient B was not suffering from a Delusional Disorder was likely to be correct, the FTPP appears to have assumed that, because Ms Sutcliffe was not qualified to make a formal diagnosis, her evidence as to Patient B being deluded was for that reason likely to be wrong. In so doing it appears to have or at any rate may have, failed to consider whether, by reason of her observation of Patient B in the group sessions, Ms Sutcliffe’s evidence that Patient B gave the impression of being deluded in the respects described by her might be reliable. Moreover even if the FTPP considered that the close working relationship might have subconsciously caused Ms Sutcliffe or Ms Dowd to seek to assist Dr Lawrence, apart from the fact that if that was its view it should have said so in clear terms, Ms Sutcliffe’s evidence as to her impression that Patient B was deluded was cast in such clear and firm terms that it is counter intuitive to suggest that such a positive impression may have been reached through unconscious bias. In theory it could of course have been the result of deliberate bias, but in my view that would not have been a conclusion open to the FTPP to draw in the absence of the allegation having been squarely put to Ms Sutcliffe and explicitly recorded in the Determination. The same applies in relation to Ms Dowd. </p>

Further as already mentioned, even if it was correct, it was in my view an important but not in itself a decisive piece of evidence in favour of Dr Lawrence and against the reliability of Patient B. </p>

I have in mind in particular the evidence of Ms Dowd that she saw Patient B gazing at Dr Lawrence as though in a trance, the fact that Dr Lawrence so regularly reported on Patient B’s erotic transference to the supervision group, a high-risk strategy if he was guilty of the misconduct alleged, and the fact that neither Ms Sutcliffe nor Ms Dowd felt that Patient B was at any risk from Dr Lawrence despite the erotic transference.  It was rather the other way round. Of less significance, but of some weight given the FTPP’s reference to the more reliable recollection of Patient B, was Ms Dowd’s evidence that Patient B’s Google search took place before Christmas 2006.</p>

That is to say that the expert evidence provided some support for the proposition that the narrow erotic transference which it was agreed Patient B experienced was capable of having caused her to form the mistaken belief that Dr Lawrence reciprocated her erotic feelings. </p>

It merely caused her to doubt if she was special to Dr Lawrence and to wonder if he treated all his patients like that. That is to say none of the three scenarios postulated by Dr Kennedy. Ms Callaghan in my view was right to submit that the FTPP was entitled to accept Patient B’s evidence, Dr Kennedy’s scenarios not having been put to her. The premise of her evidence was that what happened to her was real. However, in order to assess whether Dr Lawrence can satisfy the stringent test laid down in the authorities, it is necessary to consider the factors on the other side of the scales.</p>

I have quoted the references in the Determination to the FTPP’s reaction to Dr Lawrence’s testimony. This included very unfavourable views based on his demeanour while giving evidence, particularly while giving answers on some important issues. I see force in the criticism of the finding that Patient B’s account of her relationship with Dr Lawrence and his response to her, the personal circumstances which encompassed her depression, loneliness, the fact that she had recently lost a baby and had no close family or friends in London in whom she could confide, was more credible than his version of events, insofar as there was no real dispute between Dr Lawrence and Patient B about the personal circumstances which encompassed her depression, loneliness, the fact that she had recently lost a baby and had no close family or friends in London in whom she could confide.  However, that criticism cannot in my view fairly be levelled against the finding that Patient B’s account of her relationship with Dr Lawrence and his response to her was more credible than his version of events.

It is abundantly clear that it reached a negative view of Dr Lawrence as a witness and a positive view of Patient B.  To the extent that the FTPP’s positive view as to Patient B’s credibility rested in part on its conclusion that her evidence was generally consistent it is arguable that this court is not materially disadvantaged in assessing whether that was a conclusion which it was entitled to reach. However the same cannot be said of the conclusions it reached on her credibility to the extent that they were based on the impression made on the members of the FTPP by the manner in which she gave her oral testimony.</p>

Leaving aside the impact which the evidence relied on by Dr Lawrence on the other side of the scales should have had on the FTPP’s assessment of Patients B’s credibility as a witness, it seems to me that it cannot be ruled out that an FTPP following the correct approach on the two matters identified might have reached the same views on Patient B’s credibility as are recorded in the Determination on the facts. The question is whether the cumulative weight of the evidence relied on by Dr Lawrence tips the scales so decisively as to compel the conclusion that it would have been bound to reach different views on her credibility and reliability and that the findings actually made by this FTPP were plainly wrong.</p>

In my view that considerably overstates the position. As to the first point Ms Barnett made it clear that the typed notes were taken from the original manuscript notes and where original words were recorded in the manuscript notes they were put in italics in the typed notes.  Although the accuracy of her typed notes could not be checked against the destroyed original notes it was not suggested to her in cross examination that she had destroyed them for some sinister reason. Although not all the statements attributed to Patient B were in italics and thus it is to be inferred were not her actual words that would not have been a reason for placing little or any reliance upon them had they appeared in the original manuscript notes and had those notes been adduced in evidence and relied on by Ms Barnett in her testimony.</p>

Thus she said that Patient B told her that Dr Lawrence told her that his sexual fantasy about her was that he would visit her once the therapy was over and that he would do so in different parts of the world wherever she was – she travelled a lot with her husband – and that they would have sex together and it would be with the knowledge and approval of her husband. </p>

The same is true of Ms Barnett’s testimony that Patient B’s words to her were that all she wanted to do was put on lacy underwear for Dr Lawrence. Ms Barnett said that she remembered this very clearly. It was not in her notes because she does not write down everything a patient says if it is not of interest to her. The fact that Patient B said lacy underwear would not be of therapeutic interest to Ms Barnett. But she remembered that Patient B said it very clearly because it was “a very strong visual”. </p>

Ms Barnett said that she only used hypnosis when dealing therapeutically with Patient B’s chronic underlying depression and that she never used it when discussing Dr Lawrence. There were two separate aspects to the sessions, one helping Patient B to deal with her upset at the way her relationship with Dr Lawrence had developed. The second was therapy for her depression.</p>

In explaining that shift in evidence in her evidence Ms Barnett said that she would move in and out of hypnosis in the course of her sessions making the total time under hypnosis hard to calculate. Ms Lambert submitted that this showed that the use of hypnosis was so interwoven into the fabric of her sessions that it would be extraordinary if the compartmentalisation of issues claimed by Ms Barnett had been maintained. It was inevitable that hypnosis might have been used in the context of her discussions about Dr Lawrence and thus affected the reliability of what Patient B told Ms Barnett had happened between her and Dr Lawrence. In the absence of the original notes it was impossible to know what was or was not said under hypnosis. </p>

However if the FTPP considered that hypnosis did not take place when Dr Lawrence was being discussed, it should have said so given the reliance on Ms Barnett’s evidence as evidence both of consistency and truth and given the shadow cast over that evidence by the absence of the original notes and the use of hypnosis. Ms Lambert submitted that there should have been a reasoned analysis by the FTPP as to why it considered her evidence to be reliable. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">That of course is a reasons challenge rather than a “plainly wrong finding” challenge. In my judgment it has no merit. It is in my view clear from the FTPP’s reference to legitimate criticisms of Ms Barnett’s destruction of her original notes and her therapeutic methodology that it took those matters into account but did not consider that they rendered Ms Barnett’s evidence unreliable. It is to be inferred that that is because it accepted her evidence as to compartmentalisation and also that her destruction of the notes was innocent and that her typed notes reflected the account in them of what Patient B said to her. In addition the FTPP made it expressly clear that one reason why it found her to be a reliable witness on the key issues was that it overlapped with the other evidence of recent complaint. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Ms Barnett said that generally the hypnosis would probably last no more than 10-15 minutes in any one hour session and that “it weaves in and out and is not necessarily a lump of time”. Dr Kennedy was asked if he had experience of a therapist using hypnosis that weaves in and out during a session. He said that he did not and that it was not recognised psychodynamic psychotherapy or behavioural cognitive therapy that he knew of. However, it is in my view clear that the FTPP accepted that Ms Barnett did not use hypnosis when discussing Dr Lawrence and in my view it was entitled to reach that conclusion. The same point is in my view an answer to Ms Lambert’s reliance on Dr Kennedy’s expressed concern at the possibility of a patient becoming hypersuggestible in a hypnotised state. Moreover Mr Booth accepted that he had not suggested to Ms Barnett in cross-examination that she might have suggested any facts to Patient B. Nor did he suggest to either Patient B or to Ms Barnett that hypnosis had generated facts from her subconscious mind. </p>

In fact Ms Barnett said that she used hypnosis not hypnotherapy which she said is a different thing for which one can be trained in 5 days and which is dangerous. She had spent a year doing a post graduate diploma in applied hypnosis with a first from UCL. Moreover she did not use deep trance hypnosis. Ms Barnett was also very clear that although, as her notes showed, Patient B accepted her offer of hypnosis to address an incident from her childhood in order to help her understand why it was that she felt reluctant to proceed with making a complaint to the GMC, however she denied having suggested through hypnosis to Patient B that she should make a complaint. Indeed if anything she encouraged her not to rush into making a complaint until she had dealt with her feelings of anger and upset. </p>

In any event Ms Barnett said that she did not start hypnosis until about her fifth session with Patient B so that it could not have affected what she was recorded as having said to Ms Barnett at the first session in July 2007, which is in itself strong evidence of recent complaint. </p>

There were a number of clear factual disputes between Dr Lawrence and Patient B.  The FTPP had to resolve those factual disputes.  There were a number of possible explanations for the different accounts given by Dr Lawrence and Patient B.  A mistaken belief on the part of Patient B as to what Dr Lawrence said and did induced by erotic transference was one.  It was not however the only one.  The fact that shortly after the end of the therapeutic relationship Patient B gave accounts consistent with that which she later gave in the witness box was strong evidence that the account she gave at the hearing was not the product of subsequent fabrication or faulty recollection.  It was one of the matters the FTPP were entitled to weigh in the balance when assessing the credibility and reliability of Patient B and indirectly of Dr Lawrence.  The possibility of her account being the product of reciprocal erotic transference was another.  It is in that context that I see the force of Ms Lambert’s point, albeit in my view it was overstated.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In similar vein Ms Lambert submitted that because of the clear association between erotic transference and possible misperception the fact that Patient apparently gave balanced responses to questions, as found by the FTPP which said that she gave generally consistent clear considered and balanced answers, was not a matter on which it should not have placed any, or any significant weight.  I do not accept that submission.  The effect of the expert evidence was not, as I have found, that narrow erotic transference is likely in itself to lead to reciprocal erotic transference.  If Ms Lambert’s submission were right, the mere fact that Patient B experienced narrow erotic transference would lead automatically to the conclusion that it was likely that she was experiencing reciprocal erotic transference so that no matter what Patient B said in the witness box would have to be rejected by the FTPP as the product of reciprocal erotic transference.  There is no support for such a conclusion in the evidence in my view.  One of the questions the FTPP had in my view to ask itself was whether Patient B had or had not been experiencing reciprocal erotic transference at the time of her sessions with Dr Lawrence.  I do not accept the proposition that in assessing that question the FTPP were not entitled to place weight on their finding that in the witness box she gave generally consistent clear considered and balanced answers. At its highest Ms Lambert’s point was no more than one among many factors which the FTPP would have been entitled to take into account when weighing up the reliability of Patient B’s testimony. Certainly they were entitled to attach significant weight to that finding in considering whether there might be any other explanations as to why her account of events might have been wrong, whether because of faulty recollection or any aspects of her mental state, including narrow erotic transference, of which there was much evidence both expert and factual.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">A further submission Ms Lambert made flowing from Patient B’s 37 sessions with Ms Barnett was that there was a risk that the process of what Ms Lambert described as “work shopping” the events which occurred between Patient B and Dr Lawrence may have had an unconscious impact on Patient B and altered her recollection and/or perception of those events.  While there may have been such a risk that was a matter for the FTPP to take into account in assessing her oral testimony.  In doing so it would have been entitled to conclude that the risk had not materialised given the consistency between the account given by Patient B in her testimony and Patient B’s account to Dr Speirs, Dr King-Lewis and Ms Barnett in July 2007 immediately after the end of the therapeutic relationship with Dr Lawrence, as recorded in their several notes, but before any workshopping could have occurred.</p>

In his closing submissions it was the second point relied on by Mr Booth in support of his submission that Patient B’s evidence was unreliable.

Neither finding makes it clear whether it was intended to encompass the FTPP’s views on the email and/or Patient B’s explanations of its contents.

He did not suggest that a lengthy judgment was required but in the circumstances of the case a few sentences dealing with the salient issues was essential because that was an exceptional case. Even though it was said that the case was no more than a simple issue of fact, namely whether Dr Southall did or did not use the words set out in the charge, the Court of Appeal held that the true picture was far more complex and the analysis of contemporaneous material some years later was of real importance. </p>

In relation to the social worker who supported Dr Southall’s testimony the Court of Appeal held that it was not good enough for the panel to say that “it did not find her evidence to be wholly convincing”. If the panel were impugning the social worker’s honesty and integrity by agreeing with Dr Southall to cover up an overly oppressive interview it should have said so.

In this case the email dated 11 September 2006 formed a central plank in Mr Booth’s challenge to the reliability and credibility of Patient B. On its face it contained passages apparently inconsistent with Patient B’s account of events. If Mr Booth’s submissions as to what inferences could be drawn from it were correct, it went a long way to undermining Patient B’s credibility and reliability and supporting that of Dr Lawrence. In those circumstances it is in my view no answer to the criticism that the FTPP made no reference to the email, any findings it made as to what Patient B meant by it, whether it accepted Mr Booth’s submissions on it or Patient B’s explanations of it, and if the former how it reconciled such findings with its findings on Patient B’s credibility and reliability, to say that the interpretation of the email was not one of the facts alleged against Dr Lawrence in the charges and therefore not an issue which the FTPP was required either to decide or if decided to give reasons for its decision.</p>

It the FTPP accepted Patient B’s explanations when recalled it may well be that it was entitled to take the view that the email did not undermine Patient B’s credibility or reliability. By contrast if it reached no conclusion on what Patient B meant by the email and wholly disregarded its contents when assessing the respective reliability and credibility of Patient B and Dr Lawrence, Dr Lawrence would have an arguable complaint that the FTPP failed to give proper consideration to an important bit of evidence in the case. As it is, neither Dr Lawrence nor I would add the Court knows which if either of the above explanations of how the FTPP approached the matter is correct.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Ms Sutcliffe and Ms Dowd were important witnesses whose evidence supported Dr Lawrence’s case in material respects.  The solitary paragraph in which the FTPP deals with their testimony leaves me unclear as to how the FTPP treated some of that evidence and/or what findings of fact it made and/or why it made them.  Most important in my judgment was Ms Dowd’s testimony that Dr Lawrence reported in September 2006 to the supervision group that Patient B had begun to say that perhaps Dr Lawrence also had the same feelings towards her.  If Dr Lawrence did say that to the supervision group it was as I have said evidence that he was reporting at the very time when he was alleged to have made inappropriate comments to Patient B that Patient B was showing signs of reciprocal emotional transference. The two obvious explanations would be either that it was a devious attempt by Dr Lawrence to create a false trail or record to cover his tracks or that it followed that his testimony at the hearing reflected what he felt and said at the time.</p>

It is impossible for Dr Lawrence to know and I do not know whether the FTPP accepted Ms Dowd’s evidence that Dr Lawrence did make this report to the supervision group.  If it did not accept it is impossible for him to know why it did not accept her evidence, on this incident which had not been challenged by the GMC.  If it did accept her evidence Dr Lawrence does not know whether the FTPP took it into account in assessing respectively his and Patient B’s reliability.  If it did not take it into account he does not know why it did not consider it relevant. If it did take it into account he does not know how or why it concluded that it did not undermine Patient B’s credibility and provide material support for his account. In particular Dr Lawrence does not know if the FTPP found that it was reconcilable with Patient B’s version of events and thus her reliability because he had been deliberately laying a false trail to cover his tracks. If Ms Dowd’s evidence is correct and he did make the report that would appear to be the most obvious explanation which is reconcilable with Patient B’s account of events. That would be a very serious finding of deceit and manipulation against Dr Lawrence and in my judgment he is entitled to know whether such a finding or conclusion was reached by the FTPP and underlay its assessment of the credibility of him and Patient B and its ultimate findings of fact. </p>

Was it intended to suggest that their evidence was in some way impaired by a direct or conscious desire to assist Dr Lawrence? If so Dr Lawrence in my judgment is entitled to know that, not only because their evidence was of importance to his case but because no such suggestion was put to them in cross-examination for them to deal with and it was arguably not a finding which the FTPP was entitled to make.  If that was what the FTPP meant, what impact did that adverse view have on the FTPP’s view of the reliability of Ms Dowd and Ms Sutcliffe and on its assessment of their evidence and which parts of their evidence if any did it either reject or attach little weight to for that reason? </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It may of course be that the FTPP intended by the reference to the close working relationship to make the opposite point, namely that they were thereby well placed to have a good insight into Dr Lawrence. If that is what they meant Dr Lawrence in my view is entitled to know why nonetheless they rejected important parts of their evidence, if they did reject it, such as Ms Sutcliffe’s evidence as to delusion, Ms Dowd’s evidence as to the report to the supervision group that Patient B was saying that she felt that Dr Lawrence felt that same way towards her, the evidence of both of them that Dr Lawrence regularly reported on Patient B’s erotic transference, their impression that he was irritated with Patient B and Ms Dowd’s testimony that the supervision group had no cause for concern that Dr Lawrence would behave inappropriately with Patient B. In addition her specific recollection that Dr Lawrence reported Patient B’s Google discovery before Christmas 2006 supported Dr Lawrence’s recollection rather than that of Patient B. That is relevant in the context of the FTPP’s contrast between the extrinsic support for the reliability of Patient B’s recollection  with the lack of such support for Dr Lawrence’s recollection.</p>

However that does not alter the fact that once one appreciates the complexity and subtlety of the main issues in controversy and the most important pieces of evidence in the case and their relevance to and bearing on the two disputed versions of events, in my judgment it is apparent that in the respects which I have identified there was insufficient reference to those issues and no or inadequate explanation of whether and how they were resolved by the FTPP and/or no or inadequate reasons as to why it resolved them in the way it did. There is no doubt that in order to resolve the central dispute between Patient B and Dr Lawrence the FTPP had to form an impression of their respective reliability and credibility. However just as in <span style="font-style:italic">Southall</span> so in this case in my view the fact that the central issue is capable of being simply stated does not mean that its resolution did not necessarily depend or should not necessarily have depended on a series of conclusions and/or findings of fact on sub-issues.

As it is in my view the matters to which I have referred to in this section of my judgment and in the sections of the judgment dealing with the 11 September 2006 email and the evidence of Ms Dowd and Ms Sutcliffe support the conclusion which I have reached that the FTPP’s Determination on the facts is flawed not just because of the errors it made in respect of the two impugned statements but also because of its lack of adequate reasons for its findings (if any) it made in relation to the email and the most important parts of Ms Dowd’s and Ms Sutcliffe’s evidence.

It was submitted that it seemed to follow that Dr Lawrence would have had to intend to so encourage Patient B, that there is a wafer thin difference between the two allegations in 2(b)(v) and 2(b)(vi) and that the FTPP erred by going on to find that he exploited Patient B’s attraction to him for his own gratification when this was never a matter alleged against Dr Lawrence.</p>

The allegation in paragraph 2(b)(v) was an allegation that Dr Lawrence by his words and conduct attempted to persuade Patient B to enter into an emotional relationship with him. That was rejected by the FTPP. It does not in my view follow from that rejection that Dr Lawrence could not have encouraged Patient B to believe that he wanted to pursue an emotional relationship with her even though he did not in fact want or intend to do so. In reaching its conclusion that he did the FTPP relied on its findings that he did so by amongst other things telling Patient B that she was attractive, behaving towards her in a flirtatious manner, telling her that when this was all over he would like to meet her and by divulging his fantasy that he would visit her anywhere in the world and have sex with her. The FTPP found that his pattern of encouragement led Patient B to believe that he wanted to pursue an emotional relationship with her. I see no logical inconsistency between a finding that Dr Lawrence did not actually intend to pursue an emotional relationship with Patient B and a finding that he encouraged her to believe that that is what he wanted. Nor do I consider that if the FTPP had been entitled to make the detailed findings of fact to which I have just referred it would not have been entitled to draw the inference therefrom that in doing so Dr Lawrence encouraged Patient B to believe in the possibility of having such a  relationship. </p>

As a result the Determination of fact is in my judgment unsafe as regards the FTPP’s findings that those allegations of misconduct which were not admitted were proved. Accordingly those findings should be quashed. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The question arises as to what consequential orders I should make. I have not concluded that the weight of the evidence relied on by Dr Lawrence was so strong that the FTPP’s findings that the disputed allegations of misconduct against him were proved were plainly wrong. In those circumstances the obvious order to make would be to quash the findings that the disputed allegations of misconduct against Dr Lawrence were proved and direct the Registrar to remit the case to a freshly constituted FTPP, as happened in <span style="font-style:italic">Southall</span>. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I am of course conscious that a second hearing would be likely to involve both Dr Lawrence and the GMC in the expenditure of considerable further time and costs. It would also no doubt be a source of strain both for Patient B and for Dr Lawrence. That notwithstanding my strong provisional view is that there should be a second hearing. The same public interest that led the GMC to bring the first proceedings would in principle point to the desirability of a second hearing so that a definitive ruling can be made as to the disputed allegations against Dr Lawrence. I am mindful that the effect of quashing the FTPP’s Determination on the disputed facts for the reasons I have given does not constitute a finding that the disputed allegations are incorrect. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I do not of course know what Patient B’s attitude to a second hearing may be. It may be that the GMC would wish for time to consult Patient B and to consider its position. Or it may be that it would wish to argue that it would be preferable for me to remit the case to the Registrar on terms that would leave it to the GMC to determine whether it is appropriate to pursue Patient B’s complaint to a fresh FTPP. It may also be that Dr Lawrence may wish to persuade me that I should not remit the case to the registrar at all. The question also arises as to the status and effect of those findings of fact made by the FTPP which were admitted by Dr Lawrence. For those reasons and because the hearings before me to date have been confined to the challenge to the FTPP’s Determination on the facts it seems to me right to give the parties an opportunity to make submissions as to the appropriate consequential orders.</p>

Those submissions were the product of diligent and painstaking mastery of the detail of a very complicated case and also very persuasive. The former made my task much easier than it otherwise would have been. The latter made it more difficult.</p>
