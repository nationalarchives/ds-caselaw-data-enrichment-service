	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">By this claim for judicial review the Claimant challenges the decision to admit him to Broadmoor, a high security hospital pursuant to a transfer from Stockton Hall, a medium security hospital, in which he was detained pursuant to a hospital order made by Chichester Crown Court under section 37 of the Mental Health Act 1983 (“the 1983 Act”) following convictions in June 2008 for offences including kidnapping and dangerous driving. The decision is challenged as being unlawful because it was taken following a procedure which failed to comply with common law standards of procedural fairness and/or article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The claim raises important issues as to whether decisions to transfer detained patients from medium security to high security psychiatric hospitals are subject to common law duties of fairness and if so the extent of such duties and/or whether the current arrangements for the taking of such decisions violate Article 6 in that they constitute final determinations of the patient’s civil rights and, taken as a whole, do not provide for access to adjudication by an independent decision taker.</p>

On leaving he threatened the victim that he would kill him together with his sister, nephews and nieces if he phoned the police.

They recorded that a month before he absconded the Claimant removed a plank from his room to keep as a weapon and a week later gained access to the roof of the unit with the help of another patient. The absconding incident was preceded by threats to three members of staff who escorted him to the local hospital after he self-lacerated with a piece of glass and claimed that he had put a further piece of glass into his penile urethra. It was recorded that Dr Noon’s opinion, notwithstanding his assessment that the Claimant represented a high level of risk to others, was that he had been wrongly given a section 37 order without restriction under the classification of mental illness and that he had told the assessors that he had approached the CPS to ask for a review of the Claimant’s sentence. Although he found him to fill the diagnostic criteria for anti-social borderline and paranoid narcissistic personality disorders in addition to having histrionic traits, he had found no deficit in concentration or attention consistent with a diagnosis of ADHD in adulthood or any evidence of mental illness.</p>

The circumstances of his absconsion showed a great deal of planning – selling his television to obtain money and telephoning the unit to mis-inform them of his location. Dr Noon expressed his concerns about the level of murderousness expressed by the Claimant about his victim. The Claimant had told him that he had unprotected sexual intercourse with his girlfriend whilst AWOL and now had concerns that she might be pregnant.

They concluded that due to his recent absconsion, his continued assertion of an intention to escape to inflict further serious harm on his victim, threatening behaviour towards staff, including the secreting of weapons, and physical bullying of patients he required detention with high security services as he continued to pose grave and immediate danger to others. It was said that he met the operational criteria for the DSPD as he suffered from several severe personality disorders and had a PSL – R score of at least thirty.

That level of intent to cause physical harm to fellow patients was said to be very difficult to manage safely at medium secure level. The view was expressed that the Claimant might therefore require detention in conditions of high security, and that he would require long-term treatment, mostly in conditions of security, in order to reduce the risk of serious offending behaviour to a level that might be manageable in the community.</p>

It might also be appropriate to involve the police if there were specific threats to kill. I interpose to comment that, on its face this strikes me as a somewhat surprising response to the serious nature of the Claimant’s return to the victim’s house and his statement to the assessing team that he would return to his address so that he could put him in hospital for a time and that he felt that he could kill him if he saw him again. The Panel also said that it could not understand why or how the Claimant ended up in hospital on a section 37 order and that it might well be worth pursing an appeal against that decision if it was made unlawfully or in error. No explanation was given for that conclusion.</p>

His mental disorder continued to remain of a nature and degree requiring his continued treatment in hospital primarily for his own health and safety but also for the protection of others, specifically the victim of the index offence. The opinion was expressed that he required at least the present conditions of medium security and that he continued to require treatment within the present level of security for the management of risk both to himself and to others.

I did not see his application form so that there was no direct evidence as to what he formally applied for. However it is apparent from the handwritten reasons for the Tribunal’s decision dated 23 July 2009 signed by the Tribunal judge that when interviewed by the Tribunal’s medical member before the oral hearing the Claimant told him that he was not looking for a discharge but wanted to be moved from Ashen Hill to Llanrth Court, a private medium security hospital in South Wales.

As well as Dr Zachariah’s report dated 21 January 2009, the Tribunal received a report from Dr Noon dated 29 June 2009 in which he referred to incidents of self-harm, the Claimant inserting glass and metal into his penis in April 2009. Although he had had gradually increasing leave with a reduced number of escorts and without handcuffs to attend dental appointments, in May 2009 he had persuaded staff to allow him to have 30 minutes of escorted leave within the hospital grounds from where he absconded with a substantial amount of money. After a weekend away he presented himself to the police saying he had not gone back to the previous victim’s home but had consumed alcohol and illicit drugs. He was recorded as taking medication to help intrusive thoughts of a violent nature. Following his return, he was recorded as having threatened to cut a member of staff’s face with a blade which he had secreted in his mouth.

Dr Noon’s opinion was that the Claimant should continue to remain in hospital under section 37 both for his health and safety and for the safety and protection of others.

He had however written to the clinical director of the medium secure hospital in South Wales to ask if the Claimant might visit there to enable his family to visit him there.

It also made no recommendation pursuant to its statutory power under section 72 (3) (a) of the 1983 Act to which I refer below. In its written reasons for its decision the Tribunal recorded that the Claimant had a forensic history and a long history of self-harm which had continued until about four months previously. He had clearly been a substantial management problem. Having been in York for some five months he had evidently settled somewhat and was currently reasonably compliant with his care plan. While he principally sought a discharge it was stated that he also wished the Tribunal to make a recommendation for his transfer to a low secure unit in South Wales where his family was. The Tribunal stated that it could not make any such recommendation on that occasion because no such unit had yet been identified but it took the view that it would be appropriate for steps to be taken in that direction. In the meantime it stated that the Claimant was appropriately placed in conditions of medium security at Stockton Hall. The Section must remain in force for the health and safety of the Claimant himself and for the protection of other persons. The long history of self-harming and criminal behaviour was said to demonstrate an unacceptable risk in the context of a premature discharge.</p>

It made reference to the further hearing in front of a Mental Health Tribunal on 10 May 2010 which made recommendations for explorations to take place as to whether or not the Claimant’s care could be delivered at a hospital closer to his family home, to the Claimant having subsequently changed his mind saying that he wanted to remain at Stockton Hall but then changing his mind again and saying that he would wish to be transferred to a hospital closer to his family. </p>

Since the end of May the clinical team had noticed a deterioration in his presentation. There had been several incidents during which he had inserted foreign bodies into his urethra requiring surgical intervention and on several occasions he had also presented as more aggressive including making attempts to assault staff, throwing a remote control at a duty doctor, becoming racially abusive and episodes during which he would kick objects. In view of the ongoing risk of self harm he was placed on high levels of observations and managed on one on one observations. The view was expressed that he was currently suffering from a mental disorder as defined within the 1983 Act which was of a nature and degree warranting his detention in hospital and that were his detention not to be continued he would seek immediate discharge from hospital which would be likely to result in a rapid deterioration in his mental state while increasing risk to himself and others. </p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“… [He] subsequently manufactured weapons in order to assault the said patient.

[The Claimant] kept one of these instruments in his own possession and hid the second one in the garden area of the ward and at the time also invited several other patients on the unit to use this weapon against the patient he had taken a dislike to, should the opportunity arise.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Dr Vandenabeele added that it was also of relevance that not long after the incident when the weapons were moved by members of the nursing team the Claimant also made an attempt to punch the above mentioned patient. He expressed the view that although the Claimant had not physically assaulted the other patient the risks and the fact that he was making weapons as well as inciting other patients constituted a grave risk.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">A central part of the claim for judicial review is based on three criticisms of this letter. The first is that it is said to have presented as a fact that the Claimant had manufactured the weapons in order to assault the patient. The second, is that the letter made no reference to the fact recorded in contemporary nursing notes that the Claimant handed in the first weapon voluntarily to a nurse and revealed the location of the second weapon to the staff contrary, it is said, to the impression given in the letter that the weapons were discovered by the staff without assistance from the Claimant. Third the letter made no reference to the fact, again recorded in the contemporary nursing notes, that, having handed in the first weapon, the Claimant asked for either the identified patient or himself to be moved to a different ward and that, that having been refused, he revealed the location of the second weapon. Taken together it is said that these three aspects of the incident as recorded in the contemporary notes at least arguably suggest that there was, contrary to the Claimant’s own statements to members of staff, no actual intention to use the weapons against the identified patient. Rather the intention was to use the weapons as a means of putting pressure on the hospital to achieve the Claimant’s desire to be separated from the identified patient.</p>

He stated that the Claimant refused to disclose the whereabouts of the second weapon, triggering a full lock down of the ward and a search was required before it was located in a communal area. Although that account is partly supported by the contemporary nursing notes dated 31 July 2010 and 1 August 2010, it omitted reference to two points recorded in those notes. The first was that when asked to help staff locate the second weapon the Claimant had requested to be moved wards or to have the other patient moved. The second was that after the shut down was implemented, the second weapon was retrieved by the hospital staff as a result of the Claimant disclosing to them that he had hidden it in the drain in the secure garden area.</p>

In his introduction to the report Dr Sengupta said that in preparing it he had access to the Claimant’s “extensive history and several reports as follows”, which did not in terms include the Claimant’s hospital contemporaneous notes on the incident. In the body of the report Dr Sengupta stated that he interviewed the Claimant who described the incidents of violence, both on the ward and in the community as a matter of fact without little apparent emotion attached to it.

I observe that whether or not he read the notes his report is open to the same criticisms made by the Claimant of Dr Vandenabeele’s referral letter. I further observe that although Broadmoor’s referral procedure provides that the assessing consultant is permitted to attend the Admissions Panel and to contribute to the presentation of the case, although he is not a Panel member, Dr Murray, the clinical director of Broadmoor, stated in his first witness statement that the assessing doctor does not attend.

Of note were three very serious incidents of violence, the first being the index offence, when he took his victim hostage and subjected him to both physical and psychological torture as said to have been evidenced in the witness statements. On the second occasion he absconded from medium security and arrived back at his victim’s house with a plan to kill him. Thirdly “the most recent incident of fashioning and manufacturing a weapon with a view to either inciting other patients or seriously assaulting a patient in his neck in Stockton Hall Hospital”.

Given his serious risk of harm to others (the index offence of hostage taking, inflicting serious psychological and physical harm to his victim, his escape from custody by unlocking himself from handcuffs and again by threatening members of staff to arrive at his ex-victim’s house and finally manufacturing a weapon in medium security “to assault a specific patient”, Dr Sengupta considered that the Claimant posed a grave and immediate risk to others. He recommended his admission under conditions of maximum security. He considered it unfortunate that the Claimant had not received a restriction order at the time of sentencing.</p>

The only material said to have been read by the author of the report were the letters of Dr Vandenabeele and Dr Sengupta. The description of the incident included the following: “One of these weapons was kept in the [Claimant’s] possession whilst the other was hidden in the garden area of the ward. [The Claimant] made no secret of his intentions to harm the patient he had taken a dislike to, inciting several other patients to use the hidden weapon on him should the opportunity arise. When the weapons were discovered the [Claimant] admitted his intention was to stab the other patient in the neck, which he felt was an appropriate response as the other patient had been winding him up. He later attempted to punch the fellow patient.” The opinion was expressed that while it could be argued that the risk posed by the Claimant to his fellow patient could and should be managed by Stockton Hall hospital or by transfer to Kneesworth House hospital as had been originally proposed, the concerning factor was the escalation of risk both to himself and others as described in the various reports.</p>

He said that the panel had unanimously supported the provision of a bed in high security for the Claimant and that following discussions with Broadmoor Personality Disorder service it had been agreed that a bed should be offered in the main hospital in the first instance.

In particular there was no reference to the fact that the Claimant had voluntarily handed over the weapon which he had made to staff and told them where the other one was hidden. That, it was said, did not suggest an intention to use the weapon. The Claimant had made the weapon after trying to get help from the staff over several days to move either him or the other patient away from each other. The staff had persistently ignored his requests. His efforts included calling the Howard League and asking it to make representations to the ward that something should be done. On doing so the Howard League had been informed that nothing could be done. It was asserted that the Claimant’s fabrication of a weapon and disclosure of the weapon to staff appeared to have been more of a cry for help. This was said to be supported by the response of the staff who did not deem it necessary to move either the Claimant or the other patient. It was further asserted that Dr Sengupta’s report failed to mention that the Claimant currently had escorted ground leave at Stockton Hall which would not be permitted if his risk to others were grave and immediate, particularly given that his second absconsion from Ashen Hill took place during escorted ground leave. (This was challenged by the Interested Party as inaccurate by reference to contemporaneous notes on the Claimant’s Nursing Cover Plan.) It was submitted that Dr Sengupta erred in attributing weight to the risk of violence as self-reported by the Claimant when the evidence was clear that his history of interpersonal violence was in fact insignificant.</p>

In particular the risk posed to the other patient at Stockton Hall had been removed by moving him to a different ward. It was submitted that the Claimant’s Article 8 rights were engaged by the decision to admit him to Broadmoor in that it involved a loss of his current home and relationships with staff and patients, the Claimant currently being in a long-term relationship with a prisoner and receiving regular phone calls from her which would not be possible in high secure conditions. His Article 8 rights were also said to be engaged by the more restrictive and supervised regime at Broadmoor.</p>

It was submitted that he should have been provided as a minimum with the right to make representations in advance of the decision being made. Despite being clinical the decision concerned an assessment of risk as a matter of fact. Fairness required that he should have an opportunity to comment on the evidence and correct any factual or legal inaccuracies. </p>

More detail was given as to the attempts made by the Claimant before the incident to be separated from the identified patient. It was said that he had been alerting staff for several days to the problems he was having with the patient asking to be moved away from him.

Reliance was placed on the fact that the staff did not separate the Claimant from the identified patient even after he drew their attention to the weapons which, it was submitted, showed that they did not view the incident as indicating that the identified patient was in grave and immediate danger from the Claimant.

That, combined with the information omitted from the referral, it was submitted, suggested that the Claimant’s risk could be dealt with by alternative measures such as responding to his concerns and warning signs. It was submitted that the material before the panel disclosed an over reliance on and uncritical acceptance of the Claimant’s self-reported violent tendencies. There was a failure to take into account the Claimant’s acknowledged unreliability in self-reporting and evidence that he might have a tendency to “fake bad”. It was submitted that there were alternative measures available for dealing with the Claimant’s risk other than transfer to high secure conditions at Broadmoor. By way of example his risk of absconsion could be managed by using handcuffs, secure holds and a secure vehicle on escort outside the hospital (the circumstances of his first absconsion), and restricting his leaves outside the secure perimeter (the circumstances of his second absconsion).</p>

Section 3 provides that a patient may be so admitted and detained in pursuance of an application made in accordance with Section 3. Such an application must be founded on the written recommendations of two registered medical practitioners including a statement that they are of the opinion that the patient is suffering from mental disorder of a nature or degree which makes it appropriate for him to receive medical treatment in hospital, that it is necessary for the health and safety of the patient or for the protection of other persons that he should receive such treatment and that it cannot be provided unless he is detained under section 3 and that appropriate medical treatment is available  for him.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Section 20 of the 1983 Act provides that a patient admitted to hospital pursuant to section 3 may be detained for a period not exceeding six months but that authority for his detention may be renewed for a further period of six months and thereafter for a period of one year and so on for periods of one year at a time. Section 20 also provides a mechanism for a person’s liability to remain detained in hospital to be reviewed. Within the period of two months ending on the day on which a patient who is liable to be detained in pursuance of an application for admission for treatment would cease to be so liable in default of the renewal of the authority for his detention, it is the duty of the responsible clinician to examine the patient and, if it appears to him that the patient is suffering from mental disorder of a nature or degree which makes it appropriate for him to receive medical treatment in a hospital and that it is necessary for the health or safety of the patient or for the protection of other persons that he should receive such treatment and that it cannot be provided unless he continues to be detained, to furnish to the managers of the hospital where the patient is detained a report to that effect. The responsible clinician must consult one or more other persons who have been professionally concerned with the patient’s medical treatment before furnishing such a report. Such a report may not be furnished unless a person who has been professionally concerned with the patient’s medical treatment but who belongs to a profession other than that to which the responsible clinician belongs states in writing that he agrees that the patient is suffering from such mental disorder, that it is necessary that he should receive such treatment and that it can not be provided unless he continued to be detained.</p>

Section 20 (3) provides that where such a report is furnished the managers shall, unless they discharge the patient under section 23, cause him to be informed. Section 23, as modified by paragraph 1 of Part I of Schedule I of the Act provides that an order for discharge of the patient detained under a hospital order pursuant to section 37 may be made by the responsible clinician or the hospital managers. </p>

The effect is that the time periods during which a person subject to a hospital order may continue to be lawfully detained are the same as in the case of a person admitted pursuant to section 3, save that the initial period of six months begins with the date on which the hospital order under section 37 was made.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There are two differences of potential relevance to issues in this case between the provisions for involuntary admissions pursuant to sections 3 and 37. First the power to detain a convicted offender is conferred on the sentencing judge. Although under both sections it is a necessary condition for admission that two registered medical practitioners are of the opinion that the patient is suffering from mental disorder of a nature or degree which makes it appropriate for him to receive medical treatment in hospital, under section 3 that is a sufficient condition whereas under section 37 it is not. Section 37 imposes the further requirement that the court must itself be satisfied that the offender is suffering from mental disorder of a nature or degree which makes it appropriate for him to be detained in hospital for medical treatment. The ultimate judgment is thus not that of doctors but of a judge who is free to reject the medical evidence placed before him. By contrast there is no requirement under section 3 for a specified person to accept the recommendations of the two registered medical practitioners or to be satisfied that the patient is suffering from a mental disorder of a nature or degree which makes it appropriate for him to receive medical treatment in hospital. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Second, section 37 requires the court to be of the opinion, having regard to all the circumstances including the nature of the offence and the character and the antecedents of the offender, and to the other available methods of dealing with him, that the most suitable method of disposing of the case is by means of a hospital order. Under section 3 the requirement is that two medical practioners must state that they are of the opinion that it is necessary for the health and safety of the patient or for the protection of other persons that he should receive medical treatment in hospital. The latter requirement specifically focuses on questions of the danger to third parties. However at the later stage of the renewal of the authority for the detention of a patient, as already mentioned, the criterion of continued treatment in hospital being necessary for the health or safety of the patient <span style="font-weight:bold">or for the protection of other persons</span> applies to patients originally detained pursuant to hospital order under section 37 as well as to patients detained for treatment under section 3. </p>

The latter may be withheld if, in the opinion of the hospital managers, it is necessary to do so in the interests of the safety of the patient or for the protection of other persons.

However it states that the essential yardstick is whether the grounds for continued detention under the Act are satisfied. To ensure that that is done in a systematic and consistent way managers panels should consider, in the case of patients detained pursuant to section 37 the following questions in the order stated: Is the patient still suffering from mental disorder? If so, is the disorder of a nature or degree which makes treatment in the hospital appropriate? Is continued detention for medical treatment necessary for the patient’s health or safety or for the protection of other people? Is appropriate medical treatment available for the patient? [31.16]. If three or more members of the panel who between them make up a majority are satisfied from the evidence presented to them that the answer to any of the questions set out above is “no” the patient should be discharged. However in all cases hospital managers have discretion to discharge patients even if the criteria for continued detention are met. Managers’ panel must therefore always consider whether there are other reasons why the patient should be discharged despite the answers to the questions set out above. [31.22].</p>

Managers panels should therefore adopt and apply a procedure which is fair and reasonable, not make irrational decisions – that is decisions which no managers panel properly directing itself as to the law and on the available information could have made and not act unlawfully – that is, contrary to the provisions of the 1983 Act and any other legislation including the Human Rights Act 1998.

It is implicit in the statement that the hospital managers do not have the power to insist that another hospital accept a patient [30.14] that the code of practice contemplates that the effective power to decide whether or not a referred patient should be transferred is conferred on the managers of the putative referring hospital and not on those of the putative receiving hospital. </p>

It is stated that transfers are potentially an interference with the patient’s right to respect to privacy and family life under Article 8 of the ECHR and care should be taken to act compatibly with the Convention when deciding whether to authorise transfer.

Among the factors that it is said need to be considered when deciding whether to transfer a patient are: whether the transfer would give the patient greater access to family or friends, or have the opposite effect; what effect the transfer is likely to have on the course of the patient’s disorder or their recovery; the availability of appropriate beds at the potential receiving hospital; and whether a transfer will be appropriate to enable the patient to be in a more culturally suitable or compatible environment, or whether it would have the opposite effect.

Nor is the exercise of the power to transfer said to be subject to the general law and to public law duties arising from it. The only prescription as regards the role of the patient in relation to a decision whether to authorise his or her transfer is the statement that wherever practicable, the patient should be involved in the process leading to any decision to transfer them to another hospital. It is said to be important to explain the reasons for the proposed transfer to the patient and where appropriate their nearest relative and other family or friends and to record them. Only in exceptional circumstances should a patient be transferred to another hospital without warning. [30.17]. It is also said that the professionals involved in their care should always be prepared to discuss the possibility of a transfer and should raise the issue themselves if they think that the patient might be interested in or benefit from a transfer. [30.20]. Although nearest relatives’ consent to transfers is not a statutory requirement it is stated that unless the patient objects his nearest relative should normally be consulted before the patient is transferred to another hospital.

All four members of the Appeals Panel must attend. The Appeals Panel will have the same reports as the Directorate Panel. In addition it will have the written decision of the Directorate Panel. If appropriate other persons may be invited to the panel to provide information. The Appeals Panel will reach a decision within six weeks of being referred a case.

He said that Broadmoor receives approximately one hundred referrals annually of which about fifty are accepted on first application. Those referred include people remanded in custody having been charged with committing a serious offence in the community or who are serving a prison sentence as well as those who are presenting problems in less secure services and who are referred for continuing care at Broadmoor. Where, after assessment, it is “our” view that the person does not need admission to higher security but the medium security unit consider that they cannot safely admit (from prison) or continue to look after the particular patient (if a current in-patient) Broadmoor review the case at its “independent Appeals Panel”. About forty six such cases are reviewed every year about half of whom are accepted for admission despite their having previously been rejected. </p>

As part of the governance of that process the three hospitals cooperated over the past eight months in a project whereby twenty five percent of their Admissions Panel were undertaken with video conference input from the other hospitals, who provided their independent view of whether the referral should have been accepted or not.</p>

All cases are assessed by a suitable qualified doctor from Broadmoor Hospital and on occasions by other members of staff such as a nurse or a psychologist. The assessing clinicians prepare a report for the Admissions Panel, which comprises the Clinical Lead (Lead Doctor) for either Personality Disorder or the Mental Illness Directorate, who chairs the panel, a Senior Nurse, a Senior Psychologist, a Senior Occupational Therapist, and a Senior Social worker.  As to the Admissions Panel, Dr Murray stated that the Broadmoor assessing doctor does not attend. Nor is there attendance from the patient’s solicitor or family. He stated that these are clinical decisions taken by an experienced group of clinical staff who have long experience in assessing referrals. The intention has been to ensure that there is a consistent threshold for admission decisions, irrespective of the individual views of the referring service or assessing clinician. Similarly, the Appeals Panel reviews the papers available to the original Admissions Panel and any additional documentation provided by the dissatisfied referring agency who are seeking to appeal the original Admission Panel’s decision. </p>

This was reflected in the position of the Interested Party. In her skeleton argument Ms Hayes who appeared for the Interested Party submitted that a patient has no right to be consulted prior to transfer between hospitals. It was also reflected in Dr Murray’s response in the letter dated 1 September 2010 from the Defendant in response to Ms Jolly’s request for permission to attend the Admissions Panel which would consider the Claimant’s application as an observer in accordance with paragraph 6.10 of the Admissions Panel Operational Policy. He said that that paragraph was primarily intended for trainees and that it had never been Broadmoor’s practice to allow attendance by referring agents, either doctors or others, at the decision making meeting in respect of a particular case. A fortiori it is to be inferred it was not the practice to permit attendance on the part of the patient who was being referred or his solicitors. </p>

On an appeal the Tribunal may order that the proposed transfer not take place or as the case may be that the patient be returned to the hospital from which he or she was transferred if it is not satisfied that the patient requires to be detained in hospital under conditions of special security and that those conditions of special security can be provided only in a state hospital. If, when an appeal against a proposed transfer is made to the Tribunal, the proposed transfer has not taken place, Section 126(4) provides that the managers of the hospital shall not transfer the patient as proposed but that the Tribunal may, if satisfied that, pending determination of the appeal, the patient should be transferred as proposed, make an order that the patient be so transferred. </p>

Section 125 confers a right to appeal to the Tribunal against a transfer or proposed transfer to any hospital other than a state hospital. On such an appeal the Tribunal has power to order that the proposed transfer not take place or as the case may be that the patient be returned to the hospital from which he was transferred. As distinct from an appeal under section 126 there is no condition precedent to the making of such an order that the Tribunal must not be satisfied that the patient requires to be treated in the proposed receiving hospital or that a particular treatment can only be provided there.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In his Claim Form the Claimant sought an interim order prohibiting the Defendant from admitting him to Broadmoor, an order quashing the Defendant’s decision to admit him to Broadmoor, a declaration that the Defendant’s decision to admit him to Broadmoor was in breach of Article 8 and/or Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights and/or was procedurally unfair, damages, costs and further or other relief. In his application for urgent consideration he contended that the decision to admit him to Broadmoor was disproportionate and a breach of Article 8, that the failure to entitle him to make representations on his admission to Broadmoor was unlawful and rendered the decision procedurally unfair and that the Defendant should quash the decision of 15 September 2010 and make a fresh decision taking into account representations by him.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In his grounds in support of the claim the Claimant submitted that the decision to transfer him to Broadmoor was a breach of Article 8. It interfered with his right to private life because the high security regime at Broadmoor meant that there would inevitably be additional security measures such as searches which were likely to engage Article 8 and which were likely to mean that it would be difficult for him to maintain contact with his family which would also be likely to engage Article 8. The interference would be a breach of Article 8 because it was either unnecessary or failed to strike a fair balance. The matter that appeared to have prompted the decision to admit him to Broadmoor was the production of a weapon. This was demonstrated by the fact that the index offence and the escape where the Claimant attempted to locate his victim had been insufficient to justify his admission on the earlier occasion and by the fact that the application followed shortly after the production of a weapon. Reliance was placed on the fact that the weapons were discovered because the Claimant voluntarily brought them to the staff’s attention and that there was no reference to that fact before the Admissions Panel. It was submitted that no account had been taken of the Claimant’s acknowledged unreliability in self-reporting and evidence that he may have a tendency to “fake bad”. It was further submitted that there were a number of measures available in medium security conditions which could safely manage his risks. </p>

The decision was likely to be an infringement of his rights protected by the European Prison Rules as high security was likely to severely restrict his remaining freedoms. It was also the sort of matter that can give rise to judicial review proceedings. The dispute related to matters that had implications for the maintenance of relationships which was sufficient to engage Article 6.

More importantly there was a failure to ensure equality of arms in the failure to involve Claimant in the decision making process. Further the decision was taken by a body that lacked independence, a matter that could not be remedied by a claim for judicial review. The primary issue was a simple issue of fact of a sort regularly considered by the criminal courts when sentencing, namely whether the Claimant’s recent behaviour demonstrated high risk. Further the decision was taken following a procedure that lacked sufficient safeguards to ensure compliance with Article 6 and any claim for judicial review was likely to be considered months after the decision took effect. </p>

Having described the Claimant as a complex and conflicted individual who struggles with feelings of hopelessness and low self-worth who often expresses himself in a superficial way which makes it difficult to know what he really feels,  she said that, based on her experience at the Howard League for Penal Reform and currently at Deighton Pierce Glynn Solicitors, she was aware that there would always be significant difficulties in challenging the transfer process on behalf of detained patients because of their unique vulnerabilities. Even where they fall short of lacking capacity, they are often confused, conflicted, inconsistent in their instructions and influenced by feelings of hopelessness, worthlessness, discomfort or desperation for security. They often find it difficult to canvass and assert their rights, even with the help of a solicitor. She stated that the numbers involved are already small and in many cases the transfer process will not be substantively challenged and/or the client will not feel able or willing to challenge it. The opportunity to challenge the fairness of the procedure at the same time as a challenge to the substantive decision is likely to be infrequent. However it is precisely the vulnerability of this group and the impact of high security upon them that makes the fairness of the transfer procedure a matter of general importance.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in"> It is true that Dr Vandenabeele’s assessment was based in part on his statement that the Claimant was inciting other patients and that he had manufactured the weapons in order to assault  another patient and that Dr Sengupta based his risk assessment in part on the fact as he referred to it that the Claimant had manufactured a weapon in order to assault a specific patient and that the question whether the Claimant did in fact intend to use the weapon is disputed and that the allegation that he incited other patients to use the weapon is only partly supported by the contemporary notes. It is also the case that the Panel’s conclusion that the Claimant poses a serious risk of harm to others and that his continued care in conditions of medium security would put fellow patients and staff at grave risk of harm appear to have been based in part on a finding that the Claimant had made the weapon with intent to cause harm to others. That finding was plainly based on the assertion to that effect in the reports of Dr Vandenabeele and Dr Sengupta and in ignorance of the Claimant’s dispute of that allegation.  It is also the case that the Panel does not appear to have been made aware that it was the Claimant who handed in the first weapon and disclosed the whereabouts of the second one to the nursing staff (albeit only after a shutdown was implemented to facilitate a search by hospital staff) and that he had asked to be moved from the patient whom he threatened, which Ms Jolly submitted  was evidence that the incident was an attempt at manipulation of hospital staff by the Claimant to achieve his objective rather than evidence of a real intention to harm the other patient.</p>

It is of course a highly material fact that, irrespective of the Claimant’s own intentions and whether or not he incited other patients to use the hidden weapon to attack the patient to whom he had taken a dislike, he admitted having hidden the second weapon in the hospital.

Nor in my judgment can it be ruled out that on that basis the Admissions Panel might have taken a less grave view of the triggering incident or that it might have affected its overall assessment of the degree of risk posed by the Claimant against a background in which the two previous incidents had not been considered by the previous Admissions Panel to justify his admission to Broadmoor.</p>

The fact is that the Claimant has expressly abandoned his substantive challenge to the decision to transfer him to Broadmoor. He does not invite me to find that it was a breach of his Article 8 rights. Nor does he invite me to quash the decision and order his transfer back to a medium security hospital or to order a reconsideration by Stockton Hall and/or the Broadmoor Admissions Panel as to whether he should be admitted to Broadmoor and transferred from Stockton Hall.</p>

The decision to transfer the Claimant from medium to high security was made pursuant to the statutory powers conferred by s 19 of the 1983 Act and Regulation 7.

However the parallel is not in my judgment an exact one. In that case the question raised was a general one which was capable of precise formulation, namely what was the time within which an application to he Mental Health Review Tribunal must be heard so as to comply with obligations in Article 5 (4) of the ECHR.

Whereas it would be unthinkable for a category A prisoner to be released from prison direct, a patient detained even in a high security hospital must be released if he ceases to suffer from a mental disorder, even if he remains dangerous.

This came in the form of an additional statement from Dr Murray dated 22 April 2012.  Dr Murray qualified his evidence on the length of stay in high security conditions by stressing that the type of disorder under consideration in this case, borderline personality disorder, is inescapably a life-long disorder.  Patients with it will typically experience periods of crisis requiring admissions intermittently for many years until the disorder gradually remits, which is usually in the fifth and sixth decades.  On that basis the duration of any single episode of detention under the 1983 Act will not represent the totality of the detention an individual experiences.</p>

Dr Murray produced a chart showing that the mean length of stay at Broadmoor for patients discharged between 1 January 2009 and 31 December 2011 was 5.9 years, a reduction from the 8.5 years referred to in the <span style="font-style:italic">Harry</span> case.  For patients admitted from medium secure units the mean was 5.7 years.  However, the mean length of stay for patients discharged to medium secure units was 7.3 years, the difference between that figure and the mean of 5.9 being accounted for by the shorter length of stay for patients discharged for deportation, to other high security hospitals or to prison. In the context of the issue presently under consideration it seems to me that the relevant figure is 7.3 years since discharge to prison, other high security hospitals or deportation are unlikely to be staging posts to ultimate discharge from detention back into the community. </p>

The need to transfer from medium to high security would in general be a negative factor in considering a transfer from high security to low, open or community placements in the future.  There are often considerable administrative and clinical delays involved in transfers between levels of security due to the needs for referral, assessment by receiving clinical teams, applications where relevant to the Ministry of Justice and bed availability.  </p>

That can most reliably be gained by the experience of testing out in different levels of security, for example through medium and low security.  Before a conditional discharge there would usually be unescorted leave in the area the patient would return to.  That experience is best gained via leave from a local facility such as medium secure pre-discharge, low secure or rehabilitation.  That process is logistically very difficult to carry out from high security and usually includes a successful period of treatment in medium security.  </p>

As a result patients in high security will almost always be expected to be tested out in conditions of medium security before discharge will be considered, as set out in <span style="font-style:italic">Harry</span>.  Indeed in her experience the treatment provided by the high security hospital is often only focussed on preparing the patient for medium security, where it is anticipated that further treatment and the important rehabilitative aspects of treatment will be carried out.

She has rarely been able to challenge a failure to follow the Tribunal’s recommendation because it is at its highest only a recommendation.  In addition, because the process of moving someone to lower security services involves agreement from several different parties (the hospital, the gate-keeper, the receiving unit and the Ministry of Justice, most of whom were not party to the Tribunal proceedings and feel little by way of obligation to comply with the resultant recommendation), a challenge necessarily would involve breaking down which decision actually caused the delay and working out whether all avenues of alternative resolution have been explored.  As such, few cases pass the threshold for being challengeable.  As a result, she has often had to adopt the approach of seeking further recommendations from the Tribunal until they start to stack up and it becomes harder and arguably more unreasonable for a hospital and other bodies to resist following them.  However, the patient often has to wait another year before seeking another recommendation from the Tribunal because of the statutory  limits on the number of applications which can be made.</p>

Those reasons include the need for the patient to follow a step-down discharge via conditions of lesser security so that they can undergo refresher treatment programmes, undertake rehabilitative community leaves and demonstrate that they can behave safely in less restrictive conditions. In addition administrative delays in transferring patients (both within the high security hospital itself to lower secure wards and then onto lesser security) caused in part by the lack of a mechanism for enforcing Tribunal recommendations, will add significant time onto the patient’s overall detention, particularly when that transfer is from high to medium security. She therefore believed that the statement of Lightman J in <span style="font-style:italic">Harry</span> continues to be an accurate reflection of current practice and that patients who are transferred to high security will face additional time in detention for reasons unconnected to the severity of their mental disorder.</p>

In this context he referred to the statement in Broadmoor’s Admission Guidelines that: “It is an unacceptable infringement of a patient’s rights to detain them in a higher level of security than they require.” However he submitted that if, contrary to what should happen, a patient no longer requires to be detained in a high security hospital, but is not transferred to a lower security setting, because of delays in securing a bed or disputes between detaining authorities or otherwise, then it is the failure to transfer him <span style="font-weight:bold">out </span>of high security hospital – not the decision to transfer him <span style="font-weight:bold">into </span>it – which lengthens the likely total period of his detention.</p>

It is, in short, foreseeable when a patient is transferred to Broadmooor from a medium security hospital, that a subsequent conclusion by Broadmoor or the Tribunal at a later date that he no longer requires to be detained in high security is not likely to lead to an immediate transfer back to a medium security hospital. Absent judicial review proceedings such a conclusion will be a necessary but not sufficient condition of transfer out of Broadmoor. Although the length of time that will elapse between such a conclusion being reached and the actual transfer of the patient to a medium security hospital cannot be predicted the fact that there is likely to be a period of delay is foreseeable.</p>

The principle that should underpin hospital or ward policies on all telephone use is that detained patients are not free to leave the premises and that individual freedom to communicate with family and friends should therefore be maintained as far as possible.

Thus for example he submitted that any restrictions on a patient’s right to make unmonitored telephone calls occurs only when a decision is made under Direction 34 of the 2011 Directions and not on transfer. He did however accept that transfer to a high security hospital does of itself trigger restrictions on the right to send and receive correspondence without monitoring because interception of postal communications is mandatory at high security hospitals.

It is true that some of those consequences may not materialise, either because Broadmoor does not exercise a relevant power or because there is no adverse risk assessment triggering its right to exercise such a power. However some at least of those adverse consequences flow automatically from the transfer itself by reason of the requirement to inspect postal packets and more generally, even in the case of such restrictions as are permissive rather than mandatory, a patient, on transfer, loses the right which he possesses while in a medium security hospital for his post not to be withheld and his telephone calls not to be monitored. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Dr Murray acknowledged that the inspection of letters which is undertaken at high security hospitals is over and above practice in other services. However he stated that of 2,340 items of mail referred by postal monitors at Broadmoor to the patient’s responsible clinicians for decisions as to whether the mail should be allowed to be sent out or to be forwarded to the patient concerned only 41 were actually withheld. (As to the Claimant, Dr Murray stated that of his incoming letters five were withheld in the early part of his admission to Broadmoor but none since May 2011. However in considering whether the more stringent restrictions in high security hospitals is a factor which should contribute to a conclusion that the decision to transfer should engage the common law duty of fairness it does not seem to me that the extent of such restrictions subsequently applied to this particular claimant is of any assistance.) Dr Murray stated that the Claimant has access to a telephone to make outgoing calls from Broadmoor but not incoming ones which would typically be allowed at a medium secure unit. Broadmoor’s practice on receipt of an incoming telephone call at a ward is to make arrangements for the patient concerned to make an outgoing call in response.</p>

He stated that searching of patients and areas occurs more frequently and extensively in high security. Associated with this are restrictions on the type and volume of patients’ possessions which is more restrictive in high than medium security hospitals. Paragraphs 5 and 6 of the 2011 Directions permit respectively rub down searches of patients and searches of patients involving the removal of clothing other than outer clothing on the authority of the patient’s responsible clinician or the medical director who must take into account the interests of the patient, the safety of staff, patients, visitors and visiting children and the security of the hospital. The position in medium security hospitals is governed by the Code of Practice which provides that hospital policies on searches of patients, their belongings and surroundings may extend to the routine and random searching without cause of detained patients if necessary without their consent but only in exceptional circumstances.</p>

For example the facilities available within the secure perimeter such as therapy, workshops recreation and support are much more extensive. He also accepted that high level of restrictions for example two to one observation in a locked psychiatric intensive care unit can operate in any hospital. However in a high security hospital many of the restrictions are fundamental to the regime rather than a transitory response to increased risk and the restrictions are at a much greater level than in a medium security hospital.</p>

Medium security and high security hospitals each provide a range of wards and while the most open conditions in medium security are far less restricted than anything in high security, provision at the highest end of medium security in high dependent wards and in seclusion has a similar impact upon the free access to family as in high security hospitals. </p>

The executive management of secure clinical care requires a range of wards with a range of regimes which vary in their level of restrictions or liberty to accommodate the needs of the various patients so that there is some overlap between high and medium security. At any given time the more settled patients in high security rehabilitation wards will require a less restrictive regime than the most acute patients in medium security. He acknowledged that the Claimant had required the highest level of secure provision within Broadmoor. Although he asserted that the assessment of Dr Sengupta and Dr Vandenabeele that transfer was appropriate had been vindicated by the passage of time that does not of course address the question whether the consequences of the transfer were or were not potentially adverse to the Claimant in terms of imposing or exposing him to the risk of more stringent restrictions. </p>

Interference with unrestricted access to and use of postal and telephone communication which is unlawful in medium security hospitals is or maybe lawful in high security hospitals. Some interference is mandatory – the opening of postal packets. Other interference is permitted or may be permitted depending on the outcome of risk assessment.

While conditions at the highest end of medium security in high dependency wards and in seclusion may have a similar impact on free access to family as anything in a high security hospital, it is nonetheless the case that the most open conditions in medium security are far less restricted than anything in high security hospitals and some of the restrictions in high security hospitals to which I have referred are fundamental to the regime rather than a transitory response to increased risk as is sometimes the case in medium security hospitals. As Dr Vandenabeele put it, it is true that within conditions of high security the Claimant would be subjected to a more restrictive hospital regime. That is the very reason why he was referred there because in Dr Vandenabeele’s opinion such restrictions were necessary and clinically indicated to safely manage his risks. </p>

The transfer was unanimously considered to be appropriate by the specialist panel convened to assess it. There could be and was no credible dispute about the existence of the risk given the factual circumstances which formed the basis of the request for admission. There was no contrary medical evidence. The views of the patient had been sought and he was in favour of admission to Broadmoor. In those circumstances the assessment of risk posed was one of professional evaluative judgment made on all the evidence available. Moreover it was a decision which had to be made promptly. Reliance was placed on the assertion by Dr Murray in his first witness statement that the process of transfer is an administrative one which relies on prompt assessment by experienced professionals of the necessary level of security which a patient needs in “real time”.

Fairness almost always requires the person likely to be adversely affected by the decision to be afforded an opportunity to make representations to the decision maker. He placed reliance on the Category A cases. Where a decision is made as to a prisoner’s Category A status, reports are provided to the prisoner in advance and the prisoner or his representative is always able to make representations in writing and, where fairness requires, orally. By contrast the procedure laid down by the Broadmoor admissions policy provides a detailed procedure including a hearing and an appeal process neither of which is open to the patient. He is completely excluded from participating in the decision making process whether by making written representations or by attendance at the hearing of the Panel either himself or by a representative. That general practice Mr Squires submitted is a breach of the common law duty of fairness. </p>

Having been told on 15 September 2010 that the Claimant  had been accepted for admission to Broadmoor Ms Jolly put the Defendant on notice that the Claimant did not wish to be transferred to high security conditions and did not believe that he met the criteria for admission to high security conditions. She expressed concerns that the Panel might not have had up to date and accurate information or the relevant thoughts and observations of the Claimant. On a cursory review of the background information produced by his current placement she expressed concerns about the accuracy and detail of the information before the Panel. She therefore asked for an opportunity to assist the Claimant in the submission of representations to the Panel, access to the documents before the Panel, a review of the referral by a freshly constituted Admissions Panel based on the Claimant’s representations and a stay of transfer pending a further review. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Hyam submitted that Mr Squires’ analogy with Category A cases was misplaced. Neither the statutory nor the factual context of the decision to transfer the Claimant gave rise to a need for representations by the Claimant or attendance at an oral hearing. The basis on which a patient is detained under the 1983 Act is different from that on which a prisoner is detained. Unlike a Category A prisoner with no prospect of parole, a patient must be released if the criteria for his detention are no longer satisfied. A patient who no longer suffers from a mental disorder but nonetheless remains dangerous must be released. A decision whether to transfer a patient from medium to high security does not directly affect the Claimant’s lack of liberty which is <span style="font-style:italic">ex hypothesi</span> justified by the fact of his suffering from a mental disorder, whether the transfer is authorised or not. Although it was accepted that release from a high security hospital directly into the community is rare it was not the case that there is a relationship between the length of a patient’s detention and the level of security in which he is detained.</p>

Unlike the position with Category A prisoners, Broadmoor has no power to mandate a transfer. It did not exercise the power of categorisation. It was merely exercising an administrative clinical health care function as an adjunct to the request for a transfer from the referring hospital. Broadmoor neither determined the Claimant’s right by its decision nor even authorised his transfer. The criteria for admission were decided by the hospital pursuant to general powers. As to the assessment of risk, although that involved assessing the factual evidence it was essentially a clinical evaluation - see for example Dr Sengupta’s description of the Claimant on examination as coming across as slightly superficial and mildly cold and detached and his reference to the Claimant having described the incidents of violence in a matter of fact way with little emotion attached to it.</p>

He relied on the statement in the Broadmoor admission criteria that “it is an unacceptable infringement of a patient’s rights to detain them in a higher level of security than they require.” The purpose of transferring the Claimant to Broadmoor was precisely to subject him to a more restrictive regime, as acknowledged by Dr Vandenabalee in his witness statement: “It is true that within conditions of high security [the Claimant] would be subjected to a more restrictive regime. This is, however, the very reason why he was referred there…”. If the level of restriction of a high security regime was not, in fact, necessary in the Claimant’s case he will have been “adversely affected by that decision” to transfer him, a consequence which means that fairness would generally require his being given the opportunity to make representations (see <span style="font-style:italic">Doody v SSHD</span> [1994] [1 AC 531, 560 referred to in <span style="font-style:italic">R v Home Secretary ex parte Duggan</span> [1994] [3 All ER 277, 284]. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As to the statutory scheme, the fact that Broadmoor was not able to mandate the Claimant’s transfer and that ultimately it was Stockton Hall that had the power to transfer him did not mean that the power conferred on the Defendant to determine whether to admit a patient need not be exercised in a manner fair in all the circumstances. To exclude the obligation to act fairly would require clear statutory language. The Defendant accepted that in determining whether to admit a patient it was exercising public functions and must act properly as a public body. That submitted Mr Squires includes acting fairly. In any event the reality is that the effective decision as to whether the Claimant should be transferred lay not with Stockton Hall but with Broadmoor. If it decides that a patient is not suitable as occurred in December 2008 he will not be admitted. It is thus critical that Broadmoor should exercise its powers to admit fairly if the process as a whole is to be a fair one. </p>

When Dr Sengupta’s report was finally provided to Ms Jolly on 20 September 2010 she was able to make detailed representations and ask for the matter to be reconsidered two days later. That was more than two weeks before the Claimant was transferred. There was thus no practical difficulty as a matter of timing in involving the Claimant and his solicitors in the decision making process and considering their representations. </p>

In any event they did not cure the illegality. It is likely that persuading hospital staff immediately after a patient has been transferred that a mistake has been made to admit him will be more difficult than persuading the Admissions Panel, which rejects approximately half the referrals it receives on first application, not to admit him in the first place. Unless there is some overwhelming urgency fairness requires considering representations before rather than after transfer. As to an application to the Mental Health review Tribunal, it only had power to recommend a transfer not to authorise it.</p>

The Court of Appeal was considering a transfer pursuant to section 123 of the 1983 Act rather than, as in this case, pursuant to section 19 of the Act. I agree with Mr Hyam that there is in principle an analogy between the potentially adverse consequences in terms of greater restrictions in a high security regime following a transfer from medium security on the one hand and the possibility in some cases of adverse consequences in terms of greater difficulties in arranging family visits flowing from any transfer between hospitals including between high security hospitals on the other. However the latter do not involve greater restrictions on the patient and a transfer between high security hospitals such as that considered in <span style="font-style:italic">ex parte Pickering</span> does not involve a potential delay in ultimate release from detention such as is relied on by the Claimant in this case as giving rise to a duty to act fairly. Moreover even the potentially adverse consequence of restricted family visiting was not raised in <span style="font-style:italic">ex parte Pickering</span> so far as appears from the digest report.

Although his remarks were obiter, since he found that there was no unfairness, in my judgement they provide some limited support for the proposition that even in a transfer between two high security hospitals and even where Article 8 is not engaged, there is a common law duty to act fairly. A question arose as to whether it would be more difficult for the Claimant’s mother to visit him in Broadmoor than in Rampton and Sullivan J held that it could not sensibly be said that the difficulties of travelling from London to Broadmoor are so great as to conceivably engage any Article of the European Convention on Human Rights.

My Lords, I think it unnecessary to refer by name or to quote from, any of the often-cited authorities in which the courts have explained what is essentially an intuitive judgment. They are far too well known. From them, I derive that (1) where an Act of Parliament confers an administrative power there is a presumption that it will be exercised in a manner which is fair in all the circumstances. (2) The standards of fairness are not immutable. They may change with the passage of time, both in general and in their application to decisions of a particular type. (3) The principles of fairness are not to be applied by rote identically in every situation. What fairness demands is dependent on the context of the decision, and this is to be taken into account in all its aspects. (4) An essential feature of the context is the statute which creates the discretion, as regards both its language and the shape of the legal and administrative system within which the decision is taken. (5) Fairness will very often require that a person who may be adversely affected by the decision will have an opportunity to make representations on his own behalf either before the decision is taken with a view to producing a favourable result; or after it is taken, with a view to procuring its modification; or both. (6) Since the person affected usually cannot make worthwhile representations without <span style="font-style:italic">knowing</span> what factors may weigh against his interests fairness will very often require that he is informed of<span style="font-size:10pt"> </span>the gist of the case which he has to answer.”</p>

Whether such a duty exists, how far it goes and how it should be performed depends so entirely on the circumstances of the individual case that I prefer not to reason from any general proposition on the subject. Rather I would simply ask whether a life prisoner whose future depends vitally on the decision of the Home Secretary as to the penal element and who has a right to make representations upon it should know what factors the Home Secretary will take into account.

The giving of reasons may be inconvenient, but I can see no ground at all why it should be against public interest: indeed rather the reverse. This being so, I would ask simply: is refusal to give reasons fair? I would answer without hesitation that it is not. As soon as the jury returns its verdicts the offender knows that he will be locked up for a very long time. For just how long immediately becomes the most important thing in the prisoner’s life. …Where a defendant is convicted of, say, several armed robberies he knows that he faces a stiff sentence: he can be advised by reference to a public tariff of the range of sentences he must expect; he hears counsel address the judge on the relationship between his offences and the tariff; he will often hear the judge give an indication during the exchanges with  counsel how his mind is working; and when sentence is pronounced he will always be told the reasons for it. So also when a discretionary life sentence is imposed, coupled with an order under section 34. Contrast this with the position of the prisoner sentenced for murder. He never sees the Home Secretary; he has no dialogue with him; he cannot fathom how his mind is working. There is no true tariff, or at least no tariff exposed to public view which might give the prisoner an idea of what to expect. The announcement of his first review date arrives out of thin air, wholly without an explanation. A distant oracle has spoken, and that is that. … I therefore simply ask, is it fair that the mandatory life prisoner should be wholly deprived of the information which all other prisoners receive as a matter of course. I am clearly of the opinion that it is not.” [564F -565F].”</p>

There are, of course, the distinctions, procedurally and otherwise, to which Mr Richards drew attention. But both decisions, as it seems to me, bear directly upon a prisoner’s prospects of release. In this respect prisoners in Category A are in a different  position from prisoners in Category B, C or D. It is wholly improbable that the Parole Board would recommend the release of a Category A prisoner. Indeed, Mr Richards accepted that there is no known incidence of this occurring, although there have been three incidents of the Parole Board inviting a reconsideration of the categorisation of a Category A prisoner who had applied for parole. In any event it is inconceivable that the Secretary of State would sanction the release of a Category A prisoner, even if the Parole Board had so recommended.</p>

In the passage in Lord Oliver’s speech in <span style="font-style:italic">Leech</span> immediately before that cited by Rose LJ, Lord Oliver rejected the submission that decisions of prison governors were not subject to judicial review because they were part of a self contained administrative system into which the court should not trespass.

The two obvious impacts on a prisoner of being placed in Category A are the increased stringency of the conditions to which they become subject while placed in Category A and (save in the very rare case of whole life tariff prisoners) the likely delay in their ultimate release. These are of course the two adverse consequences prayed in aid by the Claimant in this case as likely to flow from a decision to transfer him from  a medium to a high security hospital. </p>

By contrast Jowitt J concluded that there was no evidence that a Category D prisoner had a better chance of being granted parole than a Category C prisoner and that whilst that fact might have some influence on the decision it was unlikely to be significant and certainly nowhere near as significant as was the position in relation to category A categorisation.

First in holding that the attempt to characterise the decision as merely an internal prison management decision missed the point,  he appeared to hold that even though the decision as to which definition of risk a prisoner should be allocated is not governed by statute, it still attracts a common law duty to act fairly.  Indeed that holding was part of the <span style="font-style:italic">ratio decidendi</span> of his decision given that it involved rejecting the Defendant’s submission that because the ERC decision was not governed by statute it was not open to challenge for unfairness. Second he appears to have based his decision not only on the effect of the prisoner’s prospects for parole but also on the more stringent conditions to which he is subject while detained with a high risk allocation.  In that he drew support from Blake J’s conclusion that the position of a convicted prisoner was different from that of a prisoner on remand in part because of the effect a higher exceptional escape risk assessment had on a prisoner’s circumstances while in prison.  </p>

He stated that although what was regarded as the minimum required to achieve fairness in <span style="font-style:italic">ex parte Duggan</span> was focussed by the direct impact such decisions had on the liberty of the subject it did not follow that the common law duty of fairness has no application in any prison related issue that does not engage liberty in the same stark way.

Finally his brief remarks on Article 8 are of interest in the present context in that he did not base his general conclusions as to the circumstances in which the common law duty of fairness is engaged on the presence or absence of a legal right affected by the impugned decision.</p>

In many cases the decision together with reasons for it (if given in the sort of detail he mentioned) would be sufficient to show that a request for reconsideration would be pointless. And thus it would not be appropriate to require that in every case the Defendant or his staff should have to review all the material considered in order to decide whether Section 29 (1) applies to it or not. In his judgment the need for such an exercise could only arguably arise if a request is made for such material after a reasoned ERC decision has been delivered to the prisoner concerned. The need to consider whether  fairness required such an exercise to be undertaken did not arise in that case and he preferred to express no concluded view which he considered should await  a case with appropriate facts.

Further and more fundamentally given his view that fairness requires in the first instance only a decision supported by reasons in sufficient detail to enable the prisoner concerned to decide whether a worthwhile challenge to the decision can be made, it would in his opinion have been wrong to quash the decision itself because to do so might result in the occurrence of the very problem that the ERC process is designed to eliminate.

However Taylor LJ stated that there had never been any issue in that case as to the application of those principles because they were written into Rule 49. No such provisions were laid down in relation to Rule 43. On the contrary the specific inclusion of natural justice requirements in Rule 49 and their absence from Rule 43 afforded powerful support to the respondent’s case:</p>

Although the consequences of Rule 43 are in some respects akin to those imposed as punishment, the object of the rule is not punitive. Indeed, where it is invoked at the prisoner’s request it is specifically aimed at protecting him from illegal punishment at the hands of fellow prisoners. So, in the context of Rule 43, <span style="font-weight:bold">although the governor and the regional director must act fairly and make reasoned decisions</span>, the principles of natural justice are not invoked in the rules. Instead, alternative safeguards are provided to protect the prisoner’s rights. Segregation can only exceed 24 hours by authority from the Secretary of State of the Board of visitors: Rule 43 (2). By Rule 43 (3) the governor may in his discretion terminate the segregation at any time. The prisoner has the right to see the governor and member of the board of visitors: Rule 8. The latter is required to hear any complaint or request the prisoner wishes to make: Rule 95 (1). The prisoner may petition the Secretary of State: Rule 7 (1).” [110 F – H].

In distinguishing a decision to contrary effect of the Supreme Court of Canada Taylor LJ emphasised the same two reasons, namely the lack of indication in the Canadian report that the regulations provided, as did the English Prison Rules, a right to be heard in other contexts and the existence of other opportunities for prisoners to air their views and complaints.

In the former case a prisoner has no voice in the decision which is to be taken. When a man is transferred to a segregation unit he is not able to make any representations. In paragraph 166 of the Radzinowicz Report – (by a sub committee of the Advisory Council on the Penal System 1968) it is said that before transferring a prisoner to a segregation unit it is not necessary for them to have been guilty of an offence and it therefore follows that there is no right to be heard or to make any representation against the decision. … In all the circumstances of the case I do not consider that the principles of natural justice required that the plaintiff should have been given notice of what was intended and the opportunity to make representations that he should not be transferred to the unit. Such a step is not within the contemplation of the Prison Act 1952 or the Prison Rules and would be damaging to the exercise of the administrative power under Rule 43.” [111 E – G].</p>

It is also apparent from his conclusion that apart from the urgency of decisions under Rule 43 there might well be other public policy grounds for not giving reasons in advance to the prisoner so as to enable him to make representations. Giving reasons would often require unwise disclosure of information which could reveal to prisoners the extent of the governor’s knowledge about their activities. It could also reveal the source of such information, thereby putting informants at risks and could cause an immediate escalation of trouble. [109 H -110 A].

In that case the Parole Board accepted that it had a public law duty to act in a procedurally fair manner when resolving challenges to licence revocations. Lord Bingham of Cornhill posed the question what fairness in that context required. He said that Lord Mustill in <span style="font-style:italic">Ex parte Doody</span> made plain that the requirements of fairness change over time, are flexible and are closely conditioned by the legal and administrative context. Although Lord Mustill did not suggest that an oral hearing was called for in that case, Lord Bingham pointed out that the procedure in that case had since been superseded and was in any event very different from that with which he was concerned. Where licensed revocations were challenged by mandatory and discretionary life sentence prisoners and Her Majesty’s Pleasure detainees the Parole Board now routinely held oral hearings. Lord Mustill’s guidance therefore had to be followed in a different legal and factual environment. [Paragraphs 27].</p>

The second hand presentation to the decision maker by the caseworker has its own deficiencies; since the caseworker usually gathers the facts upon which the charge of ineligibility rests, the presentation of the recipient's side of the controversy cannot safely be left to him. Therefore a recipient must be allowed to state his position orally.

But I do not think the duty is as constricted as has hitherto been held and assumed. Even if important facts are not in dispute, they may be open to explanation or mitigation, or may lose some of their significance in the light of other new facts. While the board's task certainly is to assess risk, it may well be greatly assisted in discharging it (one way or the other) by exposure to the prisoner or the questioning of those who have dealt with him. It may often be very difficult to address effective representations without knowing the points which are troubling the decision-maker. The prisoner should have the benefit of a procedure which fairly reflects, on the facts of his particular case, the importance of what is at stake for him, as for society.” [Paragraph 35].</p>

He held that in the context of the case the consequences of the categorisation decision were sufficiently important that they required a standard of procedural fairness whereby the claimant was able to put his case at an oral hearing.  The principle of procedural fairness required a focus on the context of the case, taking into account the nature of the decision and its consequences and the interests at stake.  </p>

The first two, namely that the claimant was a category A prisoner and that his tariff had expired, were significant because their combination meant that delay in moving from category A conditions was highly likely to delay his eventual release and his liberty was thus obviously affected.  Since the consequences of an adverse category A decision were so serious, those two factors pointed in the direction of a particularly high standard of procedural fairness.  Third, the inconsistency between the approach of the local prison, which had twice recommended that the claimant should be recategorised, and that of the Director of High Security Prisons supported the case for an oral hearing to explore it in greater depth.  At the end of the day there might be no inconsistency but simply a difference of opinion and for very good reasons, but it was as well that the matter be explored at an oral hearing.  Fourth, the approach of the Category A Review Team might well benefit from the closer examination which an oral hearing could provide since the local prison’s views on risk and its management were matters which might be better tested by way of an oral hearing.  Finally, an oral hearing might better explore the special factors appertaining to the claimant’s location in the Protected Witness Unit which bore on various factors such as risk.

It was also his practice since 1987 to obtain advice in respect of transfer or the grant of leave from the Mental Health Review Tribunal. Whilst Section 72 (3) of the 1983 Act provides for the Tribunal to make recommendations as to the transfer and grant of leave in the case of unrestricted patients, no provision is made for such recommendations in the case of restricted patients. However the Secretary of State announced in 1987 that if, in the course of its decision on an application to discharge a restriction order, the Tribunal made a recommendation as to a transfer or a grant of leave, and the restricted patient’s responsible medical officer made a proposal based on that recommendation, he would take full account of the Tribunal’s views. </p>

But it is to be remembered that what is sufficient to constitute the gist for one purpose may not be sufficient for another. When a fundamental right is in issue, a more expansive and informative summary may be called for. The detail required must depend on what (having regard to the importance of the issue at stake and of the contents of the documents in question on that issue) fairness requires to enable the making of meaningful and focused representations. The Secretary of State must consider in each case whether a full and fair understanding of the gist of the report can be conveyed without production of the report itself and whether good administrative practice may also call for its production. Good administrative practice may call for the production of the document where this is necessary to avoid the risk of a legitimate sense of concern or grievance and there is no countervailing consideration of any weight and no legitimate reason for wishing to withhold it.” [1748 B – D].</p>

Thus Lightman J looked beyond the fact that the Board had no statutory power to decide whether the patient should be transferred to the reality of the key role which the Board played in the decision making process rather than just the form. Although the Secretary of State’s policy of referring difficult cases to the Board included cases raising questions of discharge, the decision in issue in that case was a decision whether to order the transfer of the applicant from Broadmoor to a medium security hospital or to grant him leave for a trial period to such a hospital. He thus regarded such a decision as one which has a direct impact on the liberty of the patient. That was no doubt because of his conclusion that “the applicant’s transfer to conditions of lesser security is a vital stage of his treatment and rehabilitation and affects his future prospects of discharge.” … and that “the importance of a period of trial leave or transfer to [a medium security hospital] has as great impact upon patients’ eventual prospects of discharge as a prisoner’s categorisation as Category A or B.” [1742 D –E].</p>

To the contrary Lord Mustill’s first general principle in <span style="font-style:italic">ex parte Doody</span> that “where an Act of Parliament confers an administrative power there is a presumption that it will be exercised in a manner which is fair in all the circumstances” suggests that, at least where a decision is made pursuant to an administrative power conferred by statute, it is not so confined.

Although that is in terms addressed to the question of what the duty of fairness requires rather than whether it exists in any given case, it is in my judgment significant that the principle is couched in terms not of whether a decision may interfere with a pre-existing legal right but rather of whether it may adversely affect a person.

Although he described the general common law principle as imposing a duty of procedural fairness when a public authority makes a decision not of legislative nature affecting “the rights, privileges and interests of an individual”, the reference to the status of a person affected and to the privileges and interest of an individual suggests that the affecting of something falling short of a pre-existing legal right is sufficient to engage the common law duty of fairness.</p>

Although as discussed above Rose LJ referred to a direct impact the connection between the decision and the continuing detention of the prisoner was in fact not immediate, unlike the Home Secretary’s determination of the penal tariff in <span style="font-style:italic">ex parte Doody</span>. A prisoner who is categorised B does not thereby secure his release from prison. The connecting factor between the decision and the prisoner’s liberty is the fact recognised by the court that in reality a decision that a prisoner should become or remain Category A will delay the date of his ultimate release from prison because it is in practice inconceivable that the Secretary of State would sanction the release of a Category A prisoner.</p>

Indeed he echoed that statement by expressing the view that, even though the full panoply of the rules of natural justice did not apply to the power to segregate a prisoner under  Rule 43 as they did to disciplinary proceedings under Rule 49, whose object was punitive, the governor and regional director had to act fairly.(110F)</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Second, it is of course the case that in <span style="font-style:italic">ex parte Hague</span> the Court of Appeal held that the rules of natural justice did not apply to the exercise of the powers under Rule 43 and that there was no duty to afford a prisoner an opportunity to make representations before a decision was reached or to inform him afterwards as to the reasons for the decision. However that was a holding as to the limits of what the duty to act fairly required in the particular circumstances of a decision under Rule 43 and not a holding that the decision did not engage any duty to act fairly. Moreover that secondary question as to what are the requirements of the duty to act fairly was held by Lord Denning M.R. in the passage of his judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Payne v Lord Harris</span> approved by Taylor LJ to depend in each case on its own circumstances (page 757). That fundamental proposition was of course also a central part of Lord Mustill’s subsequent formulation <span style="font-style:italic">in ex parte Doody</span>: “(4) The principles of fairness are not to be applied by rote identically in each situation. What fairness demands is dependent on the context of the decision and this is to be taken into account in all its aspects.”</p>

The inference is that if there are no adequate alternative safeguards that may be a factor arguing in favour of a particular duty in a particular case. Nor is it apparent that there are in the present context, as there were <span style="font-style:italic">in ex part Hague</span>, other provisions which expressly provide for rights to be heard or informed from which an inference could be drawn that it was intended that no such rights should be afforded, to a patient whose transfer is being decided even if, which as I have indicated must be open to doubt, such an inference could now properly be drawn in the light of the speeches of Lord Mustill in <span style="font-style:italic">ex parte Doody</span> and Lord Bingham in the House of Lords in <span style="font-style:italic">West.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There are in my judgment striking similarities between the issues raised in this case and those decided in favour of the applicant by Lightman J in <span style="font-style:italic">Ex parte Harry</span>. Although that case concerned a decision whether to transfer a patient from a high security hospital to a medium security hospital rather than the other way around (and the patient was detained pursuant to a restriction order), it is plain that the factor which most influenced Lightman J was his view that the decision making process had what he described as a direct impact on the liberty of the patient. In fact the impact of a transfer from Broadmoor to a medium security hospital on the patient’s liberty is indirect. The patient once transferred remains subject to detention, the criteria for detention being different from the criteria for detention in high security. The impact on his liberty arises from the fact, as Lightman J found it and as I find it to be, that transfer to conditions of lesser security is a vital stage of the patient’s treatment and rehabilitation and affects his future prospects of discharge. Lightman J held that a decision as to a period of trial leave or a transfer to a medium security hospital has as great an impact upon a patient’s eventual prospects of discharge as a prisoner’s categorisation as category A or B. It was that analogy which led him to conclude that the common law duty of fairness held to exist by Rose LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Ex parte Duggan </span>in the context of a Category A decision applies to a decision whether to transfer a restricted patient from high to medium security.  There is nothing in the evidence to which I have referred which suggests that Lightman J’s holding as to the impact of such a decision on a patient’s eventual prospects of discharge is no longer accurate.</p>

Nonetheless in my judgment it would be surprising if for that reason alone the common law duty of fairness which has been held to apply to the former decision were not to apply to the latter decision. The impact on the prisoner’s liberty in <span style="font-style:italic">ex parte Doody </span>of the length of minimum sentence imposed was more direct than the impact on the prisoner’s liberty in <span style="font-style:italic">ex parte Duggan</span> of the categorisation as A or B.

Thus although the power to consent to an order transferring a restricted patient to a medium security hospital or granting him leave was conferred on the Secretary of State by statute in the form of Section 41 of the 1983 Act, the common law duty of  fairness was held to apply  at the earlier stage of the supply of material to and the deliberations and conclusions of the Board as well as to the supply of material to and decision of the Secretary of State. No distinction was made as regards the requirements of the duty of fairness as between the procedures adopted by respectively the Board and the Secretary of State by reason of the fact that it was only the Secretary of State whose decision whether to consent to a transfer to medium security was made in the exercise of the statutory power conferred by Section 41 of the 1983 Act.</p>

It was no bar to the application to the report prepared for that Board and any new information before it on a relevant point of a common law duty of fairness to make at least its gist available to the patient that the Board’s conclusions did not constitute the formal exercise of the statutory power to transfer or consent thereto. Nor was that a bar to a requirement to allow the patient an opportunity to make written representations to the Board in response to such material before the Board reached a conclusion on it advice to the Secretary of State and to give a copy of that advice to the patient.</p>

In both cases the statutory power to authorise or consent to transfer was conferred on a different person (the referring hospital in this case, the Secretary of State in that case). The reality in both cases however was that the role of the Board and the Admissions Panel was central to the decision as to how the statutory power should be exercised. Indeed the decision of the Admissions Panel was more important than that of the Board, which was limited to an advisory capacity, whereas the decision of the Admissions Panel to admit the Claimant constituted the de facto decision that he should be transferred from the referring hospital, which in reality had no further substantive decision to make once it was informed of the decision of the Admissions Panel to approve its request to agree to admit the Claimant. </p>

On both occasions it was Stockton Hall which asked for the Claimant to be admitted to Broadmoor and Broadmoor which made the decision whether he should be admitted. On both occasions it was that decision which in effect determined the decision whether the Claimant should be transferred from a medium security hospital to a high security one.  Whatever view Stockton Hall took as to the desirability of a transfer it was powerless to implement it without the consent of Broadmoor, not least because under Regulation 7 of the Mental Health (Hospital, Guardianship and Treatment (England) Regulations 2008 its power to authorise his transfer was conditional upon it being satisfied that arrangements had been made for the admission of the Claimant to Broadmoor within a period of 28 days beginning with the date of the authority for transfer<span class="legdslegrhslegp3text" style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt">.</span></p>

Paragraph 8.4 states that unless new information is subsequently provided the decision of the Appeals Panel will be final and Broadmoor expects medium secure units to abide by the decision of the Appeals Panel.</p>

Let it be further supposed that it were held that the procedure adopted by the high security hospital for considering the request from the medium security hospital to admit the patient was materially unfair. Would it be an answer to a claim by the patient that (a) the decision taken by the high security hospital, although unfair, was not amenable to challenge because it was not taken pursuant to a statutory power to transfer and (b) the decision taken by the medium security hospital to authorise the transfer was not challengeable because, although taken pursuant to a statutory power, it was not procedurally unfair and was not infected by the unfairness of the procedure adopted by the high security hospital?

There is in addition the fact that the Broadmoor Admissions Panel in considering whether to accept the Claimant for admission was a public body exercising a public function which, as the Defendant accepted, it had to discharge properly and moreover was doing so pursuant to the Defendant’s broad statutory powers to provide high security psychiatric services under paragraph 3(2)(b) of the West London Mental Health National Health Service Trust (Establishment) Order 2000, the Defendant having been established as a Trust under that Order pursuant to the power conferred on the Secretary of State by s 25 of the National Health Service Act 2007 to establish bodies called NHS Trusts to provide goods and services for the purposes of the health service</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Nonetheless it is undoubtedly a very important consideration that central to any consideration as to whether a patient should be transferred from medium to high security is an expert medical evaluation of the patient. The Broadmoor assessing consultant is required for example to include as part of his opinion and recommendations in the assessment report prepared for the Admissions Panel a psychiatric diagnosis. In that regard there is in my judgment a material distinction between a decision whether to transfer a patient to a high security hospital and for example a decision whether a prisoner should be classified as Category A or B or as a High or Exceptional Escape Risk rather than a Standard Escape Risk. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">On the other hand it is also the case that, in common with decisions as to which category or escape risk classification a prisoner should be allocated, central to a decision as to whether a patient should be transferred from medium to high security is an assessment of risk. Indeed the sole purpose of such a transfer is to protect others from the risk of harm. In the case of a patient such a risk, if it exists, is likely to (but may not necessarily) derive from or be associated with some aspect of his mental state and/or condition. It is for that reason that it involves expert medical evaluation. </p>

But part of it may. The extent to which, if at all, such an assessment is liable to play a significant part in the evaluation is likely to vary from case to case. There may be cases where the relevant facts are either not in dispute or incapable of being disputed in that they are a matter of public record. In such cases there may be little or no scope for any input beyond that of expert medical evaluation and clinical opinion.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Undoubtedly however there will be cases, perhaps many cases, where a risk assessment and a medical evaluation may be capable of being materially influenced by an assessment of inferences to be drawn from the factual history of the patient’s past. It will be remembered that the Broadmoor Admission Guidelines provide that before admission to Broadmoor can be contemplated, in addition to a mental disorder, among the behaviours one or more of which must be present are evidence of serious planned or unprovoked assaults on others, evidence of the planned use of weapons or attempts to make or conceal  weapons and evidence of other incidents. Indeed the only qualifying behaviour which is not based on evidence of specific conduct is evidence of aggressive feelings.  Thus there is often likely to be an important fact finding aspect to the process of risk assessment as well as medical evaluation. As a matter of common sense that is more often likely to arise in respect of the patient’s recent past because if more historic incidents or events were assessed as giving rise to a sufficient risk to justify a transfer to high security such a transfer would be likely to have taken place before. </p>

If true the allegation might well justify transfer to high security because the patient would constitute a serious risk of harm to others. But given that it is untrue, if the patient is transferred the adverse consequences in terms of restrictions and delay to ultimate release would serve no purpose and would be entirely unjustified.</p>

In both cases there is an obvious and important policy reason for making particular arrangements designed to protect the public or individuals from the risk of harm if allegations against a patient or prisoner are true, but not necessarily if they are not. The possibility of the risk is not, in my judgment, in law a sufficient reason for depriving the prisoner or the patient of the right to a fair procedure by which at an appropriate time the truth or otherwise of allegations may be properly tested or contextualised<span style="font-style:italic">, </span>or indeed, in my judgment, by which representations may be made as to the extent of any risk and the appropriate balance between any risk on the one hand and the interests of the prisoner  or the patient on the other.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The danger in such a case of adverse consequences to a patient which would be neither justified nor necessary for the protection of others from risk demonstrates why, as it seems to me,  there are strong arguments in favour of the proposition that the decision making process must be subject to a duty to act fairly. To adopt the language used in some of the authorities to which I have referred, in my judgment decisions to transfer a patient to a high security hospital from a medium security one and to admit him or her to a high security one have potentially adverse consequences for the patient. The decisions are likely to result in some materially more restrictive conditions (and may result in others) and to delay his or her ultimate discharge from detention under the 1983 Act. In the latter regard they may bear no less directly on the liberty of the patient than decisions to allocate Category A status. In the former regard they may have similar effects on the conditions of detention as decisions both as to Category A statues and to ERC. They may be as serious to the patient as the categorisation decisions are to the prisoner and liable to have a similar impact on him or her. They are made in the exercise of a public function which affects the liberty and to a degree the status of the subject. It is not without interest that Broadmoor’s own Admission Guidelines state that “it is an unacceptable infringement of a patient’s rights to detain them in a higher level of security than they require.”</p>

Those cases did not decide that decisions whether to confine a prisoner to cellular confinement do not attract a duty to act fairly. They decided that the requirements of fairness in that situation are in practice more limited than in decisions as to categorisation. In any event in my judgment they are distinguishable in that the effects of the potential adverse consequences for the prisoner are far more limited than in the case of transfer from a medium to a high security hospital and, as identified by Taylor LJ, there are other safeguards for the prisoner even without a right to be given reasons for the decision.</p>

What fairness demands is dependent on the context of the decision and this is to be taken into account in all its aspects. One example of that general principle is to be found in the very next proposition he laid down, namely that although fairness will very often require that a person who may be adversely affected by the decision will have an opportunity to make representations on his own behalf that may but need not always be before the decision is taken with a view to producing a favourable result.  It may in some contexts be confined to an opportunity to make representations after the decision is taken, with a view to procuring its modification.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">“Prison or YOI governors have the responsibility of maintaining good order and discipline in a complex and potentially combustible setting. They have to make urgent decisions about such matters as segregation based on their experience, expertise and judgment. They do so, not just in a binary mode as between themselves and an individual prisoner. They are acting in the interests of the security of the institution as a whole. Sometimes they may have to make a decision which has an immediate restricting effect on the whole or a large part of the institution-for example, the immediate “lockdown” of an entire wing on receipt of apparently credible information about a planned breakout. Such urgent matters are not susceptible to a judicialisation of the decision-making process. In the present cases it would be quite unrealistic to require the initial decision to segregate to be taken by “ an independent and impartial tribunal established  by law” – presumably an independent adjudicator akin to “additional days” procedure(see paragraph 3,above).The need for action is often immediate. The cases of Bourgass and Hussain are paradigm examples. It is true that when the SRB stage is reached, whilst initially the timeline is short, the urgency is less extreme. However it seems to me that the review is one best entrusted to those with the necessary experience and expertise as an exercise of collective, professional discretion, with built-in safeguards, albeit falling short of Article 6 standards. Amenability to judicial review is appropriate protection.”(paragraph 44).       </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Some but not all of the features identified by Maurice Kay LJ do or may apply in categorisation cases. Thus when considering whether a prisoner should be Category A or B or the level of escape risk classification the decision-makers may not be acting in the interests of other prisoners they are acting also in the interest of the protection of the general public who may be harmed in the event of an escape and arguably also of prison officers who may be injured in an attempted escape. It is also the case that the decision is taken by those with the necessary experience and expertise, albeit arguably not as an exercise of professional discretion. On first admission to prison there may often be an as yet un-assessed risk of escape. But those features do not prevent the decision making process in categorisation cases from engaging the common law duty of fairness. Nor do they prevent that duty from requiring the authorities to give the prisoner the gist of the relevant reports to enable him, after any initial security risk has passed, from challenging the decisions on subsequent reviews and doing so on a properly informed basis as to the grounds on which the decision has been taken. Indeed in an appropriate case the unedited report may be required to be made available (<span style="font-style:italic">Williams </span>and<span style="font-style:italic"> MacAvoy</span>).</p>

There was in this very case a need to effect an immediate lockdown of part of Stockton Hall in response to the incident which triggered the referral to Broadmoor. As it happens it appears that Stockton Hall was equipped and prepared to deal with the perceived security risks internally for some eight weeks pending the taking and implementation of the decision to transfer the Claimant to Broadmoor. Thus the immediate urgency of the need to respond to the security implications did not dictate the need for a decision to be taken at anything like the same urgency or the same speed as in some categorisation cases or indeed some segregation cases. Neither the urgency of the need to take an initial decision in some cases nor the appropriateness of the decision being taken by professional people with the necessary experience and expertise to assess not only the risk presented by a patient but whether no lesser degree of security will provide a reasonable safeguard to the public is in my judgment a reason why the decision making process should deprive the patient of any opportunity to challenge the decision.</p>

Where notice is given to the patient before the proposed transfer they have 12 weeks in which to appeal to the Tribunal and if the transfer has not yet taken place the lodging of the appeal acts as an automatic stay of the decision, subject to the discretion of the Tribunal to order the transfer if it is satisfied that the patient should be transferred pending appeal. Where notice is given to the patient on or after the transfer or no notice is given they have 12 weeks from the transfer to appeal. The Tribunal has power to order that the proposed transfer not take place or, as the case may be, that the patient be returned to the hospital from which the patient was transferred if it is not satisfied that the patient requires to be detained under conditions of special security or that such conditions can be provided only in a state hospital.</p>

In the present context what is in my view of interest is that it has been considered in Scotland that, whatever may be the policy considerations in favour of decisions to transfer being taken in the first instance by experienced professionals in all cases and urgently in some cases, they are not incompatible with or alternatively are outweighed by the need to give the patient an opportunity to challenge the decision either before or after it is. It is also significant that it is considered that even in cases of urgency it is not necessary to have an automatic practice of deferring the challenge until after the transfer, it being a matter for the Tribunal to decide if it should be deferred. This would seem to suggest that the problems associated with the need to effect an immediate or urgent transfer may be far from universal, a conclusion which does not strike me as inconsistent either with the timetable laid out in the Broadmoor Policy or with the chronology in this case.</p>

They suggest that the logistics of affording patients who wish to challenge medical assessments reached by expert psychiatrists are capable of being organised within a hospital without undue disruption or security concerns. Patients are given access to their medical records and are able to attend with solicitors to make representations and to articulate their concerns.</p>

How and when that opportunity should be provided and what it should involve may well depend on the individual circumstances and the presence (and if so strength or weakness) or absence of countervailing policy considerations and may thus vary from case to case.</p>

Indeed it was stamped with a statement that Dr Sengupta had no objection to his report being seen by, among others, the Claimant or his representative or other clinicians assessing the Claimant for transfer, presumably including any experts appointed on behalf of the Claimant to challenge the proposed transfer.</p>

In such cases there may be no significant adverse effect on the requirements of safety if, before the decision is finalised and/or implemented the patient is afforded one or more of the following opportunities: disclosure of (a) the reason why transfer is desired or considered necessary or at least the gist of it, (b) the referral letter or at least the gist of it, (c) the assessment report or at least the gist of it, (d) the documents placed or to be placed before the Admissions Panel or at least the gist of them, the ability to make written or oral representations as to fact and/or risk, the ability to give a factual account.</p>

The defendant might have to act quickly on intelligence provided at very short notice and in circumstances where it may have been supplied from second  or third hand sources in circumstances of great personal risk or where for other reasons confidentiality must be preserved. </p>

Indeed the very act of forewarning the prisoner may crystallise the risk that is apprehended. While such a situation could arise in the current context the facts of this case demonstrate in my judgment that that need not always be so. Stockton Hall was able to put in place temporary high security measures for the period pending the decision making process and the implementation of the decision to transfer, which lasted respectively 6 or so weeks and over 8 weeks.</p>

As to the former I have already made the point that there may be cases in which there is no conflict between the demands of ensuring safety and enabling a patient to make representations in advance of the decision being taken or at least implemented. The present case is in my view an example. As to the latter there is in my judgment some force in Mr Squires’ submission that in practice it may be more difficult to persuade people that a decision was wrongly taken and should be unscrambled than to persuade them not to take it in the first place.

The principal challenge sought to be made by Ms Jolly on behalf of the Claimant is based on the argument that the risk assessment was flawed by reason of a misstatement, incomplete statement and/or misinterpretation of the Claimant’s possession and hiding of weapons. I would add that the words in brackets  above which I have added to Blake J’s formulation in <span style="font-style:italic">Allen </span>reflect an important feature of the present context which is different from that of prisoner categorisation.

In many cases the decision together with reasons for it (if given in the sort of detail he mentioned) would be sufficient to show that a request for reconsideration would be pointless. Thus it would not be appropriate to require that in every case the defendant or his staff should have to review all the material considered in order to decide whether Section 29 (1) of the Data Protection Act applies to it or not. In his judgment the need for such an exercise could only arguably arise if a request is made for such material after a reasoned ERC decision has been delivered to the prisoner concerned.

In particular the patient was entitled to be told the gist of the report to the Advisory Board of the member who visited the hospital. There is in this latter point an obvious parallel with the report to the Broadmoor Admissions Panel of the consultant psychiatrist appointed by Broadmoor to assess the suitability of the patient who has been referred by the medium security hospital and also with the letter of referral from the medium security hospital.</p>

Good administrative practice might call for the production of the document where that was necessary to avoid the risk of a legitimate sense of concern or grievance and there was no countervailing consideration of any weight and no legitimate reason for wishing to withhold it.

It is  true that they were only sent after the decision was made (but long enough in advance of it being implemented to enable Ms Jolly to make detailed written representations making the principal factual challenge to the decision which is still relied on). But it does not appear that that was the result either of any concerns as to maintaining secrecy in the interests of security or of any urgency in the need to transfer the Claimant to Broadmoor. There may be some suggestion that the delay in sending documents was associated with the request by Broadmoor for a form to be signed authorising disclosure of the Claimant’s medical files and agreeing to pay copying charges. </p>

In considering that question it is in my view helpful to start with the approach which The House of Lords in<span style="font-style:italic"> West</span> held should be followed in the context of decisions to recall prisoners from licence and ask whether there are factors which would make it appropriate or inappropriate in the current context.

Equally there may be cases where there are issues of fact, where explanations are put forward to justify actions or where the assessment of the Broadmoor consultant or the referring consultant or both need  further probing. Even if important facts are not in dispute, they may be open to explanation or mitigation or may lose some of their significance in the light of other new facts. While the panel’s task certainly is  to assess risk, it might well be greatly assisted (one way or the other) by exposure to the patient or those who have dealt with him or her.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Are there distinguishing features which, despite these similarities, compel the conclusion that a different approach should be followed?  Clearly one important factor is that although the decision of the Admission Panel requires it to assess the degree of risk of harm posed by the patient part of that assessment does or may involve a clinical assessment or diagnosis of the patient’s mental state and/or illness. Dr Murray described it as a clinical decision taken by an experienced group of clinical staff who have long experience in assessing referrals and the Broadmoor Policy specifies that the assessing consultant must include a diagnosis in his report. In addition there may be, unlike retrospective decisions of the Parole Board which are taken after the prisoner has been recalled to prison from licence, urgent need for a transfer which would be incompatible with an oral hearing.</p>

That approach is sufficiently flexible to accommodate the urgent case where an oral hearing before the decision is made would be impractical or compromise safety and   the straightforward case where no useful purpose would be served by holding one. As to the fact that the decision involves an element of clinical assessment it does not follow for that reason  that the assessment may not depend on or be materially influenced by an account or assessment of facts which are disputed as untrue, inaccurate  misleading or exaggerated. Nor does it follow that the assessment might not be altered by exposure to the patient or the questioning of those who have dealt with him, although where there are no factual disputes that may be the exception rather than the rule. Even where the patient’s challenge is not to facts but to the clinical assessment and is supported by a conflicting expert report, it may be that exposure to the expert might alter the assessment. It is not without significance that the fact that the decision to continue to detain a patient under the 1983 Act involves an element of clinical assessment has not been considered incompatible with conferring on the patient the right to challenge it at a Tribunal with all the procedural rights associated with such a challenge.</p>

Again the inference was that the request had been turned down out of hand as a matter of automatic policy and not as a result of a consideration of the Claimant’s particular circumstances or the nature of his proposed challenge to the proposed transfer. Again this was confirmed by Dr Murray who said in his first witness statement that neither the assessing doctor nor the patient’s solicitor or family attends the meeting of the Panel. Nor was there any indication in response to Ms Jolly’s request for an oral hearing in her letter dated 22 September 2010 that the Defendant was prepared to consider whether such a hearing was or might be appropriate having regard to the issues raised by her on behalf of the Claimant.</p>

A screening system should be put in place which identifies those cases where the patient seeks to challenge the truth or accuracy of any allegations or findings which led to the referral, or seeks to  provide an explanation for them which was not taken into account or was disputed when the request for admission to the high security hospital  was made.

However, unlike the present context, the context under review in that case did not involve the need to take into account the need for some decisions to be taken urgently in the interests of protecting people from the risk of harm. In order to reflect that important consideration Lord Hope’s conclusion should in my judgment be adapted in the current context such that if it is considered necessary to resolve the issues to which I have referred it should be the norm rather than the exception that there should be an oral hearing before a final decision is made as to whether the patient meets the criteria for admission  to the high security hospital, and the hearing should take place before the patient is transferred unless that is incompatible with the need to protect persons from harm, in which case it should take place as soon as reasonably practicable after the patient has been transferred.</p>

If there is doubt whether the matter can fairly be dealt with on paper the high security hospital should be predisposed in favour of an oral hearing and in any event the patient and his or her representative should be told that an oral hearing may be possible although it is not automatic. If having been told this the patient clearly says that he or she does not want an oral hearing there need not be one unless the high security hospital itself feels exceptionally that fairness requires one. </p>

In any event the overall number of referrals to Broadmoor from medium security hospitals is itself on the evidence not enormous. Dr Murray stated that the overall number of referrals is about 100 a year, but that includes referrals from all sources, including persons held on remand awaiting trial, prisoners serving a prison sentence and patients presenting problems in less secure services which it is to be inferred are not confined to medium security hospitals. Moreover of those about 50 are not accepted on first application even without the availability of oral hearings. Dr Vandenabeele stated in his witness statement that transfers from medium security to high security are relatively rare occurrences. He estimated having undertaken such an activity on some half a dozen occasions in his professional career since 2006. As appears below Broadmoor already undertakes six monthly care programme (“CPA”) approach meeting at which the patient may make representations as to why high security care is no longer required.</p>

In my judgment neither of those facts constitutes a sufficiently robust alternative remedy to justify a conclusion that the initial decision to transfer the patient to a high security hospital does not engage a common law duty of fairness or that its requirements are of a lesser scope than I find them to be.</p>

They are incapable of preventing an initial decision to transfer the patient from being taken or implemented or resulting in it being cancelled or reversed. This is not just a technical or semantic difference. As described above neither the high security hospitals nor the Tribunal has the power to insist on or effect a transfer of a patient from a high security to medium security hospital and there are a number of obstacles which in practice may lead to significant delay in such a transfer being implemented even if it is recommended either by the high security hospital or the Tribunal.

The original referring hospital is no longer involved so that even a favourable decision would not lead to automatic return to the referring hospital. Moreover it would not guarantee transfer to a medium security hospital which if it happened might not happen for a very long time. In addition although the practice of hearing live evidence at hospital managers meetings is undoubtedly very important the fact that there is no obligation on the hospital to hold such meetings as soon as possible after the patient is transferred may reduce its effectiveness as a means for the patient to challenge factual findings or assumptions which led to the original decision to transfer.</p>

However in my judgment it was implicit in Ms Jolly’s letter dated 19 August 2010 that there might be such a challenge. Further it would be putting the cart before the horse to require the patient to identify facts which are challenged or in issue until he or she had been told the gist of the factual allegations and/or findings on the basis of which he or she has been referred and/or assessed.

In particular it was not suggested that such disclosure might result in harm to any of the patients or staff involved in the weapons incident or that the urgent need for a decision to admit the Claimant to Broadmoor to be taken and implemented was so great as to make it impractical to disclose that information in the time available. Indeed as to the former, it is striking that in due course Dr Murray was content to send Ms Jolly copies of both Dr Vandenabeele’s and Dr Sengupta’s reports without any editing or omissions and indeed to disclose all the material that was before the Admissions Panel with the exception of the witness statements in respect of the Claimant’s original offence.

Given the importance of the issues at stake for the Claimant, in my judgment that would not be a sufficiently good reason for such documents as the Defendant considered could properly be disclosed to the Claimant and Ms Jolly not having been disclosed prior to that date. Apart from anything else Ms Jolly had asked for disclosure on 19 August 2010 together with the Claimant’s letter of consent and if confirmation of liability for photocopying charges was the reason for delaying disclosure that should and could have been made clear long before 1 September 2010.

On a cursory review of background information produced by Stockton Hall she was concerned about the accuracy and detail of the information before the Panel and asked for an opportunity to assist the Claimant in the submission of representations to the Admission Panel. She repeated her request for access to documents, records and information before the Admissions Panel and asked for the referral to be reviewed both by the referrer and, based on representations from the Claimant, before a freshly constituted Admissions Panel or for such a review to be treated as an appeal under the Broadmoor Operational Policy. She also asked for a stay of the transfer until the review. If the case was too urgent for further review she asked for disclosure of the material before the Admissions Panel, the reasons for admitting the Claimant to Broadmoor and the reason for not staying the transfer. On 20 September 2010 she received Dr Sengupta’s report and the letter from Dr Das to Stockton Hall dated 15 September 2010 informing it of Broadmoor’s decision. That letter did not disclose the substantive reasons for the decision. In particular it made no reference to the reasons recorded in Dr Das’ file note dated 15 September 2010 which referred to the immediate reason for referral as the manufacturing of a dangerous weapon “with intent” to cause harm to others.</p>

In that letter she asserted that the Defendant had failed to take into account relevant considerations and that Dr Sengupta’s report contained factual inaccuracies which were challenged by the Claimant. It also drew attention to the failure of Dr Sengupta to consider considerable relevant information including the fact that the Claimant had voluntarily handed over the weapon which he made to staff and had told them where the other one was hidden which did not suggest an intention to use the weapon. Nor had there been reference to the fact that the Claimant made the weapon after trying to get help from the staff over several days to move either him or the other patient away from each other.

Accordingly it does not seem to me that there can be any valid criticism of the decision to proceed with the transfer in the week beginning 4 October 2010.

The factual allegations and findings in those three documents with which the Claimant and Ms Jolly took issue went to the heart of the reasons for the decision, the assessment of risk and of the unsuitability of Stockton Hall safely to manage it. They were of comparatively narrow compass and it was not ever suggested by the Defendant or Stockton Hall that revealing the contents of any of those documents constituted a security risk for any of the patients or staff concerned. In my judgement fairness required that the Claimant should have been given an opportunity to make written representations before the transfer was due to take effect on 6 Oct 2010. </p>

It is true that the areas of factual dispute and challenge were not identified by Ms Jolly until her letter dated 22 September 2010.

It is also in my judgment clear from the Defendant’s solicitors’ letter dated 24 September 2010 that it had no intention of giving or even considering giving the Claimant an opportunity to make written representations or to attend an oral hearing at any stage either before or after the Claimant was transferred. There was no suggestion that, but for the urgent security need to transfer the Claimant quickly after he became aware of the decision to transfer him, he would have been given an opportunity to make written representations or that consideration would have been given to allowing him or Ms Jolly to attend an oral hearing. </p>

Second he no longer sought to argue that his transfer was a breach of the substantive provisions of Article 8 in the sense that it was disproportionate. That was said in Mr Southey QC’s skeleton argument to be because it was accepted that that issue was now academic. It was not explained why it was considered to be academic and I infer the reason to be that the Claimant had by March 2012 indicated that he no longer challenged his transfer to Broadmoor and was not inviting the court to order the transfer and/or the decision to transfer him to be set aside and/or a new decision to be made. I infer that that was the reason rather than a recognition that Article 8 could not provide a springboard for his Article 6 claim because if there had been a breach of his Article 8 rights that would have constituted a free standing claim in its own right.</p>

He submitted that it held that a decision to allocate a prisoner to a special unit involved restrictions which were within the sphere of that prisoner’s personal rights and were therefore civil in nature. Reference was made to the European Prison Rules which provide that “[the] regime shall allow prisoners to spend as many hours a day outside their cells as are necessary for an adequate level of human and social interaction.” [48], [103]. Further restrictions that engaged Article 6 it was submitted include matters such as restrictions that make it difficult to maintain relationships (including with non-family members) and exclusion from outdoor exercise.

Further or alternatively aspects of the regime in high security such as the monitoring and withholding of incoming correspondence can only be imposed in high security. Rights regarding incoming correspondence are residual rights of patients that can only be lost in limited circumstances. As a consequence the decision regarding high security also determined other aspects of the Claimant’s rights under domestic law. It was accepted that the European Prison Rules are not directly enforceable.

Such a proceeding it was submitted does not “determine” civil rights. It is an administrative risk evaluation. In terms of its administrative nature it has some similarities with the categorisation of prisoners within the prison service – see <span style="font-style:italic">Brady v United Kingdom</span> and with the setting of licence conditions for a prisoner see <span style="font-style:italic">R(MA) v National Probation Service </span>[2011] EWHC 133 2 (Admin).

In <span style="font-style:italic">RB (Algeria)</span> the Claimants argued that Article 6 was engaged because a decision to deport them would infringe other Convention rights (para 174).

Their Lordships held that civil rights are not engaged even if a decision to deport has an “incidental” effect upon other Convention rights, for example Article 18 (paras 85 – 90, 169 – 179, 226 – 229).

Detainees lose their civil rights when they are transferred to high security hospital because a different legal regime applies in relation to matters such as correspondence and telephone calls. Therefore the transfer and any process to challenge it decisively determines civil rights and must comply with Article 6. In that regard the Claimant’s case was on all fours with <span style="font-style:italic">Stegarescu</span>. In that case the ECHR noted that high levels of surveillance, restrictions on family visits and monitoring of correspondence and telephone calls affected detainees’ civil rights so as to fall within Article 6. Unlike in <span style="font-style:italic">Enea</span> in which prisoners could appeal against the restrictions placed on them in detention (para 119) the applicants in <span style="font-style:italic">Stegarescu </span>complained that there was no appeal route allowing them to contest their placement in a special regime of security. The ECHR accepted that that was the case and that as a consequence there was a breach of Article 6(1) (paras 46 – 52). The same was true for the Claimant in the instant case. He has no means in an ECHR compliant (i.e. independent) process of challenging the decision to transfer him notwithstanding that the decision was directly determinative of his civil rights.</p>

A decision to transfer a patient like a decision on a prisoner’s security classification is in its nature administrative and unsuited to judicialisation.

They may also involve a delicate balancing of the particular patient’s interests against those of other patients and of staff.

Thus it was accepted that Lightman J’s observations in <span style="font-style:italic">ex parte</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">Harry</span> at page 1742 hold good. However it was submitted that this does not show that the decision to transfer will of itself lengthen the period during which the patient may expect to be detained. That was said to be for two reasons. First, as Dr Davies said in his witness statement, patients admitted to high security hospitals are those who, in the view of the relevant clinicians “present a grave and immediate danger and are high risk as a result of complex and enduring mental illness or personality disorder”. A patient who, in the view of the relevant authorities, answers to that description is unlikely to be discharged into the community, whether he is transferred to a high security hospital or not. Second if, contrary to what should happen, a patient no longer requires to be detained in a high security hospital but is not transferred to a lower securing setting because of delays in security a bed or disputes between detaining authorities or otherwise, then it is the failure to transfer him <span style="font-weight:bold">out</span> of a high security hospital – not the decision to transfer him <span style="font-weight:bold">into</span> it – which lengthens the likely total period of his detention. Patients can complain about such failures by judicial review proceedings. </p>

Thus it was submitted that the decision of the ECHR in <span style="font-style:italic">Stegarescu</span> that the absence of an appeal route allowing the applicants to contest their placement in a special regime of security which they argued restricted rights of a civil character constituted a breach of Article 6. (See paras 41 and 46-52). That was said to be the same as the challenge brought by the Claimant in this case who contends that there are deficiencies in the process because he has no appeal route in Article 6 compliant independent proceedings to challenge the decision to transfer him and that is so notwithstanding that the decision means that he has lost a number of civil rights. The decision to transfer him is no more of an administrative decision than the decision to place the applicants in <span style="font-style:italic">Stegarescu</span> in a special regime of security.

The discussion at paragraph 44 of Maurice Kay LJ’s judgment covering the administrative and discretionary nature of the decision-making process was designed to show that there was no dispute (<span style="font-style:italic">contestation</span>). Hence, the conclusion that “Article 6 was not engaged at the stages of the governor’s decision or the SRBs”, echoing the holding at paragraph 37 that there was “plainly … a dispute when an application for judicial review is commenced but I do not consider that there is one earlier than that”. </p>

The Claimant’s submission that the question whether there was a “dispute” is irrelevant in the present case because judicial review proceedings were commenced on 30 September 2010 was to misunderstand the significance of the reasoning in <span style="font-style:italic">King</span>. If the nature of the proceedings before the hospital managers is (like the nature of the proceedings before the governor in <span style="font-style:italic">King</span>) such that no dispute/<span style="font-style:italic">contestation</span> arises at that stage, the issuing of judicial proceedings does not somehow make Article 6 apply to those proceedings: rather Article 6 applies in the judicial review proceedings.

Neither is there an implied right of association amounting to a “civil right”. He held that the correct analysis is to see association with other prisoners as a normal privilege rather than a right and that it is subject to withdrawal in accordance with the Rules, particularly those permitting cellular confinement or segregation, which invest governors with discretionary powers. The exercise of those powers and the process of review by the Segregation Review Boards were amenable to judicial review which among other things would secure Convention rights such as those under Articles 3 and 8.

The reference to the decision to classify not being “a question of civil rights…”, which was the reason for the Commission’s conclusion, in my judgment shows that that conclusion was focusing not on the question whether the prisoner enjoyed a “civil right.” but rather on whether the categorisation decision was a determination of any such “civil right.”</p>

However although there was no explicit reference to autonomous civil rights as distinct from rights specifically protected by other Articles of the Convention, it would be surprising if the Commission had been of the view that the benefits did or might constitute civil rights in the sense contemplated by Article 6 given that it went on to consider whether they were protected by Article 3.</p>

Such units are run along the same lines as high security units.  Contact with prisoners in other units is prohibited and supervision is particularly tight.  Particularly stringent measures are put in place aimed at separating them from other prisoners and keeping them under supervision.

The “dispute” may relate not only to the actual existence of a right but also to its scope and the manner of its exercise, and the outcome of the proceedings must be directly decisive for the right in question, mere tenuous connections or remote consequences not being sufficient to bring Article 6(1) into play.

He said that the Court held at paragraph 64 that the purpose of the request was to promote the prisoner’s social rehabilitation which was “crucial to the protection of this right to lead a “private social life””.  He said that it was pertinent to observe that the Court noted at paragraph 57 that whilst the Convention institutions had traditionally taken the view that the manner of execution of custodial sentences did not fall within the scope of Article 6, “the case law has evolved in relation to proceedings concerning detention in prison”.</p>

No such right was conferred by the Prison Rules expressly nor could it be said to arise by implication. [30] [40].

That formulation appears to recognise that the so called “right” referred to is not an absolute right but rather one qualified by reference to an acknowledgement that a patient has no absolute right not to be detained in high security if that is “required”.

That conclusion is in my opinion implicit in the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Brady</span> that “in so far as the applicant is complaining of his classification as a Category A prisoner and the difference in treatment of those so classified the Commission considers that this is not a matter which falls within the scope of the rights and freedoms ensured by the Convention” (paragraph 1). That is despite the fact that it could be said that a prisoner has a right not to be allocated to a higher category than he or she requires. If classification as a Category A prisoner and the difference in treatment of those so classified is not a matter which falls within the scope of the rights and freedoms ensured by the Convention (including, it is to be inferred by Article 6) why should the classification of a detained patient as one who requires treatment in a high security hospital be such a matter?</p>

Moreover just as in <span style="font-style:italic">Enea</span> the prisoner had a right to appeal to an independent court against any decision to restrict his civil right not to have his calls monitored, so where a high security hospital decides to record or monitor a patient’s telephone calls the patient has a right to seek review of that decision before the CQC which is an independent regulator, with whose directions the hospital is required by Direction 34(9) to comply (although of course that is relevant not to the question of whether the decision to transfer constitutes a <span style="font-style:italic">contestation</span> of the patient’s right to unmonitored calls but rather to the question of whether, if it does, there are sufficient safeguards to prevent there being a violation of that right).</p>

If the likelihood of such serious adverse effect engages a common law duty of fairness why does is not also engage an Article 6 right? The technical answer is that that is the effect of the relevant authorities in these two areas. A broader answer may be found in the additional right conferred by Article 6 to a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law in the determination of civil rights that fall within the protection of Article 6. The common law duty of fairness may be engaged in a variety of circumstances in which there is no need as a matter of policy for access to an independent and impartial tribunal at a public hearings including because the decision does not determine a right recognised as a civil right within the meaning of Article 6.</p>

He thus appeared to accept that in that limited respect transfer to a high security hospital itself triggers restrictions on a right recognised as a “civil right” within the meaning of Article 6(1).

Thus in <span style="font-style:italic">Enea</span> the Grand Chamber appeared to identify two separate conditions precedent for a determination: the dispute must not only be directly decisive for the right in question, it must also <span style="font-weight:bold">relate</span> to its existence or to its scope and the manner of its exercise.

That appears to be the premise upon which the Commission based its decision: “The applicant has complained of his conditions of detention as a Category A prisoner, i.e. a prisoner who is subject to strict security measures. In so far as the applicant is complaining of his classification as a Category A prisoner and the differences in treatment of those so classified…” (paragraph 1, The Law).

Thus the key issue is likely to be risk to others. This is reflected in paragraph 4 of the Guidelines which states that the high security available within Broadmoor is necessary to detain patients who could not be safely contained within the security available at a medium secure unit. It is also reflected in the statement in paragraph 4 referred to earlier that in considering what constitutes the criteria for detention in conditions of high security one or more of specified behaviours in addition to a mental disorder must be present before admission to Broadmoor can be contemplated.

Notwithstanding that the complaint was not only about the fact of the applicant’s classification Category A prisoner but also about the difference in treatment of those so classified, the Commission held that Article 6(1) was not engaged because of the nature of the decision to classify a prisoner as Category A. The nature of the decision was not “a determination of such matters (i.e. his civil rights and obligations…), not being a question of civil rights or obligations…, but an administrative classification. In other words the decision was not resolving by way of determination a dispute or <span style="font-style:italic">contestation</span> about the applicant’s right not to lose civil rights to unsupervised visits and unvetted correspondence. It was rather an administrative classification, the nature of which I infer the Commission considered to be the exercise of a judgment as to whether the risk of harm to members of the public in the event of the applicant escaping was so great as to justify detaining him in conditions designed to make escape impossible.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">A decision by a prison governor or an SRB that a prisoner should be segregated and placed in cellular confinement is not a decision determining a dispute between the prisoner and the prison authorities as to the existence or ambit of any civil rights enjoyed by the prisoner. It is an administrative decision as to whether segregation is justified for one or more of a number of reasons having regard to the interests not only of the prisoner but of others in the prison. The fact that it will inevitably restrict the Claimant’s ability to associate with other prisoners does not mean that the decision is a decision about the existence and/or scope of the prisoner’s civil rights. By contrast a challenge to such a decision by the prisoner on the ground that it violates his Article 6 and/or Article 8 civil rights would constitute a dispute or <span style="font-style:italic">contestation</span> about the Claimant’s alleged civil rights. Compare Lord Hoffmann in <span style="font-style:italic">R B (Algeria)</span>: “ if the proceedings had been an action in tort for a breach or threatened breach of Article 3, then it would certainly be asserting a civil right and Article 6 would be engaged” (paragraph 178).</p>

I see the force of Mr Squires’s submission that there is a distinction between a decision whether to segregate a prisoner and a decision whether to transfer a patient to high security. The latter essentially involves a judgment as to whether the patient satisfies the admissions criteria at the high security hospital and represents a risk to others which cannot safely be managed except in a high security hospital. The former involves a consideration and in certain cases a balancing of a number of different potential competing considerations and is not confined to an assessment as to whether the prisoner can only safely be managed in cellular confinement.</p>

As I have already pointed out in my judgment there is considerable similarity between the nature of the decision in such a case and the decision as to whether a patient should be transferred. The reasons given by the Commission for its conclusion that categorisation decision are not determinations of disputes about civil rights was not that they involve the exercise of discretion but rather that they are not “a question of civil rights…”. By the same token the reason why Maurice Kay LJ held that the early Commission decisions on security categorisation (<span style="font-style:italic">X</span> and <span style="font-style:italic"> Brady</span>) tend to support his analysis was not that they classified such categorisation decisions as involving the exercise of discretion but rather that they classified them as “administrative” rather than as determinations of disputes about civil rights.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Southey submitted that in this case there has been a plain failure to comply with Article 6 for the following reasons. First, there was a failure to disclose relevant material that was relied on as part of the decision making process at a time when representations could have been made. There was a failure to ensure equality of arms. In contrast to the position of the relevant decision makers from Broadmoor there was almost a complete failure to involve the Claimant in the decision making process. Further the decision was taken by a body that lacks independence. That was not merely a formal lack of independence. There was also no guarantee that the decision making body would have had no prior involvement with a patient’s case. </p>

First judicial review could not remedy the lack of disclosure which denied the Claimant a meaningful opportunity to participate. Second as the primary issue was a simple issue of fact of a sort regularly considered by the criminal courts when sentencing, namely whether the recent behaviour of the Claimant justified a transfer to conditions of high security, judicial review could never ensure compliance with Article 6. Further even if judicial review could in principle ensure compliance with Article 6 there would be a need for adequate safeguards to ensure compliance – see <span style="font-style:italic">Wright</span>. Here there was an absence of such safeguards. In particular no arrangements were made for the Claimant to participate in the decision making process or to make representations. Thus the context is very different to that considered in <span style="font-style:italic">King.</span> There are none of the safeguards that are applied in the context of prison disciplinary proceedings. </p>

In that case Keith J concluded that Article 6 was not violated by the decision making process governing the process for imposing licence conditions on a person released from prison. He reached that conclusion for three reasons. First the issue to be determined was a limited one. It was not whether conditions should be imposed on the Claimant to prevent him contacting his wife. Rather it was what conditions should be imposed, which was said to be very much a question for the probation service. (para 36). Second there was little that could be said by the Claimant in that case. (para 38). As a result there was no need for him to be allowed to make representations before the conditions could be imposed. Third he could make representations seeking a variation of conditions after they had been imposed (para 37). Permission to appeal was refused in that case by Sullivan LJ who concluded that the prisoner had ample opportunity to make representations as to the effect of the conditions after they had been imposed ([2011] EWCA Civ 1667 at para 9). </p>

On such an application the Tribunal can, and often does, make extra statutory recommendations as to the necessary level of security; and third by way of judicial review.

Second an application to the Tribunal provides a means by which any potential for injustice may be cured because it has power in appropriate cases to make extra-statutory recommendations in favour of transfer to other hospitals, thus affording patients who consider they are inappropriately detained in conditions of high security the opportunity to make representations against such placements to an independent and impartial tribunal. Failure to abide by such a recommendation by a hospital without good reason would be capable of further challenge by way of judicial review. Third the decision on transfer was capable of being subject to review by a court of full jurisdiction and if necessary full merits judicial review if there was a real dispute as to fact which was crucial to the decision which could not be resolved without hearing oral evidence – see <span style="font-style:italic">R(Wilkinson) v Broadmoor</span> [2002] 1WLR 419. </p>

It was only considering whether the Claimant met the specific criteria for admission. It would have been plainly unlawful if the panel had sought to pursue any wider policy aim in admitting the Claimant.

He submitted that a system such as that in operation in Scotland in which a patient is able to challenge his detention before an independent body able to determine for itself whether the transfer is necessary, and not simply a review of the legality of the decision, is required to satisfy Article 6. </p>

Those defects it was submitted are not cured by the fact that the Defendant would be subject to judicial review if it failed to follow a Tribunal decision recommending a transfer back to medium security. In that event the Claimant would need to show that the failure by the Defendant to follow the Tribunal’s recommendation was irrational or otherwise unlawful. By definition there might be cases in which a patient might not be able to discharge that burden, whereas if the decision of the Tribunal was binding the Defendant would be bound to follow it.

(Para 26). As the court noted the judicial review was an unusual one as the claimant could have brought the claim by way of tort proceedings for assault in which his capacity to consent to treatment would need to be determined by the court. In those circumstances the court took the view that, notwithstanding that the claim was brought by way of judicial review, it would hear evidence and reach its own conclusion on the merits.

One would have thought that the opposite approach would be taken with the court according deference to the expert decision-makers who decided to admit the patient and that that was likely to be so even if the patient’s human rights are engaged.

There was a more directly relevant authority than <span style="font-style:italic">Van de Hurk</span>.

The Home Secretary pointed to the power of the English Mental Health Review Tribunal (the predecessor) of the First Tier Tribunal in this context to issue recommendations for discharge.

Exactly the same it was submitted is true of the decision whether to transfer a patient to a high security hospital from a medium security one.

The decision whether to transfer in this case was taken pursuant to regulation 7 of the 2008 Regulations made under Section 19 of the 1983 Act by the managers of the original detaining hospital not Broadmoor.

For example a decision may be taken to lock down the entire prison or a wing on receipt of apparently credible information about a planned breakout and such urgent matters are not susceptible to a judicialisation of the decision making process (ibid).  The wider policy aims that are taken into account in deciding whether to segregate a prisoner were explained by Maurice Kay LJ as including the impact of any behaviour on the wider dynamics of the prison (para 65).  On the case before the court the example was given of an improvement in the general atmosphere on a wing after a prisoner was segregated.

The Broadmoor admission guidelines provide that one or more of specified behaviours in addition to a mental disorder must be present before admission to Broadmoor can be contemplated.  It must then be decided that only high security conditions will provide the required level of security.  Prisoners can be confined to their cells in order to promote good order and discipline across the prison even if they have not done anything wrong or are not considered to pose a risk to others for example to protect them from harm by others or where a whole wing is locked down.  By contrast, patients cannot lawfully be transferred to a high security hospital en masse or individually to maintain order, to change the atmosphere on a wing or otherwise in the interests of the institution as a whole.

I agree that this conclusion follows from the decisions in <span style="font-style:italic">Van de Hurk </span>and more particularly<span style="font-style:italic"> X v UK</span>. As was said in <span style="font-style:italic">Van de Hurk</span> the power to give a binding decision is inherent in the very notion of a tribunal. I accept Mr Squires’ submission that the non-binding nature of a recommendation by the Tribunal that a patient should be transferred to a medium secure hospital is not cured by the fact that the Defendant would be subject to judicial review if it failed to follow it. By definition there might be cases in which a patient might not be able to discharge the burden of showing that it was irrational or otherwise unlawful of the Defendant not to follow the Tribunal’s recommendation, whereas if there were a right of appeal to a tribunal against the decision to transfer to Broadmoor the Defendant would be bound to obey an order upholding the appeal. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I would add that there is in my judgment a material difference between an appeal against a decision to transfer a patient to a high security hospital and a request to the managers and/or lead clinician in the high security hospital or an application to the Tribunal for a recommendation for a transfer back to a medium security hospital. As spelled out earlier in this judgment there are a variety of reasons why either of those routes  may take a considerable time, even if successful, to result in an actual transfer to a medium security hospital. Not least is the need to secure the consent of the relevant funding authority and medium security hospital. In addition where, as in this case, the challenge to the decision to transfer the patient to the high security hospital turns on or at least raises a factual dispute which may require investigation with witnesses in the original medium security hospital, there may be obvious practical difficulties in achieving a satisfactory resolution of such issues in the context of a fresh application for the patient to be transferred back to a medium security hospital, which may of course be a different one to the hospital from which the patient was transferred.  A fortiori if the statutory time limit on the number of applications which may be made to the Tribunal delay the ability of a transferred patient to seek an extra-statutory recommendation.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">By contrast in my view the question whether the right to apply for judicial review is sufficient to satisfy the procedural requirements of Article 6 is less straightforward. That is partly  because the decision making process in this context does not in my view fall neatly on either side of the dividing line suggested by the tests laid down by the  House of Lords in <span style="font-style:italic">R (Wright)</span> and the ECHR in <span style="font-style:italic">Tsfayo</span> approving the approach of the House of Lords in <span style="font-style:italic">Begum</span>.

In the latter the ECHR contrasted <span style="font-style:italic">Begum </span>in which the issues to be determined “required a measure of professional knowledge or experience and the exercise of administrative discretion pursuant to wider policy aims” with the instant case in which the HBRB was deciding a simple question of fact, namely whether there was “good cause” for the applicant’s delay in making a claim.

This is reflected in the composition of the Admissions Panel at Broadmoor which is comprised of a lead clinician/consultant psychiatrist, a service director for information, a deputy director of nursing or nurse consultant, a directorate lead psychologist, the head of the social work department and the directorate lead occupational therapist. (The Appeals Panel is comprised of a non-executive director of the Defendant, the clinical director of Broadmoor SDU, an independent MSU consultant and a representative of the NHS London strategic health authority.)</p>

Although the assessing doctor is not a member of the Admissions Panel and indeed does not attend its meetings, it is clear that part of his report, which forms the centrepiece of the material considered by the Admissions Panel, involves a professional and expert assessment of the patient’s current mental state.</p>

According to the Guidelines, if those criteria are satisfied the patient may only be admitted if no lesser degree of security than that available at Broadmoor will provide a reasonable safeguard to the public and if the high security available within Broadmoor is necessary because the patient could not be safely contained within the security available at a medium secure unit. Unless those conditions are met it is accepted by the Broadmoor Guidelines that to admit a patient to Broadmoor would be an unacceptable infringement of his or her right not to be detained in a higher level of security than he or she requires. It is not easy in these circumstances to imagine circumstances in which, if those conditions were not met, it would nonetheless be lawful for a patient to be transferred from a medium security hospital to Broadmoor as a matter of or in the interest of wider policy considerations.</p>

If it is judged that a patient poses so significant a risk that it cannot safely be managed in a medium security hospital there is no suggestion in the Broadmoor Admissions Policy that the Admissions Panel may decline to admit the patient on the ground that it would not be in his interests.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The matter is further complicated by the question of the role played by fact finding in the decision making process. Mr Squires’ submission was that the question whether the Claimant met the admission criteria was a factual one even though it required professional knowledge. The ultimate question he submitted was one of risk assessment which is conducted routinely in criminal courts by judges. So in this case the Admissions Panel must be satisfied that one or more of the specified behaviours are present before admission to Broadmoor can be contemplated. Those are all evidence based.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgment the distinction is not quite so black and white as suggested by Mr Squires. Although much of the background identified in the assessing doctor’s report is based on specific incidents, conduct or events it may include such matters as the patient’s feelings. Moreover the factual background is relevant to an evaluation or assessment as to whether the conduct identified evidences the existence of a risk to the public which could not be safely managed within the security available at a medium secure unit. That in my judgment is likely if not bound to involve a professional evaluation both of the patient’s state of mind and of the suitability or otherwise of the facilities available at the medium security hospital from which he has been referred safely to manage the risk. In that sense it could be said that findings of fact as to particular incidents are only staging posts on the way to the broader evaluative judgment as to the level of risk, albeit that that judgment is not itself made as part of an administrative discretion pursuant to wider policy aims. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">A complicating factor is that the existence of factual disputes and their importance to the ultimate risk assessment may vary significantly from case to case. Without the background of other evidence which strongly supported the conclusion reached by the Admissions Panel in this case it is possible to imagine a case in which the factual dispute relied on by the Claimant in this case might make a very material difference to the ultimate risk assessment. The risk of incorrect factual findings is arguably greater in the current context  than in the context of risk assessment in the setting of sentencing in a criminal court, given on the one hand the possibility of vulnerable patients who may be inarticulate or by reason of their mental disorder unable persuasively or at all to give a factual account and on the other the possibility of other manipulative psychopathic patients who may exploit such vulnerability and/or hospital staff who may mis-interpret events or feel that they can make false allegations with relative impunity against a vulnerable patient.</p>

It is not without interest that, if when an appeal against transfer is made to the Tribunal, the proposed transfer has not taken place, the default position is that the patient shall not be transferred.

Rather the burden is on the hospital to satisfy the tribunal that the patient does require to be detained under conditions of special security which can only be provided in a state hospital if it wishes to be certain of upholding its decision to transfer. If it fails to do so the Tribunal has an unfettered discretion to order that the proposed transfer not take place or as the case may be that the patient be returned to the hospital from which he was transferred.</p>

Moreover it is for the Tribunal itself to form the judgment as to whether the patient requires to be detained under conditions of special security which can be provided only in a state hospital.

Further it is to be inferred that it considered that the nature of a decision to transfer a patient to a state hospital to be detained under conditions of special security and the nature of the issues likely to arise in the making of such a decision are (1) such that it is desirable that the patient should have a right of appeal to an independent tribunal and (2) not such as can only be taken by people with immediate knowledge of the conditions in the referring medium security hospital.</p>

However two of the claimants also submitted that the procedure was defective because there was no right for the prisoner to make representations before the initial decision to segregate.

The first was that <span style="font-style:italic">R (Wright)</span> involved the risk of imposing possibly irreparable damage to employment or prospects of employment. The second was that the decisions in relation to the two complaining claimants in <span style="font-style:italic">King</span> were taken in circumstances requiring urgency and that although they had no right to make representations before the initial decisions they could last no more that 72 hours and were subject to early and regular periodic review thereafter at which point the prisoner could make representations to the SRB.

As to the second its application to the present context might depend on which civil right were to be held to be determined by a decision to transfer a patient to a high security hospital. In this case I have held that there was no determination of any civil right. If it were held that the decision determined the Claimant’s civil right to liberty because of its effect in delaying the ultimate date of discharge, the seriousness of that consequence would in my view strongly support the proposition that nothing short of a right of access to a court with a fact reviewing jurisdiction would comply with Article 6. If the only civil right held to be determined by the decision to transfer was his right to unmonitored post that support might be less strong.

His solicitor’s request made on 19 August 2010 to attend the Panel was refused and as appears from the Operational Policy there is a blanket refusal for patients or their representatives to attend for the purpose of making representations or giving evidence.

In contrast, in the instant case, the HBRB was deciding a simple question of fact, namely whether there was “good cause” for the applicant’s delay in making a claim. On this question, the applicant had given evidence to the HBRB that the first that she knew that anything was amiss with her claim for housing benefit was the receipt of a notice from her landlord – the Housing Association seeking to repossess her flat because her rent was in arrears. The HBRB found her explanation to be unconvincing and rejected her claim for back-payment of benefit essentially on the basis on their assessment of her credibility. No specialist expertise was required to determine this issue, which is, under the new system, determined by a non-specialist tribunal.

The notes refer to several other patients being ”involved” in the plan to attack the other patient. More fundamentally Ms Jolly takes issue with the interpretation made by Dr Vandenabeele and accepted by the Admissions Panel of the incident including the Claimant’s own admission that he intended to assault the other patient.

The majority of the Court of Appeal held that in such a case the authority could and must “contract out” its homelessness function to someone who was both independent and impartial – see (Brooke LJ with whom David Steel J agreed) at paras 43 – 45.</p>

In the rejoinder the Secretary of State submitted that that is incorrect.  The 2008 Regulations are made under s.19 of the 1983 Act which contained nothing to authorise the delegation of authority over transfers to the First Tier Tribunal whose functions under the 1983 Act are to find by part V thereof.  Thus there is no authority for contracting out the transfer function to a Tribunal.  </p>

If such a declaration were granted it was submitted that it would be sufficient for the issue of transfer to be referred to the Tribunal after the transfer had taken place.  Reliance was placed on an analogy with s.75(1) of the 1983 Act which requires the Secretary of State when he recalls a restricted patient hospital to refer his case to the Tribunal within one month of the recall.  That had been held sufficient to satisfy the procedural requirements of Article 5(4) see <span style="font-style:italic">Secretary of State for Justice v Rayner</span> [2009] 1 WLR 310.  If a post-recall reference is sufficient in a case where a patient is moving from liberty to detention he submitted it was submitted that it must also be sufficient when a patient is moving from conditions of medium security to conditions of high security.</p>

That was on the basis that Regulation 7 could be amended and that there is no provision of primary legislation which prevents an independent appeals panel determining appeals by those who wish to challenge a hospital transfer. If that were wrong the claimant had no objection to a declaration of incompatibility being made.  In that event he submitted that if the current legislative provisions are incompatible it is best left to Parliament to determine how the incompatibility should be cured and at which stage any appeal right should be available.</p>

Pursuant to the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003 where notice is given to a patient of a transfer there is a right to appeal before the transfer takes effect.  Where the transfer is urgent such that no advance notice can be given or the Tribunal decides that the patient should be transferred pending appeal the appeal will be heard after the transfer.  The claimant submitted that such an approach balances the right to a fair hearing with any requirement for urgency that may arise in a particular case.  </p>

When a patient is recalled to hospital because it is no longer safe for him to be at liberty it is very difficult to envision a situation in which it will be possible to accord him a hearing before the recall.  By contrast, and as the Scottish scheme illustrates, there will plainly be cases of proposed transfer in which it will be possible as well as desirable to hold a hearing before the transfer takes place.  It was submitted that the instant case is one such example.  The Claimant was referred to Broadmoor on 4 August 2010 but not transferred until 6 October 2010. There was no reason why a hearing could not be held in the interim.  </p>

In that case the Court of Appeal considered whether a 17 year old placed in segregation at a Young Offenders Institution was entitled to be heard before the decision to segregate was taken.  The Secretary of State argued that it was sufficient that prisoners could appear at a hearing before the Segregation Review Board within 72 hours of the segregation, but that was rejected by the Court of Appeal.  It held that giving an opportunity for comment only after a decision of that nature was taken was not a sufficient safeguard to ensure common law fairness.  </p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“[The SSHD’s counsel] showed that decisions to place a person in the segregation unit can be revoked quickly and before the expiry of the first three days – for example she said if the prisoner has calmed down.  That does not, in my view meet the point being made by Jack J. Any decision to remove to a segregation unit will be made based on a factual basis.  The best time to check on the factual basis by asking for the prisoner’s comments is before the decision is made.  As Jack J rightly observed once a decision is made, it is difficult to change it.  This is particularly so when a decision has been made on a factual basis and when the person subject to a decision seeks to persuade the decision maker, after the decision has been made, that the factual basis on which he acted is wrong.  Inevitably the decision maker will be reluctant to conclude that his original decision was wrong.  Simon Brown LJ  in <span style="font-style:italic">R v SSHD ex parte Hickey</span> (2) [1995] 1 WLR 734 at 744 made the point that “it is difficult to suppose that [a decision maker] can remain as open-minded as if no clear decision has been taken.””</p>

The decision to transfer was taken on a factual basis (namely “discovery” of two weapons manufactured by the claimant) which it was submitted was erroneous.  That was precisely the kind of case in which fairness required a chance to make representations before the decision was taken.  That applied to the timing of any hearing pursuant to Article 6.  Even if Article 6 is not engaged, however, it was submitted that it applies to the common law fairness arguments made by the Claimant namely that he should have been permitted the opportunity, whether through his solicitors or directly, to make representations prior to transfer.</p>

Given that this is a case in which the Claimant has abandoned any substantive challenge to his continued detention in Broadmoor, in my judgment no useful purpose would be served by my embarking on a full response to this question, raising as it does general questions as to whether it is legally possible and/or necessary for the transferring or receiving hospital to delegate authority over transfers to the First tier Tribunal or to some other independent and impartial person or body. </p>
