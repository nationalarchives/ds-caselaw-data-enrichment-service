This is one of the most widely endorsed treaties in the history of the UN. In this convention the WHO has laid down a series of control measures some of which are said to be mandatory and a further series of measures which contracting states are encouraged to adopt, one of which is a prohibition on advertising on packaging and upon tobacco products. This latter measure is known as “standardised packaging”. At base it involves a substantial limitation being imposed upon the ability of manufacturers to advertise or place branding upon the outer packaging or the tobacco product itself.  The Regulations do not however involve all tobacco products being sold in a homogeneous, undifferentiated manner.  The manufacturers can still place the brand name and variant name upon the box and in this way they can still communicate their identities to consumers and differentiate themselves from their competitors. But the manner in which the name and brand may be used is highly regulated in order, in effect, to strip away as much of the attractiveness of the branding or advertising as possible.  </p>

These measures are to be implemented by 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2016, the same day as the Regulations are due to become effective in the United Kingdom. In particular the TPD increases the percentage of the space on the two outer faces of a tobacco pack which must be taken up with health warnings and it introduces a series of prohibitions on different types of product presentation and appearance.  However it leaves to the Member States the decision whether to go further and introduce standardised packaging.  </p>

The Australian Government, which gave evidence to the High Court, says that the legislation is working well and the available data suggests that it is having a salutary effect upon prevalence and use of tobacco in Australia.  The Government conducted a post-implementation review which was published in 2016 which was based upon a mixture of qualitative and quantitative evidence and which substantiated the view of the Government of Australia that the measures were beginning to achieve their desired objective. </p>

In order to provide some order to the complaints made by the tobacco companies I have grouped them under 17 Grounds of Challenge. Some of these grounds have multiple parts to them. In broad terms these challenges and grounds fall into 7 categories.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The first category challenges the legality of the Regulations upon the basis that they implement the TPD, the instrument of EU law which has introduced legislation to implement the FCTC.  The Claimants submit the TPD is itself illegal. A reference was made by the High Court to the Court of Justice of a series of questions raising challenges to the legality of the TPD in <span style="font-style:italic">Philip Morris</span>.  On 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2016 the Court of Justice handed down its judgment emphatically rejecting these challenges. The parasitic domestic law challenge thus necessarily fails. The analysis of the Court of Justice has a bearing upon a number of grounds raised in these proceedings and because of this I have addressed it at the outset of this judgment (Ground 1 – See Section E below).  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The second ground (Ground 2 – See Section F below) raises a fundamental issue about the way in which evidence submitted by the tobacco industry should be treated. Specifically it focuses upon a challenge to the way in which the Secretary of State treated the expert evidence served by the tobacco companies during the consultation process leading up to the adoption of the Regulations.  It is argued that the Government acted unlawfully because it attributed only “<span style="font-style:italic">limited</span>” weight to this evidence upon the (erroneous) basis that it lacked independence and otherwise failed to meet “best practice” standards for the preparation of evidence. The argument was advanced primarily by BAT but its arguments were adopted by the other Claimants. The position of the Secretary of State is that the generality of the evidence of the tobacco companies was indeed markedly deficient and inferior. This has given rise to two particular grounds of challenge. The first is the general complaint that it was unlawful to give only “limited” weight to the tobacco industry evidence since this unfairly discounted the probative value or worth of that evidence; the second and narrower but essentially similar argument was advanced by BAT alone and was that the specific evidence adduced by BAT had been singled out for adverse and unlawful treatment.  BAT contended that its position was different to that of the other tobacco companies who participated during the consultation process because of the sheer volume and quality of the BAT evidence. The tobacco companies not only challenge the approach adopted by the Secretary of State but they also retaliate and attack the impartiality of the experts called to give responsive evidence on the side of the </p>

They also attack the “best practice” standards which the Secretary of State relied upon to evaluate evidence. The issue is of very real significance. It is not only at the heart of the limited issue concerning the approach of the Secretary of State to the evidence of the Claimants during the consultation; but it is also relevant to all of the other grounds of challenge where the tobacco companies have adduced evidence though experts.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">A core issue in this litigation concerns the intrinsic quality of the evidence submitted during the consultation, but also in the course of this judicial review.  A remarkable feature of the WHO Convention (the FCTC) is that it marks out the tobacco companies as entities which have deliberately sought to undermine national health polices and it translates this considered position into a strong recommendation to the contracting states that, in effect, they apply great circumspection when assessing evidence submitted to them by tobacco interests. The FCTC position is said to be “<span style="font-style:italic">evidence based</span>”, a claim that the tobacco companies submit is “<span style="font-style:italic">manifestly</span>” absurd. The FCTC contains at its heart two propositions of real significance for the present case.  The first is that tobacco use is an “<span style="font-style:italic">epidemic</span>” of global proportions which exerts a catastrophic impact upon health.  The tobacco companies do not dispute or seek to undermine the universal medical consensus as to the profound harm caused by smoking.  The second, and most controversial in the context of the present proceedings, is that the tobacco companies have over multiple decades set out, deliberately and knowingly, to subvert attempts by government around the world to curb tobacco use and promote public health.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The first proposition is the premise for most of the substantive provisions of the FCTC which set out to curb smoking and tobacco consumption. The second proposition is based upon the experience of the US courts in litigation involving the tobacco companies in the course of which the tobacco companies were, after protracted interlocutory disputes about discovery and privilege, required to divulge truly stupendous quantities of internal documentation (exceeding 50 million pages). This material has now been placed in the public domain and is searchable on-line.  The WHO has produced its own practical guide to searching the material.  The analysis conducted of these documents by bodies such as WHO, and by the US courts, has led to some stark and, from the perspective of public health, unpalatable conclusions: in particular that the outward facing public statements of the tobacco companies are contradicted by their own inward facing private deliberations and analyses. One instance of this concerns the claim by the tobacco companies that they do not market their products towards children.  This proposition (repeated in this litigation) has been rejected in the US courts and by the WHO upon the basis, <span style="font-style:italic">inter alia</span>, of internal tobacco company documents.  The FCTC requires that contracting states should exercise vigilance when dealing with the tobacco companies and should ensure that they act with accountability and transparency. The FCTC does not however spell out in detail how those principles should translate into the national laws and practices of the contracting states.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">In these proceedings I have analysed the conclusions of the WHO and the US courts because they bear upon the dispute between the Secretary of State and the tobacco companies as to the reliability of the evidence submitted by the tobacco companies in the course of the pre-legislative consultation, but also in this litigation.  Put bluntly the Government says that the intrinsic quality of the tobacco company’s evidence is inferior as not being in compliance with methodological best practice accepted worldwide by the scientific and technical research communities. These include such matters as: the importance of peer review of research results; the independence of researchers and experts from vested interests; the cross-referability of the reports of experts instructed by the tobacco companies against the internal documents of the tobacco companies themselves; the qualifications and competence of tobacco company experts to opine upon particular topics; and the practice of the tobacco company experts of ignoring or dismissing the pre-existing and adverse literature. To say that the parties disagree fundamentally about these matters is an understatement.   </p>

The conclusions which have arisen from the US courts about the sharp discord between what the tobacco companies think inside their own four walls and what they then say to the outside world (especially through experts), are so damning and the evidence of the discord so compelling and far reaching that it is not at all surprising that the WHO concluded that there was an <span style="font-style:italic">evidence base</span> upon which to found their recommendations to contracting states to apply vigilance and demand accountability and transparency in their dealing with the tobacco companies.   </p>

The requirement that experts should act with transparency and accountability is hardly surprising.  It is in fact the cornerstone of the “best practice” regimes applied by regulators worldwide when they seek to evaluate empirical evidence advanced by companies (outside the field of tobacco control) under investigation. Indeed, one of the Claimants’ own experts described the principles of transparency and openness as the “<span style="font-style:italic">foundational tablets of the scientific enterprise”</span>. The approach now adopted by the international research community and by regulators represents common sense rules of evaluation which resonate strongly in a case such as the present.  Further these principles are consistent with the obligations which experts and parties owe to the Court and which are required under the Civil Procedure Rules (“CPR”) which govern civil litigation in this jurisdiction.  </p>

As a generality, the Claimants’ evidence <span style="font-style:italic">is</span> largely: not peer reviewed; frequently not tendered with a statement of truth or declaration that complies with the CPR; almost universally prepared without any reference to the internal documentation or data of the tobacco companies themselves; either ignores or airily dismisses the worldwide research and literature base which contradicts evidence tendered by the tobacco industry; and, is frequently unverifiable.  I say “largely” because the quality of the evidence submitted to this Court (which included all of that tendered during the consultation) was sometimes of remarkably variable quality.  Some of it was wholly untenable and resembled diatribe rather than expert opinion; but some was of high quality, albeit that I am still critical of it, for instance, because it ignores internal documents or was unverifiable. </p>

Some of the work that they have produced for the purpose of this litigation (and in particular the empirical work) is indeed extraordinarily sophisticated.  However, as was observed in the US Courts the simple fact that an expert has a high pedigree or is a Harvard professor or a Nobel Prize winner is not a reason not to apply to their work exactly the same rigorous standards as are applied to the work of others.  The report of a Nobel Prize winner as presented to a Court might be a remarkably good piece of work but if it lacks peer review or ignores contradictory internal documents or is unverifiable, its probative value may nonetheless be substantially diminished. Nobel Prize winners should in any event be strong adherents of the very highest of international research best standards; and if they fail to live up to these standards a Court must say so and act accordingly.  </p>

The more detailed and sophisticated the evidence tendered the greater the need for the regulator or decision maker to be able to de-construct that evidence right down to the tips of its roots in order to be able to evaluate its core structure and the assumptions upon which it is predicated and to assess them against all the available data.   </p>

This entailed taking each criticism (for instance that a piece of research was not peer reviewed, or was outside the expert’s normal field of competence, or included assumptions which were not backed up with evidence, or which ignored the existing literature base, or which appeared to arrive at a conclusion which ran counter to internal documents of the tobacco companies) and checking its accuracy against the other documents in the voluminous Court file.  My conclusion was that, where I was able to conduct a proper cross-check, it was a validly made criticism.  It is notable that the Claimants have not materially challenged the detailed and highly particularised methodological criticisms made of their expert evidence.  Rather they attack the criticism at source, contending that the “best practice” principles advocated by the Secretary of State are irrelevant, misguided or flawed and that accordingly criticisms based upon these principles simply do not strike home.  </p>

But, nonetheless the Court must form its own conclusion about the evidence and the fact that up to date evidence is admissible means that the assessment by the Court might be of evidence that was not before the original decision maker (here Parliament).

The Claimants advance a theory which, in very simplified terms, works like this: standardised packaging will by its very nature wipe out the attractiveness of branding.  As such all tobacco packaging and products will become uniformly drab.  Brand loyalties will in consequence weaken and consumers will “downtrade” to the lower priced products.  In further consequence they will, on average, spend less on tobacco products than before.  All things being equal if prices go down demand tends to go up so that downtrading will lead to an increase in use of tobacco.  This increase will not be counterbalanced or netted off by the demand depressing effects of standardised packaging because there is no proper evidence that factors such as the increased saliency of health warnings and/or the reduction in appeal of tobacco packets and products will exert any serious demand depressing effects.  As such they will not counteract the stimulant effect on demand of downtrading.   </p>

I accept that in accordance with internationally accepted best practice the qualitative and quantitative evidence has to be examined as a whole, and in the round.  I have found that the econometric regression analyses conducted by the experts instructed by the Secretary of State is consistent and in line with the qualitative evidence and also consistent with a detailed post-implementation review conducted by the Australian Government (2016) which included new quantitative analysis. I reject the submission of the tobacco companies that their evidence is compelling; it is far from such. I accept the thrust of the methodological criticisms levelled by the Secretary of State at the Claimants’ evidence, though I emphasise that my conclusion on proportionality is independent of my findings on methodological quality.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">I have come to similar conclusions in relation to the second and third parts of the proportionality challenge.  I reject the submission that there is a less intrusive but equally effective way of addressing the Government’s health concerns, namely by an increase in tax, and for this reason the Regulations are a (proverbial) sledgehammer to crack a nut when a nut cracker would have done and hence unnecessary (Ground 4). I also reject the submission that applying a “<span style="font-style:italic">fair balance</span>” test of proportionality and balancing the public and private interests the Regulations are disproportionate (Ground 5).  As to this latter point the submission of the tobacco companies was that there was nothing exceptional about tobacco which was a lawfully marketed product.  The companies had a powerful private interest in their property rights (mainly trade marks) which trumped the public interest arising.  Counsel for the Secretary of State reformulated the argument as a claim that the tobacco companies had the right to maximise their profits for the benefit of shareholders by promoting a product that shortened lives and caused a health epidemic of colossal proportions and which imposed upon the state a vast financial cost.  If one examines the issue purely by comparing the monetary losses the tobacco industry assert that they will incur against the costs which would be saved to the public purse by the Regulations the balance comes out very clearly indeed on the side of the public purse.  Yet it is wrong to view this issue purely in monetised terms alone; there is a significant moral angle which is embedded in the Regulations which is about saving children from a lifetime of addiction, and children and adults from premature death and related suffering and disease. I therefore reject the Claimants’ case that the Regulations are disproportionate. </p>

I have set out in this judgment (at paragraphs [630] – [648]) my conclusions about the limits of what can properly be expected of a Court confronted with this sort of evidence.  In particular this case has brought home to me that under the instruction now given to Courts hearing proportionality challenges to arrive at their own conclusions upon the basis of up to date evidence, there is a real risk that Courts will find themselves overwhelmed by highly technical and complex evidential disputes which they may not be capable of resolving.  If this is so then there is a consequential risk that perfectly sound applications for judicial review on proportionality grounds will fail, where otherwise they should have succeeded, simply because the judicial process is not well suited to untangling the complexities involved.  I have set out my concerns in some detail in this judgment and also suggested an approach to the way in which such evidence is handled in the future which might alleviate the problem. I have also set out my views on how the constitutional relationship between the Courts and decision makers and legislatures is affected by the task imposed upon Courts by this exercise. </p>

I accept that their trade marks and other relevant intellectual property amount to “<span style="font-style:italic">possessions</span>” or “<span style="font-style:italic">property</span>” which in principle are capable of falling with the protective principles involved.  I also accept that in principle certain types of goodwill can also amount to a protectable interest (though on the facts of the case it is not possible to form a concluded view as to the extent to which there are goodwill related rights arising).  I reject the submission however that the rights have been expropriated.  Title to the rights in issue remains in the hands of the tobacco companies; the Regulations curtail the <span style="font-style:italic">use</span> that can be made of those rights but they are not expropriated. Indeed, the rights remain important in the hands of the tobacco companies because the word marks can still be used on packaging and will serve their traditional function as an identifier of origin. I accept that the figurative marks cannot be used in this manner but they still have certain, admittedly very limited, vestigial uses, which the Regulations do not curtail. Further the restrictions imposed pursue a legitimate public health based interest; a conclusion not challenged by the Claimants.  These two factors (retention of title and measures imposed for legitimate public interest reasons) are in large measure sufficient to defeat in law the submission that the rights have been expropriated.  But if I am wrong in this and the Claimants’ rights have been expropriated I have then to decide whether compensation should be paid. The law indicates that in cases of true expropriation full compensation is payable save in “exceptional” circumstances. In my judgment it is quite obvious that the circumstances are exceptional. Tobacco usage is classified as a health evil, albeit that it remains lawful.  There is no precedent where the law has provided compensation for the suppression of a property right which facilitates and furthers, quite deliberately, a health epidemic.  And moreover, a health epidemic which imposes vast negative health and other costs upon the very State that is then being expected to compensate the property right holder for ceasing to facilitate the epidemic.  </p>

These are the national counterparts of the arguments advanced by the same Claimants before the Court of Justice and which were rejected in <span style="font-style:italic">Philip Morris</span>.  I have set out in this judgment why I reject these grounds.  At base Parliament, both under international law relating to health (WHO) and intellectual property (e.g. in TRIPS) and under EU law, has a broad discretion to adopt on a precautionary and prospective basis measures designed to protect against health problems.  And that is what the Regulations do.  A number of the challenges focus upon what is said to be the essence or substance of a trade mark and upon the competence or jurisdiction of the Member States to enact legislation to regulate the use of trade marks in connection with the preservation of health.  It is contended that the Regulations are unlawful or <span style="font-style:italic">ultra vires</span> if they intrude upon trade mark rights or impair those rights.  These arguments operate upon the premise that a trade mark proprietor cannot be prevented from using a trade mark <span style="text-decoration:underline">at all</span> even when it facilitates a health epidemic.  In my judgment the law is very clear: It is <span style="font-style:italic">no</span> part of international, EU or domestic common law on intellectual property that the legitimate function of a trade mark (i.e. its essence or substance) should be defined to <span style="font-style:italic">include</span> a right to <span style="font-style:italic">use</span> the mark to <span style="font-style:italic">harm</span> public health, and the Member States have a broad power to adopt health legislation even when it intrudes upon other rights belonging to manufacturers of products which cause the health problem. The technical arguments to the contrary were advanced with forensic skill but stripped down to below their respectable veneers their bare essentials are exposed as unsustainable. </p>

As to this it is clear from case law that this is (for obvious reasons) a highly circumscribed right and all manner of different laws and regulatory measures (tax, environmental, health and safety, etc) limit the freedom that business otherwise enjoys to do as it pleases.  Indeed the express language of Article 16 confers the freedom <span style="font-style:italic">subject to</span> compliance with both EU and national laws. This ground adds nothing new to the other legal challenges.  If the Claimants cannot prevail under these other grounds there is no scope for them to succeed under Article 16.  A further challenge was made under Article 34 TFEU. This prohibits hindrances to the free movement of goods across borders.  The Regulations do create to some degree obstacles to inter-state trade. But Article 34 TFEU is subject, <span style="font-style:italic">inter alia</span>, to overriding public health grounds (in Article 36 TFEU) and accordingly whether or not this ground succeeds is parasitic upon the success of other more specific grounds.  As such it also adds nothing to the other challenges. And since no other challenge succeeds then these challenges also fail. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">BAT challenged, in a variety of ways, the consultative process which led up to the Secretary of State laying draft regulations before Parliament for its consideration and promulgation. There is nothing in these objections. BAT was able to submit, and did submit, a substantial volume of material during that process. The civil servants conducted an extensive consultative exercise.  They received a great deal of evidence from the tobacco companies, much of it mutually supportive and directed in identical lines of travel.  The civil servants summarised this evidence in detailed final submissions to the Minister. The Minister then laid draft regulations before Parliament for its independent consideration (by affirmative resolution). It is clear from the Hansard record of proceedings in Parliament that the draft regulations were subjected to vigorous debate and that many parliamentarians spoke out for the position of the tobacco companies.  I can detect not a hint of unfairness in the procedure adopted towards BAT.  Their arguments were summarised fairly and squarely and the short point is that Parliament made up its own mind aware of the full range of arguments on all sides of the debate, including as to the relevance of the Australian experience.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">And moreover, even if I had concluded that there was some element of unfairness I would not have found that this was material.  This is for two reasons.  First, the submissions made for BAT were at a high level of generality and appeared to assume that the Secretary of State was the actual decision maker.  They took no account of the fact that Parliament took its <span style="text-decoration:underline">own</span> independent decision after full debate. The submissions did not explain how any individual failings on the part of civil servants or Ministers could have exerted any tainting impact upon the decision subsequently made by Parliament. There is, on the evidence, simply no arguable causal nexus or connection identified and any such failing would in any event be <span style="font-style:italic">de minimis</span> and immaterial. Secondly, in so far as any such failing related to evidence going to the proportionality argument it was also BAT’s argument (and that of the other tobacco companies) that what happened before Parliament was in any event irrelevant since what mattered was the position before this Court.  It must follow that prior failings lost their potency when this judicial review started.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The tipping manufacturers produce paper for the filter tips for cigarette sticks.  They do so under contract to the tobacco manufacturers.  They submit that properly construed the TPD does not allow for any sort of restriction to be imposed upon the product itself and this includes the tips. Accordingly, Regulation 5 which does just this is <span style="font-style:italic">ultra vires</span> the TPD. I reject this submission. There are three principles of construction which lead me to this conclusion. First, the TPD is not, so far as definitions of terms are concerned, comprehensive and it does not define “<span style="font-style:italic">packaging</span>”.  That term clearly covers the outer-packaging and any inner-packaging inside a box; but, when read purposively against the object sought to be achieved and against the international law obligations the TPD purports to implement, the phrase is capable of a wider meaning whereby “<span style="font-style:italic">packaging</span>” includes everything into which tobacco is packed or encased. This would include all that which encases or surrounds the actual tobacco and this would include the paper which constitutes the stick and the tips, as well as outer packaging and wrapping.  Secondly, even if the term “packaging” is narrowly construed (as the Claimants submit) and refers only to the outer packaging then on ordinary EU law principles of construction legislatures may still take anti-avoidance measures to ensure that the effectiveness, or “<span style="font-style:italic">effet utile</span>”, of the chosen measure is achieved.  Indeed this point is made in the FCTC and by the WHO which identify advertising placed <span style="text-decoration:underline">on</span> the tobacco product itself as a way for tobacco companies to circumvent the main restrictions in the FCTC on advertising on the outer packaging.  As such it is in accordance with normal rules of construction to introduce a restriction on advertising and branding placement <span style="text-decoration:underline">on</span> the product <span style="text-decoration:underline">itself</span> in order to ensure the effectiveness of the restriction upon the placing of adverts and branding on the outer packaging.  Thirdly, even if the above two arguments are wrong, it is an error on the part of the Claimants to contend that the power of the Member States to introduce further legislation is limited by the terms of the TPD.  That is a measure of partial harmonisation and in the gaps and interstices left by the mandatory provisions of the TPD there is ample opportunity and a right for Member States to introduce additional legislation, in particular that which is consistent with the international law obligations of the Member States and the EU under the FCTC. Regulation 5 which governs restrictions on the product itself is therefore within the competence of Parliament even if it is not covered by the TPD. I therefore reject the submission that Regulation 5 is <span style="font-style:italic">ultra vires</span>.</p>

It does not however figure much in this litigation because it was not submitted by the Claimant tobacco companies that the pursuit of the objective of seeking to suppress tobacco consumption and use was not a legitimate objective. There are two broad strands to the objective.  First, there is the general and broad health policy pursued by the Government of seeking to suppress both the supply and demand of tobacco products.  Secondly there are, within this broader strategy, a number of more specific objectives. Given that the specific objectives are said to be a continuation of the broader, macro, strategy it is necessary to set out the Government case on both. </p>

Evidence suggests that around 207,000 children aged between 11 and 15 years old start smoking every year in the United Kingdom, i.e. about 600 every day.  Children whose parents or siblings smoke are 90% more likely to become smokers.  Evidence suggests that if smoking is seen by young people as a normal part of life, they are much more likely to take up smoking.  The impact of second-hand smoke is also a critical health issue.  Smoking is highly addictive.  The Royal College of Physicians has stated that the way in which nicotine causes addiction is similar to drugs such as heroin.  Moreover, because of neurological immaturity children can become addicted extraordinarily quickly, literally within weeks of first smoking. </p>

This is the common objective of all tobacco policies or measures. The goal is not to reduce smoking by any particular percentage figure.  The control programmes apply a mix of complementary and mutually reinforcing educational, clinical, regulatory, fiscal, economic and social strategies in the effort to reduce smoking prevalence and use. The need for states to adopt multifaceted and complementary approaches is one recognised by the WHO in the FCTC which explicitly encourages the adoption of “comprehensive” anti-smoking strategies, and is also an approach adopted by other jurisdictions across the world, such as Australia. The importance of this is that, as the FCTC reflects, there is a broad consensus at the level of international health policy that to combat smoking requires a portfolio policy approach in which the problem is treated in a variety of different ways. </p>

Many aims are common to all or most tobacco control policies (e.g. reducing second-hand smoke). However, tobacco policies may also be targeted at reducing or removing a specific driver for demand and/or addressing a specific threat or concern identified by the Government.  For example, two of the six internationally recognised strands for comprehensive tobacco control programmes are: (a) stopping the promotion of tobacco; and (b) making tobacco less affordable. Policies designed to form part of strand (a) (e.g. a ban on tobacco advertising) will have some different goals to those designed to form part of strand (b) (e.g. the imposition of a specific tax), while having common objectives such as helping or incentivising people to quit smoking.  Policies directed towards preventing youths taking up smoking in the first place will, again, be different to those directed at encouraging quitting.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">I turn now to the specific objectives behind the Regulations. These are to eradicate the attractive force of design on cigarette packaging and on the products themselves. Following the introduction over the past 20 years or so of policy measures targeting the impact of advertising, promotion and sponsorship (including the introduction of an advertising ban and display ban), the packaging of tobacco products and the appearance of the cigarettes themselves have become key promotional vehicles for tobacco manufacturers. In 2006, a spokesman for Gallaher (now part of JTI) noted that “<span style="font-style:italic">marketing restrictions make the pack the hero</span>”. Branded packaging has been described as the <span style="font-style:italic">“silent salesman” </span>and the manufacturers’ <span style="font-style:italic">“billboard”</span>.  Tobacco companies do not divulge their internal documents and they have not done so in this litigation. But in the course of litigation elsewhere, and especially in the United States, they have been compelled to provide discovery and there is thus a large body of indicative material that gives an insight into the internal thought processes within the manufacturers. This material suggests that a cat and mouse game is employed between the companies and Governments.  As the scope for promotion shrinks through successive legislative interventions so the tobacco companies focus increasingly upon the territory that is left.  The importance of the present case is that the packaging and the product itself constitute virtually the last opportunity for tobacco companies to promote their product. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The Defendant’s position is that there is clear evidence establishing a causal relationship between packaging advertising and smoking initiation, especially among the young. Psychology is critical. Brand imagery appeals to the psychological and social needs of the consumer.  Over the last decade the tobacco market has seen a proliferation of tobacco brands and brand variants. Colours and branding on packaging and on cigarettes themselves are used to enhance the appeal of products, including to the young, and to communicate different messages to the consumer in relation to the strength, quality and harmfulness of the product. The market has also seen the introduction of innovative packaging intended to introduce a ‘<span style="font-style:italic">wow</span>’ factor through, for example, ‘GlideTec’ packs (Imperial) which are designed to embrace the <span style="font-style:italic">“sociability of smoking”</span>.

On packaging innovation for example, in discussion of the development of an oval pack, the proposition behind the concept was identified as providing a “distinctive young masculine appearance” and noted that this idea was well received in concept study results which concluded that the “pack has tremendous appeal amongst young smokers””. </p>

This argument is unsustainable. It is not possible to design a product to appeal to adults (over 18s) without appealing, even inadvertently, to children. A number of the tobacco companies have strenuously denied that they target their product on children or even that they are interested in the impact of tobacco on children (see paragraphs [294ff] below). But the Government medical advisers all say that, targeted or not, the lure to children remains strong and this is plain and obvious to the manufacturers. </p>

In the UK market there is already an existing comprehensive ban on tobacco advertising and promotion as well as the recently introduced ban on retail displays. Against this background, the limited space on cigarette packs, and the marks used on them, are to all practical purposes the only means by which BAT can communicate the different qualities of its products to adult smokers and differentiate its brands from those of its competitors and from other brands and products within its own brand portfolios, other than on the basis of price. Plain Packaging will effectively eliminate such differentiation. This would result in the loss of the value of BAT’s intellectual property rights and the goodwill attaching to those rights…”. </p>

It is said that it is self-evident that the Regulations would effectively destroy the manufacturers’ brands which will in essence all look and feel the same. One expert who gave evidence on behalf of the Claimants suggested that losses to brand value could be in the region of “<span style="font-style:italic">billions”</span> of pounds and throughout this case this headline grabbing figure has been used to denote the scale of losses which would be caused by the Regulations. In relation to Philip Morris an expert instructed on its behalf estimated that the loss in brand value to the company, which holds a market share of just under 8% for ready-made cigarettes, was between £340 million and £515 million. Counsel for the tobacco companies during the hearing, whilst being chary of attributing hard valuations, nonetheless described the financial impact as “<span style="font-style:italic">truly immense</span>”.  It was candidly accepted that this case was about “<span style="font-style:italic">profits</span>”.  As I explain later in relation to the issue of valuation (See Section I(4)) I reject completely the expert evidence which postulates losses of “<span style="font-style:italic">billions</span>”, but I do accept that there will be significant lost value flowing from the introduction of the Regulations.  </p>

For instance JT International owns in excess of one hundred registrations of tobacco products sold in the UK and some of those trade marks are of a long standing nature.  The first Benson and Hedges trade mark in the United Kingdom was applied for in 1883 and the Gold pack has been protected by registered trade mark for in excess of 50 years.

Once again a considerable body of evidence was placed before the Court to establish that there can be goodwill attached to the trade marks and other intellectual property rights.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">It is also said that substantial resources are invested in the development and building up of goodwill.  One relevance of this in the present case is that it is contended that the goodwill amounts to “property” which is protected by the law of passing off and/or where registered, trade mark infringement and, it is submitted, that the Regulations unlawfully deprive the Claimants of the goodwill attached to their marks by “<span style="font-style:italic">cutting them off from the heritage with which they are associated</span>”. The Claimants point out that such goodwill is distinct from goodwill in the business arising independently of the trade marks as the Courts have recognised: e.g. <span style="font-style:italic">Mertrux Ltd v HMRC</span> [2013] EWCA Civ 821 paragraph [40]. Imperial and BAT also rely upon patents, design rights and copyright.

It examined the evidence examining the proposed benefits of standardised packaging. It considered several measures of appeal and in particular perceptions (the attractiveness of standardised packages; the quality of cigarettes in standardised packages; smoker identity and personality attributes associated with standardised packages). The investigation also examined whether standardised packaging increased the salience of health warnings (the ability of a person to notice and recall health warnings on packages, or the seriousness or believability of the warnings).  In addition the review considered whether and how perceptions of the harmfulness and strength of standardised packages differed from branded packs (and how different kinds of plain packages differed in this regard).  It also looked at whether and how standardised packages impacted upon smoking related attitudes and beliefs, perceived impact on others, and perceived impact on own smoking-related intentions and behaviours. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">A number of limitations in the evidence base were recognised in the Stirling Review: (i) there were no randomised controlled trials of standardised packaging; (ii) many studies exhibited significant methodological flaws; and (iii), the studies often examined hypothetical situations and attitudes which affected their predictive value. However, the point was made that the individual limitations were mitigated by the fact that, overall, the research was consistent in its conclusions. In the (subsequent) Chantler Review (discussed below), Sir Cyril Chantler endorsed the findings of the Stirling Review and expressly observed that the failure by the tobacco companies to disclose internal research put into context their criticisms of the Stirling conclusions: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.04in">“4.8 Contrary to the criticisms made, the authors rightly place emphasis on the overall consistency of results collected through multiple study designs and across several countries (and the absence of evidence pointing in the other direction). This is a commonplace of research analysis which involves determining the direction of effect and, where possible, effect size. <span style="font-style:italic">In my view, it does not seem to be a fair criticism that drawing studies from peer reviewed journals with a public health orientation represents a biased approach. There has been ample opportunity for the tobacco industry to present the undoubtedly extensive results of its own internal market research, for example focus group research exploring brand switching, but to date this has not been forthcoming other than as a result of litigation in the United States</span>.” </p>

All tobacco products are dangerous in their health effects. The Review has, however, focused on cigarettes and roll-your-own tobacco in view of their overall prevalence and particularly their use by children and young people. I note in this regard the approach, taken in the revised European Tobacco Products Directive (mentioned further below) in relation to these products which differs from that taken for more mainstream products but preserves power to intervene further as necessary. I see the scope of any standardised packaging scheme as one matter for policy makers to consider further in the event of a decision to introduce such a scheme.  </p>

For clarity, in this report references to “children” are generally used to refer to those under 18 years of age (who are unable legally to purchase tobacco), and references to “young adults” are to 18-24 year olds. In practice however, I considered it necessary to consider the effects of standardised packaging across the age range as a continuum. This is because addiction to smoking can involve a number of stages after first initiation, including prolonged progression through occasional use and later consolidation to becoming a habitual smoker. Coupled with the fact that once established, giving up smoking is extraordinarily difficult, there is a clear rationale for targeting anti-smoking efforts at children and young people whenever possible.  </p>

This is clearly not an issue which is capable of scientific proof in the manner one might apply, for example, to the efficacy of a new drug. There have been no double blind randomised controlled trials of standardised packaging and none could conceivably be undertaken. The most direct experiment to test the efficacy of standardised packaging might be to compare the uptake of smoking in non-smoking children with cigarettes in branded packaging and to see which group smoked more. But given the highly addictive and harmful nature of smoking, such an experiment could, rightly, never receive ethical approval. In any case such an experiment would need to be conducted over a long period and within a large population in which other variables were held constant. Indeed in Australia it will be difficult in due course to separate the effect of plain packaging from other factors such as changes in pack sizes introduced by the manufacturers, and price and tax increases.  </p>

Thus, given the importance of product attractiveness in product purchasing decisions and evidence that such packaging detracts from the health warning currently placed on such products, it is apparent that plain packaging would have some deterrent impact (albeit difficult to quantify) on the consumption of tobacco products. It might also be envisaged that this impact could be greater in deterring consumers who are non-smokers and therefore not yet addicted to nicotine from taking up smoking. Also, given the evidence on cigarette design attractiveness to different target populations, the impact of plain packaging could also have a particularly positive effect on these groups, encouraging them to reduce their cigarette consumption and uptake”. </p>

For various reasons as cited it is not possible to carry out a randomised controlled trial. Even if it was possible it would be extremely difficult to control for all the various confounding factors which are known to affect smoking. However after a careful review of all of the relevant evidence before me I am satisfied there is sufficient evidence derived from independent sources that the introduction of standardised packaging as part of a comprehensive policy of tobacco control measures would be very likely over time to contribute to a modest but important reduction in smoking prevalence especially in children and young adults. Given the dangers of smoking, the suffering that it causes, the highly addictive nature of nicotine, the fact that most smokers become addicted when they are children or young adults and the overall cost to society, the importance of such a reduction should not be underestimated”. </p>

Chantler decided to test the issue of the price effects of standardised packaging by instructing an independent economist to review the issue. The conclusions were set out in Annex C to the Report. In relation to demand for tobacco the economists concluded that standardised packaging would have two effects. First it would make tobacco products less desirable; and secondly, consumers would therefore be willing to pay less for tobacco than hitherto: </p>

This is because consumers no longer value premium products as highly after desirable packaging is removed. These effects are reported in research produced for Phillip Morris International (PMI) and for Japan Tobacco International (JTI). However, existing smokers display extremely high brand loyalty and will have been exposed over their lives to many thousands of branding images prior to the introduction of standardised packaging, so their brand memory will be strong. In Australia, there is some evidence that an existing trend for ’down-trading’ towards value brands may have accelerated since the introduction of plain packaging. However, much of this effect is likely to be the result of the significant tax increases that have also been introduced.  </p>

However, before reaching a final decision and in order to ensure that that decision is properly and fully informed, I intend to publish the draft regulations, so that it is crystal clear what is intended, alongside a final, short consultation, in which I will ask, in particular, for views on anything new since the last full public consultation that is relevant to a final decision on this policy. I will announce the details about the content and timing of that very shortly but would invite those with an interest to start considering any responses they might wish to make now”. </p>

In particular, one such ground (Ground 13) alleges that the Claimants’ evidence, and in particular the expert evidence, was insufficiently and unfairly summarised in the submission. As to this the submission provides a summary of the criticisms made of the Chantler Report and in particular it records the tobacco companies’ objection that Chantler contained an insufficient evidential basis upon which to introduce legislation, that the Report relied upon unsound and hypothetical evidence and incorrectly concluded that branded packaging contributed to increased tobacco consumption. The submission also sets out the complaint that the Chantler Report was not independent, relying upon expert opinions from tobacco control advocates and those with conflicts of interest and that it unfairly dismissed evidence which did not support the policy (i.e. Chantler was guilty of predetermination). The submission also records the complaint of the tobacco industry that Chantler<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>relied too heavily upon the Stirling Review and paid insufficient attention to data available from Australia. For example, it is recorded that the tobacco companies were of the view that Chantler had ignored a KPMG report upon illicit tobacco markets in Australia. They also referred to a report from London Economics submitted by PMI which concluded that the data from Australia did not demonstrate a change in smoking prevalence following the introduction of plain packaging. </p>

It recorded the objections of the tobacco industry as being “<span style="font-style:italic">vocal</span>” regarding the limitations and gaps in the evidence base. In Annex C to the Submission a detailed, 52 paragraph, analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the evidence in support of the introduction of advertising restrictions is set out. This Annex acknowledges the limitations inherent in the research base in support of legislation. It also sets out the criticisms advanced by the tobacco companies of that research base and examines those criticisms. It is notable that nowhere in either the Submission or in the Annexes is it said that the evidence supplied by the tobacco companies is to be given discounted weight relative to that advanced in support of restrictive measures by reason of methodological flaws contained within the tobacco companies’ evidence. </p>

A summary of the conclusions of HMRC was set out at Annex K to the submission. It recorded that the tobacco industry had identified an increase in illicit tobacco as a possible unintended consequence of the introduction of the Regulations. The conclusion of HMRC was that there was no evidence to suggest that the introduction of standardised packaging would have a significant impact upon the size of the illicit market or would prompt a step-change in the activity of organised crime gangs. HMRC did anticipate that it might prompt some change in the mechanics of fraud and to the composition of the illicit market but that this could be mitigated and managed through modifications or extensions to existing intervention methodologies. In Annex L further analysis was provided of the risk that the introduction of standardised packaging would increase illicit trade. This took greater account of evidence emanating from Australia. It provided a summary of the conclusions in the KPMG April 2014 Report “Illicit tobacco in Australia: 2013 Full Year Report”. This report, prepared on behalf of the tobacco industry, was provided to Ministers in the reference folder which accompanied the actual submission. The Annex provides the view of HMRC on the KPMG Report. The view was that the evidence from Australia was still emerging and that the picture was complex and incomplete.

Action to stop the promotion of tobacco has been taken over many years. The Tobacco Advertising and Promotion Act 2002 (TAPA) prohibits tobacco advertising. The Health Act 2009 requires the end of tobacco displays in England (in large stores from 2012 and all other tobacco retailers in 2015). A Cancer Research UK report on plain packaging says that tobacco packaging serves multiple functions for tobacco manufactures. It is used to promote the product using the same strategies employed by other manufacturers of consumer goods, specifically packaging innovation, design and value packaging. Packaging is viewed as a key marketing tool for tobacco companies, according to both their own internal documents and also the retail press. Packaging has a wider reach than advertising and is the most explicit link between the company and the consumer. Tobacco packaging and branding is a key element of tobacco marketing and promotion in the UK today.  </p>

Almost 7 smokers in 10 say they would like to quit, yet only half actually make a quit attempt. Furthermore, less than 3% of smokers successfully quit each year.  The smoker who wishes to give up smoking faces many obstacles, particularly the psychological and physiological components of addiction. Out of the smokers who do attempt to quit, approximately half do so without any assistance. These unassisted quit attempts are associated with the highest rates of relapse. In general, attempts to stop smoking are accompanied by powerful urges to smoke/cravings which are a major source of relapse and occur despite the individual concerned wanting to remain abstinent. Cravings overpower and undermine resolve to remain abstinent. These problems present examples of the difference between what smokers would prefer to do and what they are actually able to do with respect to tobacco consumption. The policy objectives include supporting smokers who want to quit and helping those who have quit avoiding relapse into smoking. In doing so, they will be better able to exercise their free choice in consumption decisions.  </p>

The independent review into health inequalities in England, ‘Fair Society, Healthy Lives’, proposed ‘the most effective evidence-based strategies for reducing health inequalities in England’ and made the following recommendation: <span style="font-style:italic">Tobacco control is central to any strategy to tackle health inequalities as smoking accounts for approximately half of the difference in life expectancy between the lowest and highest income groups.

But, as in previous IAs related to tobacco control policies, we have not otherwise included an impact on NHS costs for the treatment of smoking-related diseases.

Recent research has considered the impact specifically of tobacco packaging and branding (including standardised packaging) on the self-image of smokers and on the likelihood of quitting, and has confirmed that introducing standardised packaging could bring substantial benefits for public health.  </p>

When considering consumer surplus the orthodox approach is based on rational consumer behaviour. However, for addictive goods, this theory is not a plausible approach. For addictive goods, branding may act as a cue that stimulates craving. Removing the cue helps the addict to realise their true preferences. Any reduction in consumption due to standardised packaging might therefore be taken to reflect true preferences. The approach leaves the analyst with the task of assessing both the costs and the benefits realised by those who, in the wake of reduced branding, either do not become smokers or are enabled to quit. In addition to the health benefits listed above, there is pecuniary gain from reduced spending by quitters of around £5.7bn. However, there are offsetting withdrawal pains that quitters endure and any loss of any pleasure associated with smoking. There are also pecuniary gains for those who do not take up smoking, of £880m. These children are not addicted and hence have no offsetting withdrawal pains, but they do lose smoking related pleasures. As the assumptions that would be required to calculate non-health net gains would be relatively unconventional at this time, and were not included in the consultation IA, so they are not included in the NPV.  </p>

We conclude that there is a sizeable likelihood that there will be no discernible increase in the illicit market or cross border shopping (CBS), but there is a chance of an increase. A reasonable statistical expectation is of a 0.4% transfer from the UK duty paid market to UK duty unpaid market (both illicit and CBS are part of the UK duty unpaid market), would imply a £31m UK loss to tobacco manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers.  </p>

However, some of the value of these sales is due to the value of brands that have already been created, and whose value is diminished by the intervention. This diminution of value needs to be reckoned as a one-off cost of the policy. With standardised packaging we expect a more rapid decline in sales of high price than of low price brands because of a greater likelihood of quitting among smokers of high price brands and due to downtrading from high price to low price brands among those who continue to smoke. The impact on returns to UK business (tobacco manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers) attributed to the reduction in brand value is estimated to have a present value of £190m.  </p>

Thirty-three tobacco control experts were recruited from the UK (14), Australia (12) and North America (7). Their views were elicited via telephone interviews, and then pooled on a linear basis. Elicited estimates consisted of (1) the most likely, (2) the highest possible, and (3) the lowest possible, value for the percentage of (a) adult smokers and (b) children trying smoking, two years after the introduction of plain packaging (all other things being constant) in a target country in the expert’s region of residence. </p>

There were no differences in either estimate by region but there was considerable variability between experts’ estimates within regions. The study showed that tobacco control experts felt the most likely outcomes would be a reduction in smoking prevalence in adults, and a greater reduction in the numbers of children trying smoking. The results did however reveal a significant variability in the estimated size of these impacts. No expert estimated an increase in smoking as a likely outcome.  </p>

The script was developed by the authors from those used in similar studies. Prior to interview participants were sent a copy of a recent systematic review on the impact of plain packaging of tobacco products to ensure that all participants had the same summary of the most recent evidence relating to plain packaging. This did not provide numerical estimates of the likely impact of plain packaging policies on the two outcomes of interest in this study. During the interview, the interviewer provided the prevalence rates for the two outcomes of interest and asked participants to estimate the expected values of these two years after the introduction of plain packaging in their region, and the lowest and highest likely values, holding all other relevant factors constant (e.g. with current controls regarding the sale of tobacco still being in force, and the price and current prevalence levels being stable over the two year period). Subsidiary questions were used to explore the range of plausible values provided, to ensure that experts felt they would be extremely surprised if the actual values fell outside the range they had provided (‘extremely’ was described as a 1% chance), given the tendency of individuals to provide too narrow a range in these types of study. Finally, participants were asked to outline the reasoning behind the estimates they provided”. </p>

The percentage of this population who had ever smoked was 27% at the time of the research so the 3% represents a fall from 27% of the population to 24% of the population which, itself, represented a prevalence fall of 11%. So far as adults were concerned a decline in smoking prevalence of 1% point was estimated.  The proportion of this population that was smoking was 21% at the time so this represented a fall in prevalence of 4.8% estimated (i.e. 1 in 21).

However, it is important to bear in mind that these particular provisions are intended under the FCTC to be but one part of a much wider, prohibitive jigsaw.  Paragraphs [15] – [17] address the way in which manufacturers use attractive designs on packaging to promote their products and it explicitly endorses and encourages the use of  plain design in relation to both the outer pack <span style="text-decoration:underline">and</span> the product itself: </p>

In particular the right to use a trade mark can, under national law, yield to limitations imposed in the pursuit of superior public policy considerations.

	    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.04in;text-indent:0.5in">Also at an early stage the Court defined the specific subjectmatter of a trade mark right as "the guarantee that the owner of the trade mark has the exclusive right to use that trade mark, for the purpose of putting products protected by the trade mark into circulation for the first time". From that definition the doctrine of exhaustion of trade mark rights followed naturally. The Court thus concluded that "the exercise, by the owner of a trade mark, of the right which he enjoys under the legislation of a Member State to prohibit the sale, in that State, of a product which has been marketed under the trade mark in another Member State by the trade mark owner or with his consent is incompatible with the rules of the EEC Treaty concerning the free movement of goods within the Common Market". </p>

Proprietors could thus prevent imports into one Member State of such goods from another Member State and negate the free movement of goods guaranteed by Article 28 EC. That would however be contrary both to the Treaty and to the stated objective of the Directive, which is intended "to eliminate disparities between the trade mark laws of the Member States which may impede the free movement of goods and the freedom to provide services and distort competition within the common market" and hence to safeguard the functioning of the internal market. Article 7(1) therefore provides that the trade mark owner's right to prevent use of the mark "shall not entitle the proprietor to prohibit its use in relation to goods which have been put on the market in the Community under that trade mark by the proprietor or with his consent", thus encapsulating the doctrine of Community exhaustion of trade mark rights. </p>

It explained that the issue had to be understood in the context of the hierarchy of legislative norms. As with any other piece of secondary legislation the TMD had to be construed in the light of the Treaty rules on free movement of goods (ibid paragraph [27]) and further that the provision had been framed to correspond with the language and terminology used by the Court in earlier judgments in interpreting the superior Treaty rules on the free movement of goods (ibid paragraph [31]).

Evidence also suggests that large combined health warnings comprised of a text warning and a corresponding colour photograph are more effective than warnings consisting only of text. As a consequence, combined health warnings should become mandatory throughout the Union and cover significant and visible parts of the surface of unit packets.

The labelling of these other tobacco products should follow rules that are specific to them. The visibility of health warnings on smokeless tobacco products should be ensured. Health warnings should, therefore, be placed on the two main surfaces of the packaging of smokeless tobacco products.

Other misleading elements might include, but are not limited to, inserts or other additional material such as adhesive labels, stickers, inserts, scratch-offs and sleeves or relate to the shape of the tobacco product itself. Certain packaging and tobacco products could also mislead consumers by suggesting benefits in terms of weight loss, sex appeal, social status, social life or qualities such as femininity, masculinity or elegance. Likewise, the size and appearance of individual cigarettes could mislead consumers by creating the impression that they are less harmful. Neither the unit packets of tobacco products nor their outside packaging should include printed vouchers, discount offers, reference to free distribution, two-for- one or other similar offers that could suggest economic advantages to consumers thereby inciting them to buy those tobacco products.  </p>

However, the principal object is to introduce standardised packaging. It is undeniably correct, as the Claimants contend, that the Regulations will exert substantial limitations upon the tobacco companies’ use of their intellectual property rights. But the curtailment is not absolute. Standardised packaging entails a limited right to use trade marks on packaging and products and has no material impact on the use of trade marks outside the consumer context, for instance in relation to wholesale trade packaging or on corporate letterheads or in trade magazines. In addition, the Regulations do <span style="text-decoration:underline">not</span> prohibit the dissemination of information about the identity of the producer (Schedule 1(3)) so that, although this information is not communicated in the form of a trade mark, it can, nonetheless, operate in conjunction with permitted trade marks to facilitate the use of the mark as an indicator or identifier of origin. I set out below Regulations 3-6 which set out the rules now applicable to the packaging of cigarettes and to the appearance of the tobacco products themselves.

The judgment and opinion also address important matters relevant to the interpretation of the TPD, such as the importance of public health as both a legitimate objective to be pursued by the EU and Member States and public health as a fundamental right belonging to individuals; and the relevance of the FCTC and the WHO Guidance. The actual conclusions of the Court of Justice are accordingly relevant to (<span style="font-style:italic">inter alia</span>): Ground 7 (section K) on the scope and effect of Articles 17 and 52 of the Fundamental Charter in the context of the Claimants’ submissions about respect for property rights; Ground 9 (Section M) on Article 16 of the Fundamental Charter on the right to conduct business; Ground 11 (section O) on the application of the test under Article 24(2) TPD; Ground 12 (Section P) on the competence of the Secretary of State to adopt the Regulations at all; Ground 14 (section R) on the application of the rules on the free movement of goods; and Ground 16 (section T) on the argument of the Tipping Claimants that Regulation 5 is <span style="font-style:italic">ultra vires </span>the TPD.

First, the challenge was to EU legislation, not to measures adopted by Member States.  As such the test of proportionality described by the Court was in relation to challenges to EU legislation adopted following agreement by the Council of Ministers and the Parliament; and not the legislation of an individual Member State which does not have that level of international consensus attached to it.  The Supreme Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Lumsdon</span> (ibid) observed that the test for proportionality at the EU level of EU legislation was less strict than that applied at the national level.  Accordingly statements made by the Court about the nature of the proportionality test are of passing but not decisive relevance in this case.  Second, in relation to the application of the proportionality test by the Court reference was made on a number of occasions to the paucity of information provided by the referring Courts. It will be evident to any reader of the judgment that the evaluation of the components of the proportionality test is very cursory and in many instances conclusionary.  In my view this is a reflection of the fact that the parties did not place before the Court detailed evidence. Again I have therefore gained little assistance as to how I should approach the complex evidential issues arising in the present cases from the approach adopted by the Court of Justice to the assessment of the evidence before it; greater assistance is provided by the judgment of the Court of Justice in <span style="font-style:italic">Scotch Whisky</span> (ibid), which <span style="text-decoration:underline">did</span> (like the present case) concern a measure of a Member State.  </p>

Question 1(a) posed by the High Court asked whether Article 24(2) was invalid because Article 114 TFEU did not provide a proper legal basis for it. The analysis of the question posed raised questions about the scope of the measure and the relative powers of the EU and the Member States.  The Advocate General rejected the submissions of the Claimants that Article 24(2) TPD was unlawful.  Her reasons on validity were essentially adopted by the Court.

In the present case, this means, for example, that manufacturers of tobacco products throughout the internal market are able to use cigarette packets which have a uniform basic design and are required to adapt that design to the specificities of their respective national laws, regulations and administrative provisions only in certain details (colours, for example), but no longer in every respect. </p>

In relation to the various proportionality challenges the Advocate General concluded that the TPD was proportionate.  She applied a test of manifest (in)appropriateness upon the basis that it was undeniable that in adopting Directive 2014/40 the Union legislature was faced with “<span style="font-style:italic">complex economic, social and political questions</span>”. Consequently, “<span style="font-style:italic">the Union legislature had to be allowed a broad discretion in respect of the assessments underlying the Directive, not least with regard to the measures which are best able to achieve the high level of health protection prescribed in the European internal market (Articles 9 TFEU, 114(3) TFEU and 168(1) TFEU and the second sentence of Article 35 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights), especially since forecasts of future market activity may be reviewed as to their plausibility at most</span>”. The Advocate General identified the ingredients of this test in the following way:<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>“<span style="font-style:italic">... that is to say, where it is manifestly inappropriate for attaining the legitimate objectives pursued, goes manifestly beyond what is necessary to achieve those objectives or entails disadvantages which are manifestly disproportionate to its objectives. It is irrelevant, on the other hand, whether the measure adopted in the legislative act is the only conceivable measure or even only the most appropriate</span>”. She addressed the sort of evidence base that was needed for the EU to justify restrictive measures.  She observed that the Claimants had adduced scientific material but held that it was “... <span style="font-style:italic">immaterial whether the health considerations relating to menthol cigarettes cited by the Union legislature — considerations which seem very plausible to me personally — can be proven with sufficient accuracy in the current state of scientific research.</span>”(ibid paragraph [156]).  The Court held likewise.  It rejected in fairly cursory terms all of the various proportionality challenges applying a test of manifest disproportionality.  It rejected the submission that the prohibition in Article 18 on distant cross border sales to consumers was disproportionate in broad and sweeping terms (cf paragraphs [131] – [135]); and it did likewise in relation to the proportionality challenge to the mandatory requirement in Article 13(1) that health warnings be standardised on the labelling and outer packaging of tobacco products (cf paragraph [153] – [162]).  The argument that the prohibition in Article 7 of the placement on the market of products with flavourings was disproportionate received a little more attention (cf paragraphs [170] – [190]). In all of these instances the Court referred to the breadth of the discretion of the EU legislature, the guidance of the FCTC, and the Guidelines and the signal importance of protecting public health as central themes. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.04in">“...where it proves to be impossible to determine with certainty the existence or extent of the alleged risk because of the insufficiency, inconclusiveness or imprecision of the results of studies conducted, but the likelihood of real harm to public health persists if the risk materialises, the precautionary principle justifies the adoption of restrictive measures, provided those measures are non-discriminatory and objective”. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.04in">She relied in this regard upon the “<span style="font-style:italic">call</span>” made by the FCTC: “<span style="font-style:italic">... the call made within the framework of the WHO to limit or prohibit internationally the use in tobacco products of ingredients which may improve their taste, including the use of menthol is also nothing other than an expression of the precautionary principle</span>”.  This was consistent with EU law which demanded a high level of health protection citing Articles 9 TFEU, 114(3) TFEU and 168(1) TFEU and the second sentence of Article 35 of the Fundamental Charter. In these circumstances she emphatically (cf. paragraph [160]) rejected the submission that the TPD ban on menthol cigarettes was manifestly inappropriate for attaining the abovementioned objective and thus for contributing to a high level of health protection in the European internal market. The Court did not explicitly refer to the precautionary principle in terms, but it did refer to the discretion of the EU in terms which are redolent of the precautionary principle. For instance the Court, in rejecting an argument about the lack of evidence of the necessity of the Article 7 TPD prohibition, referred to the FCTC and the Guidelines which recommended that in order to safeguard health the Contracting States should go beyond that specifically recommended in the Guidelines (ibid paragraph [178]) and prohibit ingredients which “<span style="font-style:italic">may be used to increase palatability</span>”.  In paragraph [158] the Court again spoke in prophylactic terms of the prohibition in Article 13 being justified by the need to “<span style="font-style:italic">protect consumers against the risks associated with tobacco use</span>”.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in"><span style="font-weight:bold">Affecting or impairing the essence of a fundamental right</span>: An issue addressed by the Court of wider significance to the present case (in particular under Ground 7, Section K below) is the way in which the Court couched the proportionality test where there was a need to balance competing rights protected under the Fundamental Charter. The Claimants argue that the Regulations impair or affect the “<span style="font-style:italic">essence</span>” of their property rights and that as such the proportionality test is irrelevant and the Regulations are illegal because of Article 52 of the Fundamental Charter which (they argue) goes (well) beyond the level of protection provided for in A1P1 ECHR and renders illegal <span style="text-decoration:underline">any</span> interference with the essence of a fundamental right. I address this fully at Section K below. The Claimants have in this regard referred not only to the judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Philip Morris</span> but also to the related case brought by a manufacturer of ecigarettes who complained about the restrictions on advertising and promotion contained in Article 20 TPD: Case C-477/14 <span style="font-style:italic">Pillbox</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">38(UK) Ltd v Secretary of State for Health </span>(4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2016) (<span style="font-style:italic">Pillbox</span>). It is therefore relevant to consider both <span style="font-style:italic">Philip Morris</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Pillbox</span>. In <span style="font-style:italic">Philip Morris</span> the Court rejected the submission that the TPD exerted <span style="text-decoration:underline">any</span> affect upon the essence of the right to property in Article 17, even though the Court accepted that the right <span style="text-decoration:underline">had</span> in fact been interfered with: see paragraphs [151] and [148].  The Court has thus made very clear that an effect or impairment of the “<span style="font-style:italic">essence</span>” of a right is not to be equated with a mere interference of the right. The Court did not, however, explain or even address how that analysis was to be conducted and whether it was separate from or part of the overall proportionality analysis.  On one view it appears that the Court treated the two evaluations as discrete. However, in <span style="font-style:italic">Pillbox</span> the Court did conduct a more detailed analysis. In that case the Claimants argued that the restrictions in Article 20 TPD violated Articles 16 and 17 of the Fundamental Charter (on the right to conduct business and the right to property). The Court rejected emphatically both contentions.  The approach of the Court is significant because it stated that the implications of Article 52 of the Fundamental Charter, which includes the requirement that the essence of a fundamental right be respected, were matters that had to be implemented or applied <span style="text-decoration:underline">within</span> the test of proportionality: See <span style="font-style:italic">Pillbox</span> (ibid) paragraph [159]. Furthermore, the Court was dismissive of the suggestion that the essence of either the right to conduct a business or the right to property had even been affected by the TPD: see paragraphs [156] – [165].  In coming to this conclusion the Court took account of the limitation inherent in the asserted rights themselves.  For instance in relation to the Article 16 </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The Claimants argued that the TPD as a whole and in particular Articles 7, 8(3), 9(3) and 10(1)(g) and Articles 13 and 14, were invalid for failure to comply with the principle of subsidiarity.  The Advocate General observed that the EU did not have the exclusive competence to regulate the internal market which fell within the area of shared competences between the Union and its Member States (under Article 4(2)(a) TFEU).  The principle of subsidiarity therefore applied to harmonisation measures pursuant to Article 114 TFEU, which included the TPD. Compliance with the principle of subsidiarity was subject to legal review by the Courts of the European Union.  That review covered two aspects in particular: first, the substantive compatibility of EU measures with the principle of subsidiarity and, second, their statement of reasons in the light of the principle of subsidiarity.  As to substantive compatibility there were two aspects of the test to consider. First, the EU institutions had to satisfy themselves that they were acting only if and in so far as the objectives of the proposed action could not be sufficiently achieved by the Member States (<span style="font-style:italic">the negative component</span> of the test).  Secondly, action by the Union was permissible only if and in so far as the objectives of the proposed action could, by reason of the scale or effects of the proposed action, be better achieved at Union level (<span style="font-style:italic">the positive component</span> of the test).  These two components of the subsidiarity test ultimately addressed a single question from two different angles, namely whether action should be taken at Union level or at national level in order to achieve the envisaged objectives.  The Advocate General was critical of the Claimants’ substantive arguments concluding that they were so vague that they did not in principle warrant any review by the Court: “... <span style="font-style:italic">their statements are largely so general that even on a favourable reading they lack the necessary substantiation for a review by the Court</span>.” (ibid paragraph [276]). Nonetheless, the Advocate General conducted the subsidiarity review but in relation to the TPD as a whole.  She rejected the submission that the Court should examine each provision of the TPD separately (for instance in relation to the prohibition on menthol cigarettes).  She was of the opinion that each individual measure was part of a wider, composite, whole which was justified by an overarching policy objective, namely the protection and improvement of public health.  In relation to the Claimants’ specific argument that the protection of health could be better protected at the national level she concluded that neither the TPD in general nor the specific prohibition on menthol cigarettes was introduced purely on public health grounds.  Rather, the aim was to remove obstacles to trade for tobacco products whilst </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.04in">at the same time ensuring a high level of health protection.  The prohibition on all characterising flavours was the price that had to be paid for the circulation of tobacco products in the internal market whilst at the same time ensuring a high level of health protection. Both objectives were closely connected and interrelated.  Where a directive simultaneously pursued two interdependent objectives those objectives had to be construed together in the subsidiarity test. The Court agreed with the Advocate General and, on the facts, held that the TPD complied fully with the principle.  The analysis was quite brief. The Court relied upon the overall desirability of the establishment of a uniform set of rules for establishing an internal market (see paragraphs [219]-[224]) and a conclusionary statement that the proposal for the directive and the impact assessment contained sufficient information and evidence to justify the measures being taken at the EU level.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The importance of independence is obvious: a researcher who has no affiliation which could give rise to a conflict of interest is less likely to be subject to bias.  Independence can be compromised by any sort of financial relationship with a person or party who seeks a particular result.  This can extend from the provision of research funding to fees for the preparation of expert reports.  But bias can arise from less overt and far more subtle sources.  So for instance academics have long recognised the concept of “confirmation bias” which is said to arise when a decision maker seeks only to collect or give credit to evidence which leads to (the confirmation of) a particular preferred result.  Such confirmation bias can be subconscious; it need not indicate a deliberate intent to distort an evidence collection or decision making process.  It is sometimes said to arise as a risk when an administrative decision is quashed by a Court and remitted to a decision maker to be retaken; in such circumstances there is a risk that the decision maker will set out with determination to take the same decision again but this time curing the defect that led to the adverse judicial decision. In an appropriate case good administration can mean that a new team of officials is instructed to take the remitted decision with a clear instruction to apply a fresh mind to the issue. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Independence is not an absolute requirement; in normal litigation where expert evidence is required experts are instructed by parties and they may be very well paid to present an opinion to the Court.  The quality of that evidence cannot be automatically discounted simply because it is advanced on behalf of those who are <span style="font-style:italic">parti pris</span>.  The same will apply to evidence submitted in the course of a consultative process.  Consultees advance their point of view and frequently support that with expert evidence. Expert opinion evidence is thus submitted in a multiplicity of different circumstances ranging from consultations through regulatory proceedings to litigation. A common question therefore is how such opinion evidence is to be evaluated especially given that in the context of scientific and technical research (much of which is conducted by academics with no compromising affiliations) a premium is placed upon independence. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The problems associated with a lack of independence can be overcome.  Where there is full disclosure of the facts giving rise to the actual or perceived lack of independence those who subsequently come to read or rely upon the research output can evaluate the research through the optic of possible bias and predisposition.  The more acute the possible bias the more extensive might need to be the extent of the disclosure. A researcher who receives a research grant from an interested party which served only to defray research costs may be in a different position to an individual who stands personally to gain through the receipt of a substantial fee. Disclosure of the nature and extent of the interest may therefore be important but it is not a complete answer. Sometimes the expert evidence might concern a subject matter which is of great complexity and which is, thereby, exceedingly difficult for a Court or decision maker to unravel so that the mere fact that the author has declared an interest does not equip a reader with the tools needed to determine whether <span style="font-style:italic">in actual fact</span> the research output is affected or distorted by that declared interest. This is certainly true of the research which is before this Court, whether it derives from preexisting literature sources or from the new research conducted by experts instructed by the parties, such as the regression analyses. In the present case both sides accuse the other of bias or predisposition. Chantler rejected the suggestion that tobacco control experts were biased as “<span style="font-style:italic">absurd</span>” (Chantler Report paragraph [6.9]; see paragraph [113] above). In my view I would not wholly dismiss the proposition that tobacco control experts might, albeit subconsciously, feel so strongly about the correctness of their cause that their opinion might be influenced by that view. It is for this reason that whilst independence is a relevant factor it is not necessarily the determinative factor and adherence <span style="font-style:italic">to other</span> quality control practices such as peer review and/or benchmarking against internal documents can play an important and possibly crucial role in providing the guarantee that the research output is of the highest quality. </p>

It is equivalent to arguing that all the Defendants’ witnesses were biased, inaccurate, untruthful, and unreliable because the great majority of them had earned enormous amounts of money working and/or consulting for Defendants and other large corporations, and therefore were so devoted to the cause of corporate America that nothing they testified to, even though presented under oath in a court of law, should be believed.

Many of the highest paid experts of Defendants, while well credentialed in their particular fields, such as economics, presented relatively narrow testimony tailored to the particular problem or issue they were retained to opine on for purposes of this litigation. A few of Defendants’ experts had done virtually no individual research and written virtually no peer-reviewed articles, and a few were unfamiliar with the relevant facts and/or the major scientific literature on the issue about which they testified. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Peer review is the process by which an authored work is submitted to the scrutiny of others for constructive criticism.  It is a process of intellectual democratisation whereby anyone can access the research and evaluate it.  Not infrequently a previously unknown researcher or Ph.D student emerges from a non-mainstream academic institution who manages to puncture the previous orthodoxy and thereby contribute to the debate.  The underlying premise is that “<span style="font-style:italic">sunlight bleaches</span>” - by exposing research results to scrutiny their strengths and deficiencies are highlighted and this not only enables the original researchers to go back and improve the work but it also enables other researchers to build on the peer reviewed platform. The process of peer review is routine in the editorial practices of the better scientific and technical publications. Material that is not peer reviewed will not by definition be of inferior quality but since the practice of peer review is so widespread an absence of peer review may be a legitimate reason for querying the integrity of that research; and even more so if it is deliberately not peer reviewed. The advantages of peer review are obvious: it imposes upon researchers an incentive to ensure that their material is intellectually and evidentially robust; it enables proposals for publication to be criticised and thereby improved; and it ensures that as thinking on an issue evolves it does so with the weight of academic and scientific opinion in support. It is a process which enables concerns relating to an absence of independence to be mitigated. The advantages can be seen by considering how research results would evolve without the process.  It would mean that errors or weaknesses or bias in original research risk not being identified and there is correspondingly diminished incentive for researchers to get it right first time around. If research that has not been peer reviewed is then <span style="text-decoration:underline">used</span> as a platform for subsequent researchers to build upon it can lead to errors being selfperpetuated. Mr Derbyshire, for the Secretary of State, put the point in the following way:</p>

Such consideration helps counteract the conflict of interest issues referred to above.  The analyst or decision-maker is able to place greater weight on data and analysis that describes transparently what work has been done and any issues arising (such as conflicts), has been peer reviewed and has been published for critique by a wider audience.  Wider scrutiny can help ensure all analysis is being considered and there is not selective reporting of favourable findings and non-reporting of unfavourable results. Such scrutinised analysis is more informative than a non-peer-reviewed, opaque analysis seen only by a few people”. </p>

They submit that the fact that their evidence is exposed in litigation and subject to judicial review is a superior process to peer review. I fundamentally disagree. I have, in this litigation, had the opportunity to test the proposition thoroughly. I set out my conclusions in relation to Ground 3 and as to the sort of process that would have to occur to enable a Court adequately to resolve disputes of this type at paragraphs [630] – [648] below.  Courts do not have the time or resources to take research away and then spend months unpicking and reverse engineering it so that it can be re-performed using different and improved assumptions, even assuming that the Court has the technical ability to do so.  In judicial review the argument might not even focus upon the actual nuts and bolts merits as opposed to issues such as margin of appreciation.  In the present case nearly 30 expert reports have been tendered and relied upon, predominantly from the Claimants.  For the most part the evidence was simply used in written submissions and as cross references in footnotes to the written submissions and only a modest proportion was in actual fact highlighted during the course of oral argument.  These reports however cover an enormous array of different issues and many seek to build upon prior research a significant portion (but not all) of which is not peer reviewed or from independent researchers. It is an almost impossible task for a Court in such circumstances to assess the accuracy of the entirety of a vast body of evidence such as </p>

This is found in the exchange between the parties as to the relative reliability of different data sources. In his first report Professor Mulligan (for the Claimants) was critical of the 2014 Impact Assessment for failing to consider data sources that measured smoking prevalence frequently enough to permit a valid comparison of rates of prevalence immediately prior to, and following, the introduction of standardised packaging in Australia. Professor Mulligan relied, in particular, upon two pieces of research by Messrs. Kaul &amp; Wolf<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="8">

	      </authorialNote> (“Kaul &amp; Wolf”). There is evidence that this research was funded by the tobacco industry. In this research the authors sought evidence of an effect brought about by standardised packaging upon smoking prevalence in Australia and found none. Professor Mulligan points out that the researchers modelled the trend of smoking prevalence in Australia prior to introduction of standardised packaging and considered the degree to which prevalence fell faster than that trend following standardised packaging. Professor Mulligan attributed substantial weight to the Kaul &amp; Wolf Reports.  He rejected the criticisms made of that work in the 2014 Impact Assessment for an alleged lack of statistical “power”.  Professor Mulligan pointed out that Kaul &amp; Wolf did not control for changes in cigarette prices and accordingly even if standardised packaging had exerted no impact upon prevalence one would then have expected Kaul &amp; Wolf to observe a decrease in prevalence beyond trend but since they observed no decrease beyond trend at all this suggested that standardised packaging had an, unanticipated, <span style="text-decoration:underline">upward</span> effect upon smoking prevalence.</p>

They sought to re-work the data relied upon and concluded that, properly understood, it demonstrated the opposite conclusion to that arrived at by Kaul &amp; Wolf. The episode demonstrates the importance of peer review. It is especially important if a vested interest seeks to rely, and build upon, research that it has funded because rigorous peer review minimises the risk that non-independent research results are perpetrated by other non-peer reviewed researchers with the consequence that a growing body of un-reviewed research gains traction. I have subjected this particular episode to more detailed substantive analysis at paragraphs [619] – [624] below. Ms Demetriou QC, in her closing submissions, then subjected Diethelm &amp; Farley to her own forensic criticism.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">I turn next to the importance of being able to benchmark the Claimants’ expert opinions against internal documents generated by the Claimants themselves. It has been a striking feature of the evidence adduced by the tobacco companies during the consultation process (and replicated in the Court proceedings) that it is virtually devoid of any reference to the internal documents of the tobacco companies themselves. This has been the subject of litigation in the US. It was one of the prime reasons why in the FCTC the WHO expressed such profound scepticism at the motives of the tobacco companies and as to the reliability of their evidence.  Chantler, in his Report, commented adversely upon the fact that the tobacco companies criticised the evidence base relied upon by the tobacco control lobby (which evidence Chantler accepted) but declined to produce the internal focus reports and other analysis which he considered undoubtedly existed. One of the reasons given by the Defendant for attributing limited weight to the Claimants’ expert reports was precisely because of an inability to have confidence in the data and facts which underlay the assumptions and conclusions in the Claimants’ expert evidence and the concern that the outward (expert-led) views of the Claimants would be contradicted or qualified by their internal documents.  Mr Derbyshire, the Department of Health Chief Economist and Analyst, explained in evidence to the Court that whilst some of the primary data used by the Claimants’ experts was available to the Department much was not. As such some of the expert analysis submitted was simply not verifiable. </p>

In a sector and market where there is a systemic concern about the reliability of data and research submitted by the tobacco industry if those companies and parties do not <span style="font-style:italic">ensure</span>, when <span style="font-style:italic">they</span> place research before a decision maker, that <span style="font-style:italic">their</span> research is <span style="font-style:italic">fully</span> verifiable including, where necessary, disclosure of underlying internal documents (for and against), then this is a factor that the decision maker is entitled to take account of when weighing and evaluating that evidence. If that minimum standard is not adhered to then it cannot subsequently be complained that the decision maker failed to obtain access to all the underlying data and information sources. There is an onus on consultees as well as upon the decision maker.  If a consultee provides fully and comprehensively its research and everything underpinning it which would enable it to be checked and verified then the objection that the decision maker has failed to perform a verification (since if it had it would then have attributed greater weight to the evidence) might carry greater conviction; but if a consultee chooses not to do this then a complaint made later that the decision maker erred in not obtaining more data may ring hollow. </p>

Youth smoking is critical to the future of the tobacco companies. 600 children per day between the ages of 11 and 15 start smoking in the United Kingdom (see paragraph [63] above). Children can quickly become addicted. These children become the long term customers of the future and then replenish the customer base depleted by adult quitters.

In furtherance of this Resolution WHO produced a document entitled: “<span style="font-style:italic">The Documents: What they are; what they tell us: and how to search them – A practical Manual</span>”<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>(the “<span style="font-style:italic">WHO Manual</span>”)<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>which explained how to search the vast number of tobacco company documents which had been made public following litigation in the US.  The documents are held in various online accessible archives in the US and the UK and now amount to about 50 million pages, though of course the percentage of relevant documents is only a tiny fraction of this total. The archiving process started in 1998 when about six million documents from seven manufacturers doing business in the US became available to the public as a result of legal action. There were documents from 7 cigarette manufacturers and two affiliated organisations: Philip Morris Incorporated, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corporation, British American Tobacco Industries, Lorillard Tobacco Company, the American Tobacco Company, the Liggett Group, and the Tobacco Institute and the Council for Tobacco Research. The documents include letters, fax, memos and other notes written by company scientists, consultants, lawyers, top executives, other employees and outside organizations and amounted to over 35 million pages. In 2002 the WHO Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean published the first edition of the WHO Manual with the aim of helping journalists, public health professionals and advocates, government officials and the public to search the documents and thereby expand their use outside academia.  The WHO Tobacco Free Initiative subsequently published a second edition of the manual.  The Manual provides lists of research literature into the documents as of July 2004. </p>

And the companies deny vigorously that they ever marketed to children. The documents reveal the complete opposite to be true. The marketing experts in the tobacco companies knew the essential arithmetic: current smokers quit or die; therefore new smokers are always needed. Since the majority of adult smokers begin in their teenage years, this is the group that had to be targeted by advertising and promotions. The tobacco companies have created “children shouldn’t smoke until they are adults” campaigns around the world, without ever mentioning the health reasons for not smoking. Internal company documents show these campaigns to be a public relations effort to deflect the severe criticism against the industry for such successful promotions as those using the Joe Camel character, which may have hooked millions of teenagers into smoking. Also, the companies believe that such campaigns will lessen the number of laws restricting sales and marketing to young people. </span></p>

It was alleged that for about fifty years the companies had falsely and fraudulently denied contrary to RICO: (1) that smoking caused lung cancer and emphysema and other types of cancer; (2) that environmental tobacco smoke caused lung cancer or endangered the respiratory and auditory systems of children; (3) that nicotine was a highly addictive drug which they had manipulated in order to sustain addiction; (4) that they had marketed and promoted low tar/light cigarettes as less harmful when in fact they were not; (5) that they had intentionally marketed tobacco products to young people under the age of 21years and denied doing so; and (6), that they had concealed evidence, destroyed documents, and abused (attorney-client) privilege to prevent the public from knowing about the dangers of smoking and to protect the industry from adverse litigation. </p>

Defendants' marketing activities are intended to bring new, young, and hopefully long-lived smokers into the market in order to replace those who die (largely from tobacco-caused illnesses) or quit. Defendants intensively researched and tracked young people’s attitudes, preferences, and habits. As a result of those investigations, Defendants knew that youth were highly susceptible to marketing and advertising appeals, would underestimate the health risks and effects of smoking, would overestimate their ability to stop smoking, and were price sensitive. Defendants used their knowledge of young people to create highly sophisticated and appealing marketing campaigns targeted to lure them into starting smoking and later becoming nicotine addicts.

They may not act as hired guns. From the above citation from the <span style="font-style:italic">US Judgment</span> which refers to a “mountain” of “overwhelming” evidence, the reference to the internal documents of the tobacco companies showing how they conducted extensive internal analysis of the impact on children in paragraph [3298] is significant. The documents relied upon in the US litigation were held to reflect the current position of the tobacco companies as of the date of the judgment, 2006. It has not been suggested by the tobacco companies in <span style="text-decoration:underline">this</span> litigation that these documents are inaccurate or no longer reflective of their actual, internal, policies and positions or that they no longer reflect the reality of the tobacco market (though see paragraphs [294] – [297] above). The companies seek to contend that they do not target children through their advertising and promotional policies. The Secretary of State challenges this.  He submits that protestations made in Court without the backing of internal disclosure is unacceptable and unconvincing. He points out that, as Judge Kessler found as a fact, disclosed documents from the US show that targeting youth has been a major and enduring plank in the marketing strategies of tobacco companies and that in curtailing branding the Regulations will serve to prevent adverse impacts on children. He cites as illustrative only a 1984 Strategic document from RJ Reynolds which states: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Yet the Claimants submitted in these proceedings that internal documents were not relevant to the tasks the experts were instructed to perform.   I do not agree. For instance the Claimants’ experts addressed and were profoundly damning of the preexisting literature and research base which indicated that branding and advertising were causative of changes in consumer behaviour and, it could logically be inferred therefore, that restrictions upon such branding and promotion would equally also affect consumer behaviour (i.e. away from smoking). The internal disclosed documents suggest that tobacco companies engage in extensive marketing and research into this very issue and that these documents support the Secretary of State’s position. Yet, the Claimants’ external experts who addressed this issue ignore this source of evidence. Professor Devinney was instructed to examine the consumer research evidence which was relied on by the Defendant in introducing the Regulations. Professor Steinberg was instructed to examine whether the Regulations were likely to discourage children from taking up smoking.  The Secretary of State submitted in relation to these two examples that the best, and possibly the only, way properly to test the Defendant’s evidence or to assess the likely impact of standardised packaging on smoking initiation in children: <span style="font-style:italic">“... is by reference to evidence concerning the impact of tobacco marketing and branded packaging on smoking behaviour generally. On any view tobacco industry documents which address the impact of packaging and marketing on smoking behaviour must be relevant to the questions being addressed by JTI’s experts. Professor Steinberg’s assertion that such evidence is “irrelevant” because most forms of tobacco packaging have been prohibited in the UK is patently absurd in light of the fact that tobacco marketing on packaging and cigarettes has (until the coming into force of these Regulations) always been permitted in the UK</span>”. </p>

It was prepared on behalf of BAT for the purposes of the consultation process.  But it was, as with all of BAT’s other evidence used in that process, also tendered as relevant to the broader issues arising in the litigation and was therefore relied upon for grounds which went beyond the limited objections relating to the consultation process itself.  But (as with so much of the other evidence) it was not updated nor was it subject to the normal and requisite expert declaration under CPR 35.  Professor McKeganey adopted the position that at times researchers who generated results in favour of tobacco control were biased and that this was a real obstacle to providing a clear assessment of the evidence results they generated.  In this he distinguished between the “<span style="font-style:italic">natural and inevitable divergences of opinion on the part of different experts</span>”, and bias.  He set out his view that tobacco research had become as much a “<span style="font-style:italic">moral activity as an investigative one, a weapon used by the “researcher-activist” in the “fight against tobacco</span>””.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.04in">Professor McKeganey then goes on to review various pieces of research literature and he concludes with an overarching and central proposition that decisions to start smoking during adolescence are related to factors <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">other than</span> those related to packaging and design of tobacco products. He argues that the appeal of branded packaging is not empirically supported as a factor that significantly increases the likelihood of smoking initiation during childhood and it does not operate significantly to motivate changes in smoking behaviour in adults. In short evidence that supported tobacco control was unreliable because it was subject to moral crusader bias; and the reliable evidence was that which opposed tobacco control.  Yet, and once again I repeat the criticism that I make of so many of the Claimants’ experts, his conclusions contradict a very great deal of research by independent peer reviewed researchers, <span style="text-decoration:underline">and</span> also the internal research of the tobacco industry, <span style="text-decoration:underline">and</span> his conclusions contradict the findings of Judge Kessler who, after a comprehensive nine month trial, found the opposite, <span style="text-decoration:underline">and</span> he ignores the adverse conclusions of WHO upon analysis of the tobacco companies’ internal documentation.  What I find unacceptable is the preparation of a report which by its total refusal to engage with any of this contramaterial simply conveys the impression that it does not exist and that the best way to refute it is to ignore it.  Yet, at the same time and inconsistently, Professor McKeganey accepts that the principles of transparency and openness are “<span style="font-style:italic">foundational tablets of the scientific enterprise</span>”.  Had Professor McKeganey confronted head-on the contrary evidence, including that from the tobacco companies, then it is hard to see how he could have advanced the opinions that he did; at the very least he would have been compelled to provide a proper rationale for why his opinion could be sustained in the light of this inconsistent evidence.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">My concern lies not just with the position of a single Claimant company but, rather, with what has the appearance of being an industry wide practice not to adduce internal documents or to allow their experts to see and review and then rely upon internal documents. The position in this case is quite different to that which arises in typical civil litigation when the experts will prepare their reports <span style="text-decoration:underline">following</span> disclosure and taking the disclosure into full account and where the opposing side to the litigation and the Court can evaluate the expert’s report in the light of the disclosure or discovery. Experience tells one that very frequently the best experts of all are the middle and senior management within client companies who live with the issues on a daily basis and understand deeply the dynamics of their own markets.  These internal views, in all their unvarnished glory, are routinely the most telling and perspicacious of all. I give an illustration referred to in another context during the hearing which typifies just how sophisticated the tobacco companies are in researching how to maximise the desirability of tobacco products to consumers. Imperial Tobacco Limited filed, in 2010, a patent application for an invention relating to the packaging of tobacco.  The Description in the patent states that the invention has as its object: </p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.04in">“… <span style="font-style:italic">to provide an attractive and moderate-priced package for tobacco related articles which can be handled in a convenient way by means of one hand</span>”: Patent Application Description paragraph [8]. Paragraphs [14] and [15] of the Description explain how the invention was to facilitate smoking whilst driving or whilst operating a computer or generally when the smoker only has one hand free.  The Description says that the “…<span style="font-style:italic">package can rest well in the user’s hand, and the one-hand use of the package is fast and convenient</span>”.  What does this presuppose about the state of internal documentation?  It presupposes that a very great deal of thought has been targeted upon the way in which packaging can maximise convenience and speed during various manoeuvres and work operations.  The level of sophisticated thought which has gone into the invention and into the filing illustrates the effort that has inevitably gone into being creative about packaging and how the use of tobacco can be maximised even in those circumstances where it would be otherwise difficult to achieve.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="13">

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">I now move away from internal documents to the next aspect of methodological best practice which concerns the efficacy of researchers and experts addressing the existing literature base. I start with the criticism made by the Secretary of State that the tobacco companies and their experts failed to grapple with the pre-existing evidence base which has been generated over a number of decades by scientists and researchers worldwide. The Claimants’ experts however attack that evidence as fundamentally unsound as a matter of principle, and, in any event, superseded by their up to date regression analysis. The Defendant makes three points which concern: (i) the intrinsic value of the existing literature base which is based upon successive pieces of peer reviewed material; (ii) the evidential value of consistency between the outcome of peer reviewed research; and (iii) evidential problems related to selectivity of prior research. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The first point relates to the importance of best practice to the evolution of research over time. Research is a progressive process; one researcher builds upon the research of another.  Over time advances emerge from this iterative and incremental process and the sum is thus far more than the individual parts.  This steady process is enhanced because along the way each prior piece of prior research has been generated according to best practice.  This is important because when experts, in the context of litigation, refer to prior sources and state that they are peer reviewed and independent this is capable of carrying weight as a probative badge of quality. And conversely if an expert’s report ignores prior research or only selects research which has not been peer reviewed or which is not independent this logically is an indicator of lesser quality. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The second point concerns the probative value of consistent source evidence. The greater the volume of best practice compliant evidence pointing in a single direction the more likely it is that the thrust of that evidence should be taken as indicative of the correct result or answer. This is important because where the accumulated weight of the prior (independent, peer-reviewed) research points in one direction the fact that there may be limitations in individual pieces of research becomes of much less significance. Hence when experts include as part of their analysis a comprehensive review of source material and where that material meets best practice standards then the direction of travel of the evidence is a stand-alone factor which adds probative weight to the particular expert’s opinion. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The third and related point concerns selectivity: the correctness of an answer cannot be decided simply by weighing the evidence in support of it.  In a wide ranging consultation on a controversial topic where views are polarised there may frequently be a significant volume of well crafted and persuasive material that can be pointed to as supporting one side or the other.  But it is precisely because of this that the decision maker must exercise judgment having systematically reviewed <span style="text-decoration:underline">all</span> of the evidence in the round. If following such a review it can be seen that there is a common thread or widespread consensus then “volume” in that sense may be influential.  In <span style="font-style:italic">R (on the application of British Academy of Songwriters Composers and Authors et Ors v Secretary of State for Business innovation and skills </span>[2015] EWHC 1723 (Admin) at paragraph [229] the Court stated: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.04in">“229. ...the ability of any court to conduct an intensive review will depend also upon the evidence put before it by the parties. In this case the manner in which the attack on the economic logic of the decision has been advanced makes it difficult to accept. If a Court is to overturn an economic assumption made by a decision maker then it has to have before it <span style="font-style:italic">all</span> of the evidence that the decision maker considered so that it can be assessed in the round. It cannot be open to a Court to reject the Defendant's assessment if only a small portion of the relevant evidence is relied upon for that challenge. By its nature - and especially in relation to an issue which splits an industry and stimulates partial submissions reflecting defined economic interests - if only that portion of the evidence which reflects but one side of the argument is put before the court then it will, inevitably, appear to be a powerful and coherent body of evidence which is inconsistent with the decision maker's reasons. However, that might be for the very reason that it is only a portion of the evidence that was before the decision maker. To then say that there is a coherent body of evidence that contradicts the decision is true but an inapposite conclusion since it does not necessarily indicate that the impugned decision was outwith the decision maker's proper discretion. In this case submissions inviting rejection of the Defendant's economic pricing-in theory have rested upon only a small portion of the actual evidence before the decision maker. I have now read the contrary evidence. Submissions made have not focused upon why these other experts are wrong nor have they sought to weigh the pros and cons of competing economic theories”. </p>

Valuable guidance on how the principle of transparency might be interpreted in practice is found in the “Best Practice” guidance given by economic regulators who regularly receive and rely upon empirical and econometric evidence from affected companies. Competition authorities are prime examples since, increasingly, they rely upon these sorts of statistical analyses as evidence. I set out below the view of the Competition and Markets Authority (“CMA”) in the UK and the view of the Competition Directorate of the EU.  Both have issued guidance documents setting out “best practice” for the submission of economic evidence.  The guidance is relevant to the analysis which arises in the present case since it sets out how such evidence should be prepared and tendered in order to achieve maximum probative value. Importantly, there is nothing in the guidance which is unique or special to competition law. These regulators state that econometric modelling can be useful <span style="text-decoration:underline">but</span> it inherently involves simplification and reliance upon multiple assumptions and rarely, if ever, is it conclusive in and of itself. It must therefore be verified against the evidence it relies upon <span style="text-decoration:underline">and</span> the real life facts of the markets in which it operates. </p>

There the CMA explains that it increasingly receives submissions from parties involving formal economic modelling and sophisticated empirical work. The CMA accepts that such evidence is beneficial to their evidence collecting and assessment tasks. However, to ensure that the evidence submitted is of the highest quality the CMA has laid down various guidelines. Three general principles are identified: (i) clarity and transparency; (ii) completeness; and (iii) replicability of results. Clarity and transparency focus upon the need for clear presentation of results and conclusions including precise and clear statements of the methodology used, the assumptions made, and the justifications of the methodology and the assumptions.  Such evidence must be comprehensible.  The fact that the recipient is an expert regulator does not mean that all of its officials are capable of interpreting complex econometric or statistical analyses.  This is a recognition that complex evidence must be made digestible to non-specialists.  It is a point of real practical significance in a case such as the present.  The important point is made: </p>

In order to test the robustness of the results the parties are required to provide all relevant program files that have enabled the parties to manipulate and clean the raw data in preparation for the analysis.  Data may be “cleaned” for a variety of acceptable reasons.  However, the CMA will verify whether the parties have, for instance, discarded results or observations because they are considered as “outliers” or because of reporting error. Parties are required to provide precise descriptions of the datacleaning process and they are invited to provide an annotated computer code specifying the nature and number of data records eliminated or changed at each and every step in the analysis.  </p>

So, for instance, in a specific piece of civil litigation where experts are instructed to express an opinion upon, for instance, an issue of alleged clinical negligence it cannot be a sensible criticism that their reports are not peer reviewed.  But it may be a valid criticism if the experts fail to study and take into account the contemporaneous clinical notes. Equally, in a consultation where consultees are given (say) 6 weeks only to respond the fact that the material submitted is not peer reviewed may also be a false complaint.  On the other hand in both of these instances if the expert fails, for example, to address fairly and comprehensively the underling pre-existing relevant literature/evidence base or the points in the literature against that expert’s opinion that may still be a fair criticism. </p>

Article 5(3) FCTC and the Guidelines appear to be unique in international law.  No one has identified any other Treaty or Convention which adjudges an entire industry to be guilty of subverting the public interest and which sets out an international consensus that the evidential output of that industry should be treated with the greatest circumspection and that contracting states should ensure transparency and accountability in all of their dealings with tobacco companies. The FCTC does not however spell out how this circumspection should translate into a rule of evidence or practice to be applied at the national level. The isolated fact that the industry has a “prior record” does not mean that it is not entitled to a fair hearing. Article 6 ECHR entitles everyone to a fair hearing and this in principle applies, <span style="font-style:italic">par excellence</span>, to those who espouse unpopular views or causes or who have a history of recidivism.  And it must be remembered that the manufacture and sale of tobacco is not prohibited; it is a lawful activity.  Article 5(3) FCTC does not say that tobacco companies should not have a fair trial.  It advocates vigilance and caution. </p>

The study assessed the Tobacco Claimants’ evidence as being markedly less relevant and of lower quality than the Stirling group’s systematic review. 37 out of 37 pieces of evidence included in the Stirling Report focused on standardised packaging, none had a connection with the tobacco industry and 21 out of 37 were published in a peerreviewed journal. The Chantler Report referred to another independent review published by Ulucanlar et al, criticising the tobacco industry’s misuse of evidence in its consultation submissions. Mr Derbyshire in his second witness statement makes a similar point about the quality of the evidence filed by the Tobacco Claimants’ experts in these proceedings, concerning the evidence which is continually emerging from Australia: “The reports of the Claimants’ experts, which have not been published in peer-reviewed journals, by various means and using different data sources and modelling, contend that the policy is not working. However, many experts working in the field, and whose works are published in respected peerreviewed journals, are considering the emerging data and concluding that the policy is already proving effective in Australia.” The upshot of this analysis was that by reference to benchmarks of reliability the intrinsic quality of evidence submitted by the tobacco companies to the Defendant is: (a) inferior to that submitted by third parties; (b) generally lacking in peer review approval and independence”. </p>

Hatchard et al examined the volume, relevance, and quality of the evidence the Tobacco Claimants cited in their consultation responses. The authors compared the evidence submitted by the Tobacco Claimants with the evidence considered in the Stirling Review. They concluded that the quality of the Tobacco Claimants’ evidence was significantly lower than that considered in the Stirling Review, both in terms of independence from the tobacco industry and publication in peer-reviewed journals. Further, they concluded that evidence funded by or linked to the tobacco industry was significantly less likely to be peer-reviewed than non-industry connected evidence. Although this article only addresses the evidence served by the Tobacco Claimants in the 2012 Consultation, the evidence served by the Tobacco Claimants in the 2014 Consultation and in these proceedings is of the same nature and type i.e. generally industry-commissioned and non-peer reviewed. This contrasts with the independent peer-reviewed evidence relied on by the Secretary of State in adopting the Regulations”. </p>

Second, ‘mimicked scientific critique’ was used to undermine evidence; this form of critique insisted on methodological perfection, rejected methodological pluralism, adopted a litigation (not scientific) model, and was not rigorous. Third, TTCs engaged in ‘evidential landscaping’, promoting a parallel evidence base to deflect attention from SP and excluding company-held evidence relevant to SP. The study's sample was limited to sub-sections of two out of four submissions, but leaked industry documents suggest at least one other company used a similar approach”. </p>

Some industry experts referred to parts of their reports that would normally be labelled ‘appendix’ or ‘chapter’ as ‘exhibits’, and their critiques resembled courtroom testimonies aimed at demolishing the adversary's case. In the main TTC submissions, the experts were posited as sources of higher scientific authority, representing ‘the best contemporary scientific thinking’ and were cited extensively. Demonstrating credibility was an important part of this project, with author CVs in the expert reports ranging between 10 and 20 pages and in one instance taking up 61 pages of a 98-page report. Privileging the individual expert is a legal phenomenon and the legitimacy ascribed to individual experts' testimonies in the courts is fundamentally different from collectively established and consensus-based scientific legitimacy developed within specialised ‘communities of practice’. The tobacco company commissioned experts, working outside the peer-review system, dismissed the (peer-reviewed) evidence base for SP as flawed and unusable. In doing so, it was clear that they were attempting to establish an alternative system of scientific legitimacy. Another manifestation of the litigation model was the experts' piece-by-piece approach to reviewing. Individual studies were examined in depth to determine whether any—on its own—constituted a warrant for SP and, following systematic deconstruction, none was found to be good enough to justify SP. In court, each piece of evidence (i.e., each study and the Moodie review) is treated as a separate piece of evidence and each needs to be undermined and discredited in turn until no evidence remains that could damage one's client's case. By contrast, in scientific work, it is essential that the extant research is synthesised and greater confidence in the findings established through the cumulative ‘weight of the evidence’ .To sum up, the two TTC submissions (by BAT and JTI) and the associated expert reports used different combinations of the techniques of mimicked critique we have documented here to dismiss the entire literature supportive of SP”. </p>

These documents represent the richest source of evidence on smoking behaviour, consumer perceptions, branding, product strategy and marketing practices. Failure to account for this evidence base has important implications for the experts’ interpretation of the evidence. For example, several of the reports refer to unproven assumptions, speculation and hypotheses on the effects of cigarette packaging and branding. What the reports refer to as “assumptions” have, in fact, been documented in tobacco industry research and marketing practices over many years. For example, with regard to “speculation” on the importance of pack appeal or false health beliefs, actual market data exists documenting the importance of these factors. In other words, it is not simply speculation that cigarette branding can influence perceptions of risk, it is a fact that many millions of consumers switch to “lower tar” products in the mistaken belief that they were less harmful. In addition, tobacco company documents clearly indicate that these brands target health-concerned smokers. This “real world” evidence has been established not only in reports such as the US Surgeon General’s Reports, but in US Federal Court records.

A much more appropriate framework for understanding causal inference is the field of epidemiology, which is guided by the Bradford Hill criteria. The criteria consist of a broader – and more realistic – range of criteria that should inform causal inferences, including the strength of association, consistency of findings, specificity of associations, temporality, biological gradient or dose response, plausibility, coherence, and experimentation. In writing about experimentation, Bradford Hill wrote: “Occasionally it is possible to appeal to experimental evidence”. In other words, experiments are desirable when feasible, this is often not the case in the real world of public health and medicine.

All that is required by Article 5(3) is that the Government “<span style="font-style:italic">protect</span>” the United Kingdom’s public health policies from the “<span style="font-style:italic">interests</span>” of the tobacco industry “<span style="font-style:italic">in accordance with national law</span>”.

Excluding or giving less weight to evidence on the basis that it was filed by or prepared on behalf of tobacco companies would be inconsistent with those principles.

The Stirling Review provides a further context within which independence is lacking.

In any event, even if the Claimants’ evidence was wrongly accorded “limited” weight there is no actual evidence that this conclusion affected the views of Parliament.  The criticism is that civil servants wrongly discounted the evidence but for this then to have tainted the affirmative resolution procedure there needs to be some evidence that this adverse conclusion fed through into Parliament’s deliberations.  There is no such evidence.  Had such a tainting occurred it would have been manifest in the 2014 December Submission (see paragraphs [125] – [133] above) but that document fairly reflects the Claimants’ submissions. And further that view would also, in turn, have had to infect Parliament’s consideration. However, the Claimants did not identify in the course of the hearing how this could have occurred.  Finally, there is an additional more fundamental obstacle: the proportionality assessment I have to make is based upon the evidence as it stands as of the date of judgment, not that as of the date of promulgation of the Regulations. Even if civil servants erred in discounting the Claimants’ evidence in 2014, what matters is the state of that evidence before the Court in 2016. </p>

BAT relied upon this evidence to support the statement that the risks of smoking had been universally known in the UK for decades. Professor Hammond’s essential criticism of Professor Viscusi is that the evidence he relies upon is selective. Professor Hammond, in his report, pointed to the relevant parts of various documents relied upon by Professor Viscusi which were not referred to but which countered the propositions Professor Viscusi advanced. He also relied upon other studies and research, not referred to by Professor Viscusi, which contradicted the Professor’s conclusion. He was highly critical of Professor Viscusi for neglecting the role of addiction in perceptions of risk. Professor Hammond cited literature upon this issue. He also cited internal documents from Brown and Williamson from 1978 which contradicted the conclusions of Professor Viscusi. Internal documents from the tobacco companies suggested that very few consumers were aware of the effects of nicotine and in particular its addictive nature and that it was treated as a poison. Professor Hammond accepted that UK consumers (now) had a greater general awareness that smoking is harmful but he said that there were serious deficits in their knowledge and understanding of the attendant risks.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">I turn now to Professor Klick. He was retained by BAT to offer an opinion upon the literature regarding the effects of plain packaging on smoking rates. Professor Klick is a professor of law at the University of Pennsylvania; he is also the Erasmus Chair of Empirical Legal Studies at Erasmus University Rotterdam. I was invited by Counsel for BAT to pay <span style="font-style:italic">especial</span> attention to this report: I have. Before turning to the observations of Professor Hammond I therefore offer a number of my own conclusions about this evidence which I confess to finding unsatisfactory in multiple respects. First, although Professor Klick was expressly retained to offer his opinion on the literature regarding the effect of plain packaging on smoking rates in the UK the report does no such thing. In fact it cites remarkably few pieces of <span style="text-decoration:underline">actual</span> literature relating to the issue in question. The preponderant part of his opinion seeks to rebut the proposition that peer-review literature produced by independent authors provides a reliable basis upon which to found <span style="font-style:italic">any</span> conclusion. Secondly, there is a remarkable symmetry between the ultimate conclusion arrived at by Professor Klick and the methodological approach adopted by the Claimants generally, which is that it is not possible, using qualitative or quantitative research results pre-dating the Australian experience, to evaluate the impact of a standardised packaging policy in practice. The thrust of his attack, therefore, is to undermine the relevance and weight to be attached to <span style="font-style:italic">all</span> prior literature. </p>

Professor Klick’s criticisms operate at the highest level of abstraction and assertion and he makes no serious or detailed attempt to engage with the actual literature base that he is so profoundly dismissive of.  The conclusion of Professor Klick is that existing literature provides neither a reliable nor relevant foundation for legislation. He is particularly critical because, he says, the existing literature is not “<span style="font-style:italic">predictive of real world smoking choices</span>”. He also concludes that the existing studies are irrelevant because in a regime where all packs are plain the effect of the Regulations will dissipate as smokers become better acquainted with plain packs.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Professor Hammond also challenges the methodological approach of the Faber Report prepared on behalf of BAT which discusses the role of trade marks and the brands that they represent. The conclusion of Professor Faber is that trade marks are a key element in branding that assist consumers to identify brands and distinguish between competing brands and that they play an important role in forming brand identity. The thrust of the report is that advertising can stimulate primary demand when a consumer product category is relatively new but ceases to do so in “mature” markets that have reached a sufficiently large size such that incremental growth is less likely. There is a considerable amount of this report that Professor Hammond does not challenge. However, he points out that the report’s conclusions, as applied to standardised packaging, fail to address or take account of relevant evidential matters such as the impact of the FCTC or the fact that no other consumer product has been subjected to the same type of marketing restrictions as have tobacco products and that accordingly the general marketing principles upon which Faber relies are inapplicable or largely inapplicable to the effects of marketing and branding for cigarettes. He then says this about the data sources relied upon by Professor Faber: </p>

From my own review of the background literature sources this is a correct conclusion.  Professor Hammond points out that this literature has not been addressed by Professor Faber.  Elsewhere, Professor Hammond criticises Professor Faber (for example, in relation to the question of whether brand differentiation under standardised packaging would lead to lower prices and would impact upon demand), upon the basis that Professor Faber is neither an expert in this particular area nor, to plug any gap in expertise, has he reviewed the relevant literature.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">In this area the law has developed significantly in recent years. It was agreed between the parties (and as I set out below) that on the basis of this law: it was for the Court to decide upon the application of the proportionality principle to the facts; that it should do this upon the basis of the best up to date scientific information and evidence; that there was a margin of discretion to be afforded to the decision maker; and, that the extent of that margin was context specific. There is also no serious dispute to the proposition that the Court must examine the facts in detail and that this judicial task is not to be confused with the intensity of review: A Court might have to work very hard in order to come to the conclusion that the margin of appreciation was broad and that the decision taken was within that margin. The level of detail into which a Court delves, and the “margin of appreciation”, are two quite different things. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Before setting out the relevant legal principles I start with a practical issue, which is <span style="font-style:italic">how</span> as a matter of <span style="font-style:italic">actual practice</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">process</span> a Court in a judicial review is to approach the evaluation of what may be a voluminous and complex body of technical evidence.  The question arises because the standard starting approach of Courts in the past has been to “label” the case according to the test to be applied to the evidence, for instance a test of “<span style="font-style:italic">manifest inappropriateness</span>”. Once this categorisation exercise had been undertaken that in large measure governed the intensity of the review that followed and often dictated the result.  However, in a series of recent judgments from the Supreme Court and the Court of Justice it has been confirmed that in a proportionality case the Court must decide the question for itself based upon the most up to date scientific evidence. A number of judgments of the Supreme Court have emphasised that the evaluation to be performed by the Court is “<span style="font-style:italic">exacting</span>” and thorough. Yet at the same time the Court is to have regard to the appropriate margin of appreciation. The Courts have not, however, then gone on to explain how, in workaday practical terms, this is to be performed, especially in circumstances (such as arise in the present case) where substantial new evidence has emerged which, in consequence, the decision maker has not addressed prior to taking the decision. </p>

A case might also be decided simply upon the view of the Court as to the probative balance of the evidence. In weighing up admissible evidence the Court can (and in my judgment should) take account of the extent to which expert research evidence and material meets accepted methodological standards and norms.  In a case where there is conflicting evidence it may be wholly rational to prefer and endorse one set of evidence upon the basis that it is methodologically superior to a material degree to the competing evidence.  In this case I have found fault on this score with the Claimants’ evidence.  But in another case it is possible that a claimant’s evidence will far outshine in probative value that of the decision maker and that might also be a reason for granting relief. I can see little reason why a decision maker’s margin of appreciation should extend to basing a decision upon evidence which on analysis falls materially short of normal, acceptable, standards of evidence.  </p>

In some cases the hard edged errors can be deduced through logic or elementary common sense. But often the howling error might involve the Court understanding complex scientific or economic evidence before its flawed nature comes to light. But parties to litigation have to recognise that Courts have limits. The legal teams representing complex arguments to a Court will have spent months if not years with their clients and the experts in preparation. They are, by the very nature of the trial preparation process, further up the learning curve than the Court might ever be.  Further, the success or failure of a judicial review should not (cannot) depend upon the particular ability of an <span style="font-style:italic">individual</span> judge to grapple with complex economic and technical evidence.

The Supreme Court has pointed out that the test is different under EU law and under the ECHR. This is not particularly helpful in a case such as the present where the Claimants invoke overlapping proportionality challenges under both EU law (including the Fundamental Charter) and under the ECHR in relation to exactly the same facts.  Given that under EU law the Fundamental Charter must be construed in accordance with the ECHR the judicial exercise becomes one of intellectual gymnastics if the two tests are different but must be construed to be consistent.

Thus the Court divided up its analysis into various categories such as: challenges to measures of EU institutions (cf. paragraphs [40ff]); national measures derogating from fundamental freedoms (paragraphs [50ff]); and national measures implementing EU measures (paragraphs [73ff]).  <span style="font-style:italic">However</span>, and in my view importantly and correctly, the Court was careful to emphasise that the analysis was always fact and context sensitive and that the true starting point was the rationale of the underlying rule and the context.

In that regard, the court has been influenced by a wide range of factors, and the intensity with which the principle has been applied has varied accordingly. It is possible to distinguish certain broad categories of case. It is however important to avoid an excessively schematic approach, since the jurisprudence indicates that the principle of proportionality is flexible in its application. The court's case law applying the principle in one context cannot necessarily be treated as a reliable guide to how the principle will be applied in another context: it is necessary to examine how in practice the court has applied the principle in the particular context in question”. </p>

In that assessment, the Court must take into consideration “<span style="font-style:italic">any</span>” relevant information, evidence or other material of which it has knowledge under the conditions laid down by national law (ibid paragraph [64]). In the present case, this is an important point and it bears upon the weight that is to be attributed to other factors which are relevant to the scope of the margin of appreciation. In <span style="font-style:italic">Scotch Whisky</span> (at paragraph [64]) the Court of Justice thus stated that where a legislature has promulgated a measure “<span style="font-style:italic">…where there appears to be scientific uncertainty</span>” the duty on the Court that, subsequently, hears the case is to take into account “<span style="font-style:italic">any relevant information, evidence or material of which it has knowledge</span>”.  This serves to exemplify the point that factors which were relevant, in the past, to the decision maker’s margin of appreciation may become less so over time. This has obvious implications for the relationship between the Courts and legislatures. But in my judgment it does not imply that the margin of appreciation is irrelevant.  To the contrary, it means that the reviewing Court must modify the factors so that they are current and up to date but the Court must still remember that it is measuring the legality of a legislative or administrative measure.

On the other hand, we would not rule out the possibility that whether, for example, a measure has been taken at the apex of democratic decision-making within a member state might, at least in some contexts, be relevant to an assessment of its proportionality, particularly in relation to the level of protection considered to be appropriate and the choice of method for ensuring it.

In my view, this does not, however, strip the consideration of all of its relevance.

The Commission has also been the recipient of complaints from the Claimant association and from the State of Malta and the Commission has received justification from the Government. In my view a Court can place some modest weight upon this.

It is well known that the Commission prioritises its complaints and does not commence infraction proceedings in relation to every violation that it suspects has occurred.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">In my judgment this is an accurate reflection of the status of the Commission silence. It is notable in this regard that the TPD was adopted pursuant to Article 114 TFEU which sets out a formal procedure whereby at the end of six months following notification if there has been no objection from the Commission the measure is “approved”.  It is common ground in this case that the formal Treaty procedure does not apply.  Nonetheless Article 24(2) is adopted pursuant to that Treaty provision and as such it is capable of providing some guidance as to the status of the procedure under the TPD.  Read in the light of Article 114 it could have been argued that silence by the Commission created a harder edged approval but the Secretary of State does not so contend. For present purposes I am content to adopt the softer edged approach of the Secretary of State. Nonetheless, it is evident that the ability of Member States to introduce standardised packaging is one that is subject to close supervision by the Commission and it is equally clear that the Commission has not objected.  The fact remains that even though the Commission received a number of conflicting opinions from the Member States, including objections, it has not expressed any hostility towards the adoption by the United Kingdom of the Regulations. A distinction can be drawn between the facts of the present case and those arising in <span style="font-style:italic">Scotch Whisky</span> (ibid) where a notification of the minimum price measure was notified to the Commission under the Technical Standards Directive and the Commission objected upon the basis that the measure was not justified on public health grounds (ibid paragraph [10]). Clearly every case must be considered according to its own merits but the distinction in treatment between the two cases highlights that the process of Commission scrutiny in this case has been real and meaningful. </p>

This was directly relevant to the proportionality test because it demonstrated that the measures were not suitable or appropriate, i.e. not fit for purpose and they would, in actual fact, be counter-productive.

It is also based upon hard data generated by public agencies in Australia which can be taken to be reliable.

The Defendant’s evidence is in contrast low grade.  It is predominately based upon qualitative pre-Australian material such as survey results.  And in so far as it is based upon post-Australian quantitative regression analyses (such as those performed by Professor Chaloupka) it was riddled through with obvious errors and could confidently be disregarded. </p>

He considered that this point rendered the evidence worthless: <span style="font-style:italic">“The basic problem with the majority of the evidence relied on by the Impact Assessment is that it relates to attitudes and beliefs about smoking, or perceptions about the possible impact of standardised packaging.

Counterfactual analysis is routine in regulatory decision making.  For example when competition regulators consider how two companies will behave in a market for a particular good or service once they have merged to form a single entity they have to postulate how the new (merged) entity will act if the merger is allowed to proceed and is not blocked.  The regulator must decide whether, for instance, consumers will be better or worse off because in the hypothetical market prices will rise and product or service quality will deteriorate. The decision maker must ask whether the state of competition in this new and hypothetical market will be such as to maintain on the new merged entity sufficient competitive pressure to ensure that it keeps prices down and quality of goods and services up.  Similar sorts of counterfactual analysis occurs in the field of planning and environmental development: how will a local environment react (e.g. in respect of pollution or noise) if a development is permitted? </p>

Because quantitative evidence is based upon numbers it is capable of being verified and its probative value or reliability can therefore become a function of the robustness of the methodology used in the research. If the methodology is watertight and all of the underlying assumptions are verifiable and correct then the end result may be said to be very reliable.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Regression analysis is a common statistical tool used to investigate relationships between variables. The investigator will seek to ascertain the causal effect of one variable upon another.  A classic illustration is the impact of a price increase upon demand. In order to conduct this inquiry the compiler assembles data on the relevant underlying variables and then employs regression to estimate the quantitative effect of the causal variables upon the variable that they influence. The inquiry will also normally assess the “statistical significance” of the estimated relationships i.e. the degree of confidence that the true relationship is close to the estimated relationship.  In the present case the counterfactual being assessed is the use and prevalence of tobacco in a market where standardised packaging as mandated by the Regulations is operative.  Many factors operate upon use and prevalence: tax and excise duty; prior regulatory restrictions; the pricing policies of individual tobacco companies; etc.  Regression analysis seeks to disentangle these divergent and variable forces in order to measure how only one such force or impetus is working. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">A complication in the present case lies in the fact that due to the combined effect of existing anti-smoking measures general rates of prevalence and use are declining.  The question therefore, in relation to standardised packaging, is not whether the new measures will actually increase prevalence or use rates, but whether the existing rate of decline will accelerate with the advent of the new Regulations (the Defendant’s position) or whether it will stall or retard (the Claimants’ position).  In this judgment when I refer to an increase in prevalence or use in relation to the Claimants’ case, or a decrease in relation to the Secretary of State’s case, I do so in this particular context. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">In relation to the existence of intermediate effects Professor Hammond reviewed 73 original empirical articles of which 66 concerned the outer packaging of cigarettes and 7 concerned the cigarette sticks themselves.  One concerned both outer packaging and cigarette sticks.  He summarised each article and included that analysis as an appendix to his report. The research articles derived from a variety of jurisdictions: 15 emanated from Australia, 15 from Canada, 13 from the United Kingdom, 4 from France, 8 from New Zealand, 5 from the United States, 8 from Scotland, 3 from Norway, and one from each of Belgium, Greece and Brazil.  Thirty five of the studies included samples of youth prevalence and/ or use and 48 related to adults. Articles in the review consisted of 54 quantitative studies, 13 qualitative studies and 4 studies with both quantitative and qualitative components.  In selecting the articles to review Professor Hammond excluded public opinion articles, reviews, and commentaries. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in"><span style="font-weight:bold">Enhancement of saliency/effectiveness of health warnings</span>: First, in relation to the enhancement of the saliency and effectiveness of health warnings three qualitative studies examined how consumer perceptions of health warnings changed when displayed upon standardised packaging. Qualitative research with youth in New Zealand found that pictorial warnings increased the attention paid to graphic warning labels and overall perceptions of harm caused by cigarette smoking and reduced the social appeal of smoking. A second qualitative study relating to youth in Belgium found that health warnings ‘catch the eye’ more strongly when presented on standardised rather than branded packaging. Qualitative analysis conducted in Australia also concluded that consumers felt that standardised packaging would strengthen the impact of health messages. Five experimental studies examined recall of health warnings. For instance, an experiment amongst Canadian university students in 2013 found that students exhibited greater recall for health warnings on standardised relative to branded packaging. The more up to date literature was consistent with earlier quantitative and qualitative studies from the 1990s. Four studies used eye-tracking objective physiological techniques to assess the impact of standardised packaging on visual attention to health warnings. An eye-tracking experiment conducted in the United Kingdom with young adults involved the number of saccades (i.e. eye movements) towards health warnings in order to assess visual attention. The study concluded that increased visual attention was paid towards health warnings when presented on standardised packaging relative to branded packaging. The effect was observed among non-smokers and weekly smokers but not daily smokers. A second study of eye-tracking in the United Kingdom found similar results among youth. Other studies conducted in the United Kingdom found less of a distinction between daily and other smokers. The impact of standardised packaging on health warnings was assessed on a ‘naturalistic’ experiment in which young Scottish female smokers used standardised packs for a two week period. The authors found no material difference between pack types in terms on perceived seriousness or believability of health warnings but participants reported looking more intensely at the warning on standardised packaging and reported greater levels of cognitive processing of the message content. Eight studies examined the effect of branding and different types or sizes of health warning. These studies sought to determine whether larger health warnings (leaving less space for branded information) attenuated the effect of branding. Two studies in Canada in 2008 involving both adults and youths indicated that smoker and product image associations persisted but the significant differences in most outcomes were not observed until the pictorial health warning reached 90% of the principal display area of pack. Research conducted in Australia found that the effect of branding was observable even in the context of large pictorial health warnings. Experiments conducted in New Zealand suggested that standardised packaging and health warnings exerted independent effects upon measures of consumer appeal. A study in New Zealand with young adults found that health warnings exerted a positive, interactive effect with standardised packaging i.e. larger warnings <span style="text-decoration:underline">and</span> standardised packaging resulted in lower levels of consumer appeal and demand relative to smaller warnings and standardised packaging. Two experiments conducted in Australia concluded that the largest reductions in consumer appeal were produced when standardised packaging had larger pictorial health warnings. Similar findings were found with respect to perceptions of risk. The conclusion in relation to this particular topic was in the following terms: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.04in">“7.2.7 overall, the evidence suggests that health warnings on standardised packs are more noticeable, are associated with greater recall of health messages, and may lead to greater cognitive processing, particularly among youth non-smokers. The evidence also indicates the effects of package branding persists  even in the context of large pictorial warnings, and that standardised packaging and health warnings have complimentary, but independent, effects on consumer perceptions”. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in"><span style="font-weight:bold">Consumer perceptions of risk</span>: Professor Hammond then turned to the literature that addressed the impact on consumer perceptions of risk. His report focussed upon research specific to perception of risk associated with standardised packaging and pack colour. A number of qualitative studies from New Zealand and Scotland found the consumer perceptions of the relative harm and strength of cigarette branding were associated with pack colour. Qualitative surveys amongst youth in the United Kingdom found similar results. Equally the results of these studies were consistent with a series of qualitative and quantitative studies commissioned by the Australian government prior to the implementation of standardised packaging which found consistent associations with colours. Packs with darker colours were perceived to contain cigarettes which are more ‘harmful to health’ and ‘harder to quit’ but packs with lighter colours were seen to be less ‘harmful to health’ and ‘easier to quit’ and therefore lower risk. Similar results were found in adult smokers and non-smokers in the United States and France. Pack colour was significantly associated with ratings of reduced risk and tar and standardised packaging were associated with fewer false beliefs about the relative risks of different brands. Equally within-subject experimentation conducted with adult and youth smokers and non-smokers in the United Kingdom found that fewer false health beliefs were associated with standardised packaging. Similar results were found from experiments in Canada, Norway and Brazil. Two studies deployed experimentally-manipulated packaging to assess associations with weight-related beliefs. An experiment with young adult females in Canada found that women who viewed fully-branded female oriented packs were more likely to believe that smoking helped control appetite relative to women who viewed non-female oriented packs or female oriented packs without descriptors or colours. A study in the United States found that branded packs were significantly more likely to be associated with smoker-image trait ‘slimness’ than standardised packs. In the United Kingdom an experiment between standardised packaging and health warnings was conducted using function magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scans. When standardised packages were viewed these produced a different pattern of brain activity in areas related to threat (amygdela) and reward (nucleus accumbens), compared to viewing branded packages. The authors concluded that the findings were consistent with eye-tracking studies and supported the efficacy of standardised packaging which indicated that daily cigarette smokers actively avoided cigarette package health warnings. The conclusion in relation to this particular issue was as follows: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in"><span style="font-weight:bold">Standardised packaging and consumer appeal</span>: The next issue considered by Professor Hammond was the impact upon consumer appeal. Qualitative research with youths and young adults was conducted in New Zealand, Canada, France, Scotland and Belgium. Focus groups amongst youths in the United States and Canada indicated that standardised packaging was ‘uglier’ and about one third of the youth in the same study believe that standardised packaging would make non-smokers ‘less likely to start’; approximately one quarter believed standardised packaging would make young smokers ‘smoke less’. Qualitative and survey based research in New Zealand, Norway, Australia and Canada indicated that the removal of brand imagery diminished positive association with product characteristics and smokers of standardised package cigarettes rated the cigarette less highly than smokers of branded products. Perception analyses were conducted in Australia, the United Kingdom, Norway, the United States and Brazil. For instance a study of young females in Canada found that fully branded packs were significantly more likely to be associated with glamour, slimness and sophistication. An experiment in Australia in which the brand was removed resulted in smokers articulating unfavourable appraisals. In summary Professor Hammond stated as follows: </p>

	</paragraph>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.04in">“7.4.7 The evidence unequivocally demonstrates that standardised packaging is perceived as less attractive and less appealing, particularly among youth and young adults, including smokers and non-smokers. Standardised packaging was also associated with less positive brand imagery. Overall the findings suggest that standardised packaging is less socially desirable and limits the ability of packaging to target subgroups of youth and young adults”. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in"><span style="font-weight:bold">Standardised packaging and consumer demand</span>: Professor Hammond then turned to measures of consumer demand and smoking behaviour. A growing number of studies examined the association between standardised packaging and measures of consumer demand. A study in Canada found that pack type was an important attribute in the reasons given by adults and youth smokers for quitting, particularly when paired with a pictorial warning. Discrete methodology was also used to assess consumer demand among young smokers in New Zealand where pack options with fewer branding elements were associated with less demand and were more likely to elicit cessation behaviour. A similar discrete choice experiment conducted in Canada in 2013 with young female adults led to similar results. Standardised packaging had a significant effect upon intentions to try a product and perceptions of taste. In the United States an experimental auction study was conducted to examine changes in consumer demand associated with health warnings and standardised packaging. Such studies are an established methodology in the field of economics for assessing consumer behaviour. In this particular study smokers participated in a ‘real’ auction to purchase cigarettes and were assigned to different experimental conditions including a standardised and branded pack condition. The study found that standardised packaging reduced the demand for cigarettes over and above the effect of pictorial health warnings. Four different studies used a so-called ‘pack-offer’ methodology pursuant to which youth participants were offered a choice of packs at the conclusion of a study. No cigarettes were actually distributed as a part of the studies but the participants believed that they would be receiving a pack when they made their selection. This sort of experimentation had been conducted in the United States from 1995 onwards. When asked which pack they would like to take home the vast majority of youth (in one study 80%) chose an established branded pack. 17% chose a novel branded pack and only 3% chose the standardised pack. Similar conclusions were found from a pack-offer experiment conducted with young women in Brazil. Similar results were found from naturalistic studies of standardised packaging in Scotland and in the United Kingdom. Professor Hammond also reviewed literature relating to clinical studies which indicated that environmental cues played a strong role in smoking relapse and that cigarette packaging served as a salient cue for smokers. In summary, Professor Hammond stated: </p>

	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.04in">“7.5.8 Evidence from a range of methodologies indicates that standardised packaging reduces consumer demand. Evidence from a limited number of naturalistic studies suggests that standardised packaging may promote smoking cessation among established smokers, although additional studies are required to demonstrate this effect. Findings from clinical studies also indicated that branded tobacco packaging is a reliable cue for smoking and can prompt urges to smoke among former smokers, and that exposure to standardised packages reduces urges and motivation to smoke compared to branded packages”. </p>

The studies were consistent in demonstrating that darker, non-white colours were perceived as significantly less appealing. By way of example a study conducted amongst United Kingdom youth and adults demonstrated that standardised brown packs were seen as less appealing than standardised white packs and were associated with high perceptions of risk. Similar results were found from experiments conducted in Scotland and Australia. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.04in">other than plain white in the cigarette paper, casing, filter or material other than the tobacco, with the exception of ‘cork’ coloured tipping paper which was permitted. He observed the brand names and variants were permitted on sticks subject to restrictions on font type and size. Six studies examined branding and information on sticks apart from their outer packaging emanating from Australia, Greece and Scotland. He also referred to conference presentations reporting on findings from a study in New Zealand. The evidence in relation to advertising on sticks was consistent with the conclusions about findings of exterior packaging. Qualitative research in Scotland using focus groups comprising smoking and non-smoking participants led to the conclusion that participants perceived slim and super slim cigarettes with white filter tips and decorative features as most attractive with the slimmer diameters of these cigarettes communicating weaker taste and less harm. In contrast longer brown cigarettes were viewed as unattractive and associated with greater strength and harm. The Australian Government conducted qualitative research in 2011. This involved focus group discussions using three sets of stimuli one of which was cigarette sticks. Participants were shown four separate boards displaying cigarette sticks of various brands depicting four types: cork tips, white tips, slim cigarettes and fancy cigarette varieties. The results of the experiment exhibited strong associations with different stick colours and differentiating factors such as patterned tips. Internal industry documents demonstrated that colour and brand imagery on cigarette sticks operated in a similar fashion to that on exterior packaging. For instance Philip Morris consumer tested an ‘ultra light’ product and concluded: </p>

That of the Secretary of State was largely responsive to that of the Claimants (and in particular that of Professor Mulligan).  Professor Chaloupka presented six regression models based upon prevalence data from Roy Morgan and ten regression models based upon IMS data relating to shipments from manufacturers.  In his first report Professor Chaloupka came to the conclusion that both prevalence and consumption data supported the effectiveness of standardised packaging in Australia.  These reports were subjected to some fierce criticism by Professor Mulligan.  It is not necessary to go into detail.  In a nutshell Professor Mulligan in his first report had used a “linear time trend”; but Professor Chaloupka replaced these in his models with “year indicators” in an attempt to capture the effect on impact of non-price factors. Professor Mulligan commented that the variable used by Professor Chaloupka did not however measure what it was intended to measure. When, in a regression model, a change of behaviour is noted between two time points the model will attribute responsibility (causality) to the variables that have changed over the time period. Professor Chaloupka’s original models had separate time year indicators for each year in addition to an “indicator for plain packaging” that applied to every month from December 2012 onwards.  Professor Mulligan was of the opinion that if consumption were to decline from December 2012 to January 2013 because both months are plain packaging months but December 2012 is a year indicator for 2012 and January 2013 is a year indicator for 2013 then the model assumes that the change in behaviour is causally attributed to the 2013 year indicator and not to standardised packaging. As such the model would simply explain how prevalence and consumption for December 2012 differed from the other 11 months of 2012 but it would not indicate anything about the new packaging rules.  </p>

The Claimants say that Professor Chaloupka accepted that in truth his work was “<span style="font-style:italic">so fundamentally flawed as to be meaningless</span>”.  Of course, Professor Chaloupka acknowledges no such thing and merely says that he accepted that in an incremental process he recognised that there were improvements which could be made to his models.  He then set about perfecting his models and using linear time trends and these models, in his view, showed “<span style="font-style:italic">consistently negative effects of standardised packaging on smoking prevalence and on cigarette shipments</span>”.  He concluded that statistically the results were significant.  Whilst he was of the view that the data was promising and showed a significant effect on prevalence and use he nonetheless said: </p>

I permitted submissions to be made about this Report including the preparation of an expert critique prepared on behalf of the Claimants.  I did not permit the Claimants to submit further, new, quantitative evidence in rebuttal of the PIR for two reasons.  First, because the tobacco companies had already been given a chance to submit detailed new evidence in Australia as part of the review process leading up to the PIR and hence the PIR was the culmination of that process; accordingly I was of the view that enabling the Claimants to submit both written legal submissions and an economic critique was a sufficient and proportionate right of response.  The second reason was that from a case management perspective given the time constraints (namely the growing imminence of the date for the coming into effect of the Regulations) and my view that the rights that I had given to the tobacco companies would enable them effectively to represent their views, it was not sensible or possible to re-open the entire evidential dispute. In the event the Claimants submitted both legal submissions and a very detailed critique prepared by Professor Mulligan. </p>

This evidence shows that tobacco plain packaging is having a positive impact on its specific mechanisms as envisaged in the TPP Act. All of the major datasets examined also showed on-going drops in national smoking prevalence in Australia. These decreases cannot be entirely attributed to plain packaging given the range of tobacco control measures in place in Australia, including media campaigns and Australia’s tobacco excise regime. However, analysis of Roy Morgan Single Source Survey Data shows that the 2012 packaging changes (plain packaging combined with enhanced graphic health warnings) have contributed to declines in smoking prevalence, even at this early time after implementation. The analysis estimated that the 2012 packaging changes resulted in a “statistically significant decline in smoking prevalence [among Australians aged 14 years and over] of 0.55 percentage points over the post- implementation period, relative to what the prevalence would have been without the packaging changes”. This decline accounts for approximately one quarter of the total decline in average prevalence rates observed between the 34 months prior to implementation of the measure and the 34 months following the implementation of the measure (the total decline between the two periods was estimated as being 2.2 percentage points, with average prevalence falling from 19.4% to 17.2%). The analysis concludes that, “given the ways in which the TPP Act was intended to work, the policy’s effects on overall smoking prevalence and tobacco consumption are likely to grow over time”.” </p>

The 95 percent confidence interval around the estimated reduction in smoking prevalence is -0.095 to -1.01 percentage points.

There are two important features of this analysis. First, it disentangles the effects of multiple factors that may simultaneously be influencing the observed outcome. Second, it identifies the effect of the packaging changes by comparing smoking behaviour before the policy to smoking behaviour after. A finding that the packaging changes had a negative and statistically significant effect on smoking prevalence, controlling for changes in other factors, would provide support for the conclusion that the packaging changes are having their intended effect.

As with the evidence of the Secretary of State I set out the evidence in summary form.  The Claimants rely upon a series of regression analyses prepared by Professor Mulligan. He produced a number of reports in this litigation. In his first report he presented a regression analysis using consumption data from the Australian National Accounts (“National Accounts”) in order to estimate the impact of standardised packaging. In his view the National Accounts are a valuable source of information because they draw on data from a range of sources such as business, government agencies and households and are produced according to a rigorous and transparent methodology. The data also comes with information on tobacco prices which is useful for conducting regression analysis. He acknowledges, however, that the cigarette volume data used does not correspond directly to the number of cigarettes consumed in the market but, instead, to a quality-adjusted measure of the volume of cigarettes. Through this process of quality adjustment more expensive cigarettes are given greater weight in the data than cheaper cigarettes. Professor Mulligan considers that it is straightforward to use data on brand-level prices and market shares to modify the National Accounts measure of volume into a measure of actual consumption. Having performed this adjustment Professor Mulligan used the </p>

In this method, the impact of standardised packaging is measured as the difference between the actual level of consumption for the years after standardised packaging was introduced, and the level of consumption predicted by the model for those years”. </p>

And it also included a “dummy variable” that was used to measure the average difference between consumption in the years with and years without standardised packaging, after taking into consideration the other differences between those years. It is the view of Professor Mulligan that both approaches (forecast and dummy variable) were reasonable. He accepted that both have strengths and weaknesses. He considered that the forecast method was superior at taking into account the possibility that model parameters (such as the underlying rate of decline of smoking) might be different after standardised packaging than before; whereas in his view the dummy variable method was superior at taking into consideration temporary disruptions or transitions that occurred in the market at about the time of the introduction of the new rules. This would have included events such as stock-piling of packs or returning packs that could not be sold after the legislation was introduced. </p>

He reviewed the extant data on Australian consumption. However, he deployed a different set of data based on retail sales and a different methodology. His modelling is known as “differences in differences”. He did not set out to measure the extent to which consumption in Australia after the introduction of standardised packaging differed from consumption in Australia prior to the introduction of such rules. Instead, he used data from New Zealand (which has not adopted standardised packaging) as a benchmark comparator to analyse the impact of standardised packaging in Australia. His models also seek to control for the differences between Australian and New Zealand trends unconnected with standardised packaging, such as different tax policies. The key results arrived at by Mr Dryden are set out in his Reply Report dated 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2015. In this report he sets out results of a series of models controlling for prices and other potential determinants for consumption in a variety of ways. Nonetheless, he finds that each of the models produce the same result: standardised packaging is associated with an increase in consumption of cigarettes in Australia relative to New Zealand. He states that the conclusion of the Pechey Elicitation Studies that two years post-implementation prevalence would reduce 1% for adults and 3% for children (11-15) is refuted by 2 years’ worth of Australian data. </p>

Dr Chipty’s regressions included three indicator variables that controlled for tax changes instead of price changes. This approach was flawed because prices can change without changes in tax and because consumers respond to changes in overall prices, rather than changes in taxes.   For that reason, if price changes during the relevant period differed substantially (in amounts and/or timing) from tax changes, Dr Chipty’s approach would produce misleading results.  He argued that <span style="font-style:italic">“... any model on the effect of standardised packaging on prevalence or consumption that neglects to properly consider price, especially when inflation-adjusted cigarette prices are readily and publically available, is inappropriate and unreliable</span>.”  He also argued that even were it proper to control for price through tax Dr Chipty had not actually controlled for tax levels but had instead used indicator variables to control for three changes in excise tax rates that occurred in 2010, 2013 and 2014.  Professor Mulligan said that in actual fact there had been 14 separate occasions between 2010 and 2015, not just three, when tax changed. In any event, Dr Chipty’s decision to use indicator variables rather than actual price levels was not supported by her own data analysis. </p>

Dr Chipty’s models (like Professor Chaloupka’s) implicitly assume that the probability that a particular person is a smoker in any particular month depends only on the tax in that month, and not on the tax in any previous month. Dr Chipty thus, it is argued, fails to identify the quitting that results from the cumulative impact of increased price over more than one month.  Dr Chipty’s approach is in any event incapable of taking into account the fact that smoking behaviour can be influenced by tax and prices not just in any one month but also in the prior months thereto. As was evident from Professor Chaloupka’s analysis, this failure biases the conclusion of the analysis by misinterpreting price effects as packaging effects. </p>

Professor Mulligan employs an unforgiving approach which never admits of even the possibility of error on his part whilst simultaneously taking the view that any and all opposing experts’ reports are flawed.  Perhaps he is right?  But I return to the basic objection that I have with the approach adopted in this case which is that it provides the Court with virtually no assistance whatsoever as to how the myriad complaints boil down to properly justiciable issues.  At base when I read in detail the various conflicting experts opinions on this issue (shorn of their purely adjectival attacks) I am driven to the conclusion that the alleged errors and flaws are in truth disputes about variations in empirical and statistical techniques about which the experts simply disagree.  I am of the view that there are strengths and weaknesses in the (reasonable) approaches of all of the experts. I do not conclude that any truly vitiating errors have been identified or proven. </p>

There is no reference in the Chipty Report to any assessment of the reliability of the RMSS data which is, argues Professor Mulligan,  “<span style="font-style:italic">troubling</span>” given that the RMSS data has a propensity to underreport smoking. It is Professor Mulligan’s view that the RMSS data appears to consistently underreport smoking behaviour when compared to IMS data; RMSS survey respondents admit to smoking too little to account for the number of cigarettes that are actually shipped to Australia. Of particular note is the fact that the RMSS underreporting in 2013 and 2014 (the first two full years of standardised packaging) exceeds the underreporting that occurred in 2011 and 2012. Whenever the survey’s propensity to underreport increases, the RMSS data gives the false impression that smoking is decreasing more than it really is. As such it is better to rely on market data that reflect what people do (such as the consumption data) than on data from focus groups or questionnaires that only reflect what people say.  The magnitude of the RMSS’ underreporting may suffice to mask fully the counterproductive effects of standardised packaging on increasing consumption.

There may be strengths and weaknesses in many of the data sets being used.  This is not one-way traffic. The Defendant’s experts identified what they considered to be weaknesses in the data relied upon by Professor Mulligan and Mr Dryden (amongst others).  Indeed, the limitations of different types of data were often acknowledged by the experts who relied upon them.  To overcome limitations the experts frequently make adjustments to the data.  And accordingly any imperfections which the data set exhibited at the outset might have been overcome.  This is, in my judgment, <span style="font-style:italic">par excellence,</span> an area where reasonable experts can reasonably disagree. At the very least no party placed before this Court any route map or model which would have enabled me to come to a firm conclusion that, for instance, the RMSS data set was <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">so</span> unreliable that I should <span style="text-decoration:underline">exclude</span> results premised upon it, or that the data sets used by the Claimants were so reliable that I could safely adopt conclusions based upon them without question or qualification.  And when, where data was manipulated or perfected to increase robustness, the experts then used assumptions and new techniques to modify the data, there was no assistance given to me to enable me to differentiate as between the accuracy or reliability of those assumptions or as to the materiality of the end conclusions to the outcome of the grounds of challenge raised. </p>

Professor Mulligan argued that the “Huber/White/Sandwich” methodology” - used by Professor Chaloupka - was inappropriate because it required that errors of measurement and specification must, among other things, be “independent” (as confirmed in the STATA manual). Dr Chipty has, it is contended, made the same mistake because several factors in her approach render her errors dependent rather than independent. For example, the price left out in one month was correlated with the price left out in the previous month, because prices were correlated over time.  Both Dr Chipty and Professor Chaloupka should have adopted a more sophisticated modelling technique, such as the statistical nonparametric bootstrap procedure.   Professor Mulligan stated that: “<span style="font-style:italic">One would need access to the Chipty Data in order to see in detail how Dr Chipty has estimated her margin of error</span>”.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in"><span style="font-weight:bold">Comment</span>:  Professor Mulligan is in substance extolling the virtues of iterative peer review, where different and successive experts and researchers deconstruct and take apart the analysis performed by their predecessor and then seek to perfect the analysis.  A running complaint throughout Professor Mulligan’s analysis is that he has not had access to the underlying data so he has not been able to verify his conclusions. There is thus in this regard a striking difference between the entirely logical desire of Professor Mulligan to keep “working the data” and the rooted objection to transparent peer review which the Claimants have throughout in this litigation advanced as a reason not to reject that part of <span style="font-style:italic">their</span> evidence which is <span style="text-decoration:underline">not</span> peer reviewed and to give precedence to the worldwide research base which <span style="text-decoration:underline">has</span> been peer reviewed and upon which the Secretary of State relies. Once again, I repeat the process point made at paragraphs [630ff].  There is simply no way that a Court can accept this analysis in its present form.  Even on Professor Mulligan’s own case the analysis is in any event unripe and incomplete. </p>

The Claimants challenge the reliance, by the Secretary of State, upon the pre-existing literature upon the basis that it is not capable of answering the question whether the impact of standardised packaging on intermediate effects will translate into reduced smoking rates either at all, or, to a degree which would outweigh the demand stimulant effect of downtrading caused by standardised packaging. In particular, the Claimants rely upon expert reports from Professor Devinney, Professor Klick, Mr Gibson, Professor Viscusi, and Dr McKeganey. These reports challenge the existing research base at a high level of abstraction. I set out below some of the principal criticisms which they level at this research. They say that their own research shows that standardised packaging is unlikely  to have any of the claimed effects on intermediate outcomes and that the Secretary of State (and <span style="font-style:italic">a fortiori</span> Parliament) have proceeded on the false assumption that there will be such an effect. The Claimants’ experts highlight, for instance, the small sample sizes and repeated variances of prior studies in which, it is said, the same flawed approaches were applied time and time again by the same authors to support a false confidence based upon a preponderance of evidence from their own repeated flawed studies (a virtue deficient circle). </p>

He is a professor of law with a PhD and (from his CV) some limited professional experience in psychology. His report is dated 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2014. It was tendered in the course of this litigation without an expert declaration or any acknowledgement that the report is intended to be consistent with the CPR. He was instructed by BAT, during the consultation process, to offer his observations on the Chantler Report, the draft Regulations and the first version of the Impact Assessment. His conclusion was that the Chantler Report supplied no theoretical basis for the view that standardised packaging would have a beneficial effect. He said that there was no direct empirical evidence to support the claim and that the Chantler Report ignored established risk factors for adolescent smoking of which branded packaging was not one. He said also that the Chantler Report was based upon flawed speculation about potential behavioural effects of a move to standardised packaging. It ignored the crucial problem which is that there is no justification for the belief that differentiated packaging can have only positive causal effects upon smoking decisions and standardised packaging have only negative causal effects. In relation to children he expressed the opinion that measures such as increased prices or stricter enforcement of age restrictions on purchasing were likely to have a greater negative impact upon consumption and prevalence but that regulators should acknowledge that short of complete bans the demand for cigarettes amongst youth smokers was difficult to reduce because adolescents desire risk experiment and norm-testing behaviours. </p>

As support for this argument, the Chantler Report cites experiments, surveys, and focus group studies in which participants rate drab packaging as less appealing than branded packaging. The Chantler Report also cites as support tobacco industry documents indicating that tobacco companies have treated the cigarette package as a means of advertising and that cigarette brands and packaging have been developed to appeal to particular segments of the market.

In the unique circumstances of the present case it is, in my judgment, simply inadequate to sweep aside as implicitly irrelevant the entirety of the internal thought processes of the tobacco companies particularly when he has not had sight of that internal documentation. This is particularly so because, after a 9 month trial, the US Federal Court, in the <span style="font-style:italic">US Judgment</span>, found as a fact that the tobacco companies’ advertising and promotional activities, including branding, <span style="text-decoration:underline">did</span> materially influence consumer behaviour, including that of children: See paragraph [3298] of the Judgment cited at paragraph [310] above.

He opines that even younger smokers perceive higher risks of their experiencing smoking-related negative outcomes than their non-smoking peers, at times overestimating their objective risk of disease and early mortality. Dr Mitchell continues with this theme for a relatively small portion of his overall report. Nowhere does he address the very substantial body of evidence which fundamentally contradicts his conclusions. In short, I found this evidence unsatisfactory at almost every level. </p>

However evidence adduced by the Defendant’s experts (such as Professor Hammond) suggested that historical smoking trends in Australia indicated the opposite and that reductions in smoking were not self-sustaining and could taper off and plateau in the absence of new measures.  Professor Hammond accepted that Professor Mulligan had sought to adjust for pre-implementation time periods (which he acknowledged was reasonable for modelling changes over time). However he concluded that this was reasonable only in outcomes that have only one primary determinant or, in those cases where the outcome may have multiple determinants, where the determinants could be measured and incorporated into the model. However Professor Hammond concluded that neither of these conditions was applicable in the present case. He accepted that Professor Mulligan’s model adjusted for price effects but he pointed out that it disregarded all other tobacco control measures implemented prior to December 2012 in Australia. These included comprehensive bans on point of sale displays, a ban on electronic advertising as well as a comprehensive mass media campaign. For standardised packaging to be statistically significant in Professor Mulligan’s models the effect of such packaging had to exceed the combined effect of the measures implemented in the pre-implementation period i.e. prevalence post implementation could not simply decline; the decline had to exceed the rate observable in the pre-implementation period - it had to accelerate the decline.  Therefore, he was of the view that if standardised packaging reduced prevalence significantly but by less than in the pre-implementation period Professor Mulligan’s </p>

Professor Hammond considered that it was an unreasonable assumption but, more particularly, “<span style="font-style:italic">…an untenable one over time, as these models require constant accretion with each consequent intervention which is implemented</span>”. He pointed out that the assumption disregarded the law of diminishing returns as the proportion of smokers grew smaller over time. In addition the smokers that remained in countries such as Australia were widely believed to reflect a ‘hardening’ population who were ever increasingly resistant to quitting. Whether right or wrong, Professor Hammond’s criticisms identified some of the evidential conundrums that underpinned the modelling assumptions. </p>

These suggested that the effect of removing tobacco marketing did not appear immediately but exerted itself over time as brand associations weakened.  This was particularly true in the case of youth for whom the effects of reduced marketing occurred gradually as subsequent cohorts of youth entered the age where smoking initiation was affected by the nature and extent of promotion and branding. Equally existing smokers may retain, for a considerable period, residual memories and associations with brands which dwindled only over a lengthy period of time.

He gave 5 reasons for this. <span style="text-decoration:underline">First</span>, the Claimants submitted that the introduction of standardised packaging in Australia led to downtrading which led to a reduction in average cigarette prices.  But to the extent that this was correct to include a measure of cigarette prices in the models would make it more difficult to evaluate the full impact of the new measures because the new measure of price if caused by standardised packaging would be attributable to the new measures. The new prices would risk confusing the analysis because they could not be said to be causative of a change as opposed to being a consequence of the new measures. In his view tax was therefore a good proxy for price because it was independent of Standardised Packaging.   <span style="text-decoration:underline">Second,</span> many research studies used tax rather than price because of concerns about the potential endogeneity of price. He cited the IARC review of hundreds of demand studies from around the world which showed that tax was regularly used as an <span style="text-decoration:underline">adequate</span> proxy for price. <span style="text-decoration:underline">Third</span>, Professor Mulligan’s own analysis of tax changes over time was not accurate because it did not reflect actual changes over time but <span style="font-style:italic">“…changes relative to trend</span>s”. <span style="text-decoration:underline">Fourth</span>, there was in any event no consistent data on cigarette prices available over the time period covered by the RMSS and IMS data whilst data on the excise duty per stick was readily available.  <span style="text-decoration:underline">Fifth</span>, using price in any event risked creating measurement error because a price series had to be created (and this is what Professor Mulligan actually did). </p>

To be able to do this a Court would need to be able to verify and test each of the assumptions underlying the competing propositions and to assess the materiality of any errors found to exist.  To take but one illustration.  The response of the Claimants to the Defendant’s position that tax is a good proxy for price in the models is that price changes occur independently from excise duty increases.  Two references to parts of the expert evidence of Professor Mulligan are given in support of this proposition.  The first purports to show cigarette price increases occurring between 2010 and 2013.  It is stated that by 2013-Q4 inflation adjusted cigarette prices were 23% higher than they were in 2010-Q2.  However, there is no attempt to attribute these price increases to tax or anything else. And the second reference which is an annex to the Report purports to show increases in excise duty. This Table suggests that over the same period tax increased by 22% on 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2010; by 8% on 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> December 2012 and by 7% on 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> September 2014. Nothing in this information however provides clear information on price changes between excise duty changes and/or (importantly), nothing indicates whether, even if there <span style="text-decoration:underline">were</span> such changes, they would be material to the outcomes of the relevant models. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Professor Chaloupka argues that the overwhelming majority of studies using crosssectional survey data use a single measure of tax or price and not a dynamic, changing, measure.  Professor Chaloupka thus says that his models and analysis are consistent with widely accepted modelling techniques. This is because complex and longitudinal studies are required to conduct this sort of analysis.  But there are no longitudinal studies at the population level which would permit researchers to consider the impact of prices and tobacco control policies on prevalence in Australia.  The NTPPTS data includes only smokers and recent quitters and cannot be used reliably to examine prevalence and in any event included insufficient data points for respondents.  Equally the ITC Australia data included data on actual smokers so could not be used to evaluate impact on prevalence which focused on those who had not yet taken up smoking. Second, the overwhelming majority of existing research studies using cross-sectional survey results use a single measure of tax or price and accordingly this supports the reliability of Professor Chaloupka’s analysis.  Professor Chaloupka argued that his approach was consistent with the standard literature and Professor Mulligan’s criticism reflected a novel approach that was not supported by standard literature. </p>

For instance, the Claimants initially argued that Professor Chaloupka adopted a deeply and fundamentally flawed approach when estimating the margin of error.  As to this Professor Chaloupka was adamant that his use of the “Huber/White sandwich estimator in STATA” was orthodox and beyond criticism. He pointed out that this model for margins of error was “<span style="font-style:italic">well specified and consistent with the dozens of peer reviewed published studies used in repeat cross sectional survey data”</span>.  Ms Demetriou QC at one stage sought to persuade me that there was a hard edged error because Professor Chaloupka should have used the methodology set out in “Stata Base Reference Manual (Release 3)” which required the errors to be “independent”.  But this was, with respect and despite attractive advocacy, a forlorn exercise. It is, and was, manifest that the use by Professor Chaloupka of his method was perfectly reasonable and, as such, the difference between the experts was in truth nothing more than that - a dispute between two reasonable views. </p>

Professor Mulligan described this as misattribution. Professor Chaloupka in his Reply report accepted that the criticism was reasonable and reworked his model which then showed that the modification made no material difference to the outcome. The Claimants accept in principle (see paragraph [416] above) that unless an error can be said to be material then this would not warrant a Court interfering. But there has been no analysis of the materiality of alleged errors before the Court.  The parties allege multiple errors against each other but do not explain or establish just how relevant or significant the error is (assuming it is proven in the first place).  I have no evidence upon which I could conclude that, if there were errors, they were so central as to make any sort of a real difference to the conclusions arrived in the quantitative evidence.

Furthermore, as Chantler recorded in his report (paragraph [48]) the tobacco companies have chosen not to “…<span style="font-style:italic">present the undoubtedly extensive results of its own internal market research for example focus group research exploring brand switching</span>…”. Chantler suspected, on the basis of the US litigation, that this internal material would contradict the tobacco companies’ public utterances.

		<p class="footnotedescription"> Alan O. Sykes, "<span style="font-style:italic">An Introduction to Regression Analysis</span>" (Coase-Sandor Institute<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>for Law &amp; Economics Working Paper </p>

	      </authorialNote>.  In this seminal paper in 1993 Professor Sykes pointed out that because regression analysis was based upon hypotheses and assumptions it could be unreliable.  He explained that investigative bias could also play a part with investigators working and re-working the data so that the end result conformed to the <span style="font-style:italic">a priori</span> desired result.  He describes this as “<span style="font-style:italic">data mining</span>” whereby a researcher or expert “... <span style="font-style:italic">tries numerous regression specifications until the desired result appears.  An advocate quite naturally may have a tendency to present only those estimates that support the client’s position.” </span> He also pointed out that in litigation the results of <span style="font-style:italic">prior</span> workings which were less helpful were often shielded from scrutiny through reliance upon legal privilege. He stated as follows: </p>

It is not obvious precisely which variables should be included in a model, or what proxies to use for included variables that cannot be measured precisely. There is considerable <marker name="tab"/>room <marker name="tab"/>for <marker name="tab"/>experimentation, <marker name="tab"/>and <marker name="tab"/>this experimentation can become “data mining,” whereby an investigator tries numerous regression specifications until the desired result appears. An advocate quite naturally may have a tendency to present only those estimates that support the client’s position. Hence, if the best result that an advocate can present contains high standard errors and low statistical significance, it is often plausible to suppose that numerous even less impressive results remain hidden, and conceivably shielded from discovery by the work product doctrine. </p>

Before most experts would feel comfortable asserting that gender discrimination has been established by a study such as that in our illustration, therefore, they likely would require that the coefficient estimate for the gender dummy be negative and statistically significant. </p>

Still more difficult issues arise when an exact parameter estimate is needed for some purpose, such as for computing damages. The fact that the parameter is “statistically significant” simply means that by conventional tests, one can reject the hypothesis that its true value is zero. But there are surely many other hypotheses about the parameter value that cannot be rejected, and indeed the likelihood that regression will produce a perfectly accurate estimate of any parameter is negligible. </p>

Ultimately, therefore, statistics itself does not say how much weight a regression study ought be given, or whether it is reasonable to use a particular parameter estimate for some legal purpose or other. These assessments are inevitably entrusted to triers of fact, whose judgments on the matter if well informed are likely as good as those of anyone else”. </p>

Nevertheless, there are often pitfalls and complexities with such analysis…High standards need to be met before a regression analysis can be considered robust – economists have developed a reasonably clear idea of what constitutes “good economic practice”. The econometrics toolbox may always be something of a black box to you, and debates on which particular econometric method is most appropriate in the case at hand can be rather esoteric, but there are things you can do to shake and rattle the box by asking it critical questions, and see if it still holds together… </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.04in">First you can ask questions about the data: what is the data coverage in terms of time period and products or market participants? How frequent is the data (monthly, yearly)? How large is the data set? Are there enough observations to estimate elasticity robustly using econometric methods? Is the data of good quality (are there many missing observations or measurement errors)? Data coverage must be sufficient to cover the relevant products and time period, and the more observations (and more variants between them) there are, the greater the likelihood of finding statistically significant results. You can see that in the extreme, if you have only two observations, chances are that the line drawn from one to the other will not accurately reflect the demand curve…Second, you can ask questions about the econometric approach: is the econometric method appropriate for the market concerned and in the light of the available data…What assumptions underlie the econometric approach? Is the equation specified correctly, and is it line with economic theory and market reality? Does it solve the price endogeneity problem? If instruments are used for price, are they appropriate? How do the results vary if alternative approaches or specifications are used? The third category consists of questions about the elasticity estimates: are the estimated elasticity values plausible (is the own-price elasticity negative as theory would predict)? How similar or different are they if compared with other available elasticity estimates? Are the estimated coefficients statistically significant? Testing for statistical significant helps in understanding the uncertainty surrounding an estimate and informs about how much weight should be placed on the analysis. You should expect any econometric results to be accompanied by a range of statistical diagnostic tests, which indicate whether the results are statistically significant…and whether they suffer from potential statistical problems such as endogeneity”. </p>

	      </authorialNote>.  Each has its limitations.  Most have had to be adjusted to be made more relevant.  A good deal of debate and argument before the Court centred upon the intrinsic reliability of particular types and sources of data and the extent to which opposing experts had used data which was unreflective or inadequately modified to increase its relevance. A data source might be more (or less) reliable because of such factors as: the date or timeliness of its collection; the frequency (periodicity) of its collection and updating; and its coverage (the number of persons or transactions sampled or surveyed). Where data that is intrinsically less reliable is used then it might be rendered more reliable if it can be effectively manipulated or modified (“<span style="font-style:italic">cleansed”</span>) to improve its relevance and accuracy but whether this can be achieved will then, in turn, depend upon a range of considerations such as: the type of modelling or analytical methodology being used; the different types of controls used; and the accuracy of the assumptions deployed, etc. The utility of any particular data source therefore depends upon an understanding of its strengths and weaknesses and therefore in not overstating the accuracy of the inferences that may properly be drawn from it. I give two illustrations (out of many) below of the limitations.  In neither case was sufficient information or evidence placed before the Court to enable me to determine who was right and who was wrong or whether the differences were material. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The first concerned the CITTS and NTPPTS data sets used by Professor Viscusi in their reports on behalf of the Claimants to examine the beliefs and conduct of consumers post-Australian implementation. There is no doubt that this source of data can have <span style="font-style:italic">some</span> value but it is not free from limitations. Mr Derbyshire (for the Secretary of State) pointed out that CITTS data was based upon surveys of recent actual smokers and did not provide evidence on smoking prevalence and did not provide guidance as to the impact of standardised packaging on potential <span style="text-decoration:underline">new</span> smokers.  Professor Chaloupka pointed out in relation to the use of the NTPPTS data that if one modified (he said improved) the controls for the characteristics of the survey respondents then one could readily show that standardised packaging exerted a positive effect on reducing smoking.  This was in particular if one concentrated upon the data which used longitudinal surveys which he considered to be more accurate or indicative (i.e. surveys of the same people over time) as opposed to cross-sectional surveys (which do not follow changing patterns of behaviour in the <span style="font-style:italic">same</span> individuals). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Another illustration concerned clearance data. The Defendant’s expert witnesses relied upon Australian clearance data (including excise and customs duty) which ostensibly showed that between December 2012 and May 2013 consumption had fallen by 3.4% relative to 2012 when standardised packaging was introduced. Professor Mulligan, for the Claimants, in his second Report (paragraph [76]) complained however that this information had been misinterpreted since the official Australian Government data had not taken account of excise equivalent refunds. He said that clearances could not be taken to indicate consumption <span style="font-style:italic">unless</span> refunds were taken into consideration. Professor Mulligan then sought to provide a calculation of the actual results with refunds factored in.  He concluded that this led to a net consumption reduction of 0.2%. Mr Derbyshire for the Secretary of State responded by challenging the relevance of modifying the basic data with refund clearance data pointing out that the Australian Government had already addressed itself to this point. He concluded: “<span style="font-style:italic">These growth rates do not take into account refunds of excise equivalent customs duty made under the [relevant scheme] between December 2012 and May 2013.  These refunds cannot be related to annual net clearances on a comparable basis to other data used to derive these growth rates</span>”.  Mr Derbyshire then explained that the updated equivalent Australian clearance figures showed a decline of 7.9%.  He then, in addition, argued that the 0.2% figure arrived at by Professor Mulligan was itself premised upon data from one tobacco manufacturer (PMI) to which the Secretary of State did not have access (as it has not been disclosed). Mr Derbyshire said: <span style="font-style:italic">“...neither the Department nor Professor Chaloupka can analyse the data used and the manner in which Professor Mulligan purports to use that data for one manufacturer to assess the impact of the returns on the market </span></p>

The parties rely upon a category of raw data; they then adjust it to make it more reflective of reality; there then arises a dispute about the process of modification or adjustment and whether it is relevant or correctly quantified. This is not the sort of dispute that this Court can readily rule upon, Most of the econometric disputes are of this nature and there are a plethora of them. </p>

If I had come to the conclusion that there were hard edged errors I would then have had to ask whether they were material to the final outcome.  A Court would not strike down the Regulations unless satisfied that an error was material. The Claimants do not dispute this: see paragraph [416] above. The experts did not however in any real way grapple with materiality on an issue by issue basis and there was no proper evidence placed before the Court which would have enabled me to form a conclusion on the Claimants’ submission that any error was material. </p>

I note that the validity of Australia as a perfect comparator for the United Kingdom was questioned by even the Claimants’ own experts.  Mr Bezant, for instance, was instructed to prepare a valuation of the loss which would be sustained by PMI if the Regulations came into force.  I have referred to his report dated 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> May 2015 at paragraphs [699] - [706] below.  For present purposes the relevance is that in Appendix 4, when he is dealing with the so-called “Market Model” for calculating lost value he considered the relevance of the empirical data from Australia.  As to this he said: “<span style="font-style:italic">I have reviewed data on cigarettes in Australia between 2008 and 2014, for evidence to inform my assumptions on how cigarette manufacturers may respond to SP in the UK.

This raises the question whether a national Court should pre-empt those reviews, which will examine the evidence base as it <span style="font-style:italic">then</span> exists, which will necessarily be more complete and mature than it is <span style="font-style:italic">now</span>.  A Court can also take into account that the evidence which will be collected during these reviews is likely to be of a broader nature than that which is placed before a Court in the course of litigation, so that the conclusions arising from those specialist reviews might be superior to that arising from a Court.  And a Court can also take into account further that the fact that reviews have been scheduled-in through legislation and are mandatory is an expression of the legislature’s considered intention that the planned review is <span style="text-decoration:underline">the</span> appropriate point in time at which to take stock. </p>

There is therefore an inherent masking effect on the potency of each measure created by the combined effect of the suite of other measures acting simultaneously. The efficacy of each individual measure in this suite is uncertain: some have been in force longer than others and their principal effects may taper off over time yet they will still work in parallel with newer measures which might be at their most potent but which might themselves taper in due course.

Accordingly, a new measure, such as standardised packaging, can be expected to affect (one way or another) the overall downward pressure on usage but, again, the impact of the new measure might not become evident immediately and even when it does kick in its effect might evolve over time and that evolution itself might be variable.  There are, of course, econometric techniques which can attempt to measure the impact of a new measure in the context of other variables acting in conjunction with each other but, as the standard literature on regression analysis explains (see paragraphs [598] – [601]), these models are subject to the vicissitudes of the data they deploy and the assumptions that are built into the models.

For instance, many consumers are addicts and do not react to supply and demand factors as if the product in question were an ordinary consumer product, such as eggs or bananas.  The rate at which addicts may become receptive to the new measures will depend upon subjective factors such as the degree of addiction, the desire to quit, and the strength of the addict’s willpower to persevere with a quitting strategy.

This describes a group of consumers who are resistant to efforts to deter their smoking.  The thinking is that as deterrent measures pick off those susceptible to persuasion the residual pool of smokers becomes ever more concentrated with stubborn smokers.  The literature suggests therefore that the rate of decline in smoking might not be linear but will taper off in the absence of new, ever harder-hitting, counter measures.  This is a complicating factor in assessing, in isolation, the point in time at which a new measure such as standardised packaging may become effective. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in"><span style="font-weight:bold">Uncertainty in supply and demand</span>: A further complication arises from the fact that the way in which supply and demand operates is itself complex since the object and purpose of regulation in this field is to distort normal patterns of supply and demand.  So by way of illustration upon introduction of the TPD pack sizes may not contain less than 20 cigarettes; this is to deter the making of single or smaller unit number purchases.  If average prices reduce and consumers save money that saving will not in all likelihood be enough to pay for a new unit pack of cigarettes.  Packs of cigarettes can cost circa £9 or £10; a saving of (say) 50 pence or even £1 does not enable the consumer to go out and buy a new unit pack.  He or she must save up the 50p’s in order to purchase a new pack.  And in the interim the consumer might spend that saving on something else. This was a point recognised as a possibility in the 2014 Impact Assessment at paragraph [28] (set out in paragraph [138] above).  Since the TPD is not yet in force there is no evidence to indicate how in practice this will impact on the supposed stimulant effect of downtrading. </p>

In short the fact that the product is consumed by addicts means that the effect of downtrading is an inherently difficult thing to predict. A theme running throughout the Secretary of State’s criticisms of the Claimants’ experts was their failure properly or at all to address the impact of addiction upon consumer behaviour. There is a significant body of research literature upon this.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="23">

In their basic economic theory (summarised at paragraph [478] above) the Claimants assume either that the tobacco companies will not react to the reduction in average prices caused by downtrading, or, that if they do react they will compete the prices <span style="text-decoration:underline">down</span> even further in order to retain market share.  But there is another possibility which they have not addressed which is that the tobacco companies manage to <span style="text-decoration:underline">increase</span> prices in order to recoup lost profits.  Downtrading strips the Claimants of profit and they could seek to counter this by raising unit prices of the (now) unbranded products in order to recover some of the losses.  In oligopolistic markets where a small number of suppliers collectively dominate supplies non-collusive “coordinated effects” (or “conscious parallelism”) can arise which leads to price increases.  The market characteristics described in the Claimants’ downtrading counterfactual are: greater product homogeneity and high levels of price transparency.  Standard economic theory postulates the possibility that in such markets prices can rise.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="26">

	      </authorialNote> I would find it hard to believe that internally the tobacco companies have not given consideration to the impact of downtrading on pricing strategy and profit recoupment policies.  Yet their policy of not disclosing internal documents means that this is an issue they have not addressed in these proceedings and their internal thought processes are not transparent to this Court.  This means that their instructed experts can hypothesise about price movements without the risk of their theories and opinions being undermined by internal “real life” thinking.  For present purposes I need do no more than postulate that one or more tobacco companies would or might seek (in a perfectly lawful non-collusive manner) to raise prices to counter profits lost from downtrading.  Whether this would succeed in this market remains to be seen.  But it is sufficient that it is a possibility that makes modelling future price movements with any degree of precision very difficult indeed. </p>

I have set out in the context of Ground 2 my conclusions on the relevance of adherence to methodological standards and I do not repeat them here. These considerations apply to the evidence adduced by the parties in relation to the proportionality challenge. Pulling threads together the following points emerge: (i) none of the regression analyses have been subjected to peer review or to any alternative process by which they could be subjected to any comprehensive verification process; (ii) there is a general lack of transparency about the expert regression analyses. The assumptions which underpin these reports are opaque. It was argued for instance that the assumptions made by Professor Mulligan were set out in annexes to his reports. An analysis of these annexes does not lay bare the assumptions made and many are cloaked in and subsumed by inpenetrable maths; (iii) none of the expert opinions were capable of being verified or cross-checked against internal documents and on the basis of conclusions reached by the WHO and the US courts about those internal documents there is a strong likelihood that a proper disclosure process could have generated inconsistent evidence which would have forced the experts to alter and modify their views and at the very least would have provided ammunition to the Secretary of State’s experts which could have been used to challenge the Claimants’ experts’ opinions. Importantly, the internal documents are relevant to both the new quantitative analysis but <span style="text-decoration:underline">also</span> the older pre-Australian qualitative evidence. I accept that the methodological criteria apply to all of the evidence, from all sides. But in this case it applies with greater force to the Claimants’ evidence because their case has predominantly been advanced through a large number of experts. This is their chosen method of attack. I note also that the Australian Government took the same view in relation to evidence submitted by the tobacco companies in relation to the PIR (see paragraph [522] above). I now set out below some particular points which elaborate upon these conclusions. </p>

An illustration of the benefits of a process which subjects complex quantitative analysis to external peer review is found in the approach of the parties to the research of Kaul &amp; Wolf (see paragraph [291] above). The Claimants’ experts relied upon this research which suggested that the available data from Australia demonstrated that standardised packaging led to adverse health results. It appears (see quotation below) that this research was funded by Philip Morris. The Secretary of State however relied upon a subsequent research paper by Diethelm &amp; Farley, “Refuting tobacco-industry funded research: empirical data shows decline in smoking prevalence following introduction </p>

This set out to “correct” Kaul &amp; Wolf and to provide an assessment which they said was “independent” of the tobacco industry.  Under the methodology used monthly smoking prevalence and sample sizes from repeat cross-sectional surveys were reconstructed from published working papers using an original reverse-engineering technique that achieved (they said) nearly 100% accuracy.  This was analysed as a time series using logistic regression analysis. Indicator variables were chosen reflecting comprehensive smoke-free policies, graphic health warnings, a 25% taxation increase, and the introduction of plain packaging.  The result was that smoking prevalence declined from 25% to 18% over the 3 year period – an overall 28% relative reduction or average 2.8% (95% confidence interval 2.6% - 2.9%) annual reduction.  A significantly improved fit was obtained by the full model which included terms for tax increase (4.8%, 2.7% - 6.8% reduction), a comprehensive smoke-free policy (4.5%, 1.7% - 7.2% reduction) and plain packaging (3.7%, 1.1% - 6.2% reduction) in addition to an adjusted average annual reduction of 1.7% (1.3% - 2.2%). </p>

Similarly, JTI declared in its submission to the consultation that after 18 months, “the evidence actually emerging from Australia reinforces the fact that plain packaging does not work”, citing two studies by A. Kaul and M. Wolf published on the web-site of the University of Zurich, which “have found that plain packaging has had no effect on smoking prevalence, either among minors or adults” and a report by a UK consultancy company, all three funded by Philip Morris. A closer inspection reveals that the Roy Morgan population data cited by BAT designates the same two studies. In its response to the consultation, Philip Morris also refers to these studies, saying that “the experts found no evidence that ‘standardised packaging’ had had an effect on smoking prevalence among Australians,” adding that they “confirmed that if there had been an effect in reality … it would have been reflected in the data. </p>

Nevertheless, no such evidence has been discovered. More conservative statistical inference methods would only reinforce this conclusion.” The two papers, which use nearly identical approaches, have been criticized for their methodological flaws. Most critiques related to the first study (on minors), except Laverty et al. who looked at the second study (on adults). None was based on a re-analysis of the data used by the authors. In this article, we complement these critiques by reanalysing the data set used in the paper on smoking prevalence in adults using a more appropriate method of analysis. </p>

They explain that “we see essentially the same line in all countries” regardless of whether they have “heavy anti-smoking measures” with a “minus 0.4 percentage point effect per year.” Accordingly, this decline in prevalence observed over the past 15 years across OECD countries is the result of a “pre-existing” continuous and uniform trend. Two studies published in peer-reviewed journals contradict this assumption and strongly suggest that the evolution of smoking prevalence over periods which largely overlap the period considered by Kaul and Wolf was associated with the introduction of tobacco control measures. </p>

This suggests consequently that all these measures were effective.

This submission however is not based upon any of the lawyers having conduct of this case having undertaken a full disclosure exercise with their clients.  It is not a submission I can accept.  The experience in the US shows that there are likely to be a multiplicity of relevant documents, and that they might well <span style="text-decoration:underline">not</span> be supportive of the Claimants’ case.

We’ve seen the market decline roughly 2% to 3%, so maybe not as bad as we might have anticipated</span>”. This is the considered view of a CEO about post-implementation Australia and it is a view that – presumably – such a CEO would not deliver lightly not least because it could be price sensitive.  It refers, implicitly, to internal projections being worse than the 2-3% figures and suggests - as one would have thought was inevitable – that internal assessments of future sales in the light of standardised packaging had been undertaken.  It also confirms the conclusions of the Defendant’s experts who rely upon this 2-3% figure and whose own quantitative analysis generates figures of this order of magnitude.  As I have said elsewhere the impact of standardised packaging in Australia simply must have involved the tobacco companies in predicting future sales.  Their marketing men would have been failing in their elementary duties if they had not done this.  If all of this <span style="font-style:italic">internal</span> analysis was held up and put side by side with <span style="font-style:italic">external</span> expert reports it would put them into context.  If the external experts had been seised of all of the internal projections of their clients when they prepared their reports this would have forced them to address that internal material, to modify their own views or at least to explain in a credible way why the internal analysis was wrong or unreliable.  And if that internal material corroborated the expert’s conclusion that would enhance the reliability of those reports before the Court.  In my judgment I am bound to be cautious of analysis created entirely by experts prepared in blissful ignorance of the clients’ internal analysis and research.</p>

If the Court is required to take a decision on evidence that was not before the decision maker, which may include a legislature, then the extent to which judicial deference can apply is diluted since the Court is grappling with evidence that the decision maker never addressed itself to.  Indeed on this basis a Court might strike down a measure whilst concluding simultaneously that at the time the impugned measure was adopted the legislature acted perfectly lawfully.  And the longer the period of time between the initial decision and the Court proceedings and the greater the volume of new evidence the less logical it becomes to accord to the decision maker deference because of its status. </p>

To achieve an appropriate balance I have sought to apply the sorts of margin of appreciation factors that would apply to the decision maker, and which are consonant with the facts of this case, to the evidence before the Court.  The Court thus adopts the mantle and garb of the decision maker and then, within the confines of the appropriate margin of appreciation, applies up to date evidence.  The way in which relevant margin of appreciation factors apply might alter with the passage of time.  I have for instance, as set out above, taken into account whether the precautionary principle <span style="font-style:italic">still</span> applies and whether the decision to adopt the Regulations <span style="font-style:italic">remains</span> predictive and whether the evidence <span style="font-style:italic">remains</span> insufficiently robust or mature, etc.  These were all factors relevant to the original decision and I have re-tested them against the evidence as it exists as of the date of judgment and made the appropriate adjustments.  In this way the Court complies with the instructions given to it by the Supreme Court and the Court of Justice in cases of this sort, yet respect the constitutional limits inherent in the fact that this is a judicial review of legislation.  </p>

I start with some very general observations. The evidence was voluminous and highly complex.  Expert evidence is adduced in many different types of Court proceedings and, in the main, it is of such a nature that it is comprehensible to the normal Court.  An example is medical evidence in clinical negligence trials; experience indicates that the issues in such cases invariably boil down to narrow disputes of fact which are capable of being understood and analysed by a Court.  Most of the evidence tendered in this case, in contrast, is <span style="text-decoration:underline">not</span> the sort that would be easily digestible and readily understood by a Court.  I form this view from the perspective of a judge with at least some background and knowledge of economic and econometric analysis.  I note that the same point has been made by specialist regulators whose best practice guidelines emphasise that cases cannot be resolved at the level of high level discourse between experts (see paragraph [326] above).  The evidence has to be comprehensible to non-experts.  I am not however criticising the parties for choosing to serve empirical evidence of the sort in issue: it is appropriate evidence in the context of this case.

In the present case a major difficulty for me has been in both identifying and then being able to test the assumptions which underlie a great deal of the expert evidence. If Courts are to be able to rule, effectively, upon complex economic evidence then it is very important that the assumptions which underpin models are laid bare. It will not suffice for assumptions to be concealed amidst or submerged below a welter of complex jargon or maths. Rarely, if ever, should a Court be asked to resolve a dispute based on maths. Such matters should be capable of expert resolution and agreement prior to a hearing.   </p>

The Court must be confident that the experts are aware that their overriding and primary duty is to the Court and this awareness must feed, constructively, into the exercise of boiling down the expert evidence to manageable proportions.  This is not adherence to mere formalities.  The CPR requires, for instance, that experts set out in a balanced way material both for and against themselves (see paragraphs [316] – [319] above).  The expert declaration is not a mere mantra; it should be viewed as a statement that the experts take seriously and truly adhere to.  </p>

In a judicial review it should, ordinarily, be possible to reduce the disputes to a relatively modest number of issues to be decided.  It will be evident from this judgment that I take the view, at least in a case such as this, that a disclosure exercise would need to have been undertaken as part of this process. The earlier the parties and the Court engage with this process the more likely it is that the disclosure exercise may be calibrated to the needs of the case in a proportionate manner.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in"><span style="font-weight:bold">Appointment of experts / assessors to assist the Court</span>: If at the end result of the boiling down process there remains a large number of outstanding disputes the Court might seek an explanation as to why this is so and the Court might require the parties to use the services of an independent third party expert to assist in reducing the scope of the dispute yet further.  This could be through a form of expert mediation as between the parties or by the preparation of a report from the third party expert for the assistance of the Court.  A Court might need to give directions as to the costs of this exercise and make any orders for disclosure that are relevant. I reiterate that the purpose of this is (i) to compel the parties to reduce to the utmost minimum the number of actual disputes to be resolved by the Court; and (ii) to ensure that the Court is given maximum assistance. The use of assessors and external experts to assist a Court is rare but by no means unheard of. It is, for instance, a practice used in patent cases, even where the judges <span style="font-style:italic">are</span> specialised in and may possess, themselves, relevant scientific background:  See by way of illustration the discussion of the practice of appointing assessors in the procedural judgment of Birss J in <span style="font-style:italic">Electromagnetic Geoservices ASA v Petroleum Geo-Services ASA et ors</span> [2016] EWHC 27 (Pat) at paragraphs [27] - [36]. The power to appoint assessors exists under Section 70(1) Senior Courts Act 1981, and, CPR 35.15.  The assessor appointed under this procedure becomes a quasi-judicial official whose task it is to assist the Court. The assessor plays such part in the proceedings as the Court directs and this can include, <span style="font-style:italic">inter alia</span>, preparing a report for the Court on any matter at issue in the proceedings and attending the whole or any part of the trial to advise the Court. Provision is made for the communication to the parties of any report that the assessor prepares before the trial has begun. In <span style="font-style:italic">Electromagnetic Geoservices ASA</span> (ibid) Birss J ordered the appointment of a Marine CSEM (Controlled Source Electromagnetic) scientist to provide a non-controversial one-day introductory course to the judge in the use of a particular technology to locate marine oil deposits.  It is clear that such assessors can be used imaginatively to provide whatever level of assistance is required by the Court.  In a complex case, for instance, where the Court was not satisfied that the parties’ initial efforts to reduce the technical issues to manageable proportions were sufficient the Court might obtain the assistance of an assessor in requiring the parties, through appropriate directions, to further boil down the issues; or an assessor might be useful in providing guidance and advice to the Court in how to resolve outstanding issues; or, as in <span style="font-style:italic">Electromagnetic Geoservices </span>ASA, an assessor might provide a general or introductory education to the judge. In the final judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Electromagnetic Geoservices ASA </span>[2016] EWCA (Pat) 881 the judge, following the trial, explained how useful the teach-in process had been.  He made the telling point that what mattered with experts was not just their actual opinions but also “… <span style="font-style:italic">the material on which those opinions are based and the reasons for them</span>” (ibid paragraph [7]).   This short judgment is a useful explanation of how and why the use of third party assessors can save Court time and overall costs and lead to better justice. </p>

That conclusion is supported and reinforced by my analysis of the Claimants’ evidence. The quantitative (econometric) evidence adduced by Professor Mulligan and Mr Dryden was sophisticated and thorough. It does not however serve to exclude the competing quantitative evidence relied upon by the Secretary of State. The Claimants’ evidence was not benchmarked against potentially inconsistent internal documents from the Claimant tobacco companies, it had not been through any verification process (whether peer review, or regulatory evaluation, or a pre-hearing process such as that described above), and the assumptions which provided its bedrock were opaque. Furthermore, there are serious doubts as to whether the data which is relied upon is, as yet, sufficiently voluminous or longstanding to be robust and reliable. Ultimately, the disagreements between the experts were no more than reasonable experts disagreeing over the nuts and bolts of the regression analysis. There were no “hard edged” errors identified of a type which would lead a Court to conclude that the Secretary of State’s quantitative evidence was so flawed that it should be discounted or ignored. My conclusion is further supported by various factors which indicate that a relatively broad margin of appreciation must be applied to Parliament even when viewed through the up to date evidential optic of the proceedings before this Court. For all of the above reasons, and on the basis of the most up  to date evidence,  I reject the Claimants’ submission that the Regulations are disproportionate because the measures are not appropriate or suitable. </p>

In <span style="font-style:italic">Scotch Whisky</span> there were clear, and fact specific, reasons established by settled case law which explain why the Court of Justice doubted the necessity for Scotland to introduce a minimum price per unit of alcohol (“MPU”). This was because increases in duty are ultimately reflected in final retail prices and, as with any MPU, they therefore raise floor prices.

In this case I have a real difficulty with the absence of quantitative or indeed any evidence as to the actual level of tax increase that the Claimants submit would be sufficient to achieve the objective of standardised packaging. At one level it stands to reason that if the Government wished to eliminate smoking it could do so by (say) increasing excise duties and other taxes by 10,000% or more.  Virtually overnight all purchases of tobacco would cease. Of course the Government would then get no revenue from tobacco as sales evaporated. But as a blunt yet effective instrument of health policy tax works. As such tax could also eliminate the need for <span style="text-decoration:underline">any</span> other regulatory measure to be adopted, including standardised packaging and other advertising restrictions. The WHO would not need to recommend any additional measures because no one would be able to afford to smoke anyway. The tobacco companies would simply fold. The reality however is that tobacco control regimes operating within the EU and in the United Kingdom and elsewhere throughout the world all assume that Governments do <span style="text-decoration:underline">not</span> use tax as the sole mechanism to eliminate the health problem. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in"><span style="font-weight:bold">Health inequalities/addiction</span>: One aspect of the justification for standardised packaging is the removal of health inequalities. This was an important issue addressed in the 2014 Impact Assessment at paragraphs [10] – [13]. Tobacco is already a highly taxed product; using tax as the sole or dominant method of control risks placing a disproportionate financial burden on the socially and financially disadvantaged. It hits them far harder in their pockets than it does more affluent consumers. Standardised packaging does not have this financial effect. And if the less affluent consumers are addicted then the increased costs are unavoidable which tends to exacerbate the health inequalities that standardised package restrictions seek to reduce or eliminate. Taxation further does little, or at least far less, to deter new uptake amongst the young, <span style="font-style:italic">as yet</span>, irregular smoker, who will not be spending as much on tobacco but promotion and branding restrictions are targeted at this cohort. Equally, increased taxation does nothing to change attitudes about smoking or to “denormalise” a product which for decades has been perceived as normal. The relative positions of standardised packaging and tax sit in contrast to <span style="font-style:italic">Scotch Whisky</span> where, as I have already explained, tax increases and minimum prices have long been recognised as working through the same retail price deterrent mechanism.  Combining tax and advertising measures is in contrast a strategy which addresses supply and demand from different angles and perspectives. </p>

In this case the position set out in the 2014 Impact Assessment and in the evidence before the Court is that there is no specific quantity of effect which is hoped for.  It is accepted that the benefit might be relatively modest in terms of numbers affected but, as the net monetised assessment shows, in the longer term the cumulative impact is very substantial. In any process of comparing and contrasting the effect of the Regulations as against a putative tax increase the uncertainty as to the exact effects is a relevant factor. If the precise effect of the Regulations is not quantifiable then it is impossible to modulate tax so as to achieve the same effect. All that could be done is to err on the side of caution and impose a tax increase which was of a magnitude which would safely exceed any possible effect of the Regulations but this risks being a blunt instrument and highlights why tax and advertising restrictions are part of a complementary suite of measure rather than substitutes for each other. </p>

The two posited (increased education and improved health warnings) are already part of the overall package of measures and they do not address the specific objective of the advertising restrictions. An enhanced educational message might reinforce the increased saliency of the health warning brought about by the introduction of standardised packaging but it does not replace it. Equally increased health warnings are said to be rendered more efficacious by the advertising restrictions and so supplement them but do not substitute for them. The two suggested solutions work in tandem with standardised packaging but not in substitution. At all events the submissions are mere assertion and do not impose upon the state a burden of proof to disprove them. </p>

In <span style="font-style:italic">Scotch Whisky</span> that meant assessing the impact of the MPU on “<span style="font-style:italic">free movement of goods</span>” (ibid cf. paragraph [58]).  There it was possible to calculate with precision what the MPU would be for a given drink by reference to a stipulated statutory formula (ibid paragraph [7]) and it was accordingly possible also to determine accurately what the actual impact upon the freedom to set prices would otherwise be. In the present case the core objection of the Tobacco Claimants is not as to the free movement of goods but as to the impact upon their property rights and their ability to use those rights to maximise their profits. In this light it is hard to see how a tax which reduces the profits of the tobacco companies is more or less restrictive than advertising restrictions which achieve the same end. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">As set out above (see paragraph [429]) there is some debate as to whether the proportionality test in EU law incorporates as an ingredient an overall balancing of the rights and interests of the various parties, here the State invoking public health and the tobacco industry invoking private rights to property. The Secretary of State submitted that this limb of the proportionality test did not arise.  The Claimants submit to the contrary that it does. As already observed the Supreme Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Lumsdon</span> merely observed that sometimes the Court of Justice recognises the existence of this limb of the proportionality test but that in other cases it does not, and that there is no clear articulation in the case law which explains the difference in approach.  The issue is in this case academic because I propose to address the issue regardless of the debate.  Nonetheless, had it been critical I would have held that the proportionality <span style="font-style:italic">strictu sensu</span> limb <span style="font-style:italic">is</span> relevant in this case.  In my judgment this is because the basic fundamental right said by the Claimants to be trespassed upon by the Regulations is the right to property under A1P1 of the ECHR and the equivalent in the EU under the Fundamental Charter and, according to the Fundamental Charter, there is intended to be coincidence of application between the ECHR and the Charter.  It is not in dispute that such a balancing test does arise under the ECHR (see for instance <span style="font-style:italic">Vékony </span>discussed at paragraphs [753] – [770] below) and hence in an EU case where the Charter is at stake or where the ECHR is prayed in aid as a general principle of EU law, it would be inconsistent to refrain from similarly applying this component of the proportionality test.  To do otherwise would be to create the risk that a Court would apply two different tests when deciding whether the same fundamental right was breached, even though the tests under EU law and the ECHR were intended to be the same.  I draw support from the fact that in <span style="font-style:italic">Philip Morris</span> (ibid) Advocate General Kokott applied this limb of the proportionality test to the TPD as did the Court of Justice (see paragraphs [271] – [272] above). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">I also take the view that where the EU “proportionality <span style="font-style:italic">strictu sensu</span>” limb applies it will have the same effect as the ECHR “<span style="font-style:italic">fair balance</span>” test.  I can detect no material difference between the factors taken into account under the ECHR <span style="font-style:italic">fair balance</span> test and the considerations taken into account by the Court of Justice in cases where it applies the “proportionality <span style="font-style:italic">strictu sensu</span>” test, and this seems to have been the approach of the Advocate General and Court of Justice in <span style="font-style:italic">Philip Morris</span>.  Again, and certainly in a case involving the ECHR and/or Fundamental Charter rights, it would be inconsistent for the tests to operate in a substantively different manner.  </p>

But there was no analysis of the extent of this interest.  The fact that the tobacco manufacturers already use national trade marks and develop national brands means that parallel importers already have to address the consequences of differences in trade marks across the EU.  In some respects the introduction of absolutely standard rules might even make repackaging easier for parallel importers.  At all events this was not an interest which the manufacturers pressed hard and for good reason.

With such data one can then extract “<span style="font-style:italic">…a conservative minimum value for the assets</span>” but not an indication of the economic benefit derived from ownership. The Cost Approach would be based upon the costs that “<span style="font-style:italic">…each tobacco company has individually invested</span>”. The second approach that he advocates is the Relief from Royalty Approach. This involves an analysis of royalty rates paid under comparable licence agreements. It also establishes income levels generated through the use of assets. He concludes that the two methodologies he has identified are the most appropriate in the present situation.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">I now summarise, briefly, the transactions upon which Mr Anson relies to arrive at his conclusion of lost value. The first was the acquisition by Reynolds American Inc. in July 2014 of Lorillard for $27.4 billion. He accepts that at the time of writing no detailed purchase price allocation was available but he felt able to draw conclusions regarding the value of the goodwill and intangible assets by analysing the target’s latest quarterly financial results. There is no analysis of why a transaction in 2014 which does not relate to the UK property rights and which pre-dates the TPD is relevant.  The second transaction considered is much older and concerned the acquisition in February 2008 by BAT of Tekel, the Turkish State-owned tobacco company for $1.72 billion. He observes, from published accounts, that the value of intangible assets acquired and goodwill comprised 89% of the purchase price. Again how or why this is relevant is not explained. The third transaction identified was the acquisition by Lorillard in October 2013 of SKYCIG® the target was a UK based electronic cigarette business. Mr Anson observes that from published documents Lorillard disclosed that 74% of the purchase price was paid to acquire trade marks. This, conceivably, might have been closer to home but the analysis is so sparse as to provide no sensible basis for proper inferences to be drawn. The final transaction identified was the acquisition by Imperial Tobacco Group Plc in July 2014 of a portfolio of US cigarette brands from Reynolds American Inc. for $7.1 billion. From public documents he infers that 88.7% of the purchase price was attributable to goodwill and intangible assets. Once again why or how the acquisition of US property rights is relevant to the UK market is not explained.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">It will be seen that the analysis conducted is of a small number of international transactions with no or no obvious or material relevance to the UK market. Whilst they establish the (in my view) obvious conclusion that intellectual property rights may have significant value, they provide very little if anything at all which would enable anyone to identify what the incremental loss of value was to any particular tobacco company from the introduction of the Regulations either at all or following on from the implementation of the TPD. It is, in my view, impossible to find any support for the conclusion of Mr Anson or Mr Silva and repeated in submissions by the parties  that the actual loss of brand value could be measured in “billions” of pounds sterling or anything remotely like that. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">In the context of the above I am satisfied, because it is common sense, that the Claimant tobacco companies will have conducted some analysis, internally, of the economic and financial implications for each of them of the introduction of the Regulations. None of that analysis is before the Court or has been (apparently) seen by the experts instructed by the tobacco companies. It would have been open to any of the Claimants to instruct an expert to review, in detail, the actual putative loss by reference to any one or more of the methodologies favoured by Mr Anson as applied to the UK property rights in issue set against the backdrop of the introduction of the TPD and the Regulations, but this has not been done.

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Second, Mr Bezant sets out his key assumptions in paragraph 2.11 of his Report. When modelling losses into the future he has however nowhere taken into account that the mandatory advertising and promotional rules and restrictions in the TPD come into effect at the same time as the Regulations (May 2016).  The TPD measures will substantially curtail the ability of the tobacco companies to use their trade marks and seek quite deliberately to undermine their attractive effects by <span style="font-style:italic">(inter alia</span>) increased health warning saliency and imposing prohibitions upon certain types of advertising and promotion.  Indeed, the Claimants have argued as an independent ground of challenge that the Secretary of State erred in failing to take into account the substantial effect of the TPD (see Section O, Ground 11) when concluding that the Regulations would be effective.  The premise behind that ground is that the TPD is very restrictive and likely to be effective in curtailing tobacco company advertising and promotional efforts.  The TPD will therefore by its very nature make the Claimants’ trade marks less valuable in the United Kingdom.  The loss that is attributable to the Regulations can thus <span style="font-style:italic">only</span> be that which is incremental over and above that caused by the TPD.  The instructions given to Mr Bezant are set out in his report.  He was not however asked to model loss taking into account this <span style="font-style:italic">novus actus interveniens</span>.  For this reason it is highly probable that the loss he identifies as attributable to the Regulations is very substantially overstated.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Third, even if Mr Bezant’s analysis were correct it would still mean that the cost/benefit analysis contained in the 2014 Impact Assessment came squarely down on the side of favouring the public over the private interest, such is the vast gulf between the costs imposed upon the state and the loss of value to the tobacco companies.  Mr Bezant assumes that the loss must be assessed in perpetuity (and therefore well after the ten year period used in the 2014 Impact Assessment (Report paragraph [3.22 ff])).  It is clear from his more detailed calculations that if he were wrong in this one assumption it would make a very substantial difference indeed to his overall calculation.  I am very doubtful that it is proper to use perpetuity as the relevant timeframe.  However, even <span style="text-decoration:underline">if</span> it were correct to do so if the 2014 Impact Assessment had (equally) sought to model the costs to the state in perpetuity this would have made the net cost/benefit analysis even more compelling against the tobacco companies.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The 2014 Impact Assessment provides a monetised measure of overall public versus private net costs and benefit and this, at least in this case, is one relevant way to consider the issue <span style="text-decoration:underline">but</span> it is not the only way.  Mr Eadie QC, for the Secretary of State, submitted, in my view correctly and importantly, that the proportionality assessment was not in a case such as this a purely financial exercise and had to take into account other social and moral objectives and imperatives.  He submitted that there were relevant policies the proportionality of which could not be sensibly quantified in monetary terms.  In the present case, he submitted, there were important or moral imperatives relating to quality of life which included preventing children and youths taking up smoking, the extra years of life that a person would acquire from quitting and the reduced pain and increased quality of life that people would gain from avoiding smoking related disease. So for example the 2014 Impact Assessment estimated, on a discounted basis, that the Regulations would generate health benefits equivalent to saving “0.49m life years”, i.e. 490,000 years (see ibid paragraph [20], set out in Section C(14) above). </p>

The law was recently considered by the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Breyer Group Plc v Department of Energy &amp; Climate Change</span> [2015] EWCA Civ 408. The Court confirmed that a “possession” within the meaning of A1P1 did not include a right to acquire possessions and a mere prospective loss of future income did not amount to a “possession”. The Court of Appeal held that domestic case law, and that of the Court, could be summarised by way of the following propositions. First, loss of future income is not a possession protected by A1P1. Second, loss of marketable goodwill may be a possession protected by A1P1. Third, a number of factors may point towards the loss being goodwill rather than the capacity to earn future profits including marketability and whether the accounts and arrangements of the Claimant were organised in such a way as to allow for future cashflows to be capitalised. Fourth, goodwill may be a possession if it has been built up in the past and has a present day value as distinct from something which is only referable to events which may or may not happen in the future. Fifth, and in consequence of the earlier propositions, if there is interference which causes a loss of marketable goodwill at the time of the interference, and if that can then be capitalised, it is <span style="font-style:italic">prima facie</span> protected by A1P1 (ibid paragraph [23]). </p>

Passing off gives rise to what is essentially a negative right to prevent third party traders from misrepresenting their goods as that of the proprietor of the goodwill. The means by which the misrepresentation may occur might involve the use of same or similar marks or indicia such as get-up but that is not necessarily the case. The Secretary of State submits that this does not equate to a positive right to use those marks or other indicia in the face of other laws that may prevent or restrict such use. The common law rule against the assignment “in gross” of the goodwill attached to another unregistered mark continues to be recognised and goodwill thus has no value independently capable of assignment: see <span style="font-style:italic">Iliffe News &amp; Media v HMRC</span> [2014] FSR </p>

The alleged losses relate only to future expected income which cannot amount to a possession. On the facts as asserted by the Claimants the goodwill attaches to their businesses in general or at best particular brands rather than attaching to any individual device marks or equivalent. Customers already loyal to a particular brand of tobacco product would not realistically desert that brand upon the basis of a change in package design provided that the brand to which they owed allegiance remained distinguishable from others in practice, which they will do in accordance with Regulation 13. There is no marketable goodwill attaching to the graphic marks as used upon packaging since they are not, in any realistic commercial sense, marketable independently of the brand or capable of valid assignment independently of the business as a whole. It is pointed out that many of the graphic or composite marks relied upon by the Tobacco Claimants already incorporate within them their word trade marks for the brand concerned and they could not even be used as a matter of law by a third party if sold without the continuing consent of the brand word mark owner. Even where graphic marks used on packaging do not actually incorporate a brand word mark their association in the public mind with the brand renders them in practice not marketable independently of the brand. </p>

The Secretary of State, however, argues from a much narrower and purist perspective that trade marks are defined in law as negative rights, i.e. by their ability to prevent third party use, but that right does not extend to an inherent right on the proprietor to use the mark itself.  On the contrary, it is said that the law addresses use only through sanctions on non-use (through the risk of revocation).  There is thus an obligation to use to avoid revocation but not a positive right to use, and certainly not a right that can be said to be untrammelled.

As such, since the Regulations merely limited the <span style="text-decoration:underline">use</span> of trade marks and (through Regulation 13) did not strip from the Claimants the legal right to prevent or exclude and, on the contrary, preserved registrations from the risk of revocation through non-use there was no deprivation and any curtailment of the ability to <span style="font-style:italic">use</span> the trade marks was not a limitation or restriction on a right which was relevant to the essence of the property right.  He accepted that TRIPS permitted contracting states to define the rights attaching to trade marks by use <span style="text-decoration:underline">but</span> that in the EU and in the United Kingdom this had <span style="text-decoration:underline">not</span> happened. </p>

This proposition is not undermined by showing that courts sometimes refer loosely to the trade mark proprietor having the “right to use” the mark, particularly when one bears in mind that one way in which the owner of a trade mark (or other intellectual property right) may use it is by licensing it. Still less is it undermined by anything in art.9 of the Regulation or art.17 of the Charter”. </p>

I do accept that the rights have been significantly and even substantially diminished but this is not the same thing as saying that they have been destroyed or eradicated.  On the contrary the rights retain important functions.  Regulation 13 explicitly protects against revocation for non-use and preserves the rights attached to registration and hence the right to prevent others from using the trade marks in an unauthorised manner.  This is not, as was submitted, an illusory or fictitious exercise; on the contrary the Regulations permit tobacco companies to both place their name and the brand name on the packaging.  As such the trade marks still serve their core function as an identifier of origin. The practical effect can be ascertained by considering the position of each manufacturer in the absence of the residual rights conferred by the Regulation. In such a world manufacturers could neither identify themselves nor their brand. They would sell an undifferentiated commoditised product. The endconclusion in the Regulations is something of a compromise though one which is not at all favourable to the tobacco companies. The Regulations cannot therefore be said to destroy or deprive the trade marks of their essential function but they do nonetheless significantly diminish the value of the rights. </p>

The tobacco companies point out that, in principle, figurative trade marks can be very powerful (the Nike Swoosh was one illustration given).  They submit therefore that independent and important property rights have, on any view, had their very essence stripped from them and that, whatever might be the position in relation to the word marks, the analysis of the non-word marks is far more extreme: these are clear cut cases of <span style="font-style:italic">de facto</span> expropriation of rights. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">First, the evidence submitted to the Court is that in practice the trade marks used by the Claimants work in conjunction with each other.  It is the portfolio effect that matters i.e. the combined effect of the manufacturers’ name, the brand name, and any colours and figurative marks or symbols.   I do not accept that there is any trade mark that has the standalone characteristics of (say) the Nike Swoosh. This is, in my view, for obvious reasons.  Tobacco manufacturers have not, for some years, been able lawfully to advertise in the United Kingdom their tobacco products upon billboards or on the sides of buses or in newspapers or on the television or on clothing in the same way that the seller of running shoes or cameras or computer games can. There has accordingly been no real or material scope for a sign or symbol to develop an ability which is independent from the name mark to act as an identifier of source which can inure to the benefit of the reputation of the proprietor.  On the contrary over the past decade and more non-word marks have been compelled to play a supporting role to the name trade marks. This is simply because the tobacco companies cannot do anything else. The physical space available for <span style="text-decoration:underline">any</span> type of advertising has become so limited that <span style="text-decoration:underline">all</span> branding, of whatever type, is forced to work cheek by jowl with each other. In essence whilst I accept that in theory the non-word trade marks are independent property rights when, as the Claimants urge is essential, one focuses upon substance and not form then the true picture emerges of these trade marks playing their commercial role as supplements or complements operating in conjunction with the other word marks. </p>

If the Regulations were not introduced then because the TPD would <span style="text-decoration:underline">further</span> limit substantially the physical space for any sort of advertising or promotion then the potential for nonword trade marks to develop independent commercial potency would in any event quite irrespective of the Regulations be even more circumscribed than at present.  The most obvious limitation which the TPD will impose is the requirement that health warnings take up 65% of both main sides of the package. Any advertising or promotion that remains allowed post-TPD must be squeezed and crowded into an increasingly small space.   This means that on the front and back of a pack only a small space is left for <span style="font-style:italic">any</span> sort of advertising at all.  And in that small space it is highly improbable (and no tobacco company suggested otherwise) that the manufacturer would seek to develop an independent, free-standing, non-word trade mark. </p>

He produced a report dated 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2015. He provides the standard CPR 35 expert declaration. The report was entitled “Branding and the Standardised packaging of Tobacco Products Regulations 2015”.  This was an interesting report very little of which was challenged by the Secretary of State.  It provided, from a proprietor’s perspective, a broad overview of: the nature and role of branding; the commercial effects that branding changes can exert on consumer behaviour; the role of branding in the United Kingdom cigarette market; and, the impact on branding of the introduction of the Regulations. It was an important theme of Professor Keller that branding could be very effective and could and did impact upon consumer behaviour, though he concentrated his analysis upon how this effect was directed at differentiating between competing brands. A further important point was that the impact upon consumers was essentially brought about by the cumulative effect of the totality of branding elements used by a proprietor. In paragraphs [30ff] of his report Professor Keller described the critical importance of the combined effects of brands and logos.  He explained how firms “<span style="font-style:italic">mix and match</span>” brand elements to maximise brand “<span style="font-style:italic">equity</span>” and that it was the “<span style="font-style:italic">entire set of brand elements [that] makes up the brand identity</span>”.

In 1994 the Applicant’s family operated a grocery which sold alcohol and tobacco products. On average the turnover of tobacco represented about one third of total turnover. Tobacco products were sold pursuant to an excise </p>

The Applicant himself obtained a shop-keeping licence in 1999 and in 2005 he was registered in his own capacity as a trader of excise goods. On the 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2012 Parliament enacted a law on the Repression of Smoking of the Youth and on Tobacco Retail. The Act was published on the 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2012 and was subsequently amended on a number of occasions with the final version being enacted on the 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2013 and coming into force on the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> July 2013. Prior to the Act excise products, including tobacco, were sold through approximately 42,000 retail outlets. However, pursuant to the Act tobacco retail was to become a state monopoly exercised through a state owned company. Tobacco retailers would become licensed through a concession tender. This was advertised on the 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2012. Tenderers could apply for concessions to operate up to five retail outlets. Those applying for these new concessions were required to produce business plans reflecting, <span style="font-style:italic">inter alia</span>, the new government policy to limit to the greatest possible degree the access of minors to tobacco products. This was to be achieved notably by prohibiting those under the age of 18 going into such shops. Under the new licences tobacco retail could take place only in shops with separate entrances, with dark shades in the shop window preventing tobacco products being visible and with only a limited selection of other goods on sale. As already recorded the tenders were advertised on the 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2012 and the expiry date for applications was the 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> February 2013. There were no incumbency benefits or privileges conferred upon those retailers who had, hitherto, been engaged in tobacco retail. The decision about the grant of concessions was to be taken by the new statutory monopoly. In total approximately 6,800 licences were granted across the country. </p>

The Court summarised the submissions of the parties in the following way. So far as the Applicant was concerned the economic interests connected with the business and reflected in the prior licence represented a “possession” for the purpose A1P1 and its withdrawal by operation of law was an interference with the Applicant’s rights pursuant to that Protocol. Further, the lawfulness of this interference was exacerbated by the “<span style="font-style:italic">hasty adoption</span>” of the law in question, its amendments during the course of the tender adjudication procedure, and the absence of a transparent procedure or a legal remedy. The Applicant did not question that the “purported aim”, namely to combat underage smoking and protect the health of the population in general, was capable of amounting to a legitimate objective. The Applicant contended that “<span style="font-style:italic">… in reality, the measure rather aimed to monopolise tobacco retail and re-distribute the market shares, which could not be accepted as a legitimate aim, even in the face of the State’s wide margin of appreciation in this field</span>” (paragraph [27]). The Applicant questioned further the adequacy of the means chosen pointing to the fact that if the acquisition of tobacco products was made more difficult this would have an effect which benefitted the black market. Finally, it was submitted that no fair balance had been struck between the Applicant’s interest and that of the community in that by losing the Applicant’s principal source of livelihood without compensation the Applicant had been forced to bare an “<span style="font-style:italic">excessive individual burden</span>”. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Hungary submitted that the Applicant’s application for a concession had been overly succinct and had lacked elaboration and contained no relevant business plan. The Applicant had achieved a very low score in the adjudication process. The Applicant had no right to complain about not acquiring a new concession since he had no right to “<span style="font-style:italic">acquire</span>” such a property (paragraph [28]). Hungary rejected the suggestion that the Applicant had any legitimate expectation to obtain a new concession; all he could legitimately expect was an appropriate transition period to adjust to the new situation. In this regard Hungary submitted that there were adequate transitional arrangements. The new legislative measures were no more than a control on the use of property; the Applicant had not been deprived of his business. Only the scope of activities available to him had been curtailed. Under the new regime grocery stores could no longer sell tobacco and, accordingly, his previous licence had simply become obsolete and its loss could not be seen as a deprivation of property. He suffered no actual damage apart from losing the entitlement for the future. The measure in question had sought to reduce the number of sales points for tobacco retail in order to combat underage smoking and improve society’s health. Other states of the Council of Europe had introduced similar measures and a creation of a state monopoly to achieve these objectives fell within the state’s wide margin of appreciation in this field. Finally the Government contended that the Applicant had not suffered an excessive individual burden because only the scope of his business had been reduced and such a control of “use of property” did not entail an automatic obligation on the part of the State to provide compensation. Hungary cited <span style="font-style:italic">J A Pye (Oxford) Ltd et ors v United Kingdom </span>(Case 44302/02) (2007) paragraph [79]. </p>

There are three main points to make. <span style="text-decoration:underline">First</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">Vékony</span> was <span style="text-decoration:underline">not</span> a case where the challenge was to the system as a whole, upon the basis that it was, at a macro level, ineffective. The Applicant did not submit that the curtailment of the number of retail outlets and the imposition of marketing restrictions would not be effective to achieve the stated health objective and as such this was <span style="text-decoration:underline">not</span> a belt and braces attack on the legislation. On the contrary this was a “micro” challenge only to the internal modalities of the system in circumstances where the Applicant accepted that the overall object of the measures was lawful and legitimate.  Put another way the success or failure of the Applicant’s case did not involve the Court in having to evaluate the strength of the objective advanced for the legislation by the State and the appropriateness of the measures in achieving those goals. Instead the Court took into account the long prior period during which the particular Applicant had retailed tobacco, and, the catastrophic impact on the Applicant’s overall business caused by the loss of the licence. As such the judgment is not even necessarily a precedent for any other disappointed applicants for a licence under the same system. <span style="text-decoration:underline">Second</span>, the Court treated the <span style="text-decoration:underline">total</span> withdraw of the right to sell tobacco as a curtailment of a use right, not an expropriation.  This was even though the curtailment led to the applicant not only losing the right to retail tobacco but, moreover, to the collapse of his ability to trade in all goods and services. Yet this <span style="text-decoration:underline">still</span> fell within the second part of A1P1 which, in turn, imposed a higher evidential threshold upon an applicant seeking compensation.  <span style="text-decoration:underline">Third</span>, the Court held that in principle the state possessed a “<span style="font-style:italic">wide margin of appreciation</span>” (paragraph [35]) to withhold any form of compensation and in deciding whether the applicant had “<span style="font-style:italic">to bear an individual and excessive burden</span>” (paragraph [32]). It is not entirely clear from the judgment whether the Court accepted the submission of the State of Hungary that an Applicant had to show that the State’s conduct was “<span style="font-style:italic">manifestly unreasonable</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">and imposed an excessive burden</span>” (judgment paragraph [33]).  Nonetheless, the Court explicitly accepted that the State enjoyed a “<span style="font-style:italic">wide margin of appreciation</span>” (paragraph [35]).  It may be that the endorsement of a wide margin of appreciation was no more than the juridical converse of a test of manifest unreasonableness. In any event the litmus test, or proxy, employed by the Court was to answer the question whether the burden imposed was “<span style="font-style:italic">individual</span>” and “<span style="font-style:italic">excessive</span>”: In answering this question it is important to recognise that these are twin ingredients (i) individuality and (ii) nature and extent of burden (was it “excessive”?). In this regard the Court relied upon the judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Rosenzweig and Bonded Warehouse Ltd v Poland</span> [2005] ECHR 5520 (28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2005) at paragraph [48].

This, however, does not settle the issue, not only must the measure depriving a person of his property pursue, on the facts as well as in principle, a legitimate aim ‘in the public interest’, but there must also be a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aims sought to be realised… This latter requirement was expressed in other terms in the Sporrong and Lonnorth judgment by the notion of ‘fair balance’ that must be struck between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of the protections of the individual fundamental rights… The requisite balance will not be found if the person concerned has had to bare ‘an individual and excessive burden’… Although the Court was speaking in that judgment in the context of the general rule of peaceful enjoyment of property enunciated in the first sentence of the first paragraph, it pointed out that ‘the search for this balance is… reflected in the structure of Article 1(P1-1)’ as a whole… It was the Applicant’s contention that the leasehold reform legislation does not satisfy these conditions. In their submission, even assuming there to be a social injustice, the means chosen to cure it were so inappropriate or disproportionate as to take the Legislature’s decision outside the margin of appreciation. The Court considers that a measure must be both appropriate for achieving its aim and not disproportionate thereto.

The seizure and forfeiture of the Kruegerrands were measures taken for the enforcement of that prohibition. It is true that the High Court based its decision to declare the Kruegerrands forfeited on sub-paragraph (f) of section 44 of the 1952 Act, holding that they had been goods concealed in a manner appearing to be intended to deceive an officer. However, the Commissioners' counterclaim for forfeiture also relied on, inter alia, sub-paragraph (b) of the same section, which provided for the forfeiture of goods imported in contravention of an importation prohibition (see paragraphs 26 and 33 above). It does not appear material in this context that the High Court chose to rely on one of these sub-paragraphs rather than the other. The forfeiture of the coins did, of course, involve a deprivation of property, but in the circumstances the deprivation formed a constituent element of the procedure for the control of the use in the United Kingdom of gold coins such as Kruegerrands. It is therefore the second paragraph of Article 1 (P1-1) which is applicable in the present case (see, mutatis mutandis, the <span style="font-style:italic">Handyside</span> judgment of 7 December 1976, Series A no. 24, p. 30, para. 63)”. </p>

Those rules provided that at the end of the limitation period, the paper owner's title to unregistered land was extinguished (section 17 of the 1980 Act). In the case of registered land, the position was amended to take into account the fact that until the register was rectified, the former owner continued to appear as registered proprietor. Thus in the present case, section 75(1) of the 1925 Act provided that on expiry of the limitation period the title was not extinguished, but the registered proprietor was deemed to hold the land in trust for the adverse possessor. </p>

The provisions of the 1925 and 1980 Acts which were applied to the applicant companies were part of the general land law, and were concerned to regulate, amongst other things, limitation periods in the context of the use and ownership of land as between individuals.

Likewise, the balancing exercise between the relevant interests carried out by the Federal Constitutional Court, particularly in its leading decision of 6 October 2000, in examining the compatibility of that amending Law with the Basic Law, does not appear to have been arbitrary (see paragraphs 41-42 above).

It was enacted by the House of Commons after equally extensive debate in Parliament where various proposals were considered before an outright ban was accepted. In those circumstances, the Court is unable to accept that the House of Commons was not entitled to legislate as it did or that the refusal of the Burns Report to draw any conclusions as to the suffering of animals during hunting substantially undermined the reasons for the 2004 Act. The judgment that it was in the public interest to ban hunting was, as Lord Hope observed in context of the proportionality of the hunting ban in Scotland, pre-eminently one for the House of Commons to make. </p>

Firearms Limited and others v. the United Kingdom</span> (dec.), nos. 37674/97 and 37677/97, 26 September 2000). Nevertheless, the domestic authorities must enjoy a wide margin of appreciation in determining the types of loss resulting from the measure for which compensation will be made. As stated in <span style="font-style:italic">C.E.M. Firearms Limited</span> “the legislature's judgment in this connection will in principle be respected unless it is manifestly arbitrary or unreasonable”. This applies,<span style="font-style:italic"> a fortiori</span>, to cases where the interference concerns control of the use of property under the second paragraph of Article 1 rather than deprivation of possessions under the first paragraph of the Article. There is normally an inherent right to compensation in respect of the latter but not the former (see <span style="font-style:italic">Banér v. Sweden</span>, no. 11763/85, Commission decision of 9 March 1989; <span style="font-style:italic">J.A. Pye (Oxford) Ltd, </span>cited above, § 79). The Court does not find the absence of compensation in the 2004 Act to be arbitrary or unreasonable. Nor does it find that, in reaching the judgment it did, the United Kingdom upset the fair balance between the demands of the general interest and the requirements of the protection of the applicants' property rights by imposing on the applicants an individual and excessive burden. Indeed, the Court of Appeal's finding that hunts have continued to gather since the passage of the Act, albeit without live quarry, appears to confirm the decision of the House of Commons not to offer compensation to those affected by the ban. </p>

In the enforcement proceedings, simultaneously conducted, the applicant company was ordered to pay an additional 7% enforcement fee on the overall amount of the debt: its assets were attached and seized, whilst 76.79 percent of shares in its main production unit, OAO Yuganskneftegaz, were sold in satisfaction on the mentioned liability. </p>

They attached the company’s assets located in Russia and later partly froze the company’s domestic bank accounts and seized the shares of the applicant company’s Russian subsidiaries. On 20 July 2004 it was decided to auction off the company’s principal production subsidiary OAO Yuganskneftegaz, in satisfaction of the company’s tax liability, which at the time amounted to RUB 106.182 billion (some EUR 3.005 billion). As a result of the proceedings with regard to the Tax Assessments 2001 and 2002, the company’s debt to the tax authorities further increased and by the time the auction of OAO Yuganskneftegaz took place in December 2004 the company already owed the tax authorities some RUB 431.259 billion (some EUR 11.061 billion). In addition to the payments resulting from the Tax Assessments 2000-2003, the company was also required to pay the bailiffs a 7% enforcement fee on the overall amount of the debt. </p>

It follows that the Court’s task is to determine whether the State authorities complied with the Convention requirement of lawfulness and, if so, whether they struck a fair balance between the legitimate state interest in enforcing the tax debt in question and the protection of the applicant company’s rights set forth in Article 1 of Protocol No. 1”. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Mr Anderson QC also cited a line of authorities concerned with unlawful demolition of properties by state authorities where the Court had held that the demolition amounted to “deprivation” (i.e. expropriation) within the second sentence of the first paragraph of A1P1 and where compensation was ordered to be paid:  See for example <span style="font-style:italic">NA v Turkey</span> (Application NO 37451/97) (11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2005; and, <span style="font-style:italic">Yildirir v Turkey</span> (Application No 21482/03) (24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2010). These cases turn on unusual facts and do not in my view advance the analysis much.  In <span style="font-style:italic">NA v Turkey</span> the applicants obtained a licence in good faith to construct a hotel having paid the requisite fees; 12 months later the Treasury revoked the licence and ordered the demolition of the hotel.  This was upheld by the domestic Courts.  The Court in Strasbourg held that the demolition order was justified in the public interest (to remedy the fact that a permit had earlier been given to construct the hotel on a public beach).  The Court nonetheless held that there was a violation of A1P1 and ordered full compensation.  The reasoning is very short and conclusionary.  But the facts rather speak for themselves: the applicants should never have been granted a permit in the first place to build on a public beach but, having been granted a licence, they were entitled to compensation because, in effect, of the (lawful) change of position.  The present case is not comparable; there has been no change of position such as occurred in <span style="font-style:italic">NA v Turkey</span> which could lead a Court to conclude that wasted expenditure should be compensated for.  In <span style="font-style:italic">Yildirir v Turkey</span> the applicant purchased a property relying upon entries in the Land Register.  There was however no entry in that public document recording that the property had in fact been illegally constructed.  Subsequently the applicant was ordered to demolish the property for what the Court accepted were valid public health reasons. Domestic law stipulated that the State was liable for any damage caused by incorrect entries in the land registry.  Yet no compensation was paid.  The Court in Strasbourg held on the facts that compensation was due. Again this is a case very much on its own facts.  It provides little guidance of relevance to the present case.  </p>

Regulation 13 makes this explicitly clear. Registration rights are preserved. In substance the Regulations impose substantial restrictions on the freedom of the tobacco companies to use their property rights, and in particular their trade marks.  However, the restrictions are far from being total and the Claimants remain entitled to market themselves though the affixing of a brand name and their own manufacturer’s name. Self-evidently this is not optimal use of the trade marks for the Claimants; but it also far from the situation that would prevail if the Claimants were not entitled to use <span style="text-decoration:underline">any</span> identifying marks at all and were forced to sell their cigarettes and tobacco products as a homogenous unidentified commodity. </p>

The decided cases where compensation has been ordered invariably concern the expropriation of real property or a licence which was in the past (in the hands of the former owner) and would in the future (in the hands of the expropriating State or replacement licensee) be put to a good and legitimate use.  Or they concerned the shares in, or assets of, a trading body that served a legitimate commercial end and which the State wished to take into state ownership, by way of nationalisation, to run in the public interest.  The Secretary of State cited two authorities from the Court of Justice which were, loosely, on point in that they were cases where there was an interference of a profound nature with a property right to an agricultural product which if permitted to be in free circulation would be likely to spread disease.  In such cases the Court of Justice made clear that compensation was not payable: see Joined cases C-20/00 and C-64/00 <span style="font-style:italic">Booker Aquaculture Ltd v The Scottish Ministers</span> [2003] ECR I-7411.  There the Community legislature laid down animal health and preventive measures which Member States were required to take to prevent and to eliminate certain fish diseases in their territory. This included the destruction of diseased fish.  No right of compensation was provided for even though there was a power to compensate in some circumstances.  The Court of Justice had to determine whether, in the absence of compensation for affected farmers the relevant directive was compatible with the fundamental right to property.  The Court of Justice held that it was since the requirement to slaughter the fish was part of a Community policy adopted in the public interest: </p>

Public policy evolves.  Political thinking evolves.  No individual or company can have an expectation that if it produces and supplies a product that is, or becomes recognised as, contrary to the public interest that it will be entitled to continue to produce and sell that product, or that if the State comes to prescribe or curtail the product in issue that it will be entitled to compensation.  There can be no sensible argument based upon a reasonable or legitimate expectation (which might well be the best explanation for the demolitions cases before the Court in Strasbourg – see paragraph [782] above).  Manufacturers have been well aware for some years that across the world States have been obliged under international law to prohibit marketing and that this necessarily would bite down hard upon the use of trade marks. Markets are complex and the freedom to trade which is the hallmark of most world economies is almost inevitably accompanied by regulation which is the essential <span style="font-style:italic">quid pro quo</span> of the liberty.  The law is awash with examples of the introduction of unwelcome regulation which causes equally unwelcome costs and burdens for traders.  The use of asbestos for construction was commonplace but is now acknowledged to be dangerous and building rules and regulations prohibit its use.  When these were introduced manufacturers were not compensated for ceasing production even though expensive plant and equipment might have been stripped of its value as a result.  When thalidomide no longer came to be viewed as a wonder drug and instead became a pariah medicine the manufacturer did not receive compensation for the wasted research and investment or the trade marks used to promote the product (and on the contrary became subject to a slew of civil claims). </p>

The Claimants submit that there are no “exceptional circumstances” arising in the present case which could justify the Court in refusing compensation. Mr David Anderson QC, in particular in his final oral address on this issue for the Claimants, set out in a beguiling and bold submission (which I have nonetheless felt able to resist despite its oratorical lure) an exposition of why tobacco was not exceptional and why the current of analysis that ran though the Secretary of State’s analysis was “<span style="font-style:italic">utterly false</span>”.  His submission was entitled “<span style="font-style:italic">The Myth of Tobacco Exceptionalism</span>”. His argument went along the following lines. Tobacco products are sold lawfully throughout the world.  Tobacco trade marks are not in a special position which can be seen from the fact that trade marks may be registered in respect of a long list of controversial products such as (in no particular order): uranium, plutonium, polonium, arsenic, cyanides, cocaine, opium, strychnine, steroids, narcotics, traps for wild animals, bayonets, military drones, rocket launchers, tear gas weapons, ivory, whalebone, and love dolls.  Nothing about tobacco or their trade marks justifies “<span style="font-style:italic">bending the normal legal rules – whether as regards the right to compensation, participation in the internal market or the principles of administrative fairness and equality of arms</span>”.  Tobacco companies are not inherently dishonest, untrustworthy or liable to browbeat expert witnesses and their evidence merits precisely the same dispassionate and unprejudiced weighting as that of any other person, whether at the consultation stage or in the course of litigation.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">In my judgment the Claimants’ submissions place the bar of exceptionality far too high.  I agree that the test is one of exceptionality.  Though in <span style="font-style:italic">Vistins</span> (see below) the Court (ibid at paragraph [112]) seemed to use the test of exceptionality as the benchmark for circumstances when <span style="text-decoration:underline">zero</span> compensation would be paid; the Court did not say that it would be exceptional to pay less than 100%.  At all events in the present case Parliament has made no provision at all for compensation so the exceptionality test applies.  In this regard I have no doubt that the facts of the decided cases cited by the Claimants are exceptional.  But I disagree with the proposition that nothing short of facts which are comparable to these cases will suffice.  The phrase “<span style="font-style:italic">exceptional</span>” can convey a multiplicity of meanings.  At one level a situation is exceptional if it does no more than depart from a norm; it is an exception thereto.  But the scope of the exception may still be quite substantial.  On the other hand both in general parlance and in judicial pronouncements use of the phrase “exceptional” is sometimes intended to convey the sense of a limited derogation from the norm, or even a very limited derogation with exceptional meaning rare or very rare.  The question therefore is how exceptional is exceptional? </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">To answer this question the phrase must be understood in its context.  It involves first of all an assessment of the importance of the basic rule: Is it the sort of rule from which derogations should <span style="font-style:italic">in principle</span> only rarely be tolerated in the sort of democratic society that is contemplated by the ECHR? When put into this context it seems plain that the right to the peaceful enjoyment of property rights is a very basic rule of a civilised society and it would follow that derogations should be exceptional in the sense that they should be rare.  The sanctity of property rights and the correlative right of individuals to be free from arbitrary, capricious or corrupt expropriations is a mark of a fully developed society.  This is the view taken by commentators and reflected in case law. But even this does not give much practical guidance as to the scope of even a limited exception.  The Claimants’ Rubicon lies in cases of post-civil war or revolution reconciliation and repair. Nothing less than this sort of scenario will suffice to be “exceptional”. </p>

I have set out the relevant parts of the judgment below.  This was a case that unequivocally concerned an expropriation of rights (see paragraph [94]): <span style="font-style:italic">“In the present case, it is not in dispute that there has been a “deprivation of possessions” within the meaning of the second sentence of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1</span>”. From this Judgment the following propositions emerge.  <span style="text-decoration:underline">First</span>, any assessment under A1P1 requires an analysis of <span style="text-decoration:underline">both</span> sides of the public interest equation i.e. the nature and strength of the public interest pursued by the state which is said to warrant the interference with the private property right but also the nature and strength of the private rights being interfered with. <span style="text-decoration:underline">Second</span>, the State enjoys a wide margin of appreciation with regard both to choosing the means of enforcement and to ascertaining whether the consequences of enforcement are justified in the general interest for the purpose of achieving the object of the law in question.   <span style="text-decoration:underline">Third</span>, the existence of a wide margin of appreciation does not absolve a Court from determining whether the requisite balance was maintained in a manner consonant with the applicants’ right to the peaceful enjoyment of their possessions. <span style="text-decoration:underline">Fourth</span>, where there is an expropriation the State should set up a procedure which makes an overall assessment of the consequences of the expropriation, undertake a valuation of the expropriated property in line with normal market values, determine who the persons to be paid compensation are,<span style="color:#FF0000"> </span>and provide award of an amount of compensation in line with the value of the expropriated property. <span style="text-decoration:underline">Fifth</span>, there is however <span style="text-decoration:underline">no</span> absolute rule that compensation is payable; it will “<span style="font-style:italic">normally</span>” be payable and the occasions when total or full compensation are not payable will be “<span style="font-style:italic">exceptional</span>”. The duty to pay is not a binary all or nothing; there may be cases where the public interest leads to the result that less than full compensation is payable. Cases where less than full value may be payable include interferences for purposes relating to “<span style="font-style:italic">economic reform or measures designed to achieve greater social justice</span>”, or laws of expropriation which are “<span style="font-style:italic">enacted in the context of a change of political and economic regime</span>”. </p>

They contend that the Court of Justice adopted that analysis at paragraph [150] of the judgment, finding that the restriction of trade marks to 50% of the pack did not prejudice the substance of the right because the trade marks could still be used on the packs. In simple terms, they argue, that the present case falls on the other side of the line established by the Court in <span style="font-style:italic">BAT</span>. </p>

Their argument assumes two propositions, neither of which in my view makes legal sense.  First, it assumes that each and every fundamental right in the Charter (which is intended to mirror the ECHR) has an absolute and untouchable limit, even when it does not have such a limit in the ECHR.  Secondly, it assumes that if on the application of the proportionality test the result is that a measure <span style="text-decoration:underline">is</span> proportionate, i.e. (a) suitable relative to its legitimate objective (b) necessary in the sense of being the least intrusive measure and (c) fair in the sense of striking a fair balance between competing interests, that it is <span style="text-decoration:underline">still</span> unlawful because the essence of the Claimants’ interest (that has already been fairly balanced and found wanting) is impaired.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Indeed, the Claimants’ argument advanced in the light of the judgment in Philip Morris was that it confirmed their submission that if the Regulations affected the essence of the property right: “<span style="font-style:italic">…then they are unlawful per se and no proportionality analysis falls to be conducted</span>”. This <span style="font-style:italic">per se</span> absolutist approach was said to be consistent with the ruling in <span style="font-style:italic">Philip Morris</span>. This cannot be right.  If it were correct then in relation to a weak Charter right such as the Article 16 right to conduct a business, no government could ever prohibit a commercial activity (and thereby impair the substance of the Article 16 right) because, for instance, it caused catastrophic environmental damage or caused death or serious physical injury to consumers or workers.   Equally it cannot be right because the protection of health is <span style="font-style:italic">also</span> a fundamental right and, on the Claimants’ analysis, that right cannot be impaired either.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Support for my conclusion is found in <span style="font-style:italic">Philip Morris</span> and in <span style="font-style:italic">Pillbox</span>. I have addressed these authorities in Section E under Ground 1 above at paragraph [270]. In <span style="font-style:italic">Pillbox</span> the Court of Justice held that Articles 16 and 17 of the Fundamental Charter fed into the proportionality analysis. In <span style="font-style:italic">Philip Morris </span>in the context of proportionality, the Court considered expressly what happens when two fundamental rights collided. In that case the tobacco companies argued that they had a right under Article 11 of the Fundamental Charter (on freedom of expression and information) which they said trumped all other considerations. The Court of Justice rejected this contention holding that the public health interest and right (under Article 35 of the Charter, inter alia – see paragraph [153]) outweighed the Claimants’ asserted interests. The Court so held whilst simultaneously recognising that the Claimants’ rights <span style="text-decoration:underline">were</span> interfered with (see ibid paragraph [148]). Yet, when the Court came to consider whether the “essence” of the Article 11 right had been impaired it cursorily dismissed the argument saying that they had not even been “<span style="font-style:italic">affected</span>”. The Court’s explanation (in paragraph [151]) is that the prohibition of “<span style="font-style:italic">certain elements and features</span>” did not affect the essence of the Article 11 freedom but merely controlled them in a clearly defined way. The Court did not explain how the Article 11 right could be interfered with but at the same time not even affected. And the Court did not (because it did not arise on the facts) go on and consider what happens in the paradigm test case where in order to protect a fundamental right of the very highest importance it is necessary to extinguish altogether a weaker fundamental right. Nonetheless, the message is clear: A fundamental right is not impaired or even affected just because another public interest right trumps it. This paradigm is by no means remote because the Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Philip Morris</span> has upheld provisions of the TPD which prohibit outright certain products and thus has implicitly endorsed the absolute primacy of the right to health over the right of persons to conduct business (Article 16) or to express themselves or to provide information in relation to that business (Article 11). Out of all of this it is, in my view, evident that the Court will not readily conclude that the essence of a fundamental right is impaired or affected or not respected where it is in competition with a strong public health ground and this extends even to those instances where one fundamental right is forced wholly to give way to a superior fundamental right. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">In my view the extent to which a fundamental right may be intruded upon is logically an integral part of the proportionality test which (and certainly in relation to fundamental rights) includes the proportionality <span style="font-style:italic">strictu sensu</span> or “fair balance” limb and which, as a major part of that assessment, requires the Court to weigh up the competing public and private interests.  It is here that the reconciliation between competing fundamental interests occurs.  This relative weighing exercise takes account of how important each such right <span style="font-style:italic">actually is</span> and in this regard it is obvious and well established in case law that not all of the rights have equal weight (as the Supreme Court made clear in <span style="font-style:italic">Lumsdon</span> and has been endorsed in <span style="font-style:italic">Philip Morris</span>). The right to property is undoubtedly an important right but it is very far from being unqualified.  Indeed the ECHR case law on A1P1 makes it clear beyond peradventure that exceptionally a private property right may be wholly expropriated by the State (in the sense that title is stripped from the original proprietor and transferred to the state) and no compensation payable at all: see e.g. case law set out at paragraphs [800ff] above.  In such cases the substance or essence of the private right is utterly destroyed yet done so perfectly lawfully and proportionately and without even triggering an obligation to pay compensation.

The Advocate General in <span style="font-style:italic">BAT</span> did not say that the “<span style="font-style:italic">normal</span>” (cf. paragraph [823] above) use of a trade mark includes causing profound harm to public health.  And the Court of Justice, for its part, did not say that it was <span style="font-style:italic">proportionate</span> or <span style="font-style:italic">tolerable</span> to use a trade mark to impair public health (cf. judgment paragraph [149]). Indeed the Court of Justice appeared to treat the impairment test as part of the proportionality test (ibid paragraphs [149] and [150]).<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>This is also the way that the Court of Justice analysed the issue in <span style="font-style:italic">Pillbox </span>(see paragraph [270] above)<span style="font-style:italic">. </span>In <span style="font-style:italic">Trabelsi </span>(ibid) the General Court (whose rulings are in any event subject to those of the Court of Justice) was not addressing facts which were remotely similar to those in issue in the present case nor was it actually addressing an argument about the scope of the proportionality test and whether, as part of the analysis there was a “fair balance” or proportionality <span style="font-style:italic">strictu sensu</span> assessment to be struck. In <span style="font-style:italic">Digital Rights Ireland</span> and in <span style="font-style:italic">Schrems</span> the Court of Justice held that the invasion of privacy, <span style="font-style:italic">as a matter of fact</span>, went too far and was not justified and for that reason the measure was not “necessary”, i.e. it decided the case on an entirely separate basis. This is a far cry from a conclusion that a measure which negatives a particular use of a trade mark for otherwise good and proportionate health reasons is equally a step too far.  In short in my judgment the question of whether a right is impaired is an integral part of the overall proportionality analysis and none of the case law relied upon suggests otherwise. </p>

First, in working out what the essence of a right is it is necessary to go back to the source legal text which defined the specific property right in issue.  In the present case this is TRIPS.  At this level of analysis it is necessary to be precise about the “essence” of the right.  This is defined narrowly in TRIPS as a negative right to exclude.  But even if it were defined more broadly to include use rights there is no conceivable basis in TRIPS for saying that the “<span style="font-style:italic">essence</span>” of a trade mark includes a right to <span style="font-style:italic">use</span> that property right to facilitate a lethal health epidemic. I have already set out in this judgment: (i) the relevant international and EU legislative context which in a multiplicity of places recognises that the use of trade marks can be curtailed according to the public interest, including public health interests; and (ii) that the limits on use are also laid down in the case law of the Court of Justice which makes it clear that a trade mark or other intellectual property right cannot be used to thwart the broader objectives of the Treaties, which includes <span style="font-style:italic">par excellence</span> the protection of </p>

As is quite clear from the judgments the Court of Justice accepted as an important consideration the need for Member States to collect personal and private data for security reasons but the Court also recognised that there was a competing right in privacy.

This means that <span style="text-decoration:underline">if</span> the right to property is impaired then the Regulations are unlawful under Article 17 of the Fundamental Charter even though: (a) the terms of Article 17 expressly make the right to property subject to overriding public interest considerations; (b) the curtailment of the right to use the trade marks and other property rights in the Regulations is (<span style="font-style:italic">ex hypothesi</span>) appropriate and necessary and reflects a fair balance between all competing fundamental rights (i.e. is proportionate); (c)  the Regulations are designed to prevent those property rights from facilitating a health epidemic; and (d) the fundamental right to health in the EU treaties and in Article 35 of the Fundamental Charter is thwarted. Treating all of these considerations as irrelevant the question then is whether in actual fact the essence of the property rights is impaired by the Regulations. As to this the answer is “no”.    This is because: Regulation 13 preserves rights of registration (see paragraph [249] above) and thereby the negative right to exclude which, in formalistic terms, represents the nucleus or very essence of a trade mark under TRIPS; the property rights are not expropriated and title remains at all times with the proprietors; the word marks may be used as identifiers together with the use of the manufacturer’s name and there are various other residual uses to which all of the marks may be put. In coming to this conclusion it is relevant that in <span style="font-style:italic">Philip Morris</span> and in <span style="font-style:italic">Pillbox</span> the Court of Justice rejected the submission that even outright prohibitions on the sale of a product or the dissemination of information affected the essence of the fundamental rights asserted by the tobacco companies.

In contrast the ECHR is not a treaty which confers legislative powers, but the EU treaties do.  It thus makes sense because in particular legislation the EU might, for instance, introduce a compensation scheme for farmers whose livestock has, for health reasons, had to be destroyed in circumstances where, strictly, there was no legal duty on the legislature to make compensation available. The legislature would hence go beyond the strict A1P1 right.  Article 52(3) thus makes clear that the Convention creates floor rights and it does not preclude bespoke legislative interventions of a more generous nature.  Mr Eadie QC for the Secretary of State expressed the view that this was a difficult and controversial provision and issue.  He mooted that it might in principle also embrace acts of judicial creativity with the Court of Justice on particular facts also going beyond the strict confines of the ECHR.

In vain may it be urged, that the good of the individual ought to yield to that of the community; for it will be dangerous to allow any private man, or even any public tribunal, to be the judge of this common good, and to decide whether it be expedient or no. Besides, the public good is in nothing more essentially interested, than in the protection of every individual’s private rights, as modelled by the municipal law. In this, and similar cases the legislature alone can, and indeed frequently does, interpose, and compel the individual to acquiesce but how does it interpose and compel? Not by absolutely stripping the subject of his property in an arbitrary manner; but by giving him a full indemnification and equivalent for the injury thereby sustained. The public is now considered as an individual, treating with an individual for an exchange.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The first difficulty is that the proposition set out in Blackstone is too extreme and uncompromising. In the course of oral argument some reliance was placed upon the fact that Parliament had legislated for the payment of compensation to colonial slave owners upon the abolition of slavery in 1833 as an exercise in what was just and expedient in a case where property rights had been curtailed. It was contended that this reflected the trenchant common law approach to the legislative suppression of otherwise or erstwhile legal and/or commercial property rights. I do not agree. The abolition of slavery as a category of property had been abolished at common law in a series of earlier judgments by Lord Mansfield and there had never arisen the remotest prospect of the <span style="text-decoration:underline">common law</span> compensating the former slave owners for the deprivation of their property. In The Slavery Abolition Act 1833 Parliament addressed the manumission of slaves in the colonies.  This awarded compensation to slave owners for being “<span style="font-style:italic">deprived of their right to such services</span>”.  The basis of both the abolition and the right to compensation was that it was “<span style="font-style:italic">just and expedient</span>”.  Section 1, which also serves as the preamble to the Act, stated as follows: “<span style="font-style:italic">WHEREAS divers Persons are holden in Slavery within divers of His Majesty's Colonies, and it is just and expedient that all such Persons should be manumitted and set free, and that a reasonable Compensation should be made to the Persons hitherto entitled to the Services of such Slaves for the Loss which they will incur by being deprived of their Right to such Services ...”.  </span>The total compensation payable was specified under section 24 as £20 million, which historians have estimated is the equivalent of approximately £70 billion in present value terms and as having accounted for about </p>

However, slaves had not been “property” at common law since the condemnation of slavery as abhorrent to the common law and not recognisable in the absence of an express Parliamentary measure.  Lord Mansfield in <span style="font-style:italic">Somerset v Stewart</span> (1772) 98 ER 499 concerning <span style="font-style:italic">habeas corpus</span> ruled that the common “law of England” did not recognise slaves as property and only “positive law” (i.e. Statute law) could afford protection.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The 1833 Act cannot therefore be taken to support the proposition that curtailments or abolition of a right to property inevitably triggers a common law right to compensation. On the contrary the more apt interpretation is that Parliament stepped in because the common law refused to acknowledge a species of property, upon strong (moral) policy grounds. The judgment of Lord Mansfield pre-dated the Commentaries of Sir William Blackstone but for whatever reason the implications of that judgment are not incorporated into the section on property rights.  The fact that Parliament granted compensation is in any event clearly not an indication of what the common law is or was; Parliament intervened because the common law would not and what was “<span style="font-style:italic">just and expedient</span>” in the eyes of MPs in 1833 is not an indication of what would be so in 2016. It is inconceivable that anyone would be compensated for the manumission of a slave in a modern Western state.  In 1833 slavery was integral to the economy and had compensation not be paid the economic consequences for the colonies would have been calamitous.  The same cannot be said of the curtailing of the advertising of tobacco which on the basis of the 2014 Impact Assessment will result in a vast long term saving to the State in financial terms and a commensurate improvement in public health and welfare and to the extent that good health promotes happiness, then an increase in overall societal welfare.  An Act of Parliament was thus required to sanction the payment of compensation since the earlier judicial decisions hostile to slavery had not contemplated the possibility of compensation as part of the common law and, as many historians have observed, whilst Parliament invoked “<span style="font-style:italic">justice and practicability</span>” as its guiding lights many members of Parliament stood to, and did, gain handsomely from the compensation package.  It is perhaps not without some significance that the 1833 Act was repealed only in 1998 by the Statute Law (Repeals) Act 1998 upon the basis that by virtue of more recent legislation (including the Human Rights Act 1998) it was no longer necessary. </p>

However, the operators’ right to property is not called into question by the introduction of such a measure. No economic operator can claim a right to property in a market share, even if he held it at a time before the introduction of a measure affecting that market, since such a market share constitutes only a momentary economic position exposed to the risks of changing circumstances (Case C-280/93 Germany v Council, paragraph 79). Nor can an economic operator claim an acquired right or even a legitimate expectation that an existing situation which is capable of being altered by decisions taken by the Community institutions within the limits of their discretionary power will be  maintained (see Case 52/81 Faust v Commission [1982] ECR 3745, paragraph 27). </p>

This Ground concerns the scope and effect of Articles 1 and 110(2) of the CTMR. The nub of the point lies in 2 central premises: First, that the CTMR is exhaustive of all derogations from the unitary rights conferred on proprietors and, secondly, that there are no provisions in the CTMR which allow Member States to derogate from those rights. It is also argued (but only by ITL and BAT) that the Regulations are unlawful as being inconsistent with the “unitary” character of Community designs under Regulation 6/2002 on Community Designs (the “CDR”).

First, the CTMR does not and cannot guarantee that every CTM has equal effect across the EU.  For example, all CTMs are subject to overriding treaty obligations even though this is not expressly stated to be the case in the CTMR.  When it was put to the Claimants’ counsel in oral argument that <span style="text-decoration:underline">all</span> subordinate EU legislation had, as a matter of constitutional and administrative law, to be read as subject to the Treaty itself this was accepted as a correct statement of the law.  Equally when I put to counsel that, for instance, all intellectual property rights were subject to the prohibitions in Article 101 and 102 TFEU on cartels and the abuse of a dominant position, again, this was fully accepted. It necessarily follows that the CTMR, as subordinate legislation, could not be wholly definitive in all circumstances. It had to be construed purposively in the light of superior obligations. </p>

However, it is striking, for instance, that there is no express derogation <span style="text-decoration:underline">in</span> the CTMR for the case of a CTM which collides with competition law; yet – manifestly – nothing in the CTMR expressly or impliedly condones or could condone the use of trade marks to further illegal cartels or to abuse market dominance.  And, moreover, the prohibitions in Article 101 and 102 TFEU frequently (by virtue of the fact that markets are often local in nature) apply to limited geographical markets only which, in the overwhelming majority of cases, are national or even sub-national, but most certainly not EU-wide in nature.  As such without it being so expressly stated in the CTMR there simply have to be exceptions and derogations from the universal (EU wide) unity of Community trade marks. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">There is nothing surprising in this conclusion.  Over many decades the Court of Justice, in developments redolent of the incremental common law approach, has identified limitations to the right of proprietors of intellectual property rights to “exercise” their rights.  This is the very essence of the fundamental distinction drawn between the existence and the exercise of rights: Yet, once again, those limitations are not listed anywhere in the Community legislation on the intellectual property rights in question. And, moreover, it is not to be thought that this dichotomy is not reflected in international law since, as already pointed out within TRIPS there are multiple provisions which confer upon contracting states the right to limit the right to use the intellectual property in question including for health grounds (See Section D(3)(iii)ff above). There is no canonical list of limits laid down in TRIPS; it is, essentially, open ended. It follows that legislation which is consistent with other superior EU law does not become unlawful simply because it creates a derogation from the unitary character of a CTM. Accordingly, the first reason for rejecting the argument is that the Claimants’ case that nothing can undermine the universal application of a CTM is inconsistent with the elementary principles of EU constitutional law. Thus, insofar as EU law (here the TFEU and the TPD) permits and encourages Member States, in furtherance of public health, to introduce restrictions on the use of CTMs this is not, without more, a breach of the CTMR. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.04in">It is important to consider what Article 110(2) does and does not concern. By its terms it exists to make clear that the CTMR is without prejudice to the pre-existing right on the part of Member States (for example under TRIPS) to prohibit the <span style="text-decoration:underline">use</span> of trade marks. Specifically, Article 110(2) is concerned <span style="text-decoration:underline">only</span> with confirming the right of Member States to prohibit the “<span style="font-style:italic">use</span>” of a CTM. It says nothing about registration or revocation proceedings in relation to CTMs and any issue relating to these remains governed by the rules in the CTMR. Therefore, any issue as to revocation or registrability which flowed from the fact that a Member State quite lawfully applied to domestic trade marks <span style="font-style:italic">and</span> CTMs a prohibition on <span style="font-style:italic">use</span>, remains a matter for EU law to be determined in accordance with the procedures under the CTMR, <span style="text-decoration:underline">not</span> national law.  This is the division of labour and power between the Member States that the EU provided for under the CTMR. Further, nothing in Article 110(2) or the CTMR more generally prohibits or affects the right of the Member States to adjust their own domestic rules on registration and revocation of <span style="font-style:italic">national marks</span> to take account of the fact that certain uses of such national trade marks are prohibited. </p>

The Regulations thus reflect no more and no less than they are permitted to do under Article 110(2). This in my view is an answer to the Claimant’s submission. To the extent therefore that the Claimant’s argue that the Regulations are illegal then this is, in substance, a challenge to the legality of Article 110(2) itself.

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">As to whether there is a difference in my view there is clearly one.  It lies in the fact that under Regulation 13 if registration / revocation proceedings do arise then certain issues are in effect predetermined in favour of the Claimants. As such national trade marks are protected from revocation proceedings under domestic trade mark law, but CTMs have no equivalent protection under the CTMR.  If Regulation 13 did not exist then all trade marks, both national and CTM, would be vulnerable to revocation and the policy issues which have been relied upon to found Regulation 13 would then have to be deployed in specific proceedings. Regulation 13 has taken away this regulatory or litigation risk for national trade marks but not from CTMs.  If it was possible to predict that these same policy arguments would be effective in revocation proceedings under the CTMR then the difference might only be procedural and not substantive.  However, although there would be a good case to be made in such revocation proceedings that registration should remain, for similar reasons to those which have led to Regulation 13 being promulgated, it is not possible to be sure of this.  In my view the difference might be both procedural and substantive. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Is the difference in treatment objectively justified?  In my view it is.  This is because, for the reasons set out above, the position vis-à-vis registrability and revocation of national marks and CTMs are to be addressed in different ways under different legal regimes and this therefore reflects rational and considered legislative policy choices made at the EU level. The conditions governing revocation and registration are within the legislative power of the Member States in relation to national trade marks but they are not in the case of CTMs.  Parliament had no power at all to provide a shield to CTMs equivalent to that provided to national rights in Regulation 13.  It is however open to the EU under either the TPD or under relevant trade mark legislation or as a matter of ministrative practice at the behest of the European Trade Mark Office (as of the date of this judgment still the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market (trade marks and designs)) to achieve the same degree of protection for CTMs as exists for national trade marks, but it has yet to do so (because of course as of the present time the issue is entirely hypothetical). In my judgment the fact that Parliament had power over only one type of trade mark but not the other and that national trade marks and CTMs are subject to different regimes represents relevant and objective considerations justifying the difference in treatment.

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">If I am wrong in the above conclusion then I have to decide whether any unjustified differentiation can be remedied.  Differences in treatment can be cured by levelling up or levelling down.  It is within the power of Parliament to level down, by removing the shield afforded by Regulation 13 to national trade marks; but it is not within Parliament’s jurisdiction to level up by affording equivalent protection to CTMs, since only the EU legislature can do this by amending the CTMR.  It is possible that this might happen in the future but it has not occurred to date. If therefore I were to find that Regulation 13 was unlawful the logical solution would be to declare the offending provision (Regulation 13) to be unlawful.  An alternative form of relief which might have been better suited to the peculiar circumstances of this case would have been to make a declaration that the unlawful discrimination could be removed by the EU ensuring equivalent protection to CTMs and then awaiting to see if curative action was taken.  A further alternative could have been to refer the issue, including that of the proper remedy in these usual circumstances, to the Court of Justice. Nonetheless because I do not accept the basic premise underlying the objection these considerations are academic.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">If Regulation 13 is unlawful and cannot be cured or saved by a process of levelling up for CTMs then I next consider whether it is severable from the Regulations as a whole.  In my view the proper way to analyse this is by reference to the analysis conducted by the Government prior to the promulgation of the Regulations by Parliament.  And as to this it is plain, and in particular from the 2014 Impact Assessment, that Regulation 13 played virtually no or no material part in the justification for the Regulations.   Accordingly if Regulation 13 is unlawful it is severable from the Regulations as a whole and nothing has changed since Parliament acted which would affect that conclusion as of the date of this judgment.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Finally, there are two peculiarities about this argument advanced by the Claimants to be noted.  First, I observe that the position adopted by the Claimants in this litigation has been that Regulation 13 is worthless and, as such, its excision from the Regulations as a whole would not, on the Claimants’ analysis at least, have made any difference. Secondly, I also observe the artificial nature of the argument since Regulation 13 is the single saving grace for the tobacco companies so far as they are concerned.  The Regulations are intended to curtail to a very high degree the ability of the tobacco companies to use trade marks in promoting their products and Regulation 13 is just about the only silver lining to this otherwise dark cloud.  Yet, in order to attack the Regulations, the tobacco companies have sought to challenge the one part thereof which is to their advantage.  I have not relied upon either point as part of the overall analysis; but they do place the argument into context. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Article 24(2) TPD requires Member States to take the high level of protection provided for by the TPD “into account”.  It is argued that the decision to adopt the Regulations was taken without any consideration being given to the possibility that implementation of the TPD would, in and of itself, be sufficient to achieve Parliament’s aims and objectives.  As such Parliament failed to have regard to a relevant consideration and erred in law.  The time for assessment of the issue is said to be the date of promulgation of the Regulations.  This is not a proportionality challenge hence (a) it is not open to the Secretary of State to rely upon evidence postdating the adoption of the Regulations and/or (b) this is not a decision the Court can take for itself. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">It is argued that the Secretary of State has not proven that implementation of the mandatory provisions of the TPD would not suffice to achieve Parliament’s goals and the Secretary of State cannot meet his burden of proof unless he is able to produce evidence to show: (i) what level of health protection (i.e. effects on the intermediate outcomes and on prevalence and consumption) would be achieved by the measure required to be implemented under the TPD; and (ii) that the Regulations will achieve a higher level of health protection than the TPD.  An important part of the purpose of the TPD was to reduce the attractiveness of packaging; increase the prominence of the health warning; and ensure that no misleading information could be included on packs (see Articles 9, 13 and 14 TPD). The extent to which those objectives will be achieved by the TPD, and would or would not be <span style="text-decoration:underline">further</span> advanced by the Regulations on standardised packaging was the question at issue. It could not be assumed. However, Stirling and Chantler never considered the question (see paragraphs [1.19] – [1.21] of Chantler).  A significant part of Chantler’s reasoning (concerning the evolution of branding in the absence of other forms of advertising) is striking for its failure to take account of the effects of the TPD: see paragraph [3.10]. Equally the Pechey experts (see paragraphs [139] – [142] above) were never asked the crucial questions (i) how much they considered that the TPD would affect prevalence or consumption in children or adults; and (ii) whether they thought plain packaging would have a greater effect, and if so, how much greater. The Australian evidence cannot assist either way. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">In relation to the Irish study prepared by Professor Hammond which <span style="text-decoration:underline">did </span>address this issue this provides no answer since it post-dated the Regulations. In any event, the Defendant did not seek to dissent from the limitations in the single Irish study. The researchers themselves accepted that it was impossible to address the extent to which the identified flaws concerning the actual smoking habits of the age group concerned may have affected the results. If the question is asked: would the Regulations ever have been introduced on the strength of this piece of evidence? The answer is obviously that they would not. The only other response to this argument put forward by the Defendant is to rely on Annex E to the 2014 Impact Assessment. However, that annex is not sufficient to satisfy the burden on the Defendant since (a) that material was irrelevant to the intermediate outcomes and there was no evidence that plain packaging would have any greater effect on intermediate outcomes than the TPD packaging; (b) the baseline of the anticipated effects of TPD on consumption was derived from the EU’s impact assessment relating to draft provisions which were different from those finally adopted; (c) for that reason, the Defendant decided arbitrarily to reduce the anticipated effects of the TPD on consumption by an amount that had no evidential foundation at all: it was a figure plucked from the air; and (d) that  percentage applied to all age groups. The Annex E conclusion was then erroneously applied to the Pechey prediction for children. This was calculated to exaggerate the incremental impact of plain packaging, since Pechey anticipated a much greater effect on children than adults; (e) there was no evidence of the anticipated effect of the TPD on prevalence or consumption in children; (f) in the absence of such evidence there was no basis for any calculation of the additional benefits which might accrue from plain packaging.  These defects were compounded by the unexplained failure to address the relevant issue with the Pechey experts at all, and by the high degree of uncertainty and wide range of their opinions. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The Claimants however submit that the standard of proof upon the Secretary of State to prove that there would be health benefits over and above those achieved by the TPD is very high. They do this by reference to Article 114 TFEU.  They argue that Article 24(2) represents a bespoke derogation from the harmonising provision in Article 24(1) which is analogous to<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>the default derogation provisions at Article 114(4) and (5) TFEU and was drafted with Article 114 in mind, given the linguistic and substantive similarities between the provisions. It is said that Article 24(2) TPD, like Article 114 TFEU, reflects the particular care and scrutiny which must be applied by a Member State seeking to exceed the harmonised standard provided for under Article 24(1).  Accordingly, the proper approach to Article 24(2) is strict since it is a derogation from the norm in Article 24(1) guaranteeing free movement for tobacco products that meet the requirements of the TPD.  A State seeking to introduce stricter measures than those provided for in the TPD must be able to prove that the measures are justified with evidence that those stricter measures will achieve a higher level of health protection than that achieved by the Directive. Moreover, it is also a necessary part of the justification of such a measure that it must be shown that there is no less onerous means available which is equally effective to meet the objective pursued. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The first reason for rejecting the submission is that the TPD and the Regulations are primarily and overwhelmingly health measures adopted and it is <span style="text-decoration:underline">this</span> characteristic that governs legislative competence, not the fact that tangentially or secondarily the Regulations affect international trade and trade marks.  This is clear from the recitals to the TPD itself and from the fact that in Article 1 it is stated that the purpose of the TPD is to implement the FCTC and it is also evident from the legal basis of the Regulations, namely Section 94 Children and Families Act 2014 (see paragraphs [241] above).  The Regulations do not lose the character of a health measure (involving shared competence with the EU) simply because they cover, in part, other matters such as trade or intellectual property. It is well established in case law that if a particular measure pursues a two-fold aim then it is the “<span style="font-style:italic">main</span>” or “<span style="font-style:italic">predominant</span>” purpose which governs competence. The mere fact that an act has implications for international trade is <span style="text-decoration:underline">not</span> enough for it to become a matter of common commercial policy and hence the exclusive competence of the EU. This is clear from numerous judgments of the Court of Justice: See e.g. Case C-137/12 <span style="font-style:italic">Commission v Council</span> (22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> October 2013) at paragraphs [53] and [57] and Case C-491/01 <span style="font-style:italic">R (SSH) ex p. British American Tobacco</span> [2002] ER I-11550 at paragraphs [94] and [96]. Standardised packaging measures are thus “shared” competence matters even though they impact upon intellectual property rights. Common sense dictates this answer as well. If the trade mark tail were allowed to wag the health dog this would prevent the Member States from adopting <span style="text-decoration:underline">any</span> health measures which indirectly affected international trade. A health measure governing for instance ingredients in food or beverages or building materials would become a matter for the EU’s exclusive competence simply because it affected a product in international trade. The purpose of the Regulations is health based, not trade mark based. This governs competence and the Member States have power to adopt measures such as the Regulations. </p>

In <span style="font-style:italic">Daiichi</span> an issue arose as to whether a provision of TRIPS had direct effect because it fell within a field where the Member States had primary competence (cf. paragraph [40]). The Court considered whether TRIPS was, following the coming into force of the Lisbon Treaty, a matter of shared competence between the EU and the Member States or one of exclusive competence for the EU alone. The Court held that the effect of the Lisbon Treaty was that TRIPS was an aspect of the common commercial policy of the EU and that this fell within the exclusive legislative competence of the EU.  It is argued that the conclusion which flows from this judgment is that Parliament had no jurisdiction to adopt the Regulations since this, in effect, trespassed into a field of jurisdiction (intellectual property and trade) over which the United Kingdom has, following the Lisbon Treaty, no competence.  As such the Regulations are unlawful.</p>

First, as is evident from paragraph [59] it is open to the EU to legislate in the area of the internal market - which is explicitly an area of <span style="text-decoration:underline">shared</span> competence between the EU and the Member States - in a manner which impacts upon intellectual property <span style="text-decoration:underline">provided</span> that this is consistent with TRIPS and the mere fact that intellectual property is touched upon is not sufficient to make a measure one for the exclusive competence of the EU.  As the Court explained when the EU legislates its rules <span style="font-style:italic">“... will have to comply with the rules concerning the availability, scope and use of intellectual property rights in the TRIPs Agreement”</span>. TRIPS makes it abundantly clear that the scope and effect, including usage, of intellectual property rights may be subject to limitations on grounds of public health; and the TPD which is an internal market (shared competence) measure expressly aspires to be compliant with relevant international law obligations (such as TRIPS): see Recital [59]. Accordingly in principle provided that the TPD is consistent with TRIPS it can perfectly lawfully reserve or delegate to the Member States the power to act in relation to trade marks; and it would follow from <span style="font-style:italic">Daiichi</span> that provided the national measures are themselves consistent with TRIPS then, again, there is no ground for asserting that they are illegal or <span style="font-style:italic">ultra vires</span>. </p>

Exclusive competence prevents the Member States initiating legislation but it does not prevent the EU, in accordance with the overriding principle of subsidiarity, choosing to exercise its exclusive power by then delegating certain measures to Member States.

Article 16 TRIPS makes clear that the most elemental, bottom line, right attached to a registered trade mark is the right to exclude third persons from using the trade mark (see paragraph [177] above).  Regulation 13 (set out at paragraph [249] above) protects both the right to registration and the right to exclude (see analysis of Regulation 13 under Ground 10, Section N at paragraphs [870][883] above) and ensures consistency between the Regulations and TRIPS. As to rights of use Article 16 TRIPS does no more than afford to the Contracting States the “<span style="font-style:italic">possibility</span>” that they should extend the basic right to use rights, and in the EU and in the UK no such extension has occurred (see Section D(4) and (5) above). </p>

There is no evidence before the Court that BAT was unaware of the Report or did not have it squarely on its radar or was in any way prevented from advancing submissions about it.  Indeed, it is hard to see how it could have overlooked the Report. Further, anyone who reads the Hammond Ireland Report will immediately have understood that it was relevant. There is no evidence that BAT was unaware of the Report.  BAT has not adduced evidence upon this to suggest otherwise. The tobacco companies were not shy about making submissions to the Government and they did so even after the formal expiry of the consultation exercise.  BAT had the chance to make submissions about Hammond Ireland. For whatever reasons it chose not to.</p>

This can be seen from the fact that its submissions were specifically annexed and its expert views were also summarised, along with those of the other tobacco companies whose views it shared.  It is significant that no other Claimant has supported BAT in this complaint.  There is no basis for submitting that BAT’s point of view was not conveyed to Ministers.  It was submitted alongside other evidence some of which was consistent and supportive (for example that of the other Claimants) and some of which was inconsistent and hostile. In oral submissions it was suggested that BAT’s points were submerged amongst the welter of other evidence, i.e. that in the noise its views were drowned out. The implication of this seems to be that the civil servants should have been more selective and, in their selection, have given greater prominence to BAT than to other tobacco companies. This is unsustainable. This submission was cast at the highest level of generality and did not descend at any point to a detailed, forensic, analysis of the submission in order to support a contention that in particular respects and ways the document conveyed an inaccurate or unfair impression or view. </p>

They did, however, refer to the way in which the point was put in their initial pleaded Grounds served at the outset of the litigation. There, the Claimants advanced arguments which, in effect, are subsumed within the other Grounds relating, in particular, to proportionality. The particular points raised at that stage included the following: First, the decision to introduce standardised packaging was premature given the extant reference to the Court of Justice; second, the experience of standardised packaging in Australia established that the Regulations would have no meaningful effect upon prevalence levels; third, the Regulations would be ineffective and counterproductive because they would lead to the growth of illicit </p>

As such there was a balance to be struck. The view was taken in the assessment, which it can be assumed Parliament shared, that real and tangible public interest benefits to the health of children and young adults and older consumers could be lost if the Regulations were delayed (for example to await further information and data from Australia); further that any delay could have adverse long term repercussions for the public purse.

Tipping paper is not part of the packaging of a cigarette but, rather, an integral part of the cigarette product itself. The distinction between the packaging of cigarettes and the appearance of cigarettes is clear from the ordinary meaning of the language used in the TPD. This distinction is evident from the <span style="font-style:italic">travaux préparatoires </span>to the TPD which is valid as a guide to interpretation of the TPD itself </p>

There is no evidence to demonstrate that restricting the colour of tipping paper to white and cork-effect, and restricting brand names to a Helvetica 8 point font, will make any contribution towards the public health aim sought to be achieved by the Regulations. The Defendant’s claim that plain or cork-coloured tipping paper is justified on public health grounds is unsubstantiated pure assertion. </p>

Tipping paper production is said to be a complex and sophisticated process. The image to be displayed on the paper is etched onto the surface of a cylinder, that cylinder is then rotated through an ink fountain, and the surface of the cylinder is scraped, leaving the ink to be transferred onto the paper within the cylinder’s recesses.  The paper is then pressed to the cylinder and the image is transferred to the paper. The paper is dried at particular temperatures which take account of the inks and printing substrates being used. Each individual product may require the use of several different inks. After the initial printing process, the paper may also be subject to foiling, perforation and embossing.  The evidence indicates (and this is not challenged by the Defendant) that the Claimants have invested in product innovation within the tipping paper market and seek intellectual property protection for the fruits of their endeavours. For instance the Tann companies alone have 32 patents registered around the world. These Claimants produce a diverse product range that is said to include at least 8,000 different colours, textures and designs of tipping paper. The evidence indicates that the range includes multi-coloured products (up to five colours), electrostatic and micro/macro laser perforations, and hot foil stamping. Their turnover is tens of millions of Euros each year, with the European market accounting for the majority of that turnover. The two key “inputs” into the printing process (other than the paper itself) are ink and the print cylinders. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">My conclusion on these issues (which I elaborate upon below) is as follows. First, the phrase “packaging” in the Regulations is undefined and ambiguous; however, when read purposively in the light of the FCTC it means all that which covers, surrounds or encases tobacco. This includes tipping paper. Second, even if that is wrong, nothing in EU law would prevent Member States from introducing an extra restriction on advertising and branding <span style="text-decoration:underline">on</span> tobacco products as an anti-avoidance measure to increase the <span style="font-style:italic">effet utile</span> of the restrictions on packaging. Third, and even if the first two arguments are wrong, the TPD is a measure of partial harmonisation such that it is open to Member States to introduce restrictions going beyond the TPD, including therefore <span style="text-decoration:underline">on</span> tobacco products. In order to determine the proper scope of the TPD I address the following series of questions which breaks the issue down into its constituent components: (i) Whether the FCTC embraces as part of its overall policy the regulation of advertising and promotion <span style="font-style:italic">on</span> tobacco products themselves; (ii) whether that policy has been adopted by the EU and incorporated into the TPD; and (iii) whether the substantive provisions of the TPD on standardised packaging reflect that policy, applying an appropriate approach to interpretation; (iv) whether even if Article 24(2) does not cover the product itself the Member States have the power/competence in law to legislate in relation to the product either because this is not a field covered exclusively by the TPD and/or because it is necessary to prevent circumvention of rules prohibiting advertising on outer packaging and to protect the <span style="font-style:italic">effet utile</span> of such rules. </p>

The first sentence contains a broad statement about “<span style="font-style:italic">packaging</span>”; but the second sentence refers to “<span style="font-style:italic">tobacco pack or product features</span>” and seems, linguistically, to be a follow-on elaboration of what is meant by “<span style="font-style:italic">packaging</span>” in the first sentence. The conclusion that packaging means everything that packages or wraps around tobacco is, in my view, a fair and logical reading of the Convention.  I accept that another possible reading, and that advanced by Ms Bacon QC for the Claimants, is that packaging has a narrow meaning and covers only the outer packaging.  But this interpretation is inconsistent with the purpose of the FCTC which the TPD sets out to implement and the Guidelines which, as the Court of Justice, confirmed strongly in <span style="font-style:italic">Philip Morris</span> were to be given very great probative evidential value and could even be decisive. The underlying vice is the attractiveness of the advertising or promotion and this is common to both the pack and the features on the product and no distinction is drawn between these two locations for advertising in terms of that vice.

The burning of the paper is not toxic in the way that the tobacco is.  To equate the paper with the tobacco is to conflate two quite different things and would serve to undermine the policy objective of the TPD.

First, under ordinary principles of interpretation it is open to Member States to introduce anti-avoidance measures which ensure that the packaging restrictions achieve their intended effect.  All measures of EU law are to be interpreted to achieve their effect; this is the doctrine of “effet utile”.  If the TPD permitted Member States only to regulate the outer packaging but not the product itself this would create an incentive for the tobacco manufacturers to enlarge to the maximum degree the advertising and promotions potential of the product itself.  In other words limiting regulation to packaging would stimulate avoidance strategies on the part of the </p>

The adoption of future proofing and anti-avoidance measures is, as I have already emphasised, a recognised part of the overall policy as set out in the FCTC which the TPD seeks to introduce and it is therefore consistent with the legislative policy behind the TPD that Member States should be able, when they introduce packaging restrictions, simultaneously to introduce measures designed to ensure that the positive health effects of those measures achieve their end and are not undermined or circumvented by advertising placed elsewhere.

Second, and in any event, as a measure of partial harmonisation the Member States are entitled to enact legislation controlling branding and promotion on tobacco products themselves. I have set out fully at paragraphs [263] – [266] above the reasons why the Member States enjoy a pre-existing competence to regulate in this area which jurisdiction <span style="text-decoration:underline">includes</span> the imposition of branding and promotional restrictions and curbs on tobacco products themselves and I do not repeat those reasons here.  The judgment of the Court of Justice in <span style="font-style:italic">Philip Morris</span> also addresses an argument advanced by Ms Bacon QC for the Tipping Claimants which was that since in Article 13 TPD the EU legislature had addressed restrictions on tobacco products themselves it was therefore to be assumed that the EU had fully occupied this field to the exclusion of supplementary legislation by the Member States.  In fact the Court made clear that the competence of the Member States was fettered only to the extent that it adopted measures which conflicted with express provisions of the TPD and/or thereby replaced them.  The fact, therefore, that the EU has taken <span style="text-decoration:underline">some</span> measures is not an indication that Member States may not take further measures.  In this regard it is plain that the measures of control in the Regulations neither conflict with nor replace any measure set out in the TPD. The judgment of the Court of Justice in <span style="font-style:italic">Philip Morris</span> confirms that Member States can adopt additional control measures provided they are not inconsistent with those “aspects” of tobacco control regulated by the TPD (ibid paragraphs [71] – [84]).  </p>

This evidence also makes it plain that packaging is simply a larger “billboard” than the cigarette stick; yet the stick still remains an important space for advertising to be placed upon. Everything that physically surrounds or encases or packages the tobacco itself creates a potential location for some form of promotion.  The intrinsic advertising force, for instance, of colour or symbols thus remains regardless of the location of the advert.

	    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.04in">“...the WHO has observed tobacco companies seek to circumvent and undermine the effectiveness of tobacco control measures all around the globe.  Circumvention strategies include selling sleeves and stickers to obscure health warnings and using inserts within packaging. It is also common for branding to appear on tobacco products themselves.  The long history of industry strategies such as these suggests that a comprehensive approach to plain packaging that extends the measures to the product itself, as well as to the sleeves, stickers and other similar devices, is necessary in order to prevent circumvention and ensure that plain packaging achieves its maximum effect”. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Ms Bacon QC for the Tipping Claimants submitted that there was no logical evidential “bridge” which linked the position vis-à-vis the outer packaging with the stick itself.  I cannot accept this; the link is self-evident and the policy imperative for Governments to adopt “comprehensive” and future-proofed policies is just such a logic bridge which means that if the Regulations were confined to the outer packaging this would leave an important and already recognised loophole which the tobacco manufacturers could and undoubtedly would exploit with concomitant risks to health.   Professor Hammond pointed out in his analysis that branding on cigarette sticks operates in the same way as branding on the exterior of the packaging.  Indeed, UK cigarette sticks use the same type of colour-coding as the brand imagery displayed on the exterior of packages. A review of UK brands from the 10 leading brand families in 2014 found that, in all cases, brand variants used different colour markings on sticks to distinguish brand variants, and that the colour of the brand names printed on tipping paper corresponded to the brand imagery and colours on the exterior of pack.  Professor Hammond concluded that it was highly likely that tobacco companies would increase the amount of branding on sticks if standardised packaging only applied to exterior packages.  In my judgment this is common sense and I accept the proposition.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">In my view once it is established that there is a proportionate need to regulate the outer packaging of cigarette boxes then there arises a powerful – and proportionate – need to regulate the product itself on anti-avoidance grounds. The evidence – or “bridge” as Ms Bacon QC put it – does not require much if anything at all by way of extra evidence to support it.  That follows from: (i) the logical inferences that can be drawn from the acceptance by the tobacco companies that the importance of (even a diminishing area of) particular surfaces increases as the scope for <span style="text-decoration:underline">other</span> forms of advertising decreases; (ii) the evidence of the correlation in design strategies between the packaging and the stick and tip; and (iii) the fact (which was unchallenged) that the only difference between advertising on the outer packaging and the product was physical location. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">However, in any event, it is also possible to identify specific research evidence which has direct relevance to the attractive force of advertising upon the product itself. There is a small but consistent body of evidence specifically addressing the impact of colour and branding on cigarette sticks. This shows that the characteristics and appearance of the cigarette itself affect an individual’s perception of the attributes of the cigarette. Different colours and brand images can impact upon the perceived levels of attractiveness of the product and can communicate messages as to the relative strength and harmfulness of different products. For example, in one study (Borland and Savvas, published online in Tobacco Control, March 2012), researchers conducted an investigation into adult smokers in Australia (N=160, aged 18-29).  Their research suggested that a stick with a cork-patterned tipping paper and a gold band was seen as most attractive, of highest quality and strongest in taste compared to other tipping designs, while branded sticks were seen as more attractive, higher in quality and stronger tasting than non-branded designs, regardless of brand.

But they must be seen in context: There is a substantial volume of evidence concerning the impact of advertising on outer packaging and, in my judgment, this evidence must also be taken into account because logic dictates that if it is effective on the outer packaging it is capable of having some effect when on the product itself. Further, the submission that there is no evidence highlights the problems associated with the absence of disclosure. The criticism advanced by the Tipping Claimants, however, assumes a number of matters about the strategic intentions of the tobacco companies themselves. However, internal tobacco company documents refute these assumptions. Industry documents demonstrate that colour and brand imagery placed upon the cigarette sticks themselves operates in a manner which is similar to that upon the outer packaging. A number of internal documents are cited in the evidence of the Secretary of State.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The next argument advanced by the Tipping Claimants is that the introduction of product restrictions will increase the incidence of illicit tobacco which will have adverse public health consequences. This was advanced very much by way of assertion and was not backed with any qualitative or quantitative evidence. The 2014 Impact Assessment concluded that there was a “sizeable likelihood” (ibid paragraph [280]) that standardised packaging (i.e. everything contained within the Regulations, including that pertaining to the product itself) would cause no discernible increase in the UK duty unpaid market. However it also concluded that there was “<span style="font-style:italic">a chance</span>” that there would be an increase in the UK duty unpaid market. The position was thus, on balance, there would be no impact upon the illicit market but that the possibility that there would be an impact could not be excluded. To quantify this possibility a critical value analysis was undertaken which examined what increase in the share of the market would be required to yield a zero NPV (Net Present Value) of the policy. Two models were developed of sources of possible increases in the UK duty unpaid market. These focused upon (a) the possibility that those who continued to smoke under standardised packaging diverted to the illicit market; and (b) that those that would otherwise quit smoking under standardised packaging also diverted to the illicit market. The models generated estimates of the rate of diversion from the licit to the illicit sector. However, the assessment went on to consider the extent to which any enhancement or diversification of the risk posed by the illicit market could be countered by improved monitoring and strengthened enforcement controls and regulation. The 2014 Impact Assessment has mooted the possibility of the introduction of enhanced criminal offences. The Assessment states: </p>

I find this analysis entirely persuasive and there is no evidence or analysis which contradicts it. </p>

This was an argument advanced at a high level of abstraction.  The response of the Secretary of State, with which on the evidence I agree, was that standardised cigarette design was unlikely to exert any material impact upon the ease with which brands could be counterfeited on stick design because the vast majority of existing trade marks or designs on cigarettes were already straightforward to reproduce and counterfeit.  A Witness Statement produced on behalf of Tann suggested that standardised packaging would reduce distinguishable differences between brands which would ease the path of counterfeiters.  However, differentiated brand information remains permitted under the Regulations and this includes the brand name and brand variety.  Professor Hammond points out that such minor differences in what was now permitted and nonpermitted would make no difference to the modern printing technology which was used to counterfeit designs.

There is again no qualitative or quantitative evidence to support this proposition and it is in any event parasitic upon the argument about counterfeiting.  It is a proposition which needs to be placed into context. The existing scientific literature identifies approximately 7,000 compounds in “legal” cigarettes which are inhaled. The literature suggests that approximately 250 of such compounds have harmful effects.  70 are known to be carcinogenic.  The scientific literature provides no support for the proposition that there is any difference in the risk of different cigarette brands given the magnitude of harm presented by any brand.  There is no support in the literature for the proposition that restricting branding on cigarettes would lead to an increase in counterfeiting of any magnitude that would increase the health risk to consumers. I reject the argument. </p>
