	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.74in">The geographical location of Cyprus in the Mediterranean Sea represents the effective reason for the human, legal and diplomatic story that lies behind this case.  Cyprus has been described as “at an important cross-roads between the Middle East and Europe” (see paragraph 316 below). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.74in">So far as the human story is concerned, a boat leaving the coast of Lebanon with the intention of travelling to Italy is likely to pass close to Cyprus.  One such fishing boat (“a 40 foot clinker built open-decked vessel in poor condition”, according to a report dated 9 October 1998) left Telebibi near the Lebanese Tripoli at about midnight on 6 October 1998 carrying 75 people who were trying to escape from their home countries for a variety of reasons.  The boat (described by one observer as “barely a floating coffin”) was operated by people smugglers who charged $2000 for each person for the proposed journey. After two days at sea the boat’s engine failed and the “crew” abandoned the boat in an inflatable with an outboard motor leaving the “passengers” behind.  Some of the men on board succeeded in restarting the engine and, having sighted land, managed to steer the vessel towards what turned out to be a rocky shore line at the base of some cliffs near to Akrotiri on the south-west coast of Cyprus. (The sketch map in the Appendix demonstrates the position of Akrotiri.)  The boat arrived there at about 17.00 on Thursday, 8 October 1998. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.74in">It was the good fortune of those on board, a group which included 10 adult women and 24 children (one of whom was only 2 days old), that British servicemen at the nearby RAF base became alerted to their plight.  They were all airlifted by helicopter from the boat and taken initially to Episkopi within the Akrotiri Sovereign Base Area.  Happily, unlike many who have attempted a similar journey, all survived. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.74in">The existence of the Akrotiri Sovereign Base Area (and also the Dhekelia Sovereign Base Area) on the island of Cyprus is a reflection of the geographical importance of Cyprus from the UK’s strategic military point of view (see paragraph 58 below).  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.74in">Amongst those rescued were the six claimants in this action and various members of their respective families.  As will appear, in the ensuing years various other children were born within those families (and certain other family members joined the claimants’ families) and this claim for judicial review is effectively brought on behalf of the whole group.  What distinguishes the individual claimants and their families from some others who were on the boat is that the claimants have been recognised as “refugees” for the purposes of the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees (‘the Refugee Convention’). </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.74in">It is that Convention and the subsequent Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees (‘the 1967 Protocol’) that represents the beginning of the legal story in this case. That legal story is set against the background of Cyprus ceasing to be a British colony and becoming a Republic in 1960 when at the same time two areas (Akrotiri and Dhekelia) were retained under UK sovereignty to enable them to continue to be used as military bases reflecting the strategic importance to which reference has been made above. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.74in">The claimants and their families have essentially been permanently resident in the Dhekelia military base since their recognition as refugees.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.74in">As indicated above, the Secretary of State has denied the claimants the option of entry to the UK.  In essence the claimants assert that this breaches their rights under the Convention and the Protocol which they say apply to the military bases and thus apply to them, or, if that is wrong, that both have at least been expressly <span style="text-decoration:underline">treated</span> by the UK Government as applying to them and they should, therefore, be permitted entry to the UK. They also say that the Secretary of State’s decision means that they are discriminated against by reason of their status as refugees currently resident in one of the military bases and it thus infringes their rights under Article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights (‘the ECHR’).  They seek an order from the court quashing the decision to deny them entry to the UK. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.74in">The claimants seek to challenge the Secretary of State’s position by challenging a decision said to be contained in a letter dated 25 November 2014. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.74in">The Secretary of State contends that the Convention and the Protocol do not apply to the military bases as a matter of international law and, accordingly, the obligations asserted to exist by the claimants towards them do not arise.  Alternatively, if contrary to that contention the UK owes obligations to the claimants under the Convention (or by virtue of treating them as entitled to the protection of the Convention), those obligations were discharged when in 2005 arrangements were made with the Republic of Cyprus (‘RoC’) by virtue of which the RoC recognised the claimants’ refugee status and agreed to accept the claimants as RoC residents with (a) access to its social services and welfare system and (b) the opportunity to apply for RoC (and thus EU) citizenship.  The claim based upon unlawful discrimination is denied. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.74in">The Secretary of State also contends that the challenge to the letter of 25 November 2014 represents an attempt to bring the judicial review claim within time by challenging “an ancillary or consequential action when the claimants have been told on several occasions throughout the years that the UK would not admit them”.  It is contended that the claim is out of time and should not be entertained. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.74in">Whilst maintaining the argument based on delay, Mr Thomas Roe QC, for the Secretary of State, sensibly and realistically acknowledged that where the future of recognised refugees (including their children) is concerned, the court will want to consider carefully the substance of the case advanced irrespective of any delay.  I will, of course, return to it, but my essential focus will be upon the merits or otherwise of the competing arguments on the substantive issues. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.74in">The judicial review proceedings were issued on 24 February 2015, and thus just within 3 months of the letter of 25 November 2014.

I make no complaints because the issues raised are important, but it needs to be appreciated that it has been quite impossible for me to follow every avenue that the text of these documents might suggest is there to be followed.  I have focused principally on the matters that Mr Raza Husain QC, for the claimants, and Mr Roe advanced in the course of several days of oral argument. </p>

I will be describing aspects of that position later in the judgment.  The Secretary of State suggests that the 17 or so years that the claimants have spent on the island of Cyprus means that they would be better off settling there.  The claimants disagree and wish to come to the UK.  Doubtless the question of where they might better be settled is an issue upon the merits of which views may reasonably differ.  As I have said, it is no part of the court’s function to express any view, one way or other, upon it or be influenced by it other than to note its existence as part of the background.  Indeed, lest there be any doubt about it, it should be emphasised that it is <span style="text-decoration:underline">not</span> the court’s task to decide what ultimately should be done about the position of the claimants and their families: its task is simply to determine whether the Secretary of State’s currently expressed decision was arrived at lawfully.  </p>

There is the question of precedent to consider, as you pointed out to me when we spoke, but I think we should be careful not to make too much of this.  The Sovereign Base Areas are very different, legally and constitutionally, from the other UK overseas territories.  This was recognised in the FCO’s recent review of the overseas territories, from which the Sovereign Base Areas were specifically excluded.  The overseas territories are run by autonomous civil governments that have the facilities, in the last resort, to accommodate refugees that cannot be resettled elsewhere.  So there is no overwhelming pressure for them to be admitted to the UK.  The MOD administration in the Sovereign Base Areas has no such facilities and we cannot, because of our Treaty obligations, accommodate refugees on any sort of permanent basis.  Hence we do not believe that we would be opening the floodgates were we to admit this handful of people into the UK.  Nor would we expect the Sovereign Base Areas to become targeted by asylum seekers.  Anyone attempting to reach the island by sea would be far more likely to end up in the Republic of Cyprus, and the Republic’s approach to illegal immigrants can be expected to deter all but the most desperate.  Any arriving on our territory by land would simply be handed back to the Cypriots under well-established procedures.” (Emphasis added.) </p>

Mr B was one of the first to be recognised as a refugee (in July 1999). His wife and children were still in Syria and he raised the possibility of their joining him which, he says, SBA officials told him was not possible.  He made a formal application to the same effect in March 2000, but the response was that “it was not possible within the [SBAs] … [where] there are restrictions on both temporary visits and permanent settlement.”  Reference was made in the reply to trying to find “a solution to your permanent settlement.”  In late October or early November his wife and two children arrived illegally in the Republic.  It appears that a lawyer in the Attorney-General’s Office asked that they be reunited with Mr B “in accordance with the principle of family unity enshrined in [the Refugee Convention and Protocol].”  The then Fiscal Officer, Mr Livingstone, replied on 2 November 2000 saying that “the authorities of the [SBAs] are prepared to allow family re-unification in this case.” </p>

First, there is no SBA society or economy into which the Administration can integrate the refugees.   Second, the SBAA simply does not have the executive arms or resources which a normal civil government would be able to bring to bear on the problem.

In May 2002 the Minster replied that the SBAA “applies the principles of the Refugee Convention when dealing with asylum seekers and acts in close cooperation with the [GoC].”  The reply said that discussions between the government and the GoC “regarding the long term future of the … refugees … are continuing.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.74in">Further Cabinet Office memoranda arising from this period have been disclosed in this action which, in summary, demonstrate that the UK Government was hoping that the desire of Cyprus to become a member of the EU (an objective that the UK Government welcomed) would enable some “leverage” to be utilised to secure an acceptable agreement on the asylum seeker issue.  Negotiations with a view to agreeing an MoU took place over the succeeding months, the apparent deadline being 4 October 2002.  Drafts of the MoU prepared by the UK Government Departments included provisions designed to pass responsibility for those in the SBAs granted refugee status to the RoC.  However, it appeared that the RoC was adamant that “existing asylum seekers in the SBAs” should be treated “separately from future arrivals”.  It is clear from a telegram dated 16 October 2002 from the British High Commission to all the interested UK government departments that there was a political element to this position because of some impending elections in the RoC.  According to the e-mail, the position at Ministerial level within the RoC was that in the then pre-election period there would be a “negative impact of [the refugees] moving from the SBAs to the Republic” and that something was required from the UK “to counter-balance this.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.74in">Finally I can confirm that we are content to pay the costs you have identified and which you provided me at the meeting on 27 September.  For ease of reference and the record these are attached as Annex A to this letter.  Although we did not discuss it at the time I am assuming that where there are families with one child or three or more children the costs will be adjusted appropriately.  I can also confirm what I said at the meeting that we are content to make this as a one off payment at the time of hand over to the relevant RoC authorities.  I note that the costs have been assessed on the assumption that social security payments will be made for four months and that education and medical costs will be made for a year.  We agreed that the bureaucratic burden required to establish a process to identify the exact time that the RoC retained a financial liability outweighed any advantage that might accrue from having an exact cost.  On that basis therefore I am content that the payment should be a one off per capita payment. </p>

According to the note made, the SBAA officials thought that the RoC side had modified the position previously taken in regard to compensation payments to be made by the SBAA and in relation to the need for a fresh assessment of those residents of Richmond village who would be “handed over”.  It appears from the note that the perception of the SBAA representatives was that the cases of even those already granted refugee status would be subject to review “in the light of possibly changed circumstances”.  This was noted to have been agreed as meeting the intention of the MoU.   </p>

There were various reasons why. First of all, we were aware that the Cypriot Government had denied responsibility for us in 1998: The Minister at the time made a public statement that we were the responsibility of the SBA and the UK. Secondly, for all the years we had lived in the SBA most of us at one time or another had been subjected to ill treatment from the Cypriot Police and the Cypriot Immigration Authorities …. Thirdly many of us were, and still are, afraid that we would be deported back to our countries of origin if we agreed to become the responsibility of the Republic of Cyprus …. Fourthly, we had already been living in limbo since our arrival on the SBAs and we were not the responsibility of the Republic of Cyprus, we were and are the responsibility of the UK who should have done more to assist us.  </p>

In his witness statement, ‘Mr B’ says that during 2005 the SBAA stopped fixing the sewers and the water supply and that the street lights and the roads ceased being repaired.

It is now a year since the agreement was reached with the Republic that they would assume administrative responsibility for the refugees and asylum seekers at Richmond village.  It is the view of the SBAA that we need to do something to encourage those that remain to transfer.  As a consequence, therefore we proposed to give those who claim and receive social welfare payments from the SBAA two months’ notice that this practice will cease.  They will be told that they need to transfer administratively to the RoC in order to continue to receive payments.  The two months’ notice is sufficient time for the refugees and asylum seekers to register with the RoC and to have their initial claim assessed and then to receive payments before the payments from the SBAA cease.” </p>

The UNHCR continue to state that this also means they have a right to opt to stay in the SBAs.  In the past we have always thought this meant the UNHCR would be opposed to any move to evict refugees and asylum seekers from Richmond village, but at a meeting in August the UNHCR have clarified their view that the right to opt to stay applies to the SBAs in general and not Richmond village in particular.  This means we can evict from Richmond village, although if they were able to find somewhere else to live the Administrator would need to maintain their temporary right to remain within the SBAs.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.74in">“Whilst some of this may be attributed to the general state of disrepair of the accommodation it is possible that this may have been worsened as a result of action taken by the Administration in January 2008 to render a number of empty houses uninhabitable.  This action was taken to prevent further individuals from joining Richmond village and to deny those who had left the ability to return.  This work involved the rough removal of door and window frames.  Although temporary alternative accommodation has been offered, the current occupants of the village refused to leave to allow the necessary work to take place to render the site safe.  We have therefore only been able to erect temporary fencing to restrict access to the worst affected areas.  If the Administration is left with an ongoing responsibility for these families, alternative accommodation will have to be found.  Due to the “military nature” of the SBAs there is no rental accommodation available, and the option of using empty married quarters – all of which are now in close proximity to other service quarters, which would present unacceptable security constraints.  The SBA has identified only one viable option for alternative accommodation, which would be the erection of mobile homes costs approximately £500,000.” </p>

We, however, consider that the above concerns are not valid.  Firstly, those families have already been recognized as refugees prior to the MOU signed between the SBAs and the Republic of Cyprus.  A decision to resettle them to the UK would not set a precedent for any other person seeking asylum or has been recognized after the entry into force of the MOU.  Secondly, the number of persons to be accepted in the UK in this “one off” case, is only 35 persons and their resettlement to the UK will be seen as part of the UK’s responsibility for the international obligations of the SBAs, and not as part of the UK’s general resettlement programmes.  In other words, it cannot be said that if these families are resettled to the UK, they would take away opportunities from other refugees currently in more need for protection and durable solutions. </p>

The families have at no time been given any encouragement to believe that they could be.  It would be contrary to UK policy to accept the transfer of refugees who have no close connection to the UK and it would also be inconsistent with our policy on asylum applicants who arrive in British Overseas Territories or Crown Dependencies. </p>

Although there has been a debate before me about whether, as a matter of law, the Refugee Convention applies, it seems clear that it was the intention of the Secretary of State, when reaching the conclusion expressed in the letter, to act in accordance with the spirit of the Convention.  She said she was applying the policy on “asylum applicants who arrive on British Overseas Territories or Crown Dependencies”, a policy which precludes consideration of “applications for … transfer of refugee status” from anyone who is not “on … the mainland territory of the UK” which, for this purpose, excludes “the UK’s Overseas Territories, Crown Dependencies, or Sovereign Bases such as the ones in the Republic of Cyprus”, a policy, it is asserted, that is in accordance with the Convention. </p>

It seems clear that one reason for not making an exception to the policy was that the refugees “have the right to reside in the Republic of Cyprus and have strong links with the Republic.”  Although not said expressly, this is presumably an implicit reference to the 2005 agreement which, the letter argues, provides “a durable and suitable solution for their long term residence.” </p>

The review of the history set out above demonstrates that the consistent position taken at Ministerial level within the Home Office is that to admit this group could be seen as setting a precedent which would encourage other migrants to try to use the SBAs as a route to the UK.  However, it is also clear that at times officials in the Home Office (see paragraphs 147 and 154), the FCO (see paragraphs 86 - 87), the Ministry of Defence (see paragraphs 76 and 95) and the SBAA (see paragraphs 94, 96, 146 – 149 and 154) were of the view that there was no realistic alternative but to allow the refugees to come to the UK. </p>

Whilst Mr Husain has sought to characterise the decisions to this effect made at various times in the past as “political decisions”, he has not sought to base the claimants’ case to quash the Secretary of State’s decision because it is, or may have been, influenced by these “political” or “policy” issues.  He asserts that the decision has been taken having overlooked the full legal implications of the situation, including the need, as he contends, for the full complement of obligations that the UK owes to the claimants given their status as recognised refugees to be met.  He also contends that reliance upon the 2005 agreement is misplaced (a) as a matter of principle and, in any event (b) because of the demonstrable fragility of the agreement. </p>

It is possible that the legal advisers to each of the Departments of State that has an interest in this issue have taken differing views.  These views are, in any event, irrelevant since ultimately it is a matter for the court to determine.  Nonetheless, the case advanced on behalf of the Secretary of State for Defence (and thus the UK Government) in the hearings before the Senior Judges’ Courts (see paragraph 160 above) was that the Refugee Convention did not, as a matter of law, apply to the SBAs and that submission was upheld.  It is acknowledged by Mr Roe that I am not bound by that decision, although he submits it is of persuasive value.  I will return to the decisions of the Senior Judges’ Courts below (see paragraphs 185 – 187, 192, 197 – 203 and 249), but it is necessary to note the formal history of the adoption of the Refugee Convention and the 1967 Protocol so far as it affects the Island of Cyprus in general. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.74in">I am not really sure that, as thus articulated, this argument advances Mr Roe’s case.  The concession made in the earlier proceedings was premised on the basis that the Refugee Convention <span style="font-style:italic">per se</span> applied to the SBAs from the moment they came into existence and that the Protocol simply confirmed the position henceforth after it was ratified, that confirmation deriving from the “deeming provision” constituted by Article VII.4.  If he is right that the Convention did not apply to the SBAs as from the time they were created, this argument does not arise at all.  The Detailed Grounds of Defence asserted that “[contemporaneous] documents suggest that officials considering whether to make a notification in respect of overseas territories when ratifying the Protocol … did not consider the SBAs at all, either to extend the … Convention to a territory to which it had not previously extended or withdraw its application from a territory to which [it] had been extended.”  The inference, it was suggested, was “that they were not considered as part of this process because, given the limitations on the government of the SBAs and military purpose, the 1951 Convention did not, or ought not apply in any event to them, with the result that a decision did not need to be made either way.”  I will return to this argument, but Mr Husain’s response is that if the Convention was not considered to be applicable to the SBAs for the reasons given, the easiest course would have been expressly to exclude them when the 1967 Protocol was being considered. </p>

In due course virtually all the islanders were removed from the BIOT mainly to Mauritius.  In 2004 two Orders in Council were made by the UK government (‘the Constitution Order’ and ‘the Immigration Order’) which removed any right of abode and disentitled the islanders from entry or presence on the islands without specific permission.

That declaration lapsed when Mauritius became independent. No such declaration has ever been made in respect of BIOT. It is true that the territory of BIOT was, until the creation of the colony in 1965, part of Mauritius. But a declaration, as appears from the words “for whose international relations it is responsible” applies to a political entity and not to the land which is from time to time comprised in its territory. BIOT has since 1965 been a new political entity to which the Convention has never been extended.” </p>

The court took the view that no one feature would be decisive and that matters would have to be looked at in the round with a view to assessing the cumulative effect of the available material. Logically, it was said, the first port of call was the documentation raised at the time.  The court referred to the Treaty of Establishment and, in particular, to Appendix O (see paragraph 52 above) which, the court observed, “placed considerable limitation upon the use to which SBA land could be put – the SBAs’ primary function was undoubtedly military.”  However, the substantive conclusion can be discerned from the following passages in the judgment: </p>

This is new material – in the sense that it was not made available to the court below. By way of example, an Administrator, Chief Officer, Resident Judge, Senior Judge, Administrator’s Advisory Board and Legal Adviser were all appointed at the outset. We also look at the new legislation enacted at the time by the Administrator, as appears in the first SBA Ordinances. One of the first steps was to provide for the continuation of existing law – altogether unnecessary, say the respondents, if this were merely the continuing of a colony. The Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia Order in Council 1960 provided a constitution for the SBAs. All this taken together, in our judgment, points strongly towards the creation of a new regime and entity, the establishment of something new rather than the continuation of the old regime ….

It is perhaps difficult to see, from the points of view of either the newly emerging RoC or the UK, what the point or advantage would be of retaining two small colonial appendages to a new independent state.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.74in">As to the second factor upon which Mr Husain relies, it is necessary to identify what he means by “State practice”.  In essence, as I understood him, he is referring to the FCO (then the FO) practice in relation to the Refugee Convention when applied to what he argues was the analogous position of the Turks and Caicos and Cayman Islands when they were “retained” from the former colony of Jamaica.  The general argument as to State practice that he advances is, however, broader than that: he argues that, on analysis of the history of FCO practice concerning conventions, as recognised internationally, that practice is consistent with the proposition that no fresh declaration of adherence to the Refugee Convention was necessary in the circumstances of the creation of the SBAs.  However, that argument, as I perceived it to have been presented, is a different argument from simply saying that the principle established by <span style="font-style:italic">Bancoult No 2</span> should be construed narrowly: it is a separate way of submitting that the Refugee Convention applies to the SBAs as a matter of international law. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.74in">Since no submissions were made in <span style="font-style:italic">Bancoult No 2</span> concerning State practice, I am unable to see how the existence or otherwise of a State practice in relation to the adoption of a convention when a new political entity is created can have any direct bearing upon how the expression “new political entity” as used in that case is interpreted.  If what Mr Husain was truly relying upon was what he contends is the analogy of the Turks and Caicos Islands and the Cayman Islands, then as a starting point I find it difficult to accept that the approach of the FCO to one example of “decolonisation” can amount to a “practice”, even leaving out of account the usual requirement that the practice should receive broad international recognition. Nonetheless, I will consider what happened in relation to the Turks and Caicos Islands and the Cayman Islands to see if this throws light on whether the SBAs should be treated as new political entities or effectively the continuation of the preindependence arrangements for the purposes of the Convention. </p>

As at that date, the Turks and Caicos and Cayman Islands were part of the British colony of Jamaica. In relation to the Turks and Caicos Islands this status was recognised expressly by section 1 of the Cayman Islands and Turks and Caicos Islands Act 1958. The precise constitutional position of the Cayman Islands was not expressly identified in the Act, but, as with the Turks and Caicos Islands, the islands were considered formally to be Dependencies of Jamaica.  </p>

This appears to have been part of the process involved in the formation of the Federation of the West Indies, a federation which history demonstrates lasted only from the end of 1958 until 1962. Nonetheless, pursuant to the 1958 Act separate Orders in Council were made on the same day (13 May 1959) making provision for the government of each of these two groups of islands with effect from 4 July 1959. Each Order in Council appears to be in identical terms and provides for a separate Governor for each group of islands who in fact was the person who held the office of “Captain-General and Governor-in-Chief of Jamaica”. Each Order in Council provided for the appointment of an “Administrator” of the islands who was to be appointed by the Governor “with the approval of a Secretary of State” (see paragraph 8(1) of each order).  Each Order in Council provided for an Executive Council and a Legislative Assembly.  The Legislative Assembly had the capacity to debate and pass Bills subject to the assent of the Governor and/or the Secretary of State.  The Legislature of Jamaica could make laws “for the peace, order and good government of the Islands” which could prevail over the laws enacted by the relevant Legislative Assembly. </p>

On his argument, they were a part of Cyprus at the time of the extension relating to Cyprus and their subsequent translation into a different status should be seen as analogous to the position of the Turks and Caicos Islands and the Cayman Islands. </p>

The letter to which reference has been made is a letter between the then Commonwealth Office and the Foreign Office dated 25 August 1966 (and thus well after the arrangements referred to in paragraph 210 above).  It appears to be an internal government communication generated in the runup to the implementation of the 1967 Protocol which was in a draft form at that stage having been approved for consideration by States Parties by the UN General Assembly in 1966.  The letter was in reply to one asking about “the effect of the Protocol upon overseas territories”, a matter which the reply says “raises questions of some difficulty”. The writer begins by listing the territories “to which the Convention applies, and those to which is does not.”  Listed amongst those to which it does apply are the Turks and Caicos Islands and the Cayman Islands and the reason given in parenthesis is “As a result of extension of the Convention to Jamaica.” It is to be noted that the SBAs are not mentioned in either list. </p>

However, as already foreshadowed, I do not consider that one example of how the UK Government approached the question of the applicability of the Convention would necessarily provide a secure foundation for determining its applicability in another situation. The approach itself was taken against the background of “questions of some difficulty” arising and there is no clear indication in the material before the court about the precise legal approach being adopted. Since the matters were being considered well before<span style="font-style:italic"> Bancoult No 2</span> was decided, there is no express reference to what was or was not to be regarded as a “new political entity” in that material. The inference I draw from the material I have seen is that pragmatic solutions were often adopted to areas where there was potential uncertainty without the close analysis to which the issues would be subjected in a court of law. So far as the various overseas territories were concerned, acceptance of the applicability of the Convention plainly depended very much upon whether the territory (for which, in the<span style="font-style:italic"> Bancoult No 2</span> sense, one must read as “the political entity responsible for the territory”) was willing and able to deliver to a refugee the full complement of the obligations provided for under the Convention.

Although that new status could arguably be seen as constituting a “new political entity”, the reality was that each group of islands was just as able as each had been hitherto to meet the obligations undertaken under the Convention.

This was the approach of the Secretary of State in the Circular referred to in paragraph 214 above and the need to adopt it is obviously sound.

On that basis there was nothing to do, either positively or negatively, so far as the Convention was concerned. I agree with Mr Husain that, for the avoidance of doubt, the UK Government could have made a decision in 1966/67 formally to exclude the SBAs from the Protocol under Article IX (see paragraph 34 above).

The letter dated 12 February 1964 (referred to at paragraph 237 above) has all the hallmarks of an implicit recognition that the practice adopted in relation to the MLAs was at least debateable and was adopted by the UK as a pragmatic course.  Whilst recognised as valid by “nearly all” other relevant States, it appears that acceptance of the practice was not universal. Without minimising the importance of the objective or indeed of the treaty itself, in essence what was required was a means by which an acknowledgement by all other treaty States of the correct destination for “requests for service or for the taking of evidence” was achieved.  The means adopted required a recognition that the relevant convention applied to the SBAs from the outset.  Whilst, of course, consistency of practice is desirable, I consider that treating the Refugee Convention in the same manner would devalue the significant issues that would need to be considered before that Convention was adopted (see paragraph 221 above). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.74in">The argument starts with Article 29 of the VCLT (see paragraph 44 above) and that the expression “their entire territory” includes any overseas territories.  This interpretation is supported in the 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> edition of <span style="font-style:italic">Oppenheim’s International Law</span> (Jennings and Watts) where it is said that the “entire territory … probably includes overseas territories (such as colonies) which are under the sovereignty of the state ….”  Although the VCLT was not operative in 1960, it was a largely a codifying treaty and I will assume that the principle it established was generally accepted at the time.  As recorded above (see paragraph 209), on 25 October 1956 the UK declared that the Refugee Convention extended to Cyprus. In 1960 part of the territory of Cyprus became an independent sovereign State for which the UK was not responsible in international law.  However, as the argument continues, the ToE defined the “territory of the Republic of Cyprus” as the Island of Cyprus excluding the SBAs which were to “remain under the sovereignty of the United Kingdom”.  As a matter of international law, the UK thus remained responsible for the part of the territory of Cyprus that remained part of the UK’s sovereign territory over which the 1956 extension operated. However, the UK Government has never exercised its right of notification under Article 44(3) of the Convention (see paragraph 38 above) in respect of the SBAs. It is contended, therefore, that the proposition that the Convention continued to apply to the territory occupied by the SBAs is also demonstrated by the fact that it continued to apply to the RoC without the need for the RoC to accede to the Convention: the RoC notified the UN on 11 June 1963 that it considered itself “bound by the Convention … the application of which had been extended to its territory before the attainment of independence.” It is argued that if no notification or accession was necessary in the case of the RoC, the position of the SBAs “must be <span style="font-style:italic">a fortiori</span> because the sovereignty of the UK remained unaltered.” </p>

But I cannot see how that decision could impact on the position of the SBAs which, for this purpose, might well be treated as a third party: see <span style="font-style:italic">The Oxford Guide to Treaties</span>, Hollis, 2014, at pp. 408-409.  One thing that does seem to be clear from the relevant academic writing, both in the 1960s and more recently, is that the effect of some of the succession instruments concluded in that earlier period was “uncertain and controversial”: e.g., Aust, <span style="font-style:italic">op cit</span>, at p. 322.  If I were free to decide this issue without reference to the principle in <span style="font-style:italic">Bancoult No 2</span>, I have to say that I would not regard the international law dimension as so clear and settled that I could accede to Mr Husain’s invitation to reach the conclusion for which he contends. </p>

For my part, I would see “a different intention” from the general proposition in Article 29 of the VCLT being “otherwise established” by virtue of the very unusual status of the SBAs and their intrinsic inability to discharge the full complement of obligations required by the Convention.  That may have required careful consideration to be given to the requirements of any existing refugees who happened to be living in the territory that became an SBA for whom existing obligations would undoubtedly have been required to be honoured.  But Mr Husain’s colourful suggestion that the converse position from that for which he contends could lead to an overnight “turning off of the lights” is somewhat fanciful. </p>

It seeks to establish clearly that the Charter applies primarily to the institutions and bodies of the Union, in compliance with the principle of subsidiarity. This provision was drafted in keeping with Article 6(2) of the Treaty on European Union, which required the Union to respect fundamental rights, and with the mandate issued by the Cologne European Council. The term ‘institutions’ is enshrined in the Treaties. The expression ‘bodies, offices and agencies’ is commonly used in the Treaties to refer to all the authorities set up by the Treaties or by secondary legislation (see, e.g., Articles 15 or 16 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union). </p>

First, he says that since Article 5(2) of Protocol No 3 requires the UK to exercise controls on persons crossing the external borders of the SBAs, any decision involving the control of individuals who have crossed the borders of the SBAs (which would include the claimants) would constitute implementation of EU law and/or would fall within the material scope of EU law. Second, since the UK must work with the RoC to make arrangements for “respecting the rights” of asylum seekers under paragraph 7(b) of Part Four of the Annex to the Protocol, he submits that self-evidently such arrangements that the UK implements must not infringe the </p>

Mr Roe dissents and makes what seems to me to be the compelling point that if the intention behind Protocol No 3 was to place upon the SBAs the significant obligations arising from the Refugee Convention and Protocol (having decided not to do so in 1960), the objective would reasonably be expected to have been achieved by some express declaration rather than, as he described it, a “paper chase”. He observes that the Contracting Parties expressly applied the provisions of the EC Treaty concerning agriculture (see Article 3 of the Protocol No 3) and asks rhetorically ‘why not include the Refugee Convention and Protocol if that was intended?’ </p>

(I accept, of course, that determining the subjective intention of the UK Government, to the extent that it can be said to exist, is difficult and, as in many contexts, an objective analysis of what was done could lead to the conclusion that the Convention was applied to the SBAs via this route.

He does draw attention to the fact that Article 5(2), whilst requiring the UK to exercise controls over certain persons crossing the external borders of the SBAs, does not purport to apply any of the EU Treaties to the SBAs (apart from the specific and limited aspects referred to in Articles 2(1), 3 and 4).

The obligation to secure, in such an area, the rights and freedoms set out in the Convention, derives from the fact of such control, whether it be exercised directly, through the Contracting state’s own armed forces, or through a subordinate local administration. Where the fact of such domination over the territory is established, it is not necessary to determine whether the contracting state exercises detailed control over the policies and actions of the subordinate local administration. The fact that the local administration survives as a result of the contracting state’s military and other support entails that state’s responsibility for its policies and actions. The controlling state has the responsibility under art.1 to secure, within the area under its control, the entire range of substantive rights set out in the Convention and those additional Protocols which it has ratified.

He suggested that the obligation to assimilate is the stronger where a refugee has been in what is acknowledged to have been an unsustainable situation for nearly 18 years.  He recognises that the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Al-Skeini</span> related to the ECHR, but says that, by analogy, the approach to the Refugee Convention should be the same. </p>

In those circumstances, the European Court of Human Rights held that the UK owed certain obligations towards those individuals under the ECHR.

Given that it is common ground that “assimilation” and eventual “naturalisation” is not possible in the SBAs because no permanent British society exists there, the consequence of the proposition for which the claimants contend is that they must be assimilated in the metropolitan territory – in other words, within mainland UK.  </p>

That, he submits, could not possibly have been intended because each Contracting State must be taken to be able to facilitate the assimilation and naturalization of a refugee wherever within its overall territory the refugee may be and wherever within its overall territory the Contracting State places such a person for the purposes of assimilation and naturalization.

The administering powers nevertheless should do everything possible to stimulate their development and it was incumbent on the administering authorities to apply the covenant with due regard the degree of development in each territory on the basis of a realistic approach both to the problems of the non-self-governing populations and to the needs of the minority of settlers living among them. </p>

As a rule the U.K. Government undertook no obligations on behalf of the colonies under any convention or treaty without consulting the local Governments. If the colonial clause were omitted, the participation of colonies in an international convention would become automatic and those territories would thus find themselves deprived of the right to decide for themselves. The opponents of the colonial clause would therefore seem to be illogical since they demanded autonomy for the peoples of the non-self-governing territories while at the same time denying them the right to decide for themselves. In his opinion the only correct and democratic solution was to incorporate in the covenant an article allowing a colonial power to accede immediately to the covenant for its metropolitan territory and subsequently, after consultation with the colonial territories, for each of the colonies when they had declared their willingness to have the covenant extended to them. If the colonial clause were not incorporated in the covenant the metropolitan Governments would be obliged to consult all their colonial territories before ratifying the covenant. In the case of the U.K., that would not prevent the Government from applying the covenant but would delay its accession to it. </p>

If the Contracting State wished to permit the refugee to resettle in the metropolitan territory, that would be a course open to it, but would it be mandatory? Mr Hussain appears to be arguing that the refugee would have a right to choose where in the Contracting State’s territory he or she would live given the terms of Article 26. This does not seem to me to follow. Provided that the obligations under the Convention can be fulfilled within the non-metropolitan territory where the refugee is lawfully (see paragraphs 336 - 338 below), I do not see the words of Article 26 as giving the refugee the right to choose to live within the metropolitan territory.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.74in">In line with the position taken in the Detailed Grounds of Defence, Mr Roe has argued that Article 8 is not engaged in this case.  It is suggested that, whilst it is true that continuing to live in the inadequate conditions of Richmond Village affects the family and private lives of the residents adversely, simply because their current lives as individuals are unhappy is not sufficient to engage Article 8. Attention is also drawn to the fact that they have never resided in the UK and have no family life or private life in the UK that is interfered with or not respected by the decision not to admit them.  I do not think this aspect of the argument requires detailed analysis.  As with the argument advanced in <span style="font-style:italic">R (A (A Child))</span>, this seems to me to be altogether too narrow an approach to the issue. Given the broad scope of Article 8 and the broad nature of what constitutes a link to it, in my judgment, any decision that, directly or indirectly, has the effect of prolonging the period during which the claimants must continue to occupy their homes in Richmond Village engages Article 8.  It is unnecessary to consider the details more closely: Mr Roe says that the court should not proceed on the basis that the report of Mr Horrocks (see paragraph 382) is the last word on the matter and I agree, but there is sufficient agreed evidence concerning the living conditions (e.g. the asbestos) to make it quite plain that any decision that prolongs the period the claimants (including their children) remain there affects their family and private life in the broad sense required for this purpose (see paragraphs 381 - 396 below).  That many other refugees around the world may themselves be affected by similar, analogous or worse deprivations is irrelevant to this conclusion. </p>

It is being forced to remain in their present circumstances and accommodation that, in my view, constitutes the principal interference with the claimants’ Article 8 rights.  Removal from that situation by coming to the UK is no less difficult for the claimants than any other resident of another BOT for the reasons already given.  To that extent, any discrimination arising from the fact that there is no route to citizenship for an SBA resident is far removed from the actual interference with the Article 8 rights that generate the potential for an Article 14 claim.   </p>

This was that the rights which would be put at risk if he were to be returned to Hong Kong were his rights under the Convention—in particular his rights to life and liberty, to a fair trial and not to be subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment: see articles 2, 3, 5 and 6.

I will not repeat in detail all the references to this effect, but they include the references recorded in paragraphs 62, 63, 64, 67, 68, 93 and 98 above.  I have used the compendious expression “UK Government” because it would be unrealistic to separate the actions for this purpose, for example, of the SBAA and any of the Departments of State with an interest in this matter.  The SBAA is subject to the ultimate authority of the Secretary of State for Defence<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="12">

In the Detailed Grounds of Defence the argument was advanced that the recognition of the refugee status of the Claimants was an act of the SBAA and not of the Secretary of State.  Mr Roe did not develop this argument in his oral submissions and, in my view, wisely so.  It would, in my view, be a wholly unmeritorious argument given the repeated commitment by various officials (with Ministerial sanction) to treat the claimants as refugees even if the Refugee Convention did not apply as a matter of law to the SBAs. </p>

However, the letter recognises the “refugee” status of the claimants and seeks to justify the decision not to admit them to the UK at least in part by reference to the general policy concerning the admission of refugees to the UK.  Nonetheless, all this seems to me to be dancing on the head of a pin: the short point, in my judgment, is that any decision made in accordance with the policy adopted in respect of the claimants from a very early stage had to acknowledge, or take into account, the implications of the Convention, at least so far as possible.  It would be a wholly unacceptable U-turn for the UK Government to maintain to the UNHCR, to others and to the claimants from the time they arrived on the island of Cyprus that the obligations under the Convention would be honoured in spirit and that they would be treated as refugees (if they justified the status) only for the decision that they could not be admitted to the UK to ignore that commitment. </p>

He says that the claimants may have had this impression initially, but that it was dispelled with the passage of time.  He says that it was made perfectly clear in the court proceedings in the SBAs that the claimants were not entitled to these rights.  It is true that the Summary Grounds of Defence in those proceedings avers that the Convention does not apply to the SBAs (although it is said the SBAs are bound by the principle of non-refoulement) although the alternative contention is advanced, namely, that even if the Convention did apply various rights (e.g. those relating to housing, public assistance and welfare) were not absolute rights. </p>

However, giving the decision letter the fair reading that is called for in an application such as this, I do not consider that either the Convention or the commitment to treat the claimants as refugees was ignored (see paragraphs 332 - 335 below).

In the letter of 8 November 2011 the refugee status of the Claimants is acknowledged by the UKBA and reference is made to the agreement of the RoC “to accept and resettle the refugee families”, a matter explained by reference to the informal agreement between the SBAA and the RoC for the latter “to honour any decisions made by the SBAA in respect of the families and </p>

If the SBAs could not meet those obligations (which they could not, certainly in full), then the argument would be that arrangements had been made with a third country that (at face value) could do so and was willing to do so.  I will return to the question of whether that would operate as a discharge of the UK’s obligations to the claimants on the basis that they were to be treated in the spirit of the Convention in due course (see paragraphs 339 – 346 below). </p>

Overall, therefore, given the whole sequence of this correspondence, I consider that this aspect was considered and taken into account.  However, Mr Husain’s principal argument is that any position taken by the Secretary of State such as that to which I have referred comes nowhere near meeting the spirit of the Convention.  I will address this fundamental submission first.  If I am satisfied that, in principle, the position taken is a proper response to the commitment given, the final issue will be whether it addresses adequately the alleged fragility of the “understanding” with the RoC so far as the Claimants are concerned. </p>

Mr Roe says that the precise legal status of the claimants is not wholly clear on the evidence and does not wish to concede that they are “lawfully” in whichever is the relevant territory, but equally does not seek to argue that they are present “unlawfully”.

Mr Husain drew my attention to <span style="font-style:italic">R (ST) v SSHD</span> [2012] 2 AC 135 in support of the proposition that Article 32 confers “an entitlement for a recognised refugee to stay indefinitely in the receiving contracting State” which, he submits, means in this context “the UK and its territories”.  That case certainly establishes that once a refugee’s presence within the territory of the Contracting State has been recognised as “lawful”, the entitlement to remain in the Contracting State arises.

As I have said, I have received no argument on this issue, but it is not difficult to see in the light of the observations of the Supreme Court in that case that, notwithstanding the length of time the claimants and their families have been present in the SBAs, their status as being there “lawfully” is not conclusively demonstrated despite being given Travel documents from time to time.

Mr Husain says that, irrespective of whether the claimants do or do not have legitimate grounds for not consenting to any arrangement with the RoC, the fact that they do not consent to it means that any attempt to force the arrangement upon them would breach their rights under Articles 26 and 32.

As to Article 32, he contends that the UK Government (i) cannot require the claimants without their consent to leave the SBAs and (ii) must permit them to reside perpetually in territory for which the UK is responsible in international law. Given that the SBA does not provide a durable or suitable long term location for the claimants, the Secretary of State is bound, he submits, to make arrangements for their re-location within UK territory and it is inconsistent with the UK’s duty under the Convention “for the Secretary of State to adopt a policy or make a decision that is premised on the Claimants being removed to a third country”.  His argument is that this would amount to “a form of constructive removal” which is contrary to the object and purpose of the Convention in general and Article 32 in particular.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.74in">I should say at the outset that I have not been referred to any other case in which the concept of “constructive removal” has been considered in this context. The word in Article 32(1) is “expel” and it is, of course, easy to envisage the normal method of expulsion employed when a Contracting State feels entitled to remove a failed asylum seeker. Using the same method to remove an acknowledged refugee from the territory of a Contracting State who is otherwise lawfully entitled to be there would amount to a clear breach of the Convention. But difficult issues arise where the conduct of the Contracting State falls below what constitutes expulsion in the true sense of the expression and into the category of non-fulfilment of many of the Convention obligations with the exception of the obligation of non-refoulement. Mr Roe submits that, on the evidence in this case, the UK is not seeking to “expel” the claimants from the SBAs. They have the right to remain there if they wish although, in the longer term, not in their present accommodation. However, the position would be, on the basis of the agreement with the RoC, that they remained within the SBAs but as the responsibility of the RoC in terms of securing their rights under the Convention. This does not, Mr Roe argues, constitute expulsion from the SBAs and, in any event, the refusal of the Secretary of State to admit them to the metropolitan territory of the UK does not amount to expulsion. </p>

If and to the extent that it is said that the effect of the informal agreement with the RoC, if implemented, would amount to the expulsion of the claimants from the SBAs, then I do not accept the submission, essentially for the reasons given by Mr Roe. What seems to me to be the more important part of the argument is whether the UK, which plainly has accepted primary responsibility for the claimants by accepting that they must be treated as refugees (or treated in the spirit of the Convention) can, in principle, make arrangements with a third country to discharge the obligations under the Convention and whether it is entitled to consider the territory of the SBAs as separate from the metropolitan territory.

Second, the evidence suggests that, certainly in the early stages, they would have accepted transfer to a third country such as Canada or America if it could have been achieved.

At the outset (see paragraph 90 above) it saw the responsibility for deciding what to do for the recognised refugees as a joint one between the UK and the RoC. Furthermore, it appears also that the UNHCR has in the meantime over the years looked for re-settlement opportunities other than in the UK (see the sixth paragraph of the letter referred to in paragraph 164 above). </p>

When the question is asked in that way, it is difficult to see why a negative answer should not follow. Provided that there is no question of <span style="font-style:italic">refoulement</span> and the essential minimum requirements of a Contracting State’s obligations to the claimants as refugees are met by the third country, then that, in my judgment, meets the test of applying the spirit of the Convention where the Convention, as a matter of law, does not apply and the obligations to which it gives rise cannot be fully met in practice.  </p>

If it becomes necessary to reconsider the decision concerning the admission of the claimants to the UK, it would in principle, in my judgment, be open to the Secretary of State to take into account any offer or arrangement for a third country (including, of course, the RoC) to accept the normal Convention obligations in respect of the claimants in substitution for the obligations that, in spirit, the UK was prepared to accept in respect of the claimants. </p>

Mere brevity does not necessarily equate with inadequate consideration, but it does raise the question of the extent to which appropriate attention was paid to the status and efficacy of the “understanding” between the RoC and the UK. As the letter stands, it conveys the impression that the Secretary of State’s view was that there were no doubts about the existence of the understanding and its effective implementation if relied upon by the claimants. An issue that arises is the extent to which the Secretary of State needed to satisfy herself of matters that justified that position: should she have given the circumstances “anxious scrutiny” and, if so, is there evidence that she did so?  I will return to that issue, but in the first instance a number of features of the background germane to the “understanding” need to be summarised because there is, on the evidence, little doubt that the “understanding” has had a somewhat chequered history and a question-mark exists over whether it is something with which the RoC has always been wholly comfortable. </p>

It is (or at least was at the time) the considered position of the local representative of the international organisation with responsibility for overseeing the protection of refugees.

It is, of course, usual for the UK (including its courts) to rely initially upon a presumption (albeit rebuttable) that a Contracting State will comply with its international obligations under the Convention, but in the light of the UNHCR’s position as expressed in the letter, supplemented by Mr Jones’ intention to have what must be assumed to be a “quiet word” with Interior Ministry officials, there must at that stage have been concerns about whether that presumption could be relied upon if the issue had been addressed.   </p>

There it was contended that in March 2000 at least two of the claimants claimed they were entitled to be admitted to the UK under the Refugee Convention and sought entry clearance.  It was presumably intended to be argued that the grounds for bringing a claim existed then.  However, no final decisions concerning those applications were ever made (see paragraph 85 above) and it is, in any event, difficult to see how the other claimants could be shut out as a result.  It was also said in the Detailed Grounds of Defence that the claimants had been told on several occasions throughout the years that the UK would not admit them on a discretionary basis, the argument presumably being that there was an opportunity to challenge that position at an earlier stage.  There was no reference in the Detailed Grounds of Defence to the letter of 8 November 2011.   </p>

That letter, he submits, represents in substance a communication to the claimants of the Defendant’s position.  The grounds to make the claim arose long before the letter of 25 November 2014 which, he says, merely restated the Defendant’s position again. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.74in">I do not accept these arguments.  In the first place, the letter of 8 November 2011 was not a response to a request from the claimants for a decision: it was simply an up-date on the UKBA’s view of the position in response to a request from the UNHCR to provide one.  However, perhaps more importantly, I would accept that, given the indications on behalf of the Secretary of State that re-settlement in the UK was not seen as an option, the claimants might have forced a reasoned decision from the Secretary of State at an earlier stage in the chronology of events.  The Secretary of State’s position during that period might well be seen as a provisional view (cf. <span style="font-style:italic">R (Burkett) v Hammersmith and Fulham LBC &amp; Anor</span> [2012] 1WLR 1593 at [43]) bearing in mind that, at least internally, there was a debate about whether the claimants might to be permitted to come to the UK (see paragraph 178) and, whilst </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.74in">any decision to that effect would be against established Home Office policy, there existed the overall discretion in the Secretary of State to make an exception to that policy.  However, it is tolerably clear from the review of the extensive history undertaken earlier in this judgment that efforts had been made from time to time to secure a practical resolution of the situation and it is possible that the strength of feeling within the group of claimants about the possibility of coming to the UK has varied during that process.  Nonetheless, for whatever reason, no attempt was made on behalf of <span style="text-decoration:underline">the whole group</span> to obtain a clear decision until the joint letter from Mr Ishak and Ms Charalambidou of 30 September 2013.  It was, it should be emphasised, a letter from the <span style="text-decoration:underline">claimants’ Cypriot legal adviser and the UNHCR</span>.  It put forward an articulated case for re-settlement in the UK and undoubtedly was seeking a response.  That there was no follow up by the authors of that letter (to which Ms Young refers in her witness statement) does not seem to me to be of relevance.  Ms Young herself appreciated that a substantive reply was required which is why she pursued it with Mr Gale and others.  The ultimate reply was appropriately apologetic about the delay in responding, but it did amount to a rejection of the arguments advanced in the letter to which it was a reply.  In my view, it represented a decision that went sufficiently far to permit a judicial review challenge if the claimants wished to advance one. </p>

In light of my earlier conclusion, it would have to be seen as a continuing breach by the UK of a selfimposed obligation to act within the spirit of the Convention, but I can see that there may be some force in the argument.  However, I prefer the analysis set out in paragraph 377 above and, accordingly, I do not think that this claim is out of time.  If I was wrong in that analysis I would hold, painting with a broad brush, that the very unusual background to the case demands that, if invited to do so, the court should find a way of adjudicating on the legal submissions made otherwise the human situation that underlies it will never be resolved.  If that requires an extension of time, I would be in favour of granting it.  However, for the reasons I have given, I do not consider that to be necessary. </p>

I emphasise strongly that the decision of the court is <span style="text-decoration:underline">not</span> that the Claimants have the right to be resettled in the UK:  it is simply that the letter setting out the Secretary of State’s reasons for saying in effect that this is not regarded as an available option is flawed and, accordingly, unlawful.

They are undated, but it is clear from internal aspects of the reports that the interviews were conducted in about September 2013.  The reports were prepared by a number of trainee clinical psychologists at the Centre for Therapy, Training and Research (“KESY”) in Nicosia at the behest of the UNHCR.  It appears that those who were 18 and over were subjected to tests to determine whether they suffered from depression and anxiety.  All showed both these features to a degree, Mr Bashir in particular showing signs of severe clinical depression and severe anxiety.  All the children were assessed to have suffered in their “psychological health” because of their living conditions.  The reports justified the summary given in the letter of 30 September 2013. </p>

Although all of the parents describe their own lives and aspirations as being over, they live in the hope that the lives of their children will be different and that they will have the future which has been denied to them. In the early years of the children’s lives, because they live in close tightly knit families where they receive a high degree of emotional and physical affection, the children are less aware that their lives are different in any way from other children or that they are more disadvantaged. However as the children grow and start to go to school and become more aware of their difference, they will experience social exclusion and racism at school. They come home and see how their living conditions are very different to other children in their schools. Of great concern is the accumulative nature of the experiences and lifestyles as well as the children’s exposure to the mental health difficulties of the adults, there is no sense of any improvement in their situation and as the children become older the impact of their living situation will have an increasingly negative effect on their overall development.”  </p>

Ms Young, for example, questions how much of the report is based upon observation rather than what Mr Horrocks has “picked up through conversation with the claimants.” She says that the “adults in the families have not sought to integrate outside their community whereas the children as a whole appear to have integrated well through their school attendance.” She says that some of the claimants have cars. </p>

When it comes to considering the options for dealing with the situation, it will be for the Secretary of State to weigh up conscientiously, as part of the decision-making process, the situation of the claimants and their families. It is almost certainly the case that many refugees throughout the world will feel a sense of isolation no matter how welcoming the environment into which they may have moved. Nonetheless, the report prepared in 2013 and the report based upon Mr Horrocks’ visit some two years or so later are very similar and do suggest an endemic problem so far as the psychological health of virtually all the claimants and their family members is concerned. If that is because they feel confined to something of a social no man’s land with no escape, then such an effect is hardly surprising. Whether it can be resolved in confirmed arrangements with the RoC or whether there is no alternative but to admit the claimants to the UK is a judgment that the Secretary of State will have to make in the light of all relevant information. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.74in">I should also say that I am unable also to make specific findings on the question of whether, as they allege, the claimants are actively discriminated against by the Cypriot authorities. All that can be recorded (as, I believe, is common ground) is that at an earlier stage, according to Ms Young, there was a time when the SBAA found “all aspects of interaction with the RoC difficult and slow” and that there was a time when, for example, Mr C said that he would move to the RoC but in order to do so needed welfare benefits from the RoC in accordance with the informal agreement. His applications were rejected, on one occasion simply because he lived in the SBA and not in the RoC. The SBAA took up the matter, but no resolution was achieved. As I understand Ms Young’s second witness statement, she expressed understanding as to why there might have been a perception of discrimination at that time, particularly since the other residents of Richmond Village looked on Mr C’s case as a test case.  However, she says that working arrangements are now much better.  This may well be so, but this is a very unspecific and generalised assertion.  The crucial factor for the Secretary of State to consider when reconsidering the decision will be the current strength of the informal agreement first entered into in 2005 since that is central to the position adopted on her behalf to date. </p>
