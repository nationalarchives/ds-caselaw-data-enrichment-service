	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">These three conjoined claims for judicial review all challenge decisions by the Secretary of State setting the level of weekly support payments to asylum seekers pursuant to sections 95 to 98 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 (“the 1999 Act”). The impugned decisions all follow the decision of Popplewell J in <span style="font-style:italic">R (Refugee Action) v SSHD </span>[2014] EWHC 1033 (Admin). In that case, which forms an important part of the background to the present case and which will need to be looked at in some detail hereafter, the Court quashed the decision of the Secretary of State in June 2013 that the weekly support payments for the 2013/2014 year should remain frozen at the rate of £36.62 per week, which had applied since 2011. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Popplewell J undertook a detailed analysis of the history of asylum support in the <span style="font-style:italic">Refugee Action</span> judgment which I do not propose to repeat here. For present purposes, the points to be highlighted are as follows. Asylum support is limited to those who are destitute, defined by section 95 of the 1999 Act as those who do not have any adequate accommodation or means of obtaining it and those who cannot meet their essential living needs. When an asylum seeker applies for support, and a decision is made to grant such support, accommodation is provided, at no cost to the asylum seeker, under section 96(1)(a) of the 1999 Act. Utility bills and council tax are met by the accommodation provider. The accommodation includes basic furniture and household equipment (cooker, fridge, washing machine, cooking utensils, crockery and cutlery). Cots and high chairs are provided for young children and sterilising equipment for babies under twelve months.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In addition, the asylum seeker receives a weekly cash payment under section 96(1)(b) of the 1999 Act to meet essential living needs such as food and clothing for him or herself and dependants, as set by the relevant Regulations and it is those weekly cash payments which are the subject of the present challenges. However, it is important to note at the outset that this is not the only means by which the UK discharges its obligations to asylum seekers. In addition to the accommodation support provided in kind and the weekly cash payments, asylum seekers have free access to the NHS. They obtain free prescriptions, dental care, eye tests and glasses. They are reimbursed reasonable costs of travel to and from hospital for scheduled appointments. They benefit from free access to libraries. </p>

However, following Council Directive 2003/9/EC (“the Reception Directive”) which laid down minimum standards for the reception of asylum seekers, the UK came under an obligation to provide a minimum level of support to all asylum seekers and their dependent children.

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“The justification for setting the adult rates at 70% of Income Support was that (1) asylum seekers were provided with furnished and equipped accommodation with all utility bills paid and (2) asylum support was intended to be a measure of last resort provided on a short-term basis. This involved adopting two different rates for single adults, one for those aged 18 to 24 and a higher rate for those aged 25 and over, because such a differentiation was (and still is) drawn in Income Support rates.”</p>

However, in 2008 the link with Income Support was broken and from 2009 a single rate for all single adults was introduced. The amounts were increased by the Consumer Price Index (“CPI”) rate of inflation for 2010/11 and 2011/12. No increase was made for 2012/13 or 2013/14. Accordingly, the decision was made to maintain the single adult rate at £36.62 per week.

Thus, the term “concerning” refers first of all, to measures and decisions directly concerning a child, children as a group or children in general, and secondly, to other measures that have an effect on an individual child, children as a group or children in general, even if they are not the direct targets of the measure.</p>

This does not mean that every action taken by the State needs to incorporate a full and formal process of assessing and determining the best interests of the child. However, where a decision will have a major impact on a child or children, a greater level of protection and detailed procedures to consider their best interests is appropriate.</p>

The extension of States parties’ obligation to their “legislative bodies” shows clearly that article 3, paragraph 1, relates to children in general, not only to children as individuals. The adoption of any law or regulation as well as collective agreements – such as bilateral or multilateral trade or peace treaties which affect children – should be governed by the best interests of the child. The right of the child to have his or her best interests assessed and taken as a primary consideration should be explicitly included in all relevant legislation, not only in laws that specifically concern children. This obligation extends also to the approval of budgets, the preparation and development of which require the adoption of a best-interests-of-the-child perspective for it to be child-rights sensitive.</p>

As mentioned above, the adoption of all measures of implementation should also follow a procedure that ensures that the child’s best interests are a primary consideration. The child-rights impact assessment (CRIA) can predict the impact of any proposed policy, legislation, regulation, budget or other administrative decision which affect children and the enjoyment of their rights and should complement ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the impact of measures on children’s rights. CRIA needs to be built into Government processes at all levels and as early as possible in the development of policy and other general measures in order to ensure good governance for children’s rights. Different methodologies and practices may be developed when undertaking CRIA. At a minimum, they must use the Convention and its Optional Protocols as a framework, in particular ensuring that the assessments are underpinned by the general principles and have special regard for the differentiated impact of the measure(s) under consideration on children.  The impact assessment itself could be based on input from children, civil society and experts, as well as from relevant Government departments, academic research and experiences documented in the country or elsewhere. The analysis should result in recommendations for amendments, alternatives and improvements and be made publicly available.”</p>

The family have been provided with accommodation latterly in Wythenshawe, Manchester and have continued to receive asylum support, notwithstanding that YT is now a failed asylum seeker because of the effect of section 94(5) of the 1999 Act set out at [9] above. However, on behalf of the Secretary of State, Mr Clive Sheldon QC submits that YT would cease to be eligible to asylum support now that RG has turned 18.

The issue of travel costs was addressed by switching the designated Post Office to one which is a five minute walk from their house.

In relation to insufficiency of funds in other respects, the Secretary of State’s position is that the Home Office is willing to provide additional payments under section 96(2) of the 1999 Act for any such exceptional need where the need and the cost of addressing it is properly evidenced. </p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“85…The <span style="font-style:italic">Marleasing</span> principle requires national legislation to be interpreted in a manner which is consistent with and gives effect to EU Directives. The content of the duty imposed upon the Secretary of State, by a combination of section 95 of the 1999 Act and Regulation 5 of the AS Regulations 2005, is informed by the European law obligations imposed by the Reception Directive. Provision for essential living needs must therefore be interpreted as including, as a minimum, provision of the minimum reception conditions required by the Directive. The minimum standard of living for which provision is required by the Directive is not a matter for the Secretary of State's subjective judgment but an objective standard. To this extent it is not open to her to treat essential living needs as having a lesser content than the objective minimum required by the Directive. Section 95 and 96 must be interpreted in such a way as to place such a view outside the range of reasonable judgments in order to be compatible with and give effect to the Reception Directive. If the Secretary of State were to make a judgment which treated essential living needs as something less than the minimum standard of living required by the Directive, it would be both irrational and unlawful. </p>

The Secretary of State must make provision under s.95 and 96 which is sufficient to meet this minimum standard of living, if and to the extent that such provision is not otherwise being made by another organ of the State. In assessing whether the levels of asylum support allow asylum seekers to maintain this standard of living, the length of time which they spend on asylum support, and the uncertainty of that period, is potentially relevant. It is one thing to spend a short period coping with severe poverty, another to have to cope with it for an uncertain period of years. But that is not a material distinction in the context of the current delays in the determination of asylum claims in the UK, averaging almost 18 months and running into years in a significant number of cases. </p>

As Recital (15) of the Directive recognises, it is open to Member States to provide for a more generous level of support to asylum seekers. In that respect the wording of the 1999 Act makes clear that the Secretary of State may make provision for what appear to her to be the essential living needs of asylum seekers. Subject to the minimum required by the Directive, it is a matter for her decision what needs are properly to be regarded as essential living needs. She may decide that some particular needs are essential living needs although they would not be necessary to ensure a dignified standard of living or meet subsistence needs. What is "essential" is a criterion on which views may differ widely.

As the learned judge pointed out at [124] and [125], that was derived from a comparison between the current rate for adults and the rate for 18-24 year olds in 2007. This was erroneous and misleading and, as the learned judge said, when the correct comparison was made with the 25 plus rate in 2007, the 2013 adult rate had decreased in absolute terms by 11% since 2007.

There was no necessary error in setting rates at a lower level than previously, since the latitude afforded to the Secretary of State was such that there was a range within which both figures might fall. However, given that the earlier figure was regarded as a bare minimum to avoid destitution, a reduction in rates would require justification by a careful investigation if it was to be rational.

Moreover s.95 contains the relevant power as well as the duty. The Secretary of State has power under section 95 to meet only what he or she considers to be essential living needs; any more would be ultra vires. As a matter of logic there is no necessary error in rates being set at what is lower, in real terms, than what was previously regarded as necessary to meet essential needs, because the latitude afforded to the Secretary of State in this value judgment means there is a range within which both figures might fall.

It is in any event flawed. Essential items are subject to inflationary increases just as non-essential items are. There is no logical basis for assuming the inflation rate is lower for essential items. The evidence of Mr Hirsch suggests the contrary. Moreover, the rational response to the fact that there may be different rates of inflation for essential items and non-essential items is to seek to identify what the relevant inflationary rate is, not to assume that it is nil. Nor is there any relevance or logical force in the suggestion that measures of inflation do not reflect an ability to make economies: asylum seekers only have their essential needs provided for, from which they are not in a position to economise.”</p>

The second reason was that, unlike those on Income Support, asylum seekers did not have to pay for, furnish and equip their accommodation or pay for utilities.

There is a different legal criterion for each of the two types of support. Income Support may legitimately provide for a higher standard of living than essential living needs. Income Support can also take into account factors relevant to those who have an established right to remain in the country such as integration, whether by employment or otherwise. But this is not the basis identified in paragraph 51 of Mr Bentley's witness statement for why asylum rates should fall further behind Income Support rates, although the decision letter to the Deputy Prime Minister does refer to "the different statutory framework" (in the context of s4 and s95 rates). The critical point is that if Income Support rates were to provide any useful assistance in setting asylum rates, which the Secretary of State must have thought they did by taking them into account, it was necessary to apply some rational criteria to quantify and justify the discrepancy between the two. Otherwise they could do no more than identify a ceiling for asylum support rates, and could not assist in identifying the correct level below that ceiling at which to fix the rates.”</p>

Mr Bentley then explains how the figures in the ONS survey were for a household of 1.3 people so that he and his staff recalculated the figures, for example for food and non-alcoholic drink, to arrive at a figure for a single person. To confirm whether this was appropriate, they looked at the ONS data for a single adult, which was in fact for the lowest 20% of the population rather than the lowest 10%. The ONS data was not in fact used for all the categories, but for clothing and footwear, travel and communications, the weekly figures arrived at by the Secretary of State were rather based on the review team’s own market research. He then explains how, in the light of Popplewell J’s criticism of the Secretary of State’s approach to inflationary increases, the figures arrived at were adjusted to take account of inflation since the ONS data was collected by applying the general 2.52% CPI increase for 2013 and a further 1.76% general CPI rate for 2014.</p>

However, with other categories where ONS data was used (toiletries, healthcare, household cleaning) they only selected the items in the category which they considered essential. The ONS figure for food and non-alcoholic drink adjusted to reflect a single person, not a 1.3 person household was £22.38 per week. They made an upwards adjustment of £1.50 per week to reflect the cost of one takeaway meal a week, as the ONS survey recorded those separately, arriving at a figure of £23.88 per week. </p>

The verification took two forms: (i) an article published by the BBC in April 2013 by Tom Sanders, professor of nutrition at King’s College, London which found that with careful planning, cooking skills and the right utensils, an adult could achieve a healthy balanced diet on as little as £12 per week; and (ii) a member of the review team who produced a shopping list and meal plan to show that she regularly fed herself healthily on about £15 per week. </p>

Accordingly, the review team did not use the ONS data, but conducted research to assess the cost of buying a basic wardrobe of three sets of clothing (one on, one clean and one in the wash) so that asylum seekers were adequately clothed to ensure good health. Mr Bentley sets out the details of this research which took an average of three retailers on the internet (Tesco, Asda and Matalan) and arrived at an annual figure for men of £120.50 and for women of £130.75. To provide some margin, they took the women’s figure, which equated with a weekly amount of £2.51. </p>

He also explains that shortly after the review was completed, in September and October 2014, they carried out further research of in-store clothing prices from Primark, which in fact gave lower annual figures of £115.50 for men and £112.50 for women. He says that items such as nightwear, gloves, scarves and hats were not included when the research was undertaken, because they were not seen as essential, but their research showed that a reasonable margin of £30-40 per annum had been built in which could be used for such additional clothing. </p>

Glasgow was chosen as one of top five dispersal areas, then Coventry, Wigan, Newcastle, Doncaster and Bristol. The results in relation to community, religious and leisure facilities were such that the team considered it reasonable to assume that, for the most part, able-bodied asylum seekers could access such facilities on foot without incurring travel expenses. Nonetheless they made some allowance for travel expenses. The 2012 ONS data for the poorest 10% of the population indicated that they spent an average of £2.62 per week on travel by rail or bus. The team considered it reasonable for asylum seekers to use a combination of walking and short journeys on public transport, but considered £3 per week a fairer allowance. As Mr Bentley explains, in most areas surveyed, this would cover a return bus fare, but by an oversight, Coventry and Wigan were not entered into the research grid. Return bus fares there were more than £3, £3.10 and £4 respectively, but the team still considered it reasonable to set the allowance at £3 per week, in part because they considered an asylum seeker would not necessarily need to make a bus journey at all or, at least, not every week. They also took account of the margins built in to the overall rate in relation to food, clothing and toiletries. </p>

The 2013 ONS data used was published on 2 December 2014. In relation to food and drink, the adjusted data for a household of one gave a figure of £23.46 per week, which, as before, was adjusted upwards by £1.50 to £24.96 to reflect the cost of a takeaway. The figures for toiletries, non-prescription medicines and household cleaning were amended to reflect the 2013 ONS data. The review team did not consider it necessary to change any of the other items on which they had conducted their own research, as the research had been conducted in June/July 2014 and, although not all of it was rechecked in 2015, additional research had been undertaken in September/October 2014 to underpin the research on clothing, as set out above. Further detail in relation to the 2015 review is set out below in the context of children. Inflation was taken into account through application of the general CPI rate, 1.55% as at November 2014. The result of this review so far as single adult asylum seekers were concerned was that the rate was increased from £36.62 per week to £36.95 per week.

That assessment is dealt with in detail in Mr Bentley’s third witness statement, to which I refer below. On 12 March 2015 the Secretary of State laid before Parliament the Asylum Support (Amendment) Regulations 2015, which would have increased the rate payable to a single adult asylum seeker and reduced the rates for dependent children to the same rate. Those Regulations were, however, subsequently revoked and replaced on 27 March 2015, before they came into effect, by the Asylum Support (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 2015. These gave effect to an increased rate of £36.95 for single adult asylum seekers from 6 April 2015, but reverted to the original higher rates for children.</p>

The principle of “equivalisation” which enables incomes to be adjusted for household size and composition to put them on a comparable basis, accepts “economies of scale” as a basic precept.

This factor, together with currency fluctuations, makes direct comparison between the systems used in different EU countries difficult. Nonetheless, it was clear that the payment systems in Germany, Sweden, and France (three countries with the largest intakes of asylum seekers that provide some support through cash) are based in part on the principle that less money per person is needed to cover the needs of multi-person households.”</p>

He then sets out detailed data in support of that proposition which it is not necessary to set out here, save to note that the ONS data for the bottom 20% of income group showed that for a single parent and children (household size 2.4) expenditure on food and drink was £16.92 per person and for two parents and children (household size 3.5) it was £20.06, in each case less than the £23.46 for expenditure by a single person in the bottom 10% income group. In summary, he concludes that the data shows expenditure by all income groups on expenditure items in the survey declined considerably per person in multi-person households, including specific expenditure on food. </p>

As an example, it was recognised that children may, in some circumstances, need to replace clothes more often as they are growing.

He summarises the results of that report and notes its conclusion that children aged under 10 require less calorific intake than older groups and, in general, females of all ages require less calorific intake than males, but otherwise there was no appreciable difference in the recommended levels based on age. He also says that the review team considered the latest National Diet and Nutrition Survey (“NDNS”) published in 2014 because it gave details of actual calorific intake.

The research undertaken had not looked specifically at children’s clothing, but it was assumed by the review team that the cost would be the same or very similar to that for an adult. The only factor that could make it more expensive was the probability that some children would need to replace clothes more frequently, although no assessment was made of how frequently, partly because no source of information was identified. The review team considered that, given the economies of scale available to families with children, particularly in relation to the cost of food, any additional clothing needs could be met within the total cash envelope provided to families. </p>

The research had not considered the specific needs of children in relation to these necessities, but it was considered the need associated with each item was the same or very similar to adults, namely to maintain personal hygiene, keep the house clean and buy medicines for minor ailments.

The research showed that, in all places, children under 5 travel free on buses and concessions are invariably available for those aged 6 to 16, either in the form of free travel or reduced fares. Accordingly, it was not considered that any more than £3 per week was necessary to meet any extra need to travel where there was a child in the household. As Mr Bentley points out, the provision of £3 per person per week would enable an adult to make a second journey where there is a child under 5. </p>

In general terms, the review found some needs easier to define and easier to cost than others (for example, those relating to maintaining a healthy diet and an adequate wardrobe of clothes). The package of support available, both before and after the changes to the payment rates, ensures that the children of destitute asylum seekers are provided with stable and safe accommodation and with adequate provision for their ordinary everyday essential needs.

Specifically the 2013 ONS Data was not published until 2 December 2014, the Adams and Levell report was only published on the internet in November 2014 and the JRF report on destitution was not published until March 2015. </p>

He takes particular exception to the suggestion in Mr Aspinall’s report that the Secretary of State was deliberately seeking to constrain the weekly rate to around £37, whatever the wider evidence base might suggest. Mr Bentley says that, in the light of Popplewell J’s judgment, the Secretary of State has endeavoured to develop a new, robust, evidence-based methodology for setting the asylum support rates. </p>

He says that he sees force in the argument and that the Secretary of State would consider making this adjustment when the rates are next reviewed. Mr Bentley then sets out an analysis of what difference taking specific indices would have made in both the 2014 review and the 2015 review and demonstrates that, in fact, it would have produced a lower overall level of inflation to be taken into account, because certain specific indices had remained the same or the CPI rate had reduced in 2014. Specifically, the CPI rate for food and non-alcoholic drink to be applied at November 2014 had reduced by 1.7%. In fact some hint of this was provided in Mr Aspinall’s table showing how he calculated his £44.79, which showed a reduction in the specific rate of inflation for food and non-alcoholic drink in 2014 of 0.2%. </p>

Indeed, in one respect, in relation to travel, she appears to have completely failed to take account of the fact that under the 1999 Act and the 2000 Regulations, travel is excluded from essential living needs except for certain limited purposes. </p>

She says that the ONS data for food and drink which provides the bulk of the support is already based on the average expenditure of multi-person households, including those with children, so that the rate derived from the data already encompasses any savings from the lower calorific requirement of children. She considers it unreasonable to assume that additional savings can be made. Other items, such as shoes and clothes, will only be of use to an individual of a specific size, shape or gender. There has been no consideration of wear and tear, children’s growth or increased consumption by or for children of certain items such as toiletries and cleaning products. She considers that, if a single rate for children is to be used it must be at a level to meet the basic needs of a child requiring the highest level of expenditure, otherwise the needs of such children are not met.  </p>

That and other factors have an impact on the need for transportation to prevent social exclusion and support the health and development of children. The methodology does not take account of items that are child-specific such as the internet, recreation, books and stationery. Appearance, hygiene and material possessions need to be sufficient to ensure that they support the development of the child’s self-esteem and independence. </p>

He says that the need of a child of an asylum seeker is similar as regards travel to that of an adult asylum seeker, although he accepts that travel to play with friends or for other social activities may generally be necessary as part of the emotional development of children. However, he does not consider that travel for those purposes would usually need to incur a cost and, in any event, the availability of concessionary fares would mean the cost of any necessary journeys would be lower than for an adult. </p>

As Mr Bentley says, the Home Office research had shown deals regularly available for less. In any event, Ms Charlesworth’s figure for communications is £4.07 per week as against the Secretary of State’s figure of £3 per week. She arrived at that figure by adding £1.07 to cover the cost of an internet subscription fee. Mr Bentley counters that, since access to the internet is included in the mobile phone deals encompassed within the £3 per week and internet access is available free at libraries, he does not consider anything additional above the £3 is necessary.</p>

However, he considers that the circumstances in which pursuit of these activities will necessarily incur a cost will be rare. There is free access to books at libraries and many recreational activities do not incur any cost.

Likewise he had referred to 2013 ONS data for non-retired single person households in the lowest 20% income group which gave a figure of £25.80, only £2.34 more than the amount for food and drink set aside by the Home Office in the 2015 review. The figures from the ONS data include some non-essential items, as well as spending by a marginally more affluent cohort than the lowest 10%. As Mr Bentley says, since the figures are for non-retired single person households, there are no economies of scale inherent in those figures. In those circumstances, he does not accept that there is any material double-counting as Ms Charlesworth suggests.

If the Secretary of State did not make an adjustment going back a number of years, the effect was created that the asylum support rate would buy less than in 2007/2008.

First, that the Secretary of State had employed essentially the same methodology in the 2014 review as in the setting of the 2013 rates, whereas, Mr Sheldon QC submitted, the Secretary of State had sought, by reference to each of the essential living needs identified by Popplewell J to address the costs of each in 2014 by reference to the best evidence available, starting from scratch, which had not been done previously. In those circumstances, it was not necessary to consider inflation since 2007 (other than to a limited extent from 2012 to 2014 because the latest ONS data was for the 2012 calendar year) or to compare the rate with that in previous years.</p>

The Secretary of State must make provision under sections 95 and 96 of the 1999 Act which ensures full respect for human dignity and a dignified standard of living, maintains an adequate standard of health and meets the subsistence needs of the asylum seeker.

I agree with Popplewell J that subject to the minimum standard required by the Reception Directive being achieved, it is a matter for the judgment of the Secretary of State what needs are to be regarded as “essential living needs”. She may decide that a particular need is an essential living need, even though it would not be necessary to ensure a dignified standard of living. Provided that the minimum objective standard required by the Directive has been achieved, the judgment of the Secretary of State as to what needs constitute essential living needs is only open to review on well-established public law grounds, such as if the decision made is irrational or <span style="font-style:italic">Wednesbury </span>unreasonable.

In making that assessment as to whether the system of asylum support achieves that minimum objective standard, it seems to me important to look at the system as a whole, not at the weekly payments under section 96(1)(b) of the 1999 Act in isolation. The weekly payments are only one part of the overall support provided to asylum seekers, which, as noted at [6] and [7] above, includes free accommodation with furniture and household equipment and utility bills and council tax paid for, free access to the NHS, free prescriptions, eye tests, glasses and dental care and free state education for those aged between 5 and 18.

It is not necessary that the level be one which caters for the individual essential living needs of each and every asylum seeker and his or her dependants, and to the extent that Ms Charlesworth suggests in her evidence that the rate should take account of the needs of all children dependants, not just those of the “average” child (and therefore by necessary parity of reasoning, the needs of all adult asylum seekers), her approach is misconceived. If she were right, the rate would have to be set artificially high to cater for every eventuality and section 96(2) would serve little purpose.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Before dealing with the specific points about the individual items, I propose to address the more generalised criticisms levelled against the approach of the Secretary of State by Mr Gill QC and by the first claimant’s expert Mr Aspinall, beginning with the suggestion that the Secretary of State simply employed the same methodology in the 2014 and 2015 reviews as she had in setting the 2013 rates. Having considered Mr Bentley’s evidence about the approach adopted to the 2014 review (and therefore by definition the 2015 review), which I have already referred to and will refer to again in considering the treatment of the individual items, I am satisfied that the Secretary of State did not apply essentially the same methodology, but started from scratch in considering each of the items. In that context, it is worth noting that, as Mr Sheldon QC says in a footnote in his Skeleton, it was the claimants in <span style="font-style:italic">Refugee Action</span> who adopted the approach of assessing the cost of meeting particular categories of need, an approach which Popplewell J adopted. In the 2014 review, the Secretary of State adopted that approach in the light of the judgment, which she had not previously done, further demonstration that her methodology in 2014 and 2015 was a new one. </p>

That is of course a serious allegation, in effect of bad faith on the part of the Secretary of State and her civil servants. Having considered carefully the evidence of Mr Bentley about the methodology adopted, I am quite satisfied that there is nothing in this point. If Mr Bentley and his staff made errors in their approach, they were genuine and inadvertent, not deliberate.</p>

However, once it is recognised that the exercise in 2014 was one of assessing the cost at that time of the various items comprised within essential living needs, then what those items might have cost in previous years is of no relevance, save possibly to the limited extent that evidence about previous year’s costs or rates might suggest that the 2013 data used was flawed or inaccurate in some way. There is no such suggestion in this case. </p>

As I have already pointed out at [44] above, he was not saying that the fact that there had been an erosion of rates over the years per se vitiated the decision in 2013, but that the Secretary of State had proceeded on the erroneous assumption that rates had increased when they had in fact decreased. The point the judge made in [130] was that there would be no necessary error in setting the rates at a lower level, in real terms, than in previous years, because of the possible range of figures given the discretion available to the Secretary of State. However, if there was such a reduction or erosion, it would require justification by careful investigation. </p>

The reduction in the rate can be explained by a number of factors such as the realisation that, when economies of scale were taken into account, the previous rate may have been too high or the fact that, contrary to Mr Aspinall’s evidence, the price of food came down between 2013 and 2015. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Related to his point about erosion of rates was the submission by Mr Gill QC recorded at [125] above and apparently derived from Mr Aspinall’s expert opinion, that the approach adopted in 2014 of taking ONS data from 2012 and only looking at increases in respect of food for two years thereafter by reference to rates of inflation did not achieve the correct minimum level.  Mr Gill QC submitted that the Secretary of State was obliged to make an adjustment to reflect erosion of rates and inflation going back to 2007, failing which the rate would still be at too low a level. Although this point was advanced with verve and passion by Mr Gill QC, it lacked any coherence. If, as was the case, in the 2014 and 2015 reviews, the Secretary of State was either using 2012 or 2013 ONS data, with an uplift for inflation since the date the data was collected or up to date data from Home Office researches, that represents the best evidence of what items cost in 2014 or 2015. There is simply no requirement to go back to previous data in earlier years or make the kind of adjustment contended for by Mr Gill QC, since the data relied upon reflected actual cost in 2014 and 2015. To make the adjustment he advocated would lead to a series of inflated and artificially high costs. </p>

It would appear that the latter approach is a relatively new one and use of the general index would be regarded as the usual approach, making it difficult to criticise the Secretary of State for adopting the usual approach. However, in any event, Mr Bentley’s evidence demonstrates that adoption of specific CPI indices for specific items would have led to a lower figure for inflation overall, so that this is a non-point. </p>

The figure adopted by the Home Office was in fact higher than either of the figures arrived at by Professor Sanders or the member of the review team. Although Mr Gill QC and Mr Aspinall were critical of the use of this data to “sense-check” the figure arrived at of £23.88 per week and of the failure of the Home Office to commission independent scientific research, Mr Gill QC did not cite any authority for the proposition that the Secretary of State was under some sort of heightened obligation beyond the duty of inquiry identified by Popplewell J at [120] of his judgment.</p>

However, as Mr Bentley points out, that sum derives from the lowest 20% not 10% income group and so people who are marginally more affluent, and includes items that would not be regarded as essential. Accordingly, in my judgment, that data provided additional confirmation that the figure used by the Secretary of State was an appropriate one.</p>

I was unimpressed with this point which was not supported by any evidence. Looking at the matter in the round, it seems to me that asylum seekers are just as likely to be able to find cheaper food sources as anyone else in the poorest proportion of the population. It is also worth repeating that, apart from the first and second claimants’ food diaries for short periods of time, there is a complete lack of any evidence that the general cohort of asylum seekers has any difficulty in providing a healthy diet from the weekly payment.</p>

Mr Aspinall was highly critical of this “mix and match” approach, but in my judgment the criticism was unwarranted. Given the criticism by Popplewell J, I consider the Home office was quite right to conduct its own research with established internet retailers. Mr Aspinall again criticises the Home Office for using a figure which was lower than the ONS data would have given, but I accept Mr Bentley’s explanation that they decided to use their own lower figure because the ONS data reflected the annual spend on clothing by the lowest 10% income group, not any sort of assessment of “essential living needs”. </p>

This may be an unduly semantic criticism of what was intended as a reference to clothing to keep a person clean and warm enough. But even taken on its own terms, I am unable to accept the Claimant's argument. Here, as elsewhere, there are value judgements at play, for example in the adjective "warm". If a person's clothing is sufficient to keep him warm enough to avoid any danger of illness, it may legitimately be considered as meeting the essential need in that respect, even if it leaves the person at times colder than the majority of us would choose for comfort. If the clothing is sufficient to avoid any danger of illness, its deficiencies, as to warmth or hygiene, are no more than a matter of comfort rather than health, and harsh though it might appear to some, perhaps to most, it is within the legitimate range of views of the Secretary of State to treat that as falling outside the concept of essential needs. Ms Rose QC submitted that being clothed to a standard which left the person cold or their clothes dirty was inconsistent with the Reception Directive requiring as a minimum a dignified standard of living. But "cold" and "dirty" are relative terms. Mr Sheldon QC accepted that washing powder was an essential living need, so that a minimum standard of cleanliness is catered for. If there is no risk of danger to health, a person who is cold and whose clothes are not pristine is not in my view being denied a standard of living in breach of Article 1 of the Charter. Whether they have a need for greater warmth and cleanliness which is essential is a matter within the value judgment to be made by the Secretary of State, not the Court.”</p>

In my judgment, that criticism is misplaced. No evidence was put forward on behalf of the claimants that the costs of these items cannot be met by the general cohort of asylum seekers from the weekly payment.

I agree with Mr Sheldon QC that the court should treat this kind of assertion with scant regard. There is simply no evidence that this claimant is going to abandon her claim, let alone that asylum seekers generally are not coming to the UK or are leaving the country and abandoning asylum claims because the asylum support rates are set too low. </p>

That case concerned a claimant who had come to the United Kingdom as an asylum seeker and who, after an unsuccessful asylum claim, made a fresh claim which eventually succeeded and she was accorded refugee status and became entitled to Income Support, which she was awarded from when she was accorded refugee status. She appealed against the award, contending that she was entitled to Income Support from the date of her asylum claim. Notwithstanding legislation which came into force in 2007, under which a successful asylum seeker had no entitlement to recover back-payments of Income Support, she contended that she had such an entitlement on various grounds, including relevantly, that the failure to backdate her Income Support constituted discrimination in breach of Article 14 of the ECHR. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The second reason why Mr Sheldon QC submitted that the discrimination claim is bound to fail is that the present case is not concerned with discrimination between children in the exercise of ECHR rights, because the right to the relevant benefit is a right of the parent, not the child. In this case, none of the relevant children has any legal right to the benefit, so that the only ECHR rights in play are those of the parent. Any discrimination could only arise between adults. Mr Sheldon QC submitted that that analysis could not be circumvented by seeking to reformulate the allegation of discrimination by reference to the position of dependent children. He relied on the judgments in <span style="font-style:italic">R (SG) v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions</span>, rejecting any argument that the ECHR rights of women could be informed by the UNCRC because they have children.

In the case of article 8, the children's interests are part of the substantive right of the parent which is protected, namely respect for her family life. In the case of A1P1 coupled with article 14, the children's interests may well be affected (as here), but they are not part of the woman's substantive right which is protected, namely the right to be free from discrimination in relation to her property. There is no question of interpreting that article 14 right by reference to the children's interests. The protected right to respect for family life under article 8 is entirely different from the protected right to property under A1P1. Nor can the article 8 rights of the child be said to be in need of interpretation when it is clear for the reasons given in all the judgments that they are not infringed. The necessary connection between the ECHR right under consideration and the international instrument is not present. That can be seen by considering the position of the appropriate comparator, namely a lone non-working father with the same children and household outgoings. The interests of the children would be exactly the same in his case, but he would have no article 14 claim to discrimination.”</p>

The Court further notes that these classes cannot be considered as arbitrary or discriminatory. Those who have a fixed right to be in the United Kingdom, such as refugees or those with permanent, unconditional leave to remain, are entitled both to housing and to housing assistance. Those whose leave to remain in the United Kingdom is conditional on their ability to support themselves without recourse to public funds are not. The Court notes in this regard the applicant’s argument that it is inconsistent that she should be eligible for social housing but not considered to be in priority need should she and her son become homeless. However, there is nothing arbitrary in the denial of priority need to the applicant when it would be based solely on the presence in her household of her son, a person whose leave to enter the United Kingdom, granted only a few months before the applicant’s request for housing assistance, was expressly conditional upon his having no recourse to public funds. By bringing her son into the United Kingdom in full awareness of the condition attached to his leave to enter, the applicant accepted this condition and effectively agreed not to have recourse to public funds in order to support her son. The Court upholds the Government’s argument that it is justifiable to differentiate between those who rely for priority need status on a person who is in the United Kingdom unlawfully or on the condition that they have no recourse to public funds, and those who do not, and finds that the legislation in issue in this case pursued a legitimate aim, namely allocating a scarce resource fairly between different categories of claimants.”</p>

This may well be so, although it is interesting how little prominence was given to this aspect of the matter in the justifications put forward by the Government for their policy. But in any event, this is to misunderstand what article 3(1) of the UNCRC requires. It requires that first consideration be given to the best interests, not only of children in general, but also of the particular child or children directly affected by the decision in question. It cannot possibly be in the best interests of the children affected by the cap to deprive them of the means to provide them with adequate food, clothing, warmth and housing, the basic necessities of life. It is not enough that children in general, now or in the future, may benefit by a shift in welfare culture. Insofar as the Secretary of State relies upon this as an answer to article 3(1), he has misdirected himself.”</p>

The correct approach of starting with what was in the best interests of this group of children would have led to proper provision for their wellbeing, education, health and social development. Equal opportunity with other children required the opportunity to engage in recreational activities, such as football and other outdoor activities. It also required provision of computers, books, toys and games.

Given that it was accepted by the Secretary of State that children’s clothing needs are higher than those of adults, because of rapid growth and greater wear and tear and that clothes are not capable of attracting economies of scale in large households, the absence of any research whilst asserting that any additional costs could be off-set by savings elsewhere was simply not good enough.</p>

Mr Knafler QC submitted that the suggestion that any increased cost of children’s clothes could be met from the leeway or margin provided by economies of scale elsewhere should be rejected.

I have set out his description of the analysis undertaken at [75] and [76] above. As Mr Sheldon QC said, the principle that there are economies of scale in multi-person households is not challenged.

As Mr Sheldon QC said children would not need to see their parents’ legal advisers in the ordinary course and, if they had a need to do so, it could be dealt with as exceptional under section 96(2) of the 1999 Act. </p>

As set out in [81] the review team did not look separately at the needs of children with regard to toiletries, non-prescription medicines and household cleaning items, but considered their needs were the same as or very similar to those of adults.

Children have access to parks, playgrounds, libraries and other services offered by local authorities. Ms Rose QC suggested that such access was only possible where they were within walking distance because the level of support made no allowance for transport in this respect. I am not prepared to assume without evidence that such facilities are, other than in exceptional cases, so far away that public transport is essential to access them. I address below the position of vulnerable persons in relation to walking to the GP or the shops, and similar considerations apply here. So far as books, toys and games are concerned I detect no error in the approach of the Secretary of State, who not only takes account of the provision of full time education for those aged 5 and above and early education for 2-4 year olds, and access to libraries and other services offered by local authorities, but also includes within her definition of needs of children "a contribution to wider socialisation costs to promote their development". There is a differential rate for children provided for in Regulation 10, and the evidence on behalf of the Secretary of State is that the proportionate weighting in favour of children is greater in the UK than generally amongst other EU Member States whose structure involves more for adults but less for additional dependent children. The exclusion of toys by Regulation 9 of the AS Regulations 2000 is not incompatible with the minimum content required by the Reception Directive.”</p>

Section 55 required the Secretary of State to “make arrangements” for ensuring that her function in relation to asylum was discharged “having regard to the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of children” so that was essentially a procedural requirement.

The UK Border Agency’s main function to which Every Child Matters is particularly relevant, is interaction with individual children and their families. That was where the welfare, safeguarding and protection of individual children was of particular significance. Every Child Matters was not focusing on the cash support system for the general cohort of asylum seeker children.</p>

But it is neither necessary nor appropriate to attempt to resolve these issues in this case, especially since we heard no argument upon them. All that needs to be said is that it is clear that the wider the reach of the concept of "decisions concerning" either an individual child or children in general, the less possible it is to impose the best interests of such child or children as a determinative or even priority factor over the frequently complex legal or socio-economic considerations which govern such decisions. The committee's general comment gives some acknowledgement to this problem in, for example, para 20, which recognises that although all State actions may affect children, a full and formal process of assessing their best interests is not called for in every case, and in para 32 where it is stated that the concept of the child's best interests is flexible and adaptable.” </p>

Like their parents it is not known whether the children of asylum seekers have a right to remain in the UK, whereas the children of those on Income Support do have such a right. Furthermore, however much Mr Knafler QC and Ms Gallagher seek to overlay asylum support for dependent children with rights derived from the UNCRC, it remains the case that any entitlement to asylum support for dependants derives from Regulations passed to comply with the UK’s obligations under the Reception Directive, whereas those with a right to remain here and who need social assistance will receive mainstream benefits for themselves and their children under an entirely separate statutory regime. </p>

To the extent that Mr Knafler QC also relied upon Article 21 of the Charter, I do not consider that this court should be branching out and applying a different test of justification than the “manifestly without reasonable foundation” test. I am also acutely aware that the whole issue of what test should be applied in cases of socio-economic policy is pending before the Supreme Court, making it all the more imperative that this court should not seek to make new law on this issue.</p>

First, there is a legitimate purpose in the setting of the asylum support rates pursuant to the 2015 Decision of discouraging economic migration and ensuring that limited financial resources are not expended on providing asylum support which is in excess of the UK’s obligations under the Reception Directive and what the Secretary of State assesses as “essential living needs” under the 1999 Act. In my judgment, there is no reason why that legitimate purpose should not apply where the position of children is being considered.</p>

The level of support which the Secretary of State is required to provide is set by the minimum standard of a dignified standard of living maintaining an adequate standard of health under the Reception Directive. The level of Income Support is set by domestic legislation by reference to different criteria. </p>

Nor is there anything in the Directive which requires equivalence of treatment between asylum seekers and their dependants on the one hand and residents of a member state on welfare benefits and their dependants on the other. If the Directive had intended there to be such an equivalence, it would surely have said so. Although it is not directly relevant, Article 17(5) of the new Reception Directive 2013/33/EU, in relation to which the UK has exercised its right not to opt in, expressly recognises that a member state can grant less favourable treatment to asylum seekers than to nationals and there is nothing in that Directive which suggests that there has to be equivalence between the children of the two groups. I return to this question again below in considering the assessment of essential living needs by the Secretary of State in the 2015 review and whether there was any breach of the statutory duty under section 55 of the 2009 Act.  </p>

Mr Knafler QC addressed no separate submissions either in writing or orally in relation to the PSED, so the point appears to have been abandoned, but to the extent that it had not, it is misconceived for the reasons given by the Secretary of State.  </p>

That suggestion is not supported by any of the relevant legislation or by the Directive or the UNCRC. In my judgment, the correct analysis is that the requirement to make the best interests of the child a primary consideration arises in the overall context or framework of setting the asylum support rate in respect of dependent children in accordance with the Directive and the 1999 Act. Of course, as I said above in the context of the discrimination claim, it may be that the needs of children as regards health and welfare differ in certain respects from those of adults, but there is no requirement for the imposition of a higher standard of support than the objective minimum under the Reception Directive. </p>

I do not accept that this necessarily follows for two reasons. First, on the basis that the original rate was in fact in excess of what was required to comply with the minimum under the Reception Directive and to meet what the Secretary of State reasonably assessed were essential living needs, there is nothing inherently wrong or unfair in the Secretary of State reducing the rate. Indeed, provided the minimum standard had been met, payment in excess of what was required for essential living needs would be ultra vires, as Popplewell J pointed out at [130] of the <span style="font-style:italic">Refugee Action </span>judgment.

Indeed, common sense would suggest that must be correct. What is said by Ms Charlesworth is that the assessment by the Secretary of State is flawed, because the ONS data for the lowest 10% used by the Secretary of State for the majority of its rates was already for multi-person households and therefore already included economies of scale, so that the Secretary of State was, in effect, double counting. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgment, the answer to that criticism is the one given by Mr Bentley in his fourth witness statement as referred to at [118] above, that the review team referred not only to the adjusted figure of £22.38 per week for food and drink derived from the ONS data for the lowest 10% of income groups, but also referred to the data in ONS Table 3.3 which was for single adult non-retired households in the lowest 20% income group. That figure was £24.90 per week, only £2.52 more. The review team considered that it was still appropriate to take their lower figure, because the £24.90 included certain non-essential items of food and drink and was spending by the marginally more affluent.  A similar analysis was conducted by reference to the 2013 ONS data for the purposes of the 2015 review in arriving at a food and drink figure per person of £24.96 as compared with £25.80 for single adult non-retired households in the lowest 20% income group.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Ms Charlesworth also suggests that whilst economies of scale will rise in line with the number of people in a household, many children of asylum seekers will be in a household consisting only of two people, him or herself and a lone parent and that, therefore, any assessment of cost should be made on the assumption of a two person household. She does not produce any statistical evidence to support her suggestion that many asylum seeker children will be in a two person household, but, in my judgment, the answer to the point, even if it had any statistical validity, is that the flat rate of £36.95 per person per week includes £24.96 in respect of food and non-alcoholic drink per person. As Mr Bentley says in his fourth witness statement, the Home office has not adopted a diminishing amount for additional members of a household as in some other EU countries, from which it follows that the £24.96 figure is valid for two person households or households with more than two people. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In fact, as Mr Sheldon QC says, what the 2013 ONS data (the latest available at the time of the 2015 review) for households in the lowest 20% income group with two or three children (household sizes 2.4 and 3.6), shows is expenditure on food and non-alcoholic drink of about £16 or £17 per person per week.  So far as a single parent and one child are concerned, Mr Bentley referred to the 2013 ONS data which gave weekly expenditure on food and non-alcoholic drink of £40.90, equivalent to £20.45 per person. It follows that, even allowing for Ms Charlesworth’s point about lower economies of scale for a lone parent and one child than for households with more than one child, there is still a saving from the expenditure by one person living alone. The same ONS data gave weekly expenditure for a lone parent and two or more children of £18.06 per person per week. </p>

Of course the validity of that figure in respect of children needed to be checked, but as set out below, that was done by the review team. In the circumstances, the conclusion which the review team had reached in the 2014 review, confirmed by the 2015 review, that the existing payment of £52.96 per week per child exceeded what was required by asylum seekers with children to meet essential living needs, was a reasonable conclusion.  Nonetheless, whether the 2015 Decision to reduce the rate for dependent children was not irrational or <span style="font-style:italic">Wednesbury </span>unreasonable will depend upon the determination of the other questions identified at [252] above.</p>

I have already held that section 55 and Every Child Matters do not require equivalence between asylum seeker children and the children of those on Income Support or some higher standard of asylum support for children than the minimum standard under the Reception Directive or “essential living needs” under section 96(1)(b) of the 1999 Act.  </p>

Every Child Matters is more concerned with dealings between the Home Office and its agencies (specifically the UK Border Agency) and individual children and is not focusing on the cash support system for the cohort of asylum seeker children.

I see no reason not to accept that evidence, which is also borne out by the Explanatory Memorandum. Mr Bentley says at [32] of his third witness statement, quoted at [77] above, that they recognised that the needs of children are not always identical to those of adults and that there might be circumstances where meeting their particular needs requires greater expenditure of cash than required for an adult.

I have already held that the process by which the review team arrived at a single person figure for food and drink of £24.96 was a reasonable one. Mr Bentley describes as set out at [78] above that the review team had considered the report of the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (“SACN”) of 2011. He summarises the results of that report and notes its conclusion that children aged under 10 require less calorific intake than older groups and, in general, females of all ages require less calorific intake than males, but otherwise there is no appreciable difference in the recommended levels based on age. Both that scientific research and the National Diet and Nutrition Survey for 2014 (which measured actual calorific intake), to which the team also referred, showed that there was no great disparity between adults and children in terms of nutritional needs or calorific intake. </p>

This gave an average of £15 per person per week. Although the claimants and their experts were disparaging of this approach as non-scientific, it seems to me that it does provide an appropriate “sense check”, because in broad terms, it confirms the level of spending for households with 2.4 members in the ONS data for the lowest 20% income group, referred to above.  </p>

That data and research indicated a figure per person in a multi-person household which varied from £15 or £16 per week to £20.45 per week, however many children were in the household. Furthermore, the figures derived from the ONS data included non-essential items, so that the Secretary of State was justified in considering that spending on essential items would be somewhat lower and that, however many children there were in the household, the assumed figure for essential items of food and non-alcoholic drink of £24.96 included in the overall weekly figure of £36.95 gave a considerable leeway or margin, which would cover other items if they were more expensive. </p>

I have already held, (at [158]-[160] above), in the context of the first claimant’s claim, that the approach adopted by the review team is not open to criticism and is in accordance with the analysis of essential living needs as regards clothing set out by Popplewell J at [96]. </p>

As Mr Bentley points out in his third witness statement, the evidence of Ms Charlesworth of the cost of children’s clothing gave figures of £2.77 per week for babies, £2.62 per week for young children and £4.82 per week for teenagers. As he says, the approach she has adopted is similar to that of the Home Office and is sensible. What it demonstrates is that the cost of clothing teenagers is some £2.30 per week more than for adults, but that is comfortably covered by the economies of scale, whereas the cost for younger children is only marginally higher than for adults. I consider that his analysis is a reasonable one and a separate assessment of the costs of children’s clothing was not required in the circumstances. </p>

Mr Knafler QC submitted that there had been no proper assessment of the extent to which this would meet relevant needs. In my judgment, there was no need for any additional assessment beyond that reflected in Mr Bentley’s evidence, that whilst children’s non-prescription medicines might be theoretically more expensive, in fact they could be obtained free by asylum seekers. The second claimant has produced no evidence to challenge that conclusion. Furthermore, given that the figure allowed per week for the essential items overall for adults was considerably more than the actual cost and that, within a family, there would be economies of scale in relation to items such as toiletries and cleaning products, I consider that there is sufficient margin available to cover the cost of children’s non-prescription medication, even if (as to which the claimants have produced no evidence) the items in question could not be obtained free.</p>

It is not necessary that the level be one which caters for the individual essential living needs of each and every asylum seeker and his or her dependants, since if that were right, section 96(2) would be effectively redundant. </p>

There is thus no evidence to challenge the assessment made by Mr Bentley. As I indicated in relation to the first claimants’ claim, Ms Charlesworth’s evidence about travel needs also appears to completely overlook the fact that, save in limited respects, travel costs are excluded under the 1999 Act and the 2000 Regulations.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgment, contrary to the submissions of Mr Knafler QC and Ms Gallagher, the fact that, in setting the reduced asylum support rate for dependent children, the Secretary of State may have had regard to socio-political issues such as (i) the need to discourage economic migration and (ii) the fact that there are finite financial resources available to the Government, does not mean that she was in breach of her section 55 duty. Whilst, as Article 24 of the Reception Directive makes clear, it is incumbent upon member states to put in place sufficient resources to meet the minimum standard under the Directive, provided that minimum standard is met, nothing in the Directive or in the 1999 Act, or in my judgment in the 2009 Act, precludes the Secretary of State from having regard to those sort of socio-political issues in setting the rate, provided that proper consideration has been given to the needs of the general cohort of asylum seeker dependent children, as I have found was the case.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The third question set out at [252] above is whether the reduced rate set in the Asylum Support (Amendment) (No. 3) Regulations 2015 met the minimum standard required by the Reception Directive. As already noted, that standard requires that the asylum support provided ensures full respect for human dignity and a dignified standard of living, maintains an adequate standard of health and meets the subsistence needs of the asylum seeker. However, as I said at [140] above, there is no guidance from the CJEU as to what is necessary to achieve that minimum standard so that this court has to make its own assessment. Once it is recognised that the Secretary of State was not required to ensure equivalence between asylum seeker children and the children of those on Income Support, that she followed the guidance provided by Popplewell J and, as I have held, that she did give appropriate consideration to what was in the best interests of children, then the scope for any argument on behalf of the second claimant or the EHRC that she failed to achieve the minimum standard (or for that matter, failed properly to assess essential living needs), is strictly limited. </p>

As recorded in [207] above, one particular area to which Mr Knafler QC submitted the Secretary of State should have had regard, if she had adopted the correct child-centric, holistic approach, concerned wellbeing, education, health and social development through recreational activities, books, games and computers. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgment, there are several problems with that submission. First and foremost, as Mr Knafler QC had to recognise, Popplewell J had rejected any such argument in <span style="font-style:italic">Refugee Action </span>at [102] (which I quoted in full at [223] above) and held that specific provision did not have to be made for books, toys and games for children within the section 96(1)(b) cash payment and that the exclusion of toys and other recreational items in regulation 9 of the 2000 Regulations was not incompatible with the minimum standard under the Reception Directive. Mr Knafler QC submitted that the analysis of Popplewell J had been wrong, because it had not engaged properly with the requirements of section 55 of the 2009 Act. In my judgment, there is nothing in that criticism. The learned judge clearly had the section 55 duty well in mind, not least because he found at [155]-[157] that the decision of the Secretary of State to pay a lower amount to 16 and 17 year olds was contrary to her section 55 duty. I consider that the analysis of Popplewell J is correct. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Second, so far as computers are concerned, they are in any event also excluded by Regulation 9 of the 2000 Regulations from essential living needs. Like Popplewell J in <span style="font-style:italic">Refugee Action</span> at [102] in relation to toys, I do not consider that exclusion to be incompatible with the minimum standard required by the Reception Directive. Quite apart from that exclusion, it was not necessary to include any additional cost for computers in the weekly payment under section 96(1)(b) because the cost of connection to the internet was included in the mobile phone packages encompassed within the £3 per week figure for communications and, in any event, internet access was available free at public libraries, quite apart from the access which children would have at school. The claimants were disparaging about any reliance on free access to libraries when central and local government cuts meant many had been closed, but their availability remains a relevant consideration as the passage in [102] of Popplewell J’s judgment demonstrates.</p>

In any event, in the UK such free access is provided as part of the universal services, including free school trips.</p>

As Mr Bentley explains in his third witness statement, the overall support provided under section 4 is more limited than is provided to asylum seekers. Accommodation is provided, together with a prepaid debit card (“the Azure Card”) to the value of £35.39 per person per week, for the purchase of food, toiletries and other essential items. Cash support is not available and the Azure Card can only be used in certain retail outlets. Mr Bentley explains that additional support can be applied for through the Immigration and Asylum (Provision of Services or Facilities) Regulations 2007, including for extra travel assistance in the form of tickets. </p>

In all the circumstances, it does not seem to me that the amount of the section 4 rate demonstrates that the setting of the asylum support rate under section 96(1)(b) was flawed, as Ms Gallagher suggests.   </p>

As with the minimum standard under the Reception Directive, once the criticisms of the approach of the Secretary of State in the context of children to the various items which Popplewell J said should be considered are rejected, the only remaining area of criticism is that concerned with recreation and toys etc. which I have also rejected. It follows that the assessment of essential living needs in respect of asylum seeker children under section 96(1)(b) was neither irrational nor <span style="font-style:italic">Wednesbury </span> unreasonable.</p>

As Popplewell J rightly concluded, within those parameters, it is for the Secretary of State to set the rate, not the court and, <span style="font-style:italic">a fortiori</span>, not the experts for the claimants. To the extent that the claimants or the EHRC have concerns about the setting of asylum support rates, save to the limited extent that the court can interfere if the objective minimum standard is not met or the assessment of essential living needs is irrational or <span style="font-style:italic">Wednesbury </span>unreasonable, it is for Parliament to address those concerns, not unelected judges. </p>

He submitted that the asylum support scheme under the Reception Directive and the 1999 Act was designed to meet the essential living needs of all asylum seekers and the needs of disabled people were likely to be greater than those of able-bodied people. He submitted that, if section 96(1)(b) discriminated by only providing for the essential living needs of able-bodied asylum seekers, as Popplewell J had held in <span style="font-style:italic">Refugee Action</span>, then there had to be an adequate system of cover for the needs of disabled asylum seekers under section 96(2). </p>

In short, the decision maker must be clear precisely what the equality implications are when he puts them in the balance, and he must recognise the desirability of achieving them, but ultimately it is for him to decide what weight they should be given in the light of all relevant factors.

Mr Drabble emphasised that his case on behalf of the appellants was not based on an allegation of racial discrimination. Thirdly, the promotion of equality of opportunity is concerned with issues of substantive equality and requires a more penetrating consideration than merely asking whether there has been a breach of the principle of non-discrimination. Fourthly, the duty is to have due regard to the need to promote equality of opportunity (and good relations) between the racial group whose case is under consideration and <span style="font-style:italic">any </span>other racial groups.

At paragraph 4.2.4 of their skeleton argument they make a general point that single parent households are generally unable to share childcare responsibilities.  This is true, but I do not consider that the problem is exacerbated by the reduction in their cash allowances. Apart from in very unusual cases, asylum seekers are not allowed to work and thus have little need to arrange for childcare services, particularly given that there is access to free nursery placements from the age of 2 years (in England) and 3 years elsewhere. To the extent that they need to take their children with them when they leave the house, it is unlikely that there is an additional cost in doing so. We ensured that the same level of cash was made available to cover the transport costs of children when a journey on foot is not possible and concessionary fares for children are also available.</p>

He submitted that this all fed into the section 96(2) challenge by the third claimants. </p>

This had been raised for the first time at the outset of this hearing, almost a year after the 2015 Decision. Mr Sheldon QC submitted that, if there had been a problem with “due regard” in that respect, it would have been identified earlier. It had not been because there was no basis for this challenge. What was being argued was that lone parents were being affected because of their dependants and that they needed more money for their children, but this was a parasitic claim. The issue here was the needs of children, which had been dealt with in great detail in the Policy Equality Statement, again as quoted in [89] above. The Secretary of State had looked at the needs of children and determined that they did not need more and therefore, by definition, lone parents did not need more. Mr Sheldon QC submitted that the point was without any merit, but even if it were, given the delay in raising the point, the court should either refuse permission or refuse substantive relief. </p>

This was unrealistic and it was the duty of the Secretary of State to assess need; (ii) the argument for the Secretary of State apparently proceeded on the basis that the exceptional needs of RG would be met out of the standard budget because of the leeway in the food budget provided by economies of scale which meant that the room for manoeuvre was reduced; (iii) there had been a failure by the Secretary of State to consider whether RG needed toys and games for stimulation. </p>

It is not incorporated into English domestic law and at best should inform that law, which should so far as possible be interpreted in accordance with it. However, far more important than the status of that Convention is that, in so far as alleged discrimination on the grounds of disability is concerned, the complete answer is that, as Popplewell J held, after a careful and detailed analysis with which I respectfully agree, the system of weekly payments under section 96(1)(b) of the 1999 Act is only concerned with able-bodied asylum seekers, not the disabled, whether adults or children. In those circumstances, as Mr Sheldon QC submitted, the Secretary of State is entitled to proceed on the basis that the necessary care and assistance is provided to the disabled, whether adults or children, by local authorities, under, for example, section 2 of the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970. There is no evidence put forward on behalf of the claimants that any additional financial assistance required by the disabled is not being provided by local authorities. </p>

For example, Mr Bentley says in his sixth witness statement that the review team did consider it possible that some destitution-linked needs could be greater with regard to the disabled, for example travel needs but thought it would be impossible to provide a standard cash amount to cover such needs, since they would depend on the facts of each case and would thus be addressed under section 96(2). In my judgment, this approach was in no sense discriminatory. In the circumstances, it seems to me that no question of any discrimination on grounds of disability arises whether under the UNCRPD or any other Convention or provision.</p>

First, as Mr Sheldon QC correctly submitted by reference to the various authorities referred to at [313] and [314] above, what is required is a realistic and proportionate approach to evidence of compliance with the PSED, not micro-management or a detailed forensic analysis by the court.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As Mr Sheldon QC submitted, there is no evidence of any problem in the provision of the necessary additional support to disabled people by local authorities. Indeed it is apparent from the evidence in the third claimants’ case that RG is receiving such support. Accordingly, there was nothing which should have caused concern to the Secretary of State from the reduction of rate in relation to disabled people. As the Policy Equality statement said, the disabled were outside the scope of the review. There was no need for “due regard” under section 149 of the 2010 Act beyond what was stated in the Policy Equality Statement. Furthermore, I agree with Mr Sheldon QC that to the extent that individual asylum seeker disabled children needed extra support for exceptional needs under section 96(2), anticipation of what those needs would be is not what “due regard” pursuant to the PSED requires. In the circumstances, it does not seem to me that the approach of the Secretary of State in relation to the protected characteristic of disability can be said to be unreasonable or perverse.</p>

Indeed, it is striking that the second claimant, a single mother, does not raise this point at all.  Furthermore, I agree with Mr Sheldon QC that at its core the argument of the third claimants was that lone parents need more money for their children so that the issue is the needs of the children, not the sex of the parent. The Secretary of State had looked at the needs of children carefully (as is apparent from the Policy Equality Statement and from my analysis of the second claimant’s case set out above) and determined that, in the case of able-bodied children to whom the review was directed, the flat rate of £36.95 was sufficient to meet the needs of the general cohort of children. In those circumstances, lone parents, whatever their sex did not need more and “due regard” under section 149 did not require more detailed consideration by the Secretary of State of a problem which had not been demonstrated to exist. </p>

It is also to be noted that her submissions ranged more widely than the claims of either the second or third claimants, encompassing as they did lone parents with children generally, not just disabled children (in circumstances where the second claimant has not pursued a claim on this basis) and disabled people generally (thus including disabled adults in circumstances where there is no claim by a disabled adult asylum seeker before the court).

However, even if it were open to him to pursue that case, I consider that it is without merit.
