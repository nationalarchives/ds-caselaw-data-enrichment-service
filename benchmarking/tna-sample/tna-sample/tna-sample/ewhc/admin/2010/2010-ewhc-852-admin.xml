	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Peter Connelly died on 3 August 2007.  He was only 17 months old.  In his tragically short life he was the victim of dreadful and sickening physical abuse.  Until his identity was permitted to be revealed, he was known in the public consciousness as ‘Baby P’.  Doubtless for many he still is and it may be the way in which he will be remembered.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In the few weeks or so before he died he had suffered seven fractured ribs, a broken spinal cord, bruising to his face and back and the forceful knocking into his mouth of a tooth which he ingested.  The rib fractures and the broken spinal cord would have required the infliction of very considerable force.  These were but a few examples of the injuries he had sustained at various times.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Those directly responsible for the injuries that led to his death were his mother, Tracey Connelly, her boyfriend, Steven Barker and Steven Barker’s brother, Jason Owen, who was lodging in the house during the relevant period.  Barker’s presence in the home was concealed from the knowledge of those in authority who visited.  Following Peter’s death they were arrested and charged with murder.  Each was acquitted of murder and the alternative offence of manslaughter during a trial at the Central Criminal Court in the autumn of 2008 - Tracey Connelly and Jason Owen on the direction of the judge, His Honour Judge Kramer QC, at the close of the prosecution case and Steven Barker in due course by the jury.  Each was, however, convicted of an offence contrary to section 5 of the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004 of causing or allowing Peter’s death, his mother having pleaded guilty at the outset of the trial, albeit on a limited basis which the judge ultimately did not accept.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The sentencing process and the response to it by the Attorney-General and at appellate level, where it has arisen, is in the public domain and has been well publicised.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Judge Kramer said that any decent person who heard about the suffering to which Peter was exposed before his death “could not fail to have been appalled.”  The Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families said, following the verdicts in the case, that the case was “tragic and appalling” and that the treatment of Peter was “evil and horrific”.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Any number of expressions could have been, and indeed were, used to describe the case and those involved in it.  It provoked a universal sense of outrage and gave rise to some strongly expressed views about those who bore either direct or indirect responsibility for Peter’s death or who were perceived to have done so.  It still does.  Attractive or not, justified or not, well-informed or not, strongly expressed views will inevitably follow a case involving the death of a baby in the kind of quite dreadful circumstances that surrounded Peter’s life and eventual tragic death.  Sadly and depressingly, shocking and heart-rending though the circumstances of his short life were, the story does not reflect a unique occurrence.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">According to press reports contained in the papers before the court (and indeed by reference to the transcript of the proceedings that has been provided to me subsequently), in evidence given to the House of Commons Select Committee on Children, Schools and Families on 10 December 2008, Her Majesty's Chief Inspector at Ofsted (the 'Office for Standards in Education, Children’s Services and Skills'), Ms Christine Gilbert, said that in the period from April 2007 until August 2008, 210 children, 21 of them babies, died of abuse or neglect in England.  In his report prepared in 2009 (see paragraphs 100, 123-124 below), Lord Laming said that  “Home Office data shows that in 2007/08 55 children were killed by their parents or by someone known to the child.”  After the hearing in October 2009 was concluded it was impossible not to note the Ofsted Press Release on 15 October 2009 relating to the publication ‘Learning the lessons from serious case reviews: Year 2’ which indicated that the 173 Serious Case Reviews (see paragraph 66 below) carried out and completed between 1 April 2008 and 31 March 2009 related to 219 children and included 113 cases of child deaths as a result of an incident – not all, it should be said, because of the kind of neglect and abuse shown in the present case. However, of the 219 children identified, 68% were known to social care services at the time of the incident.</p>

They offer support for the proposition that the systems presently in place do not always operate to prevent the deaths of children known to the social care services.  Reports of other incidents, cases and Serious Case Reviews since then and during the period when this judgment has been pending serve to confirm that proposition.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As will by now be well-known, during a crucial period before and leading up to his death, Peter was the subject of a child protection plan put in place (on 22 December 2006) by the London Borough of Haringey (‘Haringey’) and was thus on the child protection register.  He was one of in the region of 200 children similarly registered in Haringey at the time.  He had become registered because of concerns about abuse and neglect.  He was seen about 60 times during this period by various social workers, doctors and other health care professionals (whose visits apparently numbered 38) and the police.  Tragically, the warning signs of impending catastrophe were not picked up or, if picked up, were not acted upon.  In order to put matters in context, it is right to note that Judge Kramer expressed himself satisfied (as indeed have others, including the Secretary of State) that the mother’s own wilful deception of the authorities over several months contributed to the failure of those involved with the family fully to appreciate the lurking dangers.  Furthermore, the broken spinal cord that was inflicted on Peter some 3-4 days before he died, and which caused or contributed to his death, was not identified by the locum consultant paediatrician, Dr. Sabah Al-Zayyat, who saw him on 1 August.   On any view, no-one within Haringey can be blamed for that omission.</p>

Why did it all go wrong?  How could it happen again in the borough where the Victoria Climbié case had occurred some years previously? That case had also captured the public attention and led to the Laming Report and the statutory scheme that Haringey and all other local authorities with responsibility for children throughout the country had been seeking to put into effect since the implementation of the Children Act 2004 during 2005.</p>

She was thus the head of the team responsible for child safeguarding within Haringey, although day-to-day management responsibility for that part of the authority’s services was delegated to and undertaken by Cecilia Hitchen, the Claimant’s Deputy, whose expertise and experience was in social work.  I shall say more about the position of DCS in due course (see paragraphs 61, 75-77 below).  The Claimant had become DCS in April 2005 and when Peter died was therefore a little over two years into a newly-created statutory position in a borough where historically the Council and other agencies with responsibility for safeguarding vulnerable children had been shown to be significantly wanting.  Along with many of her colleagues who took on such a role elsewhere in the country, her experience was not in social care, but in education.  From the outset it is a position that would plainly present anyone, even someone with a social care background, with very significant challenges.  When she became DCS there were 5 Deputy Directors within the department, but by 2006 budget constraints had reduced the number to 3.</p>

She first went to Haringey as part of the Capita intervention team in 2001 on the direction of the then Secretary of State for Education and Skills following a critical Ofsted inspection report concerning the provision of education services within the Borough.  The whole of the senior education team had been replaced.   As I have said, her professional experience had been in education. She started as a teacher in primary education, had considerable experience in special education for children with learning difficulties and then moved to the role of advisory teacher.  She became a senior inspector for special education and in due course moved into inspection as an HMI with Ofsted before joining Capita.</p>

In April 2005 the Children’s Services directorate was established formally when Haringey’s Education Department merged with Social Services to form the Department of Children’s Services, with the Claimant continuing in employment as Haringey’s DCS. </p>

She was plainly very highly thought of within the Borough and continued to be highly thought of by her colleagues within Haringey until the events with which this case is concerned.  The Chief Executive of Haringey, Dr Ita O’Donovan, said in her witness statement filed shortly before the hearing in October 2009: “… I would like to make clear that [the Claimant] had enormous respect and credibility within Haringey Council generally (and with me in particular) and that position did not change at all until” the Ofsted inspection was about to commence.  I will be returning to the Ofsted inspection in more detail in due course (see Section 11 below) and to Dr O’Donovan’s perception of the preparations for it within Haringey.  I should for completeness in this regard add that soon after what has been described as “the media storm” erupted after the verdicts in the criminal case were returned, but before the Secretary of State’s decision under challenge in these proceedings was announced on 1 December 2008, 67 head-teachers from State-funded schools in Haringey wrote to <span style="font-style:italic">The Times</span> praising the Claimant as “an outstanding public servant” and referred to her commitment and leadership in the education field and the improvements made in the Borough in the time she had worked there.  They suggested that if she should be lost to Haringey “then our children and young people will lose one of their most effective, determined and committed champions.”   They referred to her role in transforming “a demoralised education service” and to the “exceptional rate of improvement of many of the borough’s schools [which] would not have been possible without the support of the service that [the Claimant] rebuilt, revitalised and led.”</p>

There is, however, a broader, and important, issue of legal principle to be considered irrespective of the merits or otherwise of this case.  It relates to the question of how a local authority employee whose position possesses a statutory status such as that which went with the Claimant’s position can enforce or protect their right not to have their contract of employment unfairly or wrongfully terminated when effectively removed from the job for which they have been employed by the local authority as a result of the dictate of central government.</p>

Mr James Maurici, who has represented her in these proceedings, has made clear that whilst success in this claim may assist a claim for compensation, it is not the main point for present purposes. These proceedings afford an opportunity for her to demonstrate that any conclusions made against her – including the statement made publicly the Secretary of State that she was “not fit for office” – were not made fairly.</p>

It relates to whether the Claimant had a fair opportunity to respond to matters upon which, in due course, critical comment was made in the Ofsted report upon the basis of which the Secretary of State’s decision was made.  Her case is that not even the gist of what was said in the report to reflect matters of serious concern about safeguarding arrangements in Haringey was communicated to her during the inspection carried out by the Ofsted inspectors and, accordingly, she asserts that she had no opportunity to respond to these matters of concern.  Ofsted asserts that she was given the opportunity to comment on the central concerns relating to her areas of responsibility in a series of meetings and interviews during the inspection and points to documentary evidence that demonstrates that this was so.   I will, of course, be dealing with this issue in detail in due course (see Section 11 and paragraphs 410-490).  For present purposes, I merely draw attention to the existence of the dispute.</p>

It would, as I have indicated, have been an unusual application in judicial review proceedings and would undoubtedly have had the effect of prolonging the hearing.

As a result, in written submissions dealing with this disclosure he invited me not to accept the evidence of Ofsted’s witnesses in so far as it conflicted with that of the Claimant.  If I was not prepared so to do then, he submitted, the only alternative would be to order cross-examination of Ofsted’s witnesses.  </p>

There may be an exception where there is undisputed objective evidence inconsistent with that of the witness that cannot sensibly be explained away (in other words, the witness’s testimony is manifestly wrong), but that is not the present case.  The general rule applies as much in judicial review proceedings as in other litigation, although in judicial review proceedings it is relatively unusual for there to be a conflict of testimony and even more unusual for there to be cross-examination of witnesses.”</p>

However, whilst I will bear that guidance in mind when appraising the evidence, I am less convinced than Mr Maurici suggests I should be that, as he submits, the post-trial disclosure provides in a number of respects “undisputed objective evidence inconsistent with that of the witness that cannot sensibly be explained away (in other words, the witness's testimony is manifestly wrong)”.   I will return to this where appropriate, but, whilst I accept that there are aspects of the further disclosure that give some grounds for questioning the precise accuracy and reliability of what <span style="text-decoration:underline">some</span> witnesses have said about <span style="text-decoration:underline">some</span> issues, that is not necessarily determinative of whether the evidence of a particular witness on a particular issue or more generally is “manifestly wrong”.

It will be obvious that by the end of the prolonged process that constitutes the effective hearing in this case, I had received a considerable amount of written evidence in the form of witness statements and other documentation.  However, none of the witnesses had been cross-examined and had put to them any countervailing evidence or any documents said to contradict or undermine their evidence.  </p>

He submits that the principle reflected in the Latin expression  <span style="font-style:italic">omnia praesumuntur contra spoliatorem </span>(everything is to be presumed against the destroyer of evidence) should be invoked in this case and draws attention to <span style="font-style:italic">Earles v Barclays Bank Plc</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold"> </span>[2009] EWHC 2500.

A considerable amount of evidence was served very shortly before the case started, some of which, as I have said, confirmed the factual gulf between, most particularly, the Claimant and the Ofsted inspectors about the conduct of the inspection and also between the Claimant and some of her erstwhile colleagues at Haringey in connection with the emerging conclusions of the inspectors. The lateness of this evidence is a matter upon which submissions have been made and I will indicate where, if I consider it relevant, those submissions have affected my approach to the evidence.  The late service of evidence may, of course, have an impact on costs irrespective of the outcome of the case. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Even before the extensive late disclosure by Ofsted, Mr Maurici had pointed to what he said were failures in disclosure of relevant documents by all Defendants.  As will become plain at later stages in this judgment, some of those complaints were, in my view, justified.  As subsequent events demonstrated, they were clearly and unequivocally justified in relation to Ofsted.  However, given that general background, and notwithstanding that I have not been invited to direct cross-examination of any of the witnesses, I have taken a somewhat more liberal approach to my evaluation of the evidence than reflected in the general practice to which I referred in paragraph 42 and I have paid particularly close attention to such contemporaneous documentation as has been revealed: see Fordham <span style="font-style:italic">Judicial Review Handbook, </span>5th ed., at paragraph 17.3.6(B).  However, it should be understood that, save where I have felt obliged to indicate the direction in which, in my view, the inherent probabilities and/or the preponderance of the evidence points on any material issue of fact which goes to the question of whether the grounds for judicial review are made out, I have formed no view (certainly none that would bind another court or tribunal) on the credibility or reliability of any of the witnesses or upon their character, competence or capacity to deal with any of the actions that each was called upon to perform at any time during the period relevant to the applications before the court.  Observing someone giving evidence and being challenged in cross-examination is an inestimable advantage when it comes to matters of that nature.</p>

Since the issue has been raised I cannot avoid making reference to it and I shall be dealing with it in due course.  However, I wish to make it abundantly clear that, consistent with the position that any court would adopt, political matters are quite outside the boundaries of any area that the court would enter voluntarily.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Second, the Claimant is undoubtedly of the view that she has been subject to press and media interest and intrusion that has gone beyond an acceptable threshold, a view that appears to have been shared by others and, at least to some extent at some stage, according to an interview in the papers before me, by the Secretary of State himself.  Again I cannot avoid reference to the involvement of the press in relation to some parts of the background since it forms a significant feature of that background and may have a bearing on at least one important feature in the case.  However, anything I say about the press interest should not be seen as either condemning or condoning what has occurred.  There will be those who consider the press interest in the Claimant to have been entirely appropriate and called for; there will be those who consider it to have been unfairly personalised and unnecessarily and aggressively intrusive.  That is a matter of personal opinion and taste.  My position on this issue must be one of neutrality.  No issue of law arises from it although, as I shall observe in due course, it is a well-recognised consequence of allowing the discussion of any serious issue to become personalised that the issue itself can become obscured and devalued.  It is arguable that that has occurred in some respects in this case.  Furthermore, the extent to which the circumstances of the Ofsted inspection were affected by the press and media interest at the time is an issue that cannot be avoided.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Third, I can deal with the issues and arguments in this case <span style="text-decoration:underline">only</span> on the basis of the evidence put before me.  I have already alluded to issues that have arisen concerning the disclosure of material in the case and I have indicated how I have gone about evaluating the evidence I have received in the light of those considerations (see Section 4).   But the point to be made (which is very much a reflection of the nature of the proceedings before me) is that ultimately I can deal with the case only on the basis of what the parties choose to put before me, the assumption being made that all parties (particularly the public authority defendants) have complied with the duty of candour expected of them.  I am quite certain that I have not seen every piece of paper and every electronic communication concerning the background to the events in this case: indeed I should emphasise that in the ordinary course of this kind of litigation I would not have expected to do so.  For example, whilst exhibited to Ms Pugh's witness statement (and thus disclosed) on behalf of the Secretary of State were some 40 or so e-mails passing between various parties during 2008 (and earlier) until the e-mail from Orla Delargy to Mr Mike Snowdon at Haringey just after Prime Minister's Questions on 12 November 2008 (see paragraph 128 below), no further e-mails were disclosed until the e-mail exchange late on 30 November when the Ofsted report was sent to DCSF officials (see paragraphs 284-286 below).  Equally, no internal notes or other documentation within the DCSF were disclosed during the period of the Ofsted inspection and the preparation of the report until its formal presentation to the Secretary of State on the morning of 1 December with the exception of a briefing document for the Secretary of State dated 21 November (see paragraph 500 below) setting out the various options for intervention depending on the conclusions of the Ofsted report.  It is quite plain that other e-mails passed during this period (many in fact disclosed by Ofsted) and other documents would have been generated.  Meetings and contact undoubtedly took place between Ofsted officials and DCSF officials during this period: that has never been concealed and Ms Pugh's witness statement mentions most, if not all, of them.   I have to approach matters on the basis that nothing remains to be disclosed, either by way of a further statement or by way of the revelation of further documents, that would support the Claimant's case against the Secretary of State or would undermine his answer to that case.  The same applies to all other parties.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Fourth, although I have received extensive written and oral submissions, and have received a very large volume of further documentation as a result of the further disclosure by Ofsted, I have focused on those submissions which have appeared to me to lend the greatest weight to each party’s case or otherwise needed to be addressed.  If arguments or documents are not referred to specifically in the judgment it is because my assessment is that they are unlikely to have made a material difference to the outcome.  It is, of course, open to others to take a different view, but dealing with the case in any other way would have lengthened the period for preparing this judgment which has not seemed to me to be in anyone's interest.</p>

The report was published in January 2003.  In summary, it was critical of the failure of all the agencies to protect Victoria or to share vital information with each other.  The report made a substantial number of recommendations.  In September 2003 the Government published a response to the report and to a research report of the Joint Chief Inspectors, the response being entitled ‘Keeping Children Safe’ (Cmnd 5861).  At the same time it published the Green Paper ‘Every Child Matters’ (Cmnd 5860) (‘ECM’).  ECM went further than proposals simply for the protection of children and set out what was described at the time as a “hugely ambitious agenda” for the provision of improved services for all children within a locality.  Following consultation on ECM, the Children Act 2004 was enacted.</p>

I understand that at the time with which the events of this case are concerned about 70% of LSCBs were chaired by the DCS.  The Chief Inspector, when giving evidence on 10 December 2008 (see paragraph 7 above), said that there were 150 relevant local authorities and did not contest the suggestion put to her that only 50 had independent Chairs of the LSCB.  To the extent that the Claimant has been subjected to criticism for taking on this role at Haringey, it is at least possible to see why she has felt such a criticism was neither justified nor fair in the light of what was, numerically at least, widespread practice at the time - unless, of course, there was something particular about Haringey that demanded the Chair of the LSCB to be wholly independent.  Since it was not something that had attracted adverse comment from Ofsted previously in its inspections – indeed the Claimant’s role in this regard had been praised (see paragraph 84 below) - nor was it something insisted on by the Chief Executive or the Leader of the Council, many would think that the Claimant had some justification for feeling aggrieved about this.  It appears that the true meaning of “independence” was still a matter of debate at that time because, in the evidence given by the Chief Inspector on 10 February, she said that Ofsted felt that there was a need for a wider debate on “what independence means” in this context.  I will be returning to the matters of criticism in due course but, despite the observation I have just made, it is clear (and indeed undisputed) that the Claimant did speak to the inspectors about this matter (see paragraph 446 below).</p>

In recent years, a high proportion of initial assessments have been made in response to referrals, reflecting an understandably cautious approach to protecting children.  However, cases are not always prioritised sufficiently well or consistently by referral and assessment services; there is variation in practice between the two geographically-based teams, including the application of national guidance on sharing information.   There are delays in addressing some children’s needs, including potential child protection concerns; in some of the individual cases sampled during the review, standard assessments had not been carried out, making planning difficult and resulting in delays for children and young people.  The turnover of social work staff is high, resulting in lack of continuity in managing cases.  The electronic recording system, Framework I, has the potential to provide a good overview of practice but there continue to be problems in embedding the system and there is as yet insufficient management scrutiny of electronic files.”</p>

Mr Maurici says that civil servants for whom the Secretary of State, not the Claimant, was responsible occasioned this delay, but notwithstanding this the Claimant and Haringey are blamed for it by Ofsted.  This observation was in response to the suggestion of Ms Brown that she “would not accept that the alleged failure on the part of the GOL justifies the delay [since] the responsibility for conducting the SCR lies with the LSCB and, in particular, the SCR sub-group [of which the Claimant] was chair of both bodies.”  It is unnecessary for me to form any view about this save to note that the Claimant on 27 November was expressing the view to her Deputy and Mr McGhee that the need to finalise the terms of reference was “getting urgent”.</p>

It took place between 29 October 2007 and 9 November 2007 and the report became available on 16 November 2007.  It concluded that “good quality social work to children and families within the Borough [was provided] with a generally sound management group supported by clear leadership from the Deputy Director.”   There were a number of positive themes in this report, including reference to the sense of teamwork and support within the department and the loyalty to the Borough of staff within it.  However, there were criticisms based upon a random audit of what turned out to be 45 children’s files.  The management oversight of files was not universal: 16% were regularly supervised and 49% had some supervision notes (although the notes were “often minimal and lacked detail”), whereas 35% had no supervision notes on the file.  The report indicated that where there was no evidence of management oversight, the files “lacked clarity and focus on actions or planning for the children.”   It was recognised that this was an area that required attention.  Initial assessments seen were said to be “generally of a good quality” although the quality of core assessments “varied”.  This was an area identified as requiring improvement.  There was some evidence of a “slow response to referrals with actual and potential child protection concerns.”  Ms Doe recorded that “[although] some of the cases had already progressed and had not been updated on the system there was recognition that certain children’s situations needed action.”  Reference is made to recruitment difficulties and to the shortcomings of some agency staff.  The difficulties of securing multi-agency co-operation is also referred to.</p>

Ms Doe emphasised that the report was “based in the main on written material” and that there had been “no interviews with key staff or stakeholders.” She concluded that Haringey and the LSCB had “responded robustly” to the Laming recommendations and that Haringey had “come a long way since the Laming inquiry.”  She said the progress was “tangible, clear and unequivocal.”</p>

With, it was said, the possible exception of the long awaited paediatric assessment on 1 August 2007, no single factor was likely to have prevented the tragic outcome.  Various recommendations were made for the LSCB, the health agencies and others, including the police.  A total of 15 recommendations were made for the Haringey CYPS including ensuring that all known parents of a child are informed of concerns about the child, are consulted on plans, invited to child protection conferences and included in core groups.  </p>

The evidence demonstrates that it was a highly charged occasion coming, as it did, only hours after the jury’s verdicts.  The Claimant herself has said that she and the representative of Great Ormond Street hospital “faced a hostile room of people” and that, when she reflected subsequently on what had happened, felt that it had plainly gone wrong and that the strategy adopted was a “disaster”.  She accepts that an unfortunate interchange allowed the suggestion to be made in the press that she would not apologise to Peter’s father for what had occurred whereas, she says, the truth was that she had written to him appropriately at a very early stage following Peter’s death.  However, that, plus her resistance to the suggestion that she should resign, prompted, on her account, a hostile press attitude to her thereafter.  In addition to that press conference she gave about 15 other media interviews that day.  One thing she said (which was reported widely subsequently) was to the effect that it was impossible to “stop people who are determined to kill children”.  It was an observation that led to adverse comment in the press including the comment that it demonstrated complacency.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Within the DCSF, there was a meeting between Beverley Hughes and officials at about 6pm to discuss what kind of review should be carried out to see if Peter’s case was indicative of wider failings within Haringey.  That involved, according to Ms Pugh, the possibility of an Ofsted inspection rather than a diagnostic review by independent consultants.  An issue has been raised about the correctness of that assertion and it is fair to say that an e-mail sent by Ms Hughes’ Private Secretary at 20.02 suggests that reference to Ofsted in this meeting was in relation to the possibility of seconding someone from Ofsted (a lead inspector) to assist Lord Laming rather than in the context of preparing a report on the child safeguarding services in Haringey.  Furthermore, in her e-mail to Mr David Bell later that evening (see paragraph 115 below), Ms Pugh says that “a diagnostic review looks like a strong possibility” in the context of further work that was needed with Haringey.  (Mr Bell, I should record, is the Permanent Secretary at the DCSF and thus its most senior civil servant.)  At all events, I do not consider that anything turns upon the question of whether Ofsted was identified at that meeting as a possible source of the report.  The evidence (see paragraph 125 below) is clear that by the following morning Ofsted had been so identified.  I should record that the same e-mail recorded the suggestion that Ms Pugh should speak to the Claimant about a diagnostic review and to the Chief Executive of Haringey and the Council members about whether disciplinary action was contemplated.  </p>

I have no reason to doubt her competence or her sincerity – and she has been very open and cooperative with me – but her stance today and her position as Chair of the LSCB as well as DCS makes things trickier.

Ms Pugh accepts that on that day she was sent “the current draft overview report” of which she asked a Departmental official to produce an analysis.  That was done on 7 November and the analysis supplied to Ministers.  The full SCR would, she says, include the detailed individual management reports and the executive summary of the overview report.  She already had a draft of the executive summary (provided on 21 October) and now she had the draft overview report, but not the “full SCR”.  The “full SCR” was not received until it was sent to the DCSF by the Government Office for London (GOL) during the morning of 12 November (see paragraph 126 below).  </p>

It makes all of us question how someone could do such a terrible thing to a child and set out to deceive the very people trying to help. Safeguarding children is Government’s top priority and we expect it to be the top priority for local agencies too. In response to Lord Laming’s report following the death of Victoria Climbié we introduced fundamental reforms to help keep children safe. Local areas are also now required to review every case where a child is harmed or killed, and neglect or abuse is suspected. We will be considering the serious case review in this case and whether there needs to be a further investigation of child protection procedures and practices among local agencies in Haringey.”</p>

However, Ms Pugh, in a witness statement dated 2 October, has exhibited her contemporaneous handwritten notes of this morning meeting which demonstrate that the option was indeed considered at that time.  Mr Maurici says that no reference to this meeting had been made prior to it being revealed in a letter from the Treasury Solicitor dated 25 September.  That may be so, but since no suggestion is or could be made that such a meeting did not take place, it takes his argument no further.  He is, however, on stronger ground when he contends that there was nothing in the Ministerial statement referred to in paragraph 123 that suggested any urgency in reviewing the SCR with a view to deciding “whether there needs to be a further investigation of child protection procedures and practices among local agencies in Haringey” and that there is nothing in Ms Pugh’s contemporaneous handwritten notes of the meeting on 12 November to suggest that urgent contact was to be made with Ofsted.

She asked if we were seeking the resignation of the Claimant and we said we were not. We mentioned that one option we were exploring was an inspection led by Ofsted.  As far as the Claimant was concerned two options were discussed: that she remained in post with someone working alongside her to provide her with support and challenge, or that she be suspended.  We knew very well that it was not within our remit to seek the Claimant’s suspension and we certainly did not do so.  The employment of the Claimant was a matter for Haringey.  However, we asked what the Council’s intentions were and whether the Claimant retained the confidence of the Council.  The Chief Executive was emphatic in saying that she did.  We accepted this and it was therefore agreed that the option of someone working alongside the Claimant to offer support during any inspection would be explored.  This led to my having subsequent telephone conversations with John Coughlan. It is incorrect to say that officials pressed for the Claimant’s suspension ….”</p>

I can recall that the Leader of the Council, Councillor George Meehan, shared my view that Ms Shoesmith retained the confidence of the Council and agreed with what I had said. Councillor Meehan did not at any time say to me that he had received any telephone call urging that Ms Shoesmith be suspended (whether at a meeting with Ms Shoesmith present or separately) and I do not believe that this happened.

Indeed the inherent likelihood, given the need for an investigation of the workings of the safeguarding services at Haringey, would be that suspension whilst the investigation continued of the Head of those services would be considered, though not necessarily implemented.  However, I would be unable to conclude that the DCSF sought to “demand” the Claimant’s suspension even though, understandably, that may have been how the Claimant perceived it and, had it occurred, it might have taken some of the heat being generated at the time out of the situation.</p>

The Claimant agrees that she was told by the Chief Executive that this is what would happen.

As these effectively constituted a continuing discussion with the different officials involved, the divisions between these meetings were not always clearly demarcated.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Brokering the arrangements by which Mr Coughlan, who was DCS of Hampshire County Council, came to be seconded must have taken a little while and the same letter from the Treasury Solicitor indicates that he was contacted after midday.  The comprehensive statement issued by the Secretary of State at 5.23 pm (see paragraph 142 below) will have required careful drafting and consideration, but presumably when a Secretary of State decides that things should move fast, they move fast.  The only additional insight into how matters moved forward is to be derived from the evidence of the Ofsted witnesses. Mr Roger Shippam, then the Deputy Director of the Education Directorate at Ofsted, said that “in the course of the day [the Chief Inspector] received a telephone call from David Bell … [informing her] that she would shortly be receiving a letter from the Secretary of State asking Ofsted (together with the Healthcare Commission and HMIC) to carry out an urgent JAR of safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children in Haringey.”  (HMIC stands for Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Constabulary.)   If it is correct that the letter from the Secretary of State did follow “shortly” then, bearing in mind that it was sent shortly after 5.30 pm, it would suggest that this first contact was made earlier that afternoon and hence after Prime Minister’s Questions.  Indeed in a formal response dated 8 September 2009 to a request for further information, the Treasury Solicitor on behalf of Ofsted has said that the telephone contact between Mr Bell and Ms Gilbert was “at some time estimated to be between 2.30 pm and 3.00 pm.”  Mr Shippam’s witness statement does not actually confirm this was so and neither does the witness statement of Ms Brown give any real insight into when Ofsted were first approached.  In answer to a question from the Claimant’s solicitors the Treasury Solicitor has confirmed that the letter to Ofsted was written “during the course of the afternoon after Prime Minister’s Questions”. Mr Maurici submitted in his Skeleton Argument dated 18 September (and served on 21 September) that the “evidence shows that Ofsted were not approached about doing an inspection even on a preliminary basis until the afternoon … after PMQT.”  Neither Ms Pugh in her subsequent witness statement, nor Mr James Eadie QC in his submissions on behalf of the Secretary of State, has challenged that assertion and, in those circumstances, in the absence of evidence that might have shown the contrary, I am inclined to assume that this was indeed so.  The reply to the request for information from Ofsted seems to support this conclusion.</p>

It was agreed with him that whether or not an inspection of safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children in Haringey should be carried out should be clearly rooted in the serious case review and whether that review pointed to inadequacies in safeguarding. </p>

Ever since Peter’s death the DCSF had been concerned that, following the trial, the case might either be used as or simply have the effect of, as it was put in Ms Pugh’s witness statement (and reflected in the Claimant’s own understanding of the position), destabilising “the improvements that there had been nationally following the implementation of the 2004 Act and the Government’s ‘Every Child Matters’ reforms.”  She has drawn attention to concerns expressed on behalf of the Government Office for London to that effect earlier in the summer of 2008 (see paragraph 98 above).  It is clear from the media coverage to which I referred in paragraph 120 above that many questions were being raised.  It is, of course, possible that neither the Ministers nor the Departmental officials had foreseen the strength of the public reaction to the case and were, accordingly, not initially as prepared for taking the urgent steps that they did that afternoon as they might, on reflection, have been.  But if that is so, it was not necessarily just “party politics” that dictated the change of gear:  the urgent need to restore some confidence in the position within Haringey and more widely was, as it seems to me, a judgment that the Secretary of State was entitled and indeed obliged by virtue of his office to make at the time, albeit one made within an apparently short timescale.  That does not make it wrong or otherwise inappropriate.  Indeed, of course, it is not a decision that is the subject of direct challenge in these proceedings although the oblique suggestion is that, because matters proceeded with such haste, corners were cut which resulted in ultimate unfairness to the Claimant.  I have dealt with all this merely because of the suggestion that what happened was “politically motivated”.  As I have said, that is too simplistic.  The essential question in the present case relates to the decision made by the Secretary of State on 1 December to which, of course, I will be returning in due course.</p>

But in this case I think that there were problems, and in Haringey of all places, after Victoria Climbié; and what I don’t want to do is jump to a particular judgement, I don’t want to comment on what was said by one person at a press conference, I want the national inspectors to go in and tell me what needs to be done, and at the same time I have also asked, with the agreement of Haringey, the director of children’s services from Hampshire to go in today and be there with the social work team to support them, but also to challenge, to make sure the procedures are being properly followed in Haringey now”.</p>

In her witness statement the Claimant speaks of the press intrusion in her private life and in connection with her family, including her elderly mother.  She was also, she says, the recipient of a large number of abusive and threatening messages, one of which was sent on several occasions spelling out 100 ways of committing suicide.  She also received some death threats, including some targeted at her daughter.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Her account in this regard has not been challenged by anyone and indeed it is supported by other accounts.  It is clear that consideration was given during this period by Haringey’s legal advisers to the question of whether an injunction might be obtained to protect her from the press attention.  It is quite plain from Dr O’Donovan’s witness statement that she (Dr O’Donovan) was very concerned during this period for the Claimant’s safety, health and ability to cope.  She was, Dr O’Donovan said, “the focus of an amazing amount of press and public attention.”  Dr O’Donovan observed the stress and strain she was under and what she described as her “variable ability to concentrate during this very difficult period.”   Ms Brown said that the inspection team was acutely conscious of the media pressures on the Claimant during the period of the inspection and that she appeared “both distracted and anxious during my dealings with her.”  Mr Pullen, who saw her on two occasions during the fieldwork week, said she spoke about the pressure that she personally was under from the press and, in his view, “was clearly greatly affected by this.”    Whilst Ms Ryan thought the Claimant “was holding up extraordinarily well under the pressure” the record kept (see paragraph 205 below) suggests that her “responses … to the team’s questions was less focused and coherent than … might have been expected”, an observation backed up by Ms Brown’s memorandum to which I refer in paragraph 487 below.  Whilst the Claimant has said that she “is a very resilient person” and that she “was coping well with the pressure” – and, of course, I have had no opportunity to make an assessment of her in the witness box - it would be very surprising if, on this issue, the observations made by others did not contain more than a little substance even if some of the observations are arguably self-serving.  The Claimant’s text message to Ms Brown (quoted in paragraph 280 below) demonstrates the strain she was under.</p>

However, an analysis of the normal procedures that would govern the production of a JAR would suggest that either it was not a full JAR or that it was not produced in accordance with the standard procedures and timetable.

These include JARs and APAs … but also other inspections such as those of fostering and adoption agencies.  The ECM Framework explains how relevant inspections will report on the contributions of services to improving five key outcomes for children and young people (“the ECM Outcomes”).

To this end they encompassed investigations into three core areas: “safeguarding”, “looked after children”, and “children and young people with learning difficulties and/or disabilities” plus any additional investigations warranted by particular weaknesses in the area in question.  This meant that JAR inspections would always cover those ECM Outcomes and Key Judgements that were relevant to the three core areas, but coverage of the remainder would depend on the particular circumstances.  In determining that coverage, regard was had, among other things, to the area’s most recent APA and the areas for development identified within it.  </p>

Ms Brown, the Lead Inspector, said that the request for the report by 1 December “meant that we had 19 days in which to scope the inspection, carry out all fieldwork and documentary analysis and to draft and finalise our Report.”  She said that “JARs conducted under the original programme took place over a period of approximately five months … [and that as far as she was aware] this was the first time that Ofsted had received a request of this kind.”  The period of 19 days included weekends, it would seem.   Ms Brown’s memorandum (see paragraph 487 below) gives a clear indication of the problems caused by the severely foreshortened process.</p>

In this case the Secretary of State directed that the report should go to him - and not just that it should go to him, but that no-one else should see it before he did: see paragraphs 177-178 below.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgment, there would have to be far more compelling evidence than that to justify the conclusion that the Ofsted inspection had been effectively subverted by or on behalf of the Secretary of State.   This was an unusual process (no-one denies that) and the parameters for the inspection were different from those surrounding the preparation of a normal JAR.  On that basis the normal rules of engagement would be unlikely to apply.  However, as I shall observe later (see paragraph 543), unless there is evidence from which it could be concluded that the Ofsted report was 'made to order' at the behest of the Secretary of State or his officials to meet a particular political or administrative objective, and thus the outcome became a foregone conclusion irrespective of the true merits of the inspection, I am unable to see that there is any substance in Mr Maurici's argument.  In order to be ready to deal with the implications of the report when it emerged finally, particularly in a context when there would be a media expectation of an announcement of the outcome soon after the report was presented to the Secretary of State, it is tolerably easy to see why there would have to be contacts between officials in the short period provided for this inspection.   The desire on the part of the Secretary of State to see the report before anyone else did may have arisen from concerns that its contents would be 'leaked' before he had had an opportunity to consider it.   Unless there was evidence of some much more sinister influence in the process, I am quite unable to see that the matters upon which Mr Maurici relies for this purpose sustain his argument.  I will return to another feature of this general argument later.</p>

The witness statements of those involved at Ofsted show that there were further discussions on 13 November and again on 14 November, those latter discussions also involving the Healthcare Commission and HMIC.  It was agreed early on that whilst the process would not be a “full” JAR, the framework and methodology employed in carrying out a JAR would be applied, albeit adapted to the restricted timetable.  No intrinsic complaint is made about that and indeed the Claimant herself has acknowledged that it was a sensible approach.  </p>

	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“21.<marker name="tab"/>First, the Secretary of State had asked that “a first report should be submitted to [him]”.  We understood this to mean that the inspection team’s findings should be reported directly to the Secretary of State, and should not be disclosed beforehand to anyone outside of the participating inspectorates.  This approach was, in our view, justified in view of the sensitivity surrounding the safety of vulnerable children in the Haringey area (arising from the Baby P case), together with the fact that this inspection had been specifically requested by the Secretary of State outside the original JAR programme.    </p>
	  </content>
	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">22.<marker name="tab"/>A secondary reason was the timescale within which we had decided to conduct the inspection.   We anticipated that this would have made it difficult to hold a meaningful oral summary meeting in any event.  In particular, since the inspection team would be conducting its fieldwork over one week rather than two, and would at the same time be analysing the documentary evidence (which would have taken place prior to the fieldwork under the ordinary programme), it was unlikely to have properly formulated its provisional conclusions by the end of that week, or to have had sufficient time to prepare for such a meeting.</p>
	  </content>
	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">23.<marker name="tab"/>Our third concern was that, if an oral summary meeting was held at the end of the fieldwork at which the inspectors presented their provisional conclusions, there was a risk that those provisional conclusions (whether good or bad) might become public and possibly leaked to the media or even “spun”<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>before we had completed the report and delivered it to the Secretary of State. I am not seeking to suggest that there was any particular reason to think that the specific agencies involved in this inspection might seek to do this, but it has happened in other JARs, where local authorities have sought to manage the response of the press.  We did not wish the Secretary of State to hear of the conclusions via the media, and possibly, to hear an inaccurate account.”</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I should say that Mr Shippam’s witness statement containing these paragraphs was dated 24 July and I assume it was served on the other Defendants not long thereafter.  Ms Brown’s first witness statement was dated 16 July 2009.  She said in that statement that she “had been told that we were to report directly to the Secretary of State, and that there was to be no interim feedback to the local authority”, her understanding being as indicated in paragraph 177 above.   She exhibited her notes for the set-up meeting on 13 November (see paragraph 181 below) which indicated that “we will be unable to offer a feedback meeting at the end of inspection fieldwork [because our] brief is to feed back to the Minister.”  These pieces of evidence certainly supported what, in due course in her witness statement of 21 September, the Claimant said she was told by Ofsted at the outset of the inspection, namely, that there was to be “strictly no feedback during the course of the inspection either to me or to any of the other agencies.”  Indeed that was clearly recorded in the evidence that she gave to the Haringey Appeal Hearing in January 2009 (see paragraph 349 <span style="font-style:italic">et seq</span> below), the transcript of which was attached to the witness statement of Councillor Dodds on behalf of Haringey dated 2 June 2009.  In her second witness statement, dated 2 October, some five days before the commencement of the hearing, Ms Pugh responded to this assertion of, as she put it, “the Claimant”, in this way: </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“The Secretary of State did not prohibit the giving of feedback during the course of the inspection. The Secretary of State did say in his letter to Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector, Christine Gilbert, of the 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2008 [<span style="font-style:italic">see paragraph 143 above</span>] that ‘Given the importance and urgency of these matters, I request that a first report should be submitted to me by 1 December 2008’. By this, the Secretary of State indicated that the report should be submitted to him and not to anyone else by that date. Insofar as this may have been interpreted by Ofsted as meaning that there should be no feedback at all to the Claimant or other agencies before submission of the report, then this would have been a misunderstanding.”</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Leaving aside for present purposes the comment that this position of the Secretary of State took a rather long time to emerge given the much earlier stage than the Claimant’s second witness statement that Ofsted’s view was revealed and indeed from sources other than the Claimant, it is plainly of concern that the Secretary of State and those advising him may apparently have thought that there would be feedback during the inspection process whereas those conducting it thought that he had precluded it.  I did not find Mr Eadie’s attempt to suggest that there “was in fact no misunderstanding” particularly convincing.  I will have to consider, in due course, whether in truth this advances the Claimant’s case as to unfairness, but it does illustrate the consequences that can flow from engaging at short notice in a vastly accelerated form of an otherwise well-established process.  I am far from suggesting that the decision to proceed in this accelerated way was wrong or reflected a misjudgement, but it does illustrate starkly the need for clarity of thinking when such a decision is made and for very clear lines of communication between those engaged on important practical issues.</p>

This was said by Ms Brown at the first set-up meeting at Haringey on the afternoon of 13 November and indeed the Claimant’s own notes of that meeting reflected it.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It was also made clear at that meeting that the evaluation of the SCR in Peter’s case was a separate matter from the inspection itself.  There is, however, an issue about whether, as Ms Brown suggests in her witness statement, she told the meeting that the evaluation would be taken into account by Ofsted as part of its consideration of the evidence as a whole or whether, as the Claimant says, this was not mentioned at that meeting.  It is common ground that Ms Brown was reading from a script prepared in advance and it is equally clear that that script says nothing about the SCR evaluation being taken into account in the way suggested.  The Claimant’s own notes do not contain any reference to this either.  If I had to choose between these two recollections on the basis of the documentary material, I would, on the basis of the contemporaneous documentation, choose the Claimant’s.  It is, however, clear from a document detailing the scope of the inspection prepared for the second set-up meeting held at Haringey on the afternoon of 14 November that it was stated that, whilst the SCR review was separate, issues that arose from it would, it was said, “inform the inspection and be part of the evidence considered by the team.”  The Claimant’s brief notes do not reflect this, but she will have had a good deal on her mind in considering how to meet Ofsted’s requirements for the provision of information to and the arrangements for the inspection the following week and may simply not have taken it on board.  Indeed it was not just that: during the course of the meeting (according to one of Ms Brown's internal e-mails within Ofsted dated 15 November, disclosed in the later disclosure) the Claimant's daughter telephoned during the meeting to say that she was unable to leave her flat because of the press outside which, according to Ms Brown "further distracted and distressed" her.  That is hardly surprising.  However, I do not think that whatever may or may not have been said specifically at the meeting on 13 November really makes any difference:  it must have been plain as the inspection proceeded that the evaluation of the SCR would (or could) have a bearing on the report submitted to the Secretary of State and indeed the Claimant herself discussed the SCR in some detail with the inspectors. </p>

It is clear from an e-mail of Ms Brown on 15 November (disclosed in the subsequent disclosure) that Mr Coughlan was also "particularly opposed" to the suggestion that the inspectors would arrive in the duty room when it opened at 08.30 on the Monday morning, suggesting something a little more than having "expressed a concern over our proposal to visit the duty room", as she had put it in paragraph 91 of her first witness statement.  At all events, whatever the background to the concerns expressed, by whom and with what strength, it was agreed that the inspectors should defer their arrival at the duty room until the duty team had been briefed by the managers.</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“13. … Over that weekend and on the 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> and 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th </span>November I was aware of the increased and increasing anxiety among staff and officers in CYPS. I had seen over the weekend, how difficult it was to get data from Framework I. It is a core requirement in safeguarding that what is recorded on a particular case can be understood and appreciated by anyone looking at the case file or Framework I, so that the social care professional knows what has happened on the case and what is required by way of next steps. To understand the record, it is important to be able to see immediately when it was first notified; a chronology of the dealings; and what the recorder is saying about the family at any given time. The record should demonstrate reflective practice, that is to say, an appreciation of the known state of affairs and what should be done to address it. If there are gaps in the records, the person tasked to respond will not know what has happened on the case and will find it difficult to make a judgment about what should happen next. When I saw and heard about the great and glaring gaps in Framework I over that weekend, alarm bells started ringing for me. If the data was incomplete, I could not see how the case management could be adequate and therefore I was concerned that management and supervision could not have been effectively carried out.</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">14.<marker name="tab"/>In addition to these concerns, I was also present during a fraught exchange that weekend (which left a lasting impression on me) between [the Claimant] and her Deputy about delayed responses to correspondence in relation to a case. This case concerned a child in care and the correspondence related to an injury to that child which had not been answered or addressed. I cannot recall the exact length of the delay in providing any response but it was a question of several months since the letter had been received. [The Claimant] was speaking to her Deputy about the case and was very concerned at the delay. She was very upset as was her Deputy. Immediate action was required by [the Claimant] to be taken by the Deputy Director following this exchange. I specifically recall thinking that this might be indicative of wider problems and felt that it did not bode well for the inspection when added to the issue concerning the absence of data on Framework-I.</p>

It was difficult to have these conversations with [the Claimant] because her focus was the inspection and seeing that through as she kept telling us. There were moments when I thought she could see how matters were unfolding but then those insights seemed to disappear. I knew she was under great pressure and making a huge effort to concentrate on the task on hand.</p>

As I recall [the Claimant’s] response was that she wanted to focus on getting through the JAR inspection and that it was too soon to come to that conclusion. I disagreed on the basis of what I had seen. I have seen preparations for inspections before and could tell that there was a palpable difference between the high levels of anxiety being exhibited by managers in Children and Families over this inspection and the "normal" level I have seen in most other inspections. When I went home that evening I was seriously concerned about the outcome of the inspection.”</p>

First, staff were updating Framework [I] in preparation for the Inspection and were preparing excel spreadsheets of our cases for the inspectors. I saw staff sitting in front of whole sections on screen that were empty and although I am not a social care professional, I understand the difference between an exercise involving the tidying up of records, and empty screens. What I saw was the latter and I was really concerned about the scale of the information that was missing from our systems. I spoke to Eve Pelekanos (who was helping with the Framework-[I] records) about the glaring gaps. She and other staff were plainly concerned. She told me that there were significant gaps in the data and that staff were trying to complete them. Even to someone not familiar with the system it was evident that this was more than a simple tidy-up exercise and that something fundamental was wrong. This was not a secret. It was discussed openly over the weekend and staff were in a real state about it. Whilst I do not recall personally discussing it with [the Claimant], I cannot accept that she would have been unaware of it. The scale of the omissions was significant and she was sending more and more staff to the floor to input their records.”</p>

He also makes the point strongly (both about that weekend and other meetings to which I will refer later) that neither Dr O’Donovan nor Mr Young have any contemporaneous notes confirming their recollections.  There is some force in that point, but certainly some of the matters to which they refer are matters of impression and one would not necessarily expect records to be made of that kind of matter.  Mr Maurici recognises that Mr Young had said in his first witness statement of 22 June that he (Mr Young) was not surprised by the outcome of the inspection because of what he saw on the weekend of the 15 and 16 November.  In that statement he said that “there were issues emerging”.  He continued thus:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Taken in isolation this evidence would not necessarily have been particularly compelling.  It is not difficult to imagine that any inspection of the sort carried out by Ofsted would occasion a degree of nervous anticipation on the part of those whose work is to be inspected.  However, the circumstances of this “unique” and uniquely urgent inspection, taken against the background of the press presence near the office and the headlines that had emerged in the previous few days, must have made that weekend an especially difficult and intimidating time for everyone involved.  Since it had made such an impression on Dr O’Donovan and Mr Young I am surprised that it was not articulated more fully at an earlier stage and that Mr Young, when presenting the Council’s case to the Appeal Hearing in January, did not remind the Claimant about it.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">However, be that as it may, there is little dispute that as the fieldwork week progressed, Dr O’Donovan, Mr Young and some of the senior Councillors were anticipating a poor outcome.  Mr Young said in his witness statement of 22 June that it was clear “by the end of the last week in November that the report … would not be positive.”  However, in the witness statement of 1 October he said that by Tuesday, 18 November, he (along with Dr O’Donovan) had already formed that view.  It is not in dispute that Dr O’Donovan and Mr Young had a meeting with the Claimant that day in which, according to the Claimant, Dr O’Donovan “repeatedly told [her] that the report would be negative” and that she mentioned the name of Richard Penn as someone from the Association of Local Authority Chief Executives who could represent her in any negotiations and said that the Haringey would pay for this.  The Claimant did indeed contact Mr Penn that evening.   It follows that by whatever process it came about, by then at least Dr O’Donovan had come to appreciate that the report would not be good.  I will return to that perception when I have reviewed the events of Monday, 17 November, and the earlier part of the Tuesday.  It does have to be said that if that perception on the part of Dr O’Donovan and Mr Young was already in place by the end of the Tuesday, it must have been something very rapidly confirmed from their impressions formed over the weekend given that the inspectors did not arrive to commence the inspection until the Monday morning.  I should say that Dr O’Donovan has said that the view was also shared by Councillors Meehan and Santry.  She has denied receiving any private feedback from Ofsted or having any liaison with the DCSF at this time.  She says that her assessment was based on her own observations and discussions with Haringey staff and Council members, together with the nature of the concerns being raised with them by the Ofsted inspectors and her own direct dealings with the Ofsted inspectors.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Claimant says, and I doubt anyone would seriously dispute it, that those who had worked in the office over the weekend were exhausted by the Monday morning.  Ms Hitchen had been considerably stressed over the weekend and Mr Preece, the Service Manager with responsibility for Children in Need and Safeguarding  (including the responsibility for the management of the duty room), reported sick that morning.  The Claimant says that he had been tracked down by one of the newspapers.  This meant that the Service Manager with responsibility for the place where the inspection was to start was not in post that morning.  The Monday, incidentally, was the day of the <span style="font-style:italic">Panorama</span> programme that had been in the course of preparation for some while.  There is no doubt that it was an additional source of anxiety for the Claimant and others at Haringey.  In the late disclosure of material by Ofsted there is a lengthy e-mail from Ms Brown to Mr Pullen (copied to Ms Ryan) on 15 November which reported on her meeting at Haringey the previous day.  She said there was an aura of Haringey being ‘under siege’ and drew attention to the fact that everyone there was “very [focused] on the fact that Panorama will be airing on Monday night.”  She concluded the e-mail in this way:</p>

There has also, as yet, been no mentioned of how senior managers are ensuring that good quality responses are being made to the needs of vulnerable during this difficult time and of the importance of maintaining services.” </p>

The lack of appointment at the start of fieldwork of one link officer by the council (several people were charged with aspects of this role) meant that there were delays in receiving documents.

There is a broad issue, to which I will refer later, concerning the nature of the JAR process and whether it demands “fairness” to any individual in the way that, for example, an inquiry into a disciplinary matter demands.  However, irrespective of the answer to that issue, Ofsted has sought to demonstrate in the proceedings before me that if “fairness” was required to be shown, it was in fact shown sufficiently in the engagement of the Claimant by those involved in the inspection on issues and concerns that arose, particularly those that affected her position as DCS.  Furthermore, Ofsted suggests that she accepted some of the crucial concerns in any event.  </p>

To that end, we sought to encourage a very open discussion.   We would not, for example, say “I put it to you that ...” in the way a lawyer might.  Rather, we would explain the issues that we had been considering and/or the concerns that we had identified and say “tell us what you think works well, what you think the challenges are, and what issues you think need to be resolved”.  In this way, we would allow the interviewee the opportunity to speak freely about areas of good and poor performance, and to comment on concerns which we raised as a result of the evidence gathered so far.   </p>

The gist of concerns that are raised is, however, put to managers ….  Furthermore, in practice, it is typical in inspections for those individuals who are interviewed to communicate the gist of Ofsted’s concerns with their senior managers themselves.   </p>

She also asserts that the Claimant was not a layperson for the purposes of the inspection since she “had herself previously been an HMI at Ofsted”.  That is, of course, a fair point though it is also fair to point out that the Claimant had not been an HMI recently (at least since 2001) and, in any event, her experience would have been in the inspection of educational establishments, not of CSAs.  Nonetheless, as DCS she would (or should) have been familiar with the Ofsted guidance on inspections leading to a JAR and was, of course, DCS during the period of the JAR in Haringey in 2006 (see paragraph 81 above).  However, on any view, the process taking place during the week beginning 17 November 2008 was no ordinary JAR.</p>

To that extent, the focus is upon what has been termed “the duty room” and “case-tracking” feedback meetings that took place on the Tuesday and Wednesday respectively.  Mr Ward has submitted that “leadership and management issues were a constant theme” in those meetings.    I will return to consider whether that submission is justified later.</p>

It is not disputed that the RoE contains entries relating to the concerns that had arisen.  Mr Maurici has, however, drawn attention to what he submits is a gaping hole in the contemporaneous documentary material relating to the duty room feedback meeting which, he says, lies at the heart of Ofsted’s case that the gist of the concerns the inspectors had were raised with the Claimant.  As I have already indicated, there was undoubtedly considerable emphasis based on this particular feedback meeting for the purpose for which I have indicated.  Mr Ward helpfully produced a document entitled “The Inspection's central concerns” which set out the ten bullet points under the heading “Main Findings” in the JAR (see paragraph 288 below) and sought to demonstrate how each had been raised with the Claimant.  Mr Maurici has highlighted the fact that all but two (and, indeed arguably, all but one) placed substantial (though not complete) reliance on what was said at this meeting.  He is, I think, justified in saying that the meeting is of some real importance to Ofsted on this aspect of Ofsted’s case.</p>

Given that there are some entries relating to the “case-tracking” feedback meeting, and given the “serious concerns” it is said underpinned the need for this meeting, it is surprising that there is no contemporaneous record of what took place.  Mr Hart spoke of this meeting in some detail in his witness statement of 24 July, but his account must have been based purely on recollection, given the lack of contemporaneous documentation to which to refer.  Since the contemporaneous documentation is usually more compelling than a recollection put together some while after the event (no matter how honestly it may have been constructed) this is a legitimate area for Mr Maurici to launch an attack.  Given that Mr Hart’s statement was produced in response to the Claimant’s judicial review application and that she was DCS at the material time (and, frankly, very high profile at the time), it is surprising that he had forgotten that she was at this meeting.  His first witness statement merely referred to Cecilia Hitchen “and a number of service managers”. Given that the Claimant subsequently produced her contemporaneous notes of the meeting, Mr Hart has accepted that she was there.  </p>

Inevitably, it has made me look with caution at what Mr Hart has said about this meeting.  As I have said before, and I repeat, it is no part of my task to assess the credibility of any witness and Mr Hart has not had an opportunity to rebut suggestions of inaccuracy about his evidence in relation to the feedback meeting.  Given that all the material observations of the duty room were made by Ms O’Brien and she was also present at the feedback meeting, it is, perhaps, unfortunate that she is currently on a career-break and no evidence has been supplied directly by her. (In the late disclosure by Ofsted she is seen to raise concerns about some matters intended to be put in the report.  Indeed, to be fair to Mr Hart, so did he.)  The principal issue between the Claimant and Mr Hart is the extent to which the “serious concerns” were raised in that way at the meeting.  Her note, whilst reflecting a “level of concern” about “process”, does not reflect a suggestion that the concerns were serious.</p>

Mr Maurici resists the admission of this late evidence and suggests that it is an opportunistic attempt to close a gap in Ofsted’s evidence.  I agree that it could and should have been produced earlier (and, along with other matters, I shall be looking closely at costs issues that arise from matters such as this), but I cannot see any basis for not receiving it in evidence.  Where further and fuller disclosure is given, there can be documents that are both adverse to and supportive of the discloser's case.   To be even-handed I should admit this e-mail.</p>

Mr Maurici says the reason for this e-mail being sent by Mr Hart to Ms Brown on 16 December 2008 is wholly unexplained.  That is not quite correct because, in his third witness statement, Mr Hart says that it was sent in connection with a meeting between Ms Brown and Mr Coughlan that day.

Equally, and for the record, it should be noted that it <span style="text-decoration:underline">does</span> record 3 particular features that were “good”, one concerning the administrative process of dealing with new referrals and another relating to staff training.  Ms Brown makes it clear that judgments made by Ofsted are not made on the basis of a simple arithmetical exercise, but the inference I would draw from a perusal of the RoE entries for the duty room is that they represented a set of observations that raised concerns at a level sufficient for there to be a “feedback” meeting when, during the course of this particular inspection, no feedback was generally intended.  Whether the full seriousness, as it is now contended by Ofsted to have been (“unique in my experience” was how Ms Brown put it in her witness statement), was properly and effectively conveyed to the Claimant (or whether in fact she was so distracted by all the media interest in her that she did not take it fully on board) is an open question, but I do not think it possible to accept that the Claimant and her Deputy would not have seen the meeting as flagging up issues that the inspectors had identified, were interested in and sufficiently concerned about to justify a specific meeting.  I will address later the question of whether this was sufficient to pass the threshold of “fairness” to the Claimant on the assumption that such a threshold needs to be passed.</p>

He said that “there was a fairly muted response to our presentation” and Cecilia Hitchen said that they would go away and have a look at the files so that they could come to a view themselves and feedback to us in due course.  Mr Hart says that there was no further response.  Equally, it has to be said that there is no evidence of Mr Hart (or Ms O’Brien) following this up even though, as will appear in paragraph 238 below, Mr Hart interviewed Cecilia Hitchen the following day.  Mr Hart has said that they raised “seven or eight specific cases … in which we had specifically serious concerns about the quality of the work undertaken with each child [and that they] raised issues such as the timeliness of response to referrals, the nature of that response, and the quality of assessment and decision making, recording and supervision.”  Mr Maurici submits that this does not sit well with a failure to follow up these concerns or with an e-mail from Ms Brown to the Claimant’s assistant the following week (on 26 November) when, subject to one matter, she said that “there is nothing more we are requesting.”  I will return to this more generally later.</p>

There are 8 RoE entries relating to the 16 files audited by the inspectors, some of which appear to overlap to some extent.  The Claimant’s notes of the meeting (which indicated that it took place at about 3 pm) reflect aspects of the entries in the RoE.  According to the RoE, an issue raised was the variable quality of the assessments made on child protection and looked after children (LAC) files, with lack of rigorous analysis or, in some cases, a complete lack of analysis.  This is reflected in the Claimant’s own notes.  The Claimant’s notes do, however, indicate a number of positive comments made.  For example, positive comments were made, according to her note, about the recruitment and training programme for staff, a matter which does appear to be reflected in the RoE although the quality assessment was only put forward as “adequate”.  According to the Claimant’s notes, Ms Brown told the meeting that Haringey “was further down the line than most” in implementing a new IT programme (which I understand to have been the Integrated Children System).  The only comparable reference in the RoE to IT is when the Claimant and her Deputy are recorded as saying that the need to use electronic files and the consequent “filling in of boxes” militates against the process of analysis.  This was attributed to the “capacity” aspect of the “Service Management” Key Judgment (see paragraph 202 above) and given an assessment of “inadequate”.</p>

According to an e-mail disclosed in Ofsted's late disclosure, Ms Featherstone's office had been in touch with Ofsted during the morning in an endeavour to arrange a meeting between her and the inspection team leader.  Also during that day, at about the same time as the duty room feedback meeting was taking place at Haringey, what was entitled as a DCSF/Ofsted “stock-take meeting” took place.  The agenda indicates that amongst the matters proposed to be discussed were the Secretary of State’s “expectations” on “coverage” (which I take to mean the scope of the inspection) and on “publishing” the JAR.  The question of whether there would be a separate “final” report was also on the agenda.  The meeting was attended by senior officials within the DCSF (including Mr Lauener) and a team from Ofsted including Mr Shippam and Mr Pullen.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It appears that the DCSF had by then decided that it wanted Ofsted to include reference to “the Baby P case” in the review and “to include mention in [the] report.”  Apparently, the Ofsted representatives had suggested that they might need a further letter from the Secretary of State to ensure this.  By the following morning the DCSF had confirmed a strong feeling “that the report should make specific comment on the Baby P case … although we recognise that it is not your usual practice to comment on specific cases.”  The e-mail continued that “it seems justified here, given the circumstances of this case.”  The final observation was in these terms:  “And we do not think that a further letter is needed.”  That e-mail was followed later in the day by a conversation between David Bell and a representative of Ofsted and then a further conversation between Mr Bell and Ms Gilbert.  Mr Bell referred to this conversation in an e-mail to Ms Pugh later in the evening of 19 November in the following terms:</p>

I can’t help feeling that the weight of negative evidence will be so great that Sharon will be compelled to resign or the Council will force her to go.

In an interview with <span style="font-style:italic">The Guardian</span> on 6 December Ms Gilbert was reported as saying to say that “[by] the second day the inspectors were saying the things they were finding were really inadequate … there seemed to be a catalogue of concerns” which confirms this conclusion.   She repeated this in her evidence before the House of Commons Committee on 10 December.  It has to be said that it reflects also the sense that Dr O’Donovan and Mr Young had obtained from their presence “on the ground” at Haringey (see paragraphs 190-197 above).</p>

It was to the effect that the DCSF was “looking for closure” with the possibility of the taking over of the service by a new team or the service of an improvement notice.  Neither Ms Pugh nor Dr O’Donovan make reference to this meeting in their witness statements and I have no witness statements from Councillors Meehan and Santry.  However, the suggestion of a team being sent in to “take over” the Department is something that was reflected in press reports of the previous day or so and thus adds credence to the Claimant’s recollection.</p>

She is well aware that audits have revealed competency issues and although some action has been taken against some staff who are unfit to practice (two she thinks), others are still employed (no details of any increased supervisory/monitoring offered) as the recent high profile case has meant that replacement staff are not in place.  Recent interviews for new permanent team managers and social workers cancelled when all applicants withdrew or failed to show up.  <span style="font-weight:bold">Issue here is that DDCS is condoning the retention of staff who she has decided to release or commence competency processes without being able to explicit about the actions she is taking to oversee their practice.”</span></p>

These interviews would have appeared to have reflected the Secretary of State’s expectation, expressed in a letter to Ms Featherstone MP dated that day, when he said that he understood that Ofsted would interview persons named in ss. 18 and 19 of the Children’s Act 2004 (the DCS and the Lead Member for children’s services) “and consider how effectively they are discharging their responsibilities”.

Ms Miriam Rosen is Director of Education at Ofsted and effectively Ms Gilbert's Deputy.  Although no Minute or other documentation associated with the meeting emanating from the DCSF is before me (Ms Pugh was apparently not present) notes taken by Mr Pullen indicate a number of things.  First, there is a note to the effect that the Secretary of State wanted “closure on the public debate”, an approach reflecting that apparently taken by Ms Hughes at the meeting with representatives of Haringey on 18 November (see paragraph 237 above).  Second, it appeared that David Bell had requested in a telephone conversation with Ms Rosen that the report should be “clear in its judgments and attribution of responsibility” and that he wanted “definitive evidence on which the Minister can act”.  Third, it appeared to be agreed that Ofsted would make no reference to the names of the 38 LSCB areas whose SCRs had been assessed as “inadequate”.  Fourth, it appears that the preference of Ofsted was that Haringey should receive the report at the same time as the Secretary of State.  </p>

There is a dispute about what was said and Mr Maurici has made a forceful submission that it is not possible to tell from the RoE entries how the issues were raised.  Without that, he submits, it is not possible to know whether the “concerns” that were eventually reflected in the report had been sufficiently ventilated with the Claimant to make the process “fair”. I will be returning later to consider the evidence on the issue of whether the gist of the concerns were communicated during the interviews on the continued assumption, for this purpose, that such an obligation rested upon Ofsted.  One conclusion I can foreshadow now is the obvious proposition that the Claimant must have known that her actions as Chair of the LSCB and as DCS would be under intense scrutiny, and it would, accordingly, be necessary for her to make sure that she made her viewpoint clear to the inspectors.  The Ministerial Statement to which I referred in paragraph 142 above makes clear that the review would include “rigorous scrutiny of … the effectiveness of management practice and performance management systems in all relevant agencies.”  That the intense pressure, including the media pressure, that she was under may have diminished her capacity to do so effectively is a matter that may fall to be considered in other contexts.</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“ … Ofsted did not regard the judgements reached in this case as marginal, or finely balanced. In this case, the evidence of inadequate safeguarding practice was overwhelmingly strong.  The quality of practice that we witnessed in Haringey ranks as the worst that I have seen in the 15 JARs I have undertaken.  Usually in an inspection one sees files where good and safe practice is demonstrated.  We did not see such practice in the overall assessment and care planning for children and young people in any of the 63 individual case files that we reviewed and found only a single example of good practice …”.</p>

However, on the evidence before me there can be no other conclusion but that (subject to certain specific matters about which views differed) this <span style="text-decoration:underline">was</span> plainly the collective judgment of the inspectors.  Leaving aside the issue of whether the process thus far was “fair” to the Claimant (on the assumption that an obligation of fairness to the Claimant was required on the part of Ofsted), I think it is an irresistible conclusion that the views of the inspection team would not have been altered by anything they saw or received subsequently even though some further documentation had been requested from Haringey.  Ms Brown said that “the additional material we considered only served to triangulate the concerns that had arisen during the course of the fieldwork.”    I am a little troubled by the comment she made that “many of our requests [for further information] were never answered … [most notably] in relation to the cases that we had raised following the duty-room observation” because, as I have observed previously, one might have expected a documented follow-up request if this was perceived to be so important.  There is no evidence of any such follow-up request and the e-mail of 26 November (see paragraph 224 above) said that “there is nothing more we are requesting.”   However, this is all probably a function of the speed with which the inspection was carried out and of the perception at that stage that it was interim in nature. </p>

According to Ms Pugh, she said that the inspectors had just left and that they had gone about their work very professionally.  Ms Pugh said she made no complaint about the JAR process.  The Claimant does not dispute the terms of this conversation, but understandably points out that any comments she made about the inspection team or the process were made in the context of her understanding at the time, namely, that the inspection was an interim review only.  That, as I have indicated, was also Ms Brown’s perception at the time she left Haringey’s offices that day even though by then she had formed the view that the children’s service was “inadequate”.</p>

In the event of an “inadequate” finding by Ofsted, five main options were identified, one of which was the replacement of the “DCS and/or 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> and some 3rd tier managers”.

It is not clear whether this was the view that officials had formed with a view to its recommendation to the Secretary of State or whether it was the Secretary of State’s own view.  Whatever the position, provisional plans were put in hand to ensure a state of preparedness if this eventuality should occur.  The Secretary of State personally saw Mr Graham Badman (then DCS with Kent County Council) on 26 November to see if he would be willing to take up the post on an interim basis if the findings were negative.  He was not prepared to do so, but Mr Coughlan was so prepared on a short term basis.</p>

It certainly was prompted by that, but Ms Brown had plainly sent on the morning of 24 November a detailed list of documents she and her colleagues wished to see.  Ms Brown has explained the e-mail on the basis that it “did not state that there was no information outstanding, but simply indicated that we were not making any further requests for information.”</p>

The “written confirmation of the list of further information” referred to in her e-mail to the Claimant referred to in paragraph 256 above was disclosed in the further disclosure of Ofsted.  It appears largely to seek statistical information as at 21 November 2008 of, for example, the number of children and young persons subject to child protection plans, the number of ‘looked after children’, the social care staff vacancies and the number of agency staff (including social care staff turnover figures for the previous six months) and so on.

It was dealing with events of some six months earlier which themselves must have been uniquely challenging for Ms Brown (and for her other colleagues from Ofsted).  It is, for example, clear that during the inspection and until the final report was effectively “signed off” on 1 December, Ms Brown in particular was working extremely long hours and probably getting very limited sleep (see paragraph 487 below).  She said in that witness statement that she was unaware of any complaints that the Claimant had about the inspection or the report until the judicial review proceedings were commenced.  If that is correct, it would not have been until March or April last year that she would have been invited to start trying to recall the precise circumstances again.  Even with the availability of every piece of paper and every electronic communication generated during the period of the inspection and the drafting of the report, it would be surprising if every single sentence of a witness statement of that length would have been completely accurate.  Despite the fact that a Statement of Truth was applied to the witness statement, the fact that something in it has been shown to be wrong does not necessarily make the statement dishonest in that respect.</p>

I have already made plain that, given that I have not had the opportunity of assessing any witness in this case and no witness has been cross-examined, I cannot possibly draw conclusions of that nature about anyone.  The same, I should add, applies to what I perceive to be Mr Ward’s attack on the Claimant’s credibility in relation to the issue of whether ‘the Baby P case’ was discussed during the inspection.  It applies also to Mr Maurici’s assertion that the evidence of Mr Pullen that he had a “quality assurance role” only in relation to the drafting of the report and the evidence of Mr Shippam that his “editorial work” did not involve “material changes to judgments” were “patently untrue”.</p>

If (which seems unlikely) she had to hand the e-mail exchanges during the report-writing stage of the process that have now been revealed when she composed the witness statement, I doubt that she would have used that expression because it is plain that a number of people (including, of course, the other inspectors who were part of the inspection team) made their own contributions to the drafting.  She was undoubtedly (as Lead Inspector) the initial primary drafter of the report and collected and collated the contributions of everyone else.  Furthermore, she was the person who made the changes requested by Haringey at the meeting on 1 December 2008 using her laptop to do so.  So she was, as it were, there at the beginning and there at the end of the process.  But plainly others played a part in the production of the final draft.

I regarded that role as falling to me as the Chief Executive in relation to the meeting with the Secretary of State. I considered that the meeting with Ofsted was likely to be a meeting to check the accuracy of the report, rather than an exercise involving a line by line assessment of its validity. I decided that it was not necessary or appropriate for [the Claimant] to be present. I took two senior officers for that purpose, one from CYPS and the Council's link officer for the inspection. Both officers had been closely involved in the inspection and were familiar with matters that had been raised in questions and interviews during its conduct. They did not attend the meeting with the Secretary of State. I would add that I was genuinely worried about [the Claimant’s] health and safety and had already advised her to remain outside London on 1 December. I judged that attending such a meeting was likely to be highly emotional and very stressful for her as head of the safeguarding service.

Mr Maurici has suggested that it has been very unfair to rely upon that text message against the background of what had occurred that day.  Doubtless that would be a matter of debate amongst those who have knowledge of this case.  It is not something upon which I express any view.  However, since this is a judgment that may be read widely, it is right that the Claimant’s account of how the text message came to be sent is recorded for anyone reading the judgment to see:</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“There were press outside my flat when I got home (I came past in a cab) and so I had to wait in a nearby café until late before going in. During that wait I did send the text message to Ms Brown …. It was sent late in the evening from the café where I had sought refuge until the press had left my flat. I was exhausted and had endured the delivery of a petition said to be signed by 1.4 million people to Downing Street who wanted rid of me. I had been chased that morning by TV cameras and it was then that the most often used piece of film of me was taken. By then I had had a death threat and police secured my windows and gave me advice about my safety. That threat had focussed on my daughter and she had left London. I had extra smoke alarms fitted above the door to my flat and a cage lined in foil fixed over the letterbox to catch any burning material that might be put through it. The police set up an arrangement whereby I could get an instant police response if I needed it. I was being recognised on the tube and was photographed on the bus. Given the context in which the inspection took place I expected the report to contain some criticism but I knew that it would not mention me or focus on me or anyone else because JAR reports did not mention individuals as a rule and Phil Pullen had told me that this report would be no exception …. I was trying to elicit some kind of response by sending the text message. Although by now I was very afraid for my safety on London's streets I was coping well with the pressure. I am a very resilient person ….”</p>

That was emerging clearly fairly early the previous week.  To that extent the text message adds little to the evidence.  Whether the message itself makes comfortable reading for some of those engaged in the events of the time is a matter only they can answer.</p>

Ms Brown said that it had been "clear that [the Claimant] has been under massive emotional pressure and distress due to the intrusive media coverage of her personal and work life."  She went on to say that she was "very concerned for [her] emotional state".  There is no evidence before me that these concerns (apparently shared by others in the inspection team) were passed to the Secretary of State on the following Monday morning.</p>

Since that is so, nothing that was said the following day in truth made any difference to the decision made even if, as recommended practice required, the Secretary of State was obliged to say to the Council that he was “minded to” take certain action before finally resolving to take that action (see paragraph 500).  I will have to refer to some of the things said by the Ofsted representatives to the Secretary of State, but, as I have said, the clear inference is that those things did not influence the decision made by the Secretary of State.  </p>

Ms Brown confirmed in her second witness statement that whilst all of the findings contained in the Report contributed to the overall conclusion appearing under the heading ‘Summary judgement<span style="font-weight:bold">’</span>, some carried more weight than others.  The key issues that carried the greatest weight in the assessment, she said, were those that impacted most directly on the safety of children.  These are reflected in the bullet points that constitute the “main findings” of the inspection, although these bullet points, she emphasised, are general to <span style="text-decoration:underline">all</span> agencies, not simply to Haringey.</p>

Ms Pugh took notes and they have been typed up subsequently.  It appears that Ms Gilbert and Ms Brown developed themes appearing in the report.  Mr Maurici submits that they went further than what had been included in the report.  He says, correctly, that it is Ofsted’s case that the inspection was not an inquiry into the conduct of a specific individual – or even a single agency – and that is not the practice to name anyone in a report.  Indeed the report does not do so.  Yet the notes reveal that comments were made directly about the Claimant.  It appears from the notes that Ms Brown said that she (the Claimant) had engaged in a lot of ‘finger-pointing’ at her Deputy (Cecilia Hitchen) and that Ms Gilbert had observed that “the DCS has got no grip and relied on No 2 who couldn’t hack it.”  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">If this was the way things were said at this meeting then I am bound to say it was unfortunate.  Whether the observations were justified intrinsically or not, it might, with hindsight, have been better simply to allow the report to speak for itself, certainly if the Claimant had not had a fair opportunity of answering what could be taken as directly critical comments of her.  Nor, for that matter, did Ms Hitchen whose professional qualifications and experience as a social worker, and whose expressed concerns to Mr Hart about attracting permanent staff (a problem plainly not unique to Haringey), were dismissed in the expression that “she couldn’t hack it”.  It is, I am bound to say, also unattractive to use the expression “finger-pointing” (on the assumption that it was used) when the discussion with the Claimant presumably giving rise to the comment was deliberately designed to be “open ... in which [she was] encouraged to share her views with us”:  see paragraph 238 of Ms Brown’s first witness statement.  Mr Maurici was also entitled to say that Ms Ryan’s handwritten notes of that discussion (revealed as part of the late disclosure by Ofsted) did not really justify the assertion that the Claimant was trying to blame Ms Hitchen for any failings in the Children’s Department that there may have been.  The only entry in the RoE that reflects on this is a record made by, I believe, Ms Ryan of the conversation between Ms Brown, Ms Ryan and the Claimant when the Claimant was interviewed as DCS when it is recorded that that she held regular meetings with the Deputy Director “but finds a lack of openness in sharing information, particularly about interpretation of the [performance indicators] … [against] quality of practice on the ground.”   It is also recorded that the Deputy Director was “fiercely protective of her team”.  This seems a slender basis for using an expression such as “finger-pointing”.  At all events, Mr Maurici says that the comments referred to in paragraph 291 above were apparently used to justify something said by the Secretary of State in his press statement later (see paragraph 303).  That is probably correct, but I am not satisfied that it takes his legal case on the Claimant’s behalf any further.  As I have said, the decision of the Secretary of State to act as he did was almost certainly taken the day before.  It is true, of course, that he could have changed his mind, but I think that that would be a fanciful suggestion in the circumstances.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">If anything was said at the meeting that would have reinforced the decision already made, it was Ofsted’s opinion that Haringey was “exceptionally bad” in the nature of “management and systemic failing.”  Whilst that comment would have reflected on the Claimant since she was head of the team, it would have reflected on others and indeed the whole system in place.  As I have said before, it is not for me to assess whether such a judgment was correct or not.  On the assumption that it was an honest assessment and, to the extent that the Secretary of State relied upon it, he would not have been misled.  However, its influence was, in my view, tangential.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The (as yet still) draft report was shown to the Haringey representatives after the meeting with the Secretary of State had concluded.  According to Ms Brown's first witness statement, Mr Shippam and Ms Rosen met those attending from Haringey at about 10.00 am and she and Ms Gilbert joined at about 11.00 am.  Although the outcome of this meeting would have had no direct bearing on the Secretary of State’s decision, there is one general aspect of it that is criticised on the Claimant’s behalf in relation to her case against Haringey and one more particular feature of what occurred (revealed following the further disclosure from Ofsted) that she asserts was unfair.  As to the general matter, it is suggested that Haringey did not take anyone who could check the report for factual accuracy which, according to an e-mail evidencing a telephone conversation between Mr Lauener and Dr O’Donovan on 28 November, was apparently intended.  Dr O’Donovan asserts that she took two senior officers with her, one from the CYPS, the other being the person who had acted as link officer for the inspection, both of whom, she says, “had been closely involved in the inspection and were familiar with matters that had been raised in questions and interviews during its conduct.”  I understand these people to have been Sharon Kemp (see paragraph 185 above) and Jan Doust, who held a senior post in the CYPS.  The Claimant says that Ms Doust did not work within social care and would not have had the knowledge to make any meaningful comment on the draft report.</p>

The extent to which this consideration ought to have had a bearing on the disciplinary hearings conducted by the Council later in the chronology is something to which I will return.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As to the more specific matter concerning this meeting, I will be referring to it again later (see paragraph 428).  However, it is convenient to mention it now.  Ms Brown says that they "had a very open discussion" about the draft report and recalled two concerns being raised, the first concerning the reference to the Climbié Report which was said by those present to be “inflammatory”.  She said they were asked to remove it but "refused to do so as we considered the failings in this regard to be very important".  The second, she said, arose from Dr O'Donovan and the elected members querying whether they "could be expected to intervene in the work of staff and managers at HCCS."  Ms Brown said that, in their view, it was critical that they provided such challenge.  She went on to say that as a result of comments made "we agreed to make some minor changes to the wording of the Report."  As will become apparent in due course, it has emerged that that involved a change from the suggestion that appeared in the draft report that "<span style="text-decoration:underline">members</span> and senior officers ... [failed] to ensure full compliance with some requirements of the Climbié Inquiry recommendations" (my emphasis) to the finding that there was "a <span style="text-decoration:underline">managerial</span> failure to ensure full compliance with some requirements of the inquiry into the death of Victoria Climbié ..." (my emphasis again).  In other words, the blame for any failure to comply with aspects of the Victoria Climbié Inquiry recommendations was shifted from a combined failure on the part of members of the Council <span style="text-decoration:underline">and</span> officers to an entirely managerial failure.  The shift of blame is not, of course, directed solely at the Claimant, but she was head of the management team and would have been identified as one of those responsible for the "managerial failure".</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I make absolutely no comment on whether the general assertion as to a failure along these lines was or was not justified: that is not my concern in these proceedings.  However, given the sensitive nature of any such assertion, it can hardly be said to be fair for an alteration of this nature to be made at the behest of a member or members of the Council (and thus an alteration in <span style="text-decoration:underline">their</span> interests) when no member of the management team upon whom the blame was thus sought to be placed was present, or had any opportunity, to refute the suggestion of sole managerial responsibility.  I shall be returning to this matter when considering the issue of whether the gist of Ofsted's concerns were ventilated with the Claimant, but I do not think this kind of alteration to the draft report can be characterised as a "minor [change] to the wording": it is a substantive change to a critical comment on a very sensitive matter.  Given that, in due course, Haringey dismissed the Claimant (and, possibly, others) on the basis of management shortcomings revealed in the report (see paragraphs 334 and 361), it is arguably of concern that agreement to an alteration of this nature should have occurred.  Dr O'Donovan, who had been at the meeting with Ms Brown, had not mentioned this matter in her witness statement so that the precise nature of the change made was not revealed until disclosed by Ofsted.</p>

He said that he was not going to argue and “was on the same page as the Government.”  The Secretary of State indicated what he was "minded" to do.  </p>

Whether the opinion represented the reality of the position within Haringey or not (and again it is not for me to say), it is unfortunate (and, one has to say, intrinsically unfair) that it was repeated in such a public setting without the Claimant, or indeed her Deputy, having had a full and fair opportunity to refute it.  It went to their respective abilities and competence.   Indeed it was a public comment such as this, taken along with comments about "fitness for office", that is arguably more likely to have affected the future careers of the Claimant and her Deputy than the actual decision to replace them because of weaknesses found in the system within Haringey for which they held ultimate responsibility. </p>

I have removed the … that official from her post, from her statutory responsibilities, and I’ve directed the replacement of a new person to go in and take over those responsibilities.  The employment relationship, as you know, is for Haringey, and that’s something I know they will considering this afternoon and immediately.  There is a precedent for this to happen.  But these are obviously powers which you only use in the last resort, and you use them with care because they are strong powers.  But in this case I judged it was the right thing to do.  You’ll know that there have been a number of interventions in different local authorities around the country over the past decade or so.  I don’t know that there’s been one done in this way.  I’m confident that we’ve never, ever directed a change in the local safeguarding board chair, the … effectively the chair of the board, if you like.  And to be honest, having seen this report today, independent of any personnel changes which have been made, I think that I would have decided that intervention and direction now and in the coming months was the right thing to do in Haringey.  But, you know, in terms of particular people, we are where we are.</p>

It’s not my role; I don’t have the power to do that.  But what I do have the power to do is intervene and remove somebody who I judge not fit to hold an office, to be removed from office, and that’s what I have done, and I have directed a new director of children’s services to go in.

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“78.<marker name="tab"/>The Secretary of State judged that the issues of public confidence in safeguarding in Haringey required action to be taken with the utmost urgency.  This is explicitly set out in the Secretary of State’s letter to Haringey on 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> December, namely <span style="font-style:italic">“given the seriousness of the report and the need to restore public confidence in Haringey’s children’s services, it is clear that a robust solution needs to be implemented urgently in Haringey. I have concluded this must involve appointing a new statutory post holder of Director of Children’s Services.” </span>The level of public concern following the verdict in the trial of Baby P on 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2008 was overwhelming and unprecedented.  This went far beyond the saturation coverage in the media over many weeks. While this undoubtedly fuelled public reaction, it also very clearly reflected the public’s deeply felt shock and anger at what had taken place in Haringey.</p>

	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">79.<marker name="tab"/>This public concern manifested itself not only in the headlines of newspapers (of all kinds) but also in around 1,400 letters and e-mails received by No. 10 and the Department between 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November and 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> December 2008 alone.  In addition, there were an unusual number of calls for Parliamentary debates and numerous Parliamentary Questions were asked<span style="font-style:italic">.</span>  There were calls from Opposition politicians and commentators for a public inquiry as well as calls for dismissals and resignations.  There were also clear public safety issues.  Media frenzy there certainly was but this was mirrored by public outrage, at times manifested in a ‘lynch mob’ mentality with social workers up and down the country – quite unconnected with Haringey – being subject to random abuse and in extreme cases physical threats.  Frontline social workers, on whom children at risk of harm depend day to day, were being vilified and scapegoated.  Ministers and officials believed that there was an absolute imperative to restore public confidence quickly before the wider system became destabilised with the safety of more children put under threat as a result.  It was to meet this imperative that the Secretary of State made his various statements to Parliament and to the press, and gave numerous interviews to the media.  He also wrote an article which was published in the Sun on 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2008.  The Sun had been particularly active in voicing public concern, reflected in the petition of 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November, so it was natural that the Secretary of State should try to calm the public outcry by writing in the same paper.  However, it is certainly not true that the Secretary of State’s decision to make his Direction of 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> December was a response to the calls from that paper, as alleged at paragraph 47 of the Claimant’s grounds.</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">82.<marker name="tab"/>Given the strong public criticism of social workers following the Baby P trial, and, with recruitment and retention issues in the sector already severe, there was a very real danger of the entire system being propelled into crisis through a wider undermining of social workers’ confidence and morale which could have exacerbated existing recruitment and retention difficulties. There was also the threat – to some extent realised – of spiralling numbers of referrals as the system tipped in to risk-averse behaviour.  It was crucial, not just for the safety of children in Haringey, but for the protection of children across the country, to act quickly.”</p>

He also criticizes what was apparently said by her in a supplementary answer to a member of the press when she said the Claimant would not receive a "pay-off".  I do not understand Dr O’Donovan to dispute that she gave an answer broadly to this effect (although not precisely in the words quoted). I have not been shown a transcript of the press conference, but a press report in <span style="font-style:italic">The Evening Standard</span> on the following day records the Chief Executive as having “yesterday insisted that there would be no compensation package” for the Claimant. There is also a press report in the material before me suggesting that the “acting Haringey Council chief said she ‘did not expect there to be packages’”.  At all events, it would appear that there were at very least strong hints made either by Dr O’Donovan or Councillor Reith or both that there would be no “pay-off”.  Councillor Reith expressly acknowledged “the failings in our service identified in the report”, a further matter upon which Mr Maurici relies to suggest that she should not have been on the Panel of 8 December (see paragraph 322 <span style="font-style:italic">et seq</span> below).</p>

It is said on behalf of Haringey that the Claimant did not object to this suggestion.  That is undoubtedly true.  However, it is also true that she had virtually no practical opportunity to take informed and considered legal advice about the position.  When the background to an important hearing such as a dismissal hearing is itself complicated (by, for example, concerns about the “evidence base” underlying the management’s case and the need to provide the employee with an opportunity to prepare to meet that case), an extension, rather than an abridgement, of the usual period would normally be considered “fair” procedure.</p>

Furthermore, there is no reference to it in Mr Young's first witness statement.  No reference was made to it either before or in the disciplinary and appeal hearings conducted by Haringey.  It came to light only within the initial disclosure made by Ofsted in these proceedings.  I am surprised that that should have been so: it could have been important that the Claimant knew about it before the disciplinary hearings and it was certainly relevant to the general issue raised in this application of the fairness of the procedures adopted by the Council in its disciplinary hearings.  Dr O’Donovan makes reference to it in her witness statement of 1 October, but by the time her statement came to be prepared the letter had been disclosed by Ofsted.  Dr O’Donovan had received a response to the letter (which, as can be seen, was e-mailed to Ms Brown) on behalf of Ms Gilbert to whom the request had been referred.  The reply was sent on 4 December on Ms Gilbert’s behalf by Keryn Bell, but was signed ‘Christine’, and was in these terms:</p>

As I understand Mr Young’s witness statements, his view that an investigation was not required did not arise from the receipt of Ms Gilbert’s e-mail, but as a result of “further reflection” on his part after he had sent his letter.</p>

In an interview with <span style="font-style:italic">The Guardian</span> reported on 6 December (and taken up by other newspapers) she was reported as suggesting that the favourable Ofsted review in 2007 (see paragraph 85 above) was achieved by Haringey as a result of the provision of “inaccurate data” to Ofsted by “managers in Haringey”, a claim, incidentally, reported to be have been challenged subsequently by the Chairman of SOLACE (the Society of Local Authority Chief Executives and Senior Managers) and for which, it appears, the evidence to back it up had been destroyed.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In the week before the disciplinary hearing the Claimant was, as I have indicated, effectively housebound until the Saturday.  She had no ready access to any legal advice during that week, although one thing she said at the hearing suggests she had made some preliminary contact with “lawyers”.  The circumstances were plainly not conducive to obtaining informed legal advice and when she attended the hearing on the Monday she was accompanied by Mr Richard Penn.  Mr Penn had, I understand, had a lengthy career in local government, had served as a Chief Executive in two large borough councils and, following his retirement from active local government work, had become a freelance consultant on employment issues for Chief Executives and Senior Managers and who had worked both for SOLACE and ALACE (the Association of Local Authority Chief Executives). Whilst I have no doubt Mr Penn would have provided admirable support for the Claimant, he was not a lawyer and would not have been able to deploy effectively any legal submissions about her contractual position with the Council that might have been deployed and would have been in no position to advance a significant challenge to the management’s position.  In fact, according to the transcript of the hearing which is with the papers before the court, he played little, if any, part in the proceedings.  It is noticeable that Mr Young in his letters to the Claimant made frequent reference to the fact that she had been “represented” by Mr Penn, but this is certainly not the impression given by the transcript. It is right to say that the management side was not represented by a lawyer either, but the panel of Councillors had available to them a legal adviser.</p>

I should also say that, although she spoke at some length, it is not clear what access she had had to any papers concerning management issues at Haringey.

It appears from the final paragraph of his letter (which is not reproduced here) that she “expressed a desire to appeal as soon as possible” and indeed 15 December (less than a week later) had provisionally been agreed.  In other words, it looks as though she indicated immediately a desire to appeal and certainly well within the 10-day period apparently set by the Council’s disciplinary procedures.   I am unsure, in those circumstances, why Ms Simler suggested that “there was all likelihood in the circumstances of this case that she would not [appeal]” and that she did not do so until shortly before 22 December.  On that date Mr Clifford Hart, the Haringey Committees Manager, wrote to the Claimant indicating formally that the appeal had been set for some dates in early January as arranged with her representatives.  By then Mr Tony Child (see paragraph 349 below) had been instructed to represent her.  I do not see any evidence of any reluctance on her part to appeal.</p>

He submits that this represents another piece of evidence indicating a pre-determined outcome of the internal processes at Haringey or at least the appearance of a pre-determined outcome.  It will be noted that the Panel expressly said that it “took no account of the statement by the Chief Executive at the Press Conference on 1st December 2008 in reaching its decision”, presumably because it was felt that it gave an appearance that the issue had been pre-determined.  No reference was made at the hearing to anything said by Councillor Reith at the Press Conference (see paragraphs 313-315 above). </p>

Mr Pullen’s notes were disclosed on 8 September 2009 and a typed version of notes taken by Mr Young was disclosed by way of being exhibited to his witness statement of 1 October 2009.

Mr Pullen has recorded the words “anything that firms up case” and Mr Coughlan is credited in the note with mentioning “detailed evidence behind findings”.  According to Mr Pullen’s note, Ms Brown indicates that she is aware that they wanted “feedback on managers and frontline workers.”  The note indicates that the representatives of Haringey at the meeting were asking whether there was anything beyond the general statement that appeared in the report to the effect that the strategic leadership was inadequate.  There was, according to the notes, a discussion about the relationship of the Deputy Director with the Claimant and of other management issues.</p>

The notes would suggest that this remained the position on 10 December, even though the Claimant’s dismissal had already been decided upon (subject, of course, to the outcome of any appeal), but equally the disciplinary process relating to others who had been suspended had not then taken place.  </p>

Indeed it is clear from some aspects of the subsequent disclosure by Ofsted that Ms Brown thought that this was Haringey's essential motive too.  As I say, I remain surprised that the letter, the response and this meeting were not revealed in Haringey’s evidence at an earlier stage in these proceedings.</p>

As far as I can judge, nothing that was said by Ofsted at the meeting was used as part of the case against the Claimant at the Appeal hearing.  The relevance of the meeting is much more to do with the strength of Haringey’s position vis-à-vis the Claimant in the context of the termination of her contract of employment.</p>

Perhaps not surprisingly in the circumstances, it does not appear that she revealed them to Haringey when she attended this meeting either.  Nor, of course, would anyone at Haringey at that time have appreciated the process by which the final form of the report was arrived at.  It is possible (and I deliberately put it no higher than that) that they might not have been quite so confident in their decision to accept some aspects of the report without question and quite so confident in their decision to dismiss the Claimant (and others) without compensation had they known of the problems with the inspection and the process by which the final report assumed the form it did.  They were, on my interpretation of the evidence, trying to find out why the Ofsted inspection came to the conclusions it did (particularly since all the previous Ofsted evaluations had been essentially positive), but were denied that knowledge.  </p>

He said that “firstly and primarily” the ground for dismissal was the Secretary of State’s directions which made the Claimant’s “continued employment … in the role of Director untenable.”  Second, and he said “very much a secondary part of it”, was that paragraph 7 of the Ofsted report (see paragraph 288 above) “in its totality calls into question the management of the service … [and was such as to] undermine the relationship of trust and confidence that the Council would ordinarily expect to have with [the Claimant] as an employee in the role of Director.”</p>

Well, first of all, they didn’t have to, the Council weren’t directed to dismiss her - they were directed to appoint someone else as interim director.  That may have meant that her position may have to be considered, but it could have been considered in a number of ways.  Were there any functions of her post which weren’t being assigned to the new director, she had been working in tandem with the new director since the 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November.  Could that arrangement have continued given her managerial skills, which had been successfully and generally favourably commented on in relation to education?

The only party to raise the point before me is Haringey.  Ms Simler has submitted, as I understood her, that since what the Claimant is effectively challenging so far as Haringey is concerned is reliance upon matters that occurred on 1 December 2008, the 3-month period within which claims should normally be brought should run from then.  Alternatively, she argued that if the Claimant was justified in waiting until the hearing of 8 December, the delay from then until 6 March was not justified.</p>

If forced to make a decision on the issue, I would have said that the Claimant was entitled to await the outcome of the appeal hearing in January 2009 before instituting judicial review proceedings against Haringey.  To fail to have done this would have run the risk of Haringey arguing that she had not exhausted all other remedies before instituting judicial review proceedings.  But there can be no doubt that, through Mr Child, she was trying to put in place funding to bring this claim and Haringey was aware that Mr Child was waiting for a full transcript of the appeal hearing which was not made available in draft form until 2 March.</p>

I imagine that this is at least in part why it is accepted on the Secretary of State’s behalf that some degree of fairness ought, in principle, to be required in circumstances such as those that have arisen in this case.  The issue seems to be the extent of the obligation to act fairly, whether it was achieved in practice and if, for any reason, the process fell short of what was required, whether it would have made any difference to the outcome if a higher degree of fairness to the Claimant had been shown.  </p>

He relies on <span style="font-style:italic">Ridge v Baldwin</span> [1964] AC 40, <span style="font-style:italic">Malloch v Aberdeen Corporation</span> [1971] 1 WLR 1578 and <span style="font-style:italic">McLaughlin v The Governor of the Cayman Islands</span> [2007] 1 WLR 2839, in particular.  He does not suggest that the Claimant should necessarily have been given the opportunity to make oral representations to the Secretary of State, but that she should have had “some opportunity” to state her position before he made his adverse decision about her position.  Mr Maurici says this is particularly important where the decision affects the livelihood of the individual concerned and may, as is suggested here, result in the person never working again.   In this case the Secretary of State relied on the Ofsted report to remove the Claimant from her office, a report which she had no opportunity to comment upon or endeavour to refute before the decision was made and announced.  On any analysis, Mr Maurici submits, that is unfair.</p>

(2) The standards of fairness are not immutable. They may change with the passage of time, both in the general and in their application to decisions of a particular type. (3) The principles of fairness are not to be applied by rote identically in every situation. What fairness demands is dependent on the context of the decision, and this is to be taken into account in all its aspects. (4) An essential feature of the context is the statute which creates the discretion, as regards both its language and the shape of the legal and administrative system within which the decision is taken. (5) Fairness will very often require that a person who may be adversely affected by the decision will have an opportunity to make representations on his own behalf either before the decision is taken with a view to producing a favourable result; or after it is taken, with a view to procuring its modification; or both. (6) Since the person affected usually cannot make worthwhile representations without knowing what factors may weigh against his interests fairness will very often require that he is informed of the gist of the case which he has to answer.”</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In deciding what the principle of fairness demanded in this case, Mr Eadie makes a strong plea for attention to be given to the context of the legislation that underlies the material events and to the context in which the process that led to the Secretary of State’s directions operated.  The legislative context involves to a very significant degree the “safeguarding” of children, the children in question being a particularly vulnerable group because of the risk of harm to which they are potentially exposed.  The legislative context is, of course, a national one.  However, he makes the point that the impetus for the reforms that led to that national legislative context came from events within Haringey itself.  Given the serious past failings in relation to child protection within the Borough, and given the rationale for the appointment of a DCS as involving responsibility and accountability for the improvement of those services, he submits in effect that the need for fairness in the urgent situation confronting the Secretary of State should not be judged by reference to what might be termed the standard requirements of fairness demanded in a normal disciplinary process.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This submission has a compelling aspect to it, though it is important not to be wholly seduced by it.  In all these matters, it is a question of balancing the competing considerations, interests and rights.  It is very difficult, if not impossible, to envisage any circumstances in which the right of an individual to be treated fairly would take precedence over, or should delay, an urgent decision concerning the interests of a large number of vulnerable children who may be exposed to the risk of significant injury or death, particularly if the decision is perceived to affect not just children in a particular locality, but nationwide.  Although Mr Eadie did not contend for the approach of “shoot first, ask questions later” in relation to decisions of this nature, taken to its logical conclusion the submission could amount to that.  Since that was not the argument, I do not have to address it in that way.  However, if in this situation an individual is deprived of some of the ordinary notions of fairness in the process that leads to his or her removal from a particular position, it should not necessarily mean that the individual is, or should be, deprived of his or her reputation or his or her other contractual or statutory rights.  It is always possible for the decision-maker to make it clear that the decision had to be taken in the wider public interest and that it did not necessarily reflect anything adverse about the individual’s competence or professionalism.  Equally, the opportunity to redress the balance may arise in other ways, more often than not outside any litigious process.  Finally, it is open to an individual affected in this way to seek a declaration from the court that the process was unfair even if, ultimately, such a declaration cannot “put the clock back”.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgment, it is not possible to draw many analogies between the process that was applied in this case and a normal disciplinary process where matters can usually be taken with less expedition.  Dealing with the child protection services in Haringey was perceived by the Secretary of State to be a major and urgent concern, not merely from the point of view of child protection in Haringey itself, but also in a nationwide context given the overwhelming public concern arising from the outcome of ‘the Baby P case’.  That judgment was pre-eminently a matter for the Secretary of State and is not, strictly speaking, for the court to evaluate.  I would, however, merely observe that it would be difficult to see how anyone could argue to the contrary.  Looking at the more local context of Haringey itself, there were, as I have observed previously, about 200 other children on the child protection register at the time and the SCR about Peter’s case, produced under the LSCB of which the Claimant was Chair, revealed some important issues that needed addressing in any event.  The need to address the way the services in Haringey were organised was going to arise irrespective of any media campaign or public outcry after the verdicts in Peter’s case.  That the intense public reaction may have hastened the process somewhat is, in one sense, neither here nor there:  the issue had to be addressed and addressed quickly.  If another death occurred whilst prolonged investigations took place, anyone who was responsible for prolonging the investigatory process would be blamed (or would blame themselves) for contributing to another tragedy.  It follows that there was nothing irrational about a truncated investigation and, logically, nothing wrong about being less concerned about the principle of fairness to individuals than in other cases.</p>

It was a process that was designed to look at the functioning of a department, or more accurately, at a system within Haringey that involved not merely the CYPS, but also the healthcare services and the police.  It was not of itself designed to look at the roles of individuals.  Unfortunately, it was conducted against the background of a significant degree of press coverage that was decidedly personalised, the Claimant being one person at the forefront of that coverage.  This personalised approach continued into the press conference of 1 December 2008 and into the events of the next 6 or 7 weeks. That may have had the effect of skewing the perception of many people about what was involved at the time – and it may still have the effect of skewing people’s perceptions about what occurred and the responsibilities of those involved.  However, be that as it may, standing back from the process envisaged, it cannot, in my judgment, be said to have been intrinsically unfair in its conception in relation to any individual concerned.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The precise advice received by the Secretary of State on 12 November has not been revealed, but one issue that he plainly knew that he would have to address if he was to intervene under Section 497A of the Education Act 1996 was whether he was “satisfied” that Haringey was “failing in any respect to perform [its functions] to an adequate standard”.  That has nothing specifically to do with an individual or group of individuals – though, of course, individuals are responsible for ensuring the performance of those functions.  Had he been so satisfied on the basis of what he saw on 12 November, he could there and then have issued a direction of the type made on 1 December.  It would have run the risk of a challenge either by the local authority or by any individuals concerned: since sadly deaths of and serious injuries to children on the child protection register do occur even in local authorities where there is a generally adequate system of child safeguarding, it would have been difficult to justify taking any step until there was additional material available to show that Haringey was not performing its child safeguarding functions to an adequate standard.    However, it would, in theory at any rate, have been a course open to him.  He did not do so and invited an inspection by those who, in the normal course of events, are required, if asked to do so by the Secretary of State, to carry out an inspection of children’s services.  That will doubtless have been perceived by him as a “fair” approach to adopt, both to Haringey itself and, to the extent that fairness to individuals was perceived to be part of the consideration he had to give to the intended process, to those individuals too.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There is, it has to be said, little evidence that fairness <span style="text-decoration:underline">to individuals</span> was considered actively at the outset or necessarily at any stage:  the focus was on the child protection arrangements in Haringey.  To the extent that consideration of fairness to individuals was taken into account, it was said in effect on the Secretary of State’s behalf that he assumed that the individuals concerned would have the opportunity to influence the Ofsted process and would thus have an opportunity to “put their case” to the inspection team.  I have already drawn attention to what seems to have been a misunderstanding between the Secretary of State and Ofsted about the extent of “feedback”.  That is unfortunate and has caused me some concern.  However, “feedback” is one thing; having the opportunity to put a message over to the inspectors is another.  Feedback might have corrected some of the misconceptions, as the Claimant sees them, in the report; but in terms of individual responsibility in the management structure for what did or did not happen in Haringey I am doubtful whether it would have made any impact.  If that was going to come, it would come from the individual interviews. There is no doubt that the Leader of the Council, the Lead Member, the Chief Executive, the DCS, her deputy and others were all interviewed and each had the opportunity to put across his or her point of view: the evidence suggests that the discussions were held in an open, rather than accusatorial, fashion - which is what one would expect of a proper “inspection”.  For reasons which I have mentioned and will mention again elsewhere, I do not think it could possibly be said that the circumstances for conveying a viewpoint were ideal:  they were not.  However, the opportunity existed.  Because this case involves the Claimant, it has to be said that the opportunity existed for her albeit, given all the pressures to which she and those close to her were being exposed during that time, one in which it is difficult to believe it was easy to collect relevant thoughts and put them forward in a focused and persuasive way. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As will, perhaps, be apparent from the foregoing discussion, striving to find a pigeon-hole for the appropriate concept of fairness in this case is, I think, a forlorn exercise.  It seems to me that the true basis for what occurred in this case is that, if one left out of account any actual or perceived personal fault or failing on the Claimant’s behalf in how she carried out what must have been complex responsibilities at Haringey, she was the head of a vital department found to have fallen short of expected standards in a significant way.  That falling below of expected standards could easily have been the direct responsibility of the person to whom the day-to-day conduct of the department was delegated or could simply have been a function of the difficulties faced by Haringey (and doubtless other local authorities) of recruiting and retaining sufficient well-qualified social workers to be able to respond to the needs of the children on its child protection register (indeed the very point Ms Hitchen made to Mr Hart during their discussion: see paragraph 238 above).  It could also have been a function of the inadequacy of the other principal agencies (the healthcare services and/or the police) to engage with the expected standards: the Ofsted report criticised them too and arguably could have made more of the criticisms.  If it was any of those factors and the Claimant had striven within the limits of the financial and human resources at her disposal to maintain and improve standards, then most fair-minded people would say it was “unfair” on a personal level that she should be removed from her position, certainly if she had not had a reasonable opportunity to put that point of view to those who were in a position to influence her future.  However, if “fairness” in this context is judged by reference to someone having to “carry the can” for the failings of a system then, as head of that system, it would not on that analysis necessarily be “unfair” that she was replaced.  It all depends upon the perception and meaning of the expression “accountability”.  It is notable that the Secretary of State, in the press conference when he announced his decisions, said within a short while of commencing his statement that “all the people who work to keep children safe … must … be accountable for their decisions.”</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Traditionally, an elected politician who becomes a Minister is expected to resign if his or her department is found wanting over a significant matter even if it was not the personal responsibility for the Minister concerned.  I say “traditionally” because it may be thought that the tradition has been less frequently observed in more recent times.  In this case, of course, there was “political accountability” within Haringey because the Leader of the Council and the Lead Member, both elected politicians, resigned.  That is generally what people would expect.  Political accountability is one thing:  accountability on the part of someone employed to do something is arguably another, with matters of professional reputation, livelihood and considerations of a contractual and financial nature also in play.  If what happened in this case is going to be repeated in the future, the law will have to grapple with this concept of accountability in the rather more local and less familiar setting of that of an employee than hitherto.  Indeed the issue may arise acutely in the Employment Tribunal proceedings that may take place in this case.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As I have said, a substantial factor in the Claimant being replaced by the Secretary of State was because, as head of the department that was assessed to be inadequate, she was held “accountable”.  To that extent, the normal conceptions of “fairness” to the individual do not really apply.  There may need to be a debate, which one court case decided on its own facts cannot possibly resolve, about whether individual responsibility in this way for a collective failure is what is to be expected of someone who achieves the position of DCS or its equivalent and, of course, whether it justifies summary dismissal.  Was this what was meant by the guidance on “accountability” to which I referred in paragraph 77 above? The answer to the question would be of interest to anyone thinking of taking on the role of DCS - and maybe to those currently in office.  The prospect of summary dismissal with no compensation and a good deal of public opprobrium is hardly likely to be an inducement for someone thinking of taking the job or, perhaps, in some circumstances, continuing in it.  It is to be noted that the Dismissal Appeal Panel at Haringey gave as one of its reasons for upholding the decision to dismiss the Claimant “that the Director of Children's Services was <span style="text-decoration:underline">personally accountable</span> for any failings identified in the Service by” the Ofsted report (my emphasis).  I have not heard full argument about what "accountable" means in the legal context (rather than what it might convey in something said by a politician or a commentator on public events) and the view I express about it is necessarily tentative.   However, whilst there can be no doubt that the word is generally understood simply to mean the same as "answerable" (in other words, a person who is "accountable" is the person who must answer questions about why something did or did not happen), it would be a very significant step to say that "accountability" means liability for summary dismissal without compensation.  That seems to me, potentially at any rate, to open up some very large employment law issues leaving aside the obvious comment that few people would want to take on the role of DCS in those circumstances.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">At all events, my ultimate conclusion is that, (a) since what the Secretary of State was engaged in was not a true disciplinary process, (b) the issue had a real local and national dimension that affected vulnerable children and (c) since he was entitled to adjudge it to be urgent, the traditional safeguards concerning the rights of an individual to a fair hearing and/or a fair opportunity to put his or her case, whilst not removed totally, of necessity assumed a considerably lower profile than it might otherwise have done.  For the reasons I have endeavoured to articulate, I do not consider that what was understood by the Secretary of State to have occurred during the Ofsted inspection rendered the process adopted unfair.  That the whole process became subverted by the personalisation of the issues was unfortunate.  It would have been better had it not.  As I have already observed, it is, to my mind, very doubtful if the Claimant really did have a true opportunity to put her point of view persuasively to the inspectors because of the distractions caused by the media interest in what was going on at Haringey, particularly in relation to her, during the inspection week.  Threats made to her and her family cannot have helped either.  However, the Ofsted inspection team were there to investigate and report, not to formulate allegations and obtain a specific response to them.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Bearing in mind, as I do, all those words of caution, I am reluctantly driven to the conclusion that anything the Claimant said in this case would not have made any difference to the Secretary of State’s decision.  I reach this conclusion simply on the basis that he had before him a report which told him that Haringey’s children’s services department was “inadequate” and that there were systemic management failures within the current arrangements.  A decision to replace the management against that background, he says through Ms Pugh, was inevitable, a decision made even more inevitable because of the nationwide concerns about child protection arrangements generally.  I am, of course, alive to how easy it is simply to assert in a witness statement that a decision like this would have been the same irrespective of anything that might have been said by the person affected who had no direct opportunity to influence the decision taken.  I am also alive to how unfair this would seem to the person affected.  But I have to say that, given the terms of the Ofsted report, given that this was Haringey (where the impetus for all the national child protection reforms started) and given the national context of the concerns about child protection arising from what was known then as 'the Baby P case', I can see no alternative but to conclude that nothing the Claimant could have said at that time (which would have been about the conclusions of the Ofsted report and about any personal responsibility she perceived she might have about any of those aspects) would have made any difference.  I agree with Mr Maurici that, given the opportunity, she could have said a good deal about the report: what she said in the Haringey hearings and what she has said in her detailed response to the report prepared for these proceedings evidences that proposition.  Indeed given some of the material that has emerged in the late disclosure by Ofsted about how the report achieved its final form, she might have had quite a bit more to say.  However, I am quite sure that the wider picture, as it presented itself to the Secretary of State, would have resulted in the same outcome irrespective of what she could have said.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I should make it clear that I was much pressed by Mr Eadie, and indeed Mr Ward and Ms Simler, with submissions supporting this general argument, but based upon material that was not before the Secretary of State, either because, although in existence, it was not drawn to his attention by Ofsted or his Department at the time or because it was not yet in existence.  This does not seem to me to be a legitimate approach to this kind of issue.  If the invitation to approach matters in this way were accepted, it would be tantamount to the court being asked to substitute its own views on the merits of the case on the basis of material that was not available to the decision-maker.  That cannot be right.  I should say that the same point has to be made in relation to the Claimant's argument (set out in her detailed commentary on the Ofsted report prepared for these proceedings) that a fair number of the criticisms made of the arrangements within Haringey and in respect of the SCR in Peter’s case were criticisms made by Lord Laming in the report published in March 2009 and indeed (in relation to the SCR) in Ofsted’s own evaluation of other SCRs throughout the country published at or about the same time as the Secretary of State’s directions.  If she is correct about that it is, of course, possible to see why she might feel aggrieved that the SCR which she oversaw should have been used as part of the reason for her dismissal.  However, I must base my assessment purely on the material that was available to the Secretary of the State on 1 December and on what could have been said by the Claimant at or about that time.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I cannot leave this aspect of the case without repeating and amplifying one comment I made earlier.  It appears that no arrangements had been made to communicate the effect of the Secretary of State’s decision to the Claimant, or even the gist of the final version of the Ofsted report, before the directions were issued at 12.30 on 1 December or before the Secretary of State announced the position at a televised news conference that afternoon.  This means that the first she knew that she had been removed from her office was when she saw the announcement to that effect on the television.  She also heard the Secretary of State say that the inspectors had said that she had displayed “insufficient management oversight” in relation to her deputy and that she was “not fit for office”.  I have concluded that, subject to the question of whether the Ofsted report itself was flawed, the decision to make the directions the Secretary of State made was not itself made as a result of an unfair process according to law.  Whether the way matters were announced was fair must be a matter for others to judge, but I cannot avoid the comment that a Government Minister might feel less than pleased if the Prime Minister was to remove him or her from office by announcing their unfitness for office directly to the nation before telling the Minister concerned.  One question the Secretary of State was asked at the press conference was why the Claimant had not resigned “given the damning findings of Ofsted”.  He had to draw attention to the fact that she had not yet seen the report.  I do not think that any fair-minded person could think that this was a satisfactory state of affairs.</p>

That case arose out of the terrible murder of James Bulger by Robert Thompson and Jon Venables who were aged 10½ at the time of the murder.  It was another case that gave rise to very strong feelings and emotions – and indeed still does.  Thompson and Venables were sentenced to be detained during Her Majesty's pleasure pursuant to section 53(1) of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933.  After that sentence was passed, the trial judge, in a report to the Secretary of State, stated that in his view the minimum period of detention necessary to satisfy the requirements of retribution and deterrence was 8 years having regard to their youth at the time of the offences. The Lord Chief Justice recommended a tariff of 10 years.  The Home Secretary, in the exercise of his powers that he then possessed under section 35 of the Criminal Justice Act 1991, informed Thomson and Venables that he had fixed a tariff of 15 years as appropriate to satisfy the requirements of retribution and deterrence.  It was plain from his decision letters that the Home Secretary, when fixing the penal element in the sentences at 15 years, had paid some regard to a large number of petitions and letters inviting him to impose a whole life term one of which, incidentally, was coordinated by <span style="font-style:italic">The Sun</span>.</p>

Parliament must be assumed to have entrusted the power to the Home Secretary on the supposition that, like a sentencing judge, the Home Secretary would not act contrary to fundamental principles governing the administration of justice. Plainly a sentencing judge must ignore a newspaper campaign designed to encourage him to increase a particular sentence. It would be an abdication of the rule of law for a judge to take into account such matters. The same reasoning must apply to the Home Secretary when he is exercising a sentencing function. He ought to concentrate on the facts of the case and balance considerations of public interest against the dictates of justice. Like a judge the Home Secretary ought not to be guided by a disposition to consult how popular a particular decision might be. He ought to ignore the high-voltage atmosphere of a newspaper campaign. The power given to him requires, above all, a detached approach. I would therefore hold that public protests about the level of a tariff to be fixed in a particular case are legally irrelevant and may not be taken into account by the Home Secretary in fixing the tariff.

Expressions of opinion from these sources, however sincere and well presented, are rarely based on a full appreciation of the facts of the case.”</p>

However, it is right to say that the Secretary of State went on to refer to what many people “right across the country” had felt about the case having “seen in the newspapers the reality of this tragedy.”  I do not interpret his answer, taken as a whole, to support the proposition that it was <span style="text-decoration:underline">because</span> of <span style="font-style:italic">The Sun’s</span> petition that he took the action that he did.  There can be no doubt from the press material put before me that virtually every newspaper in the country was carrying the story and its implications.  Doubtless it was extensively reported and the subject of comment on television, radio and also the Internet.  Ms Pugh refers to e-mails and letters received by No 10 Downing Street and the Department and the way the matter was raised in Parliament on a good number of occasions, including calls for a public inquiry.  She refers also to a “lynch mob” attitude towards social workers in various places across the country, a problem that is highlighted in some of the press reports in the papers before me.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">However, taking such a step and being photographed with someone conveying a petition demanding that certain actions be taken shortly before considering what action to take does run the risk of a court being forced to draw the inference that a material consideration in taking the decision a few days later was the petition and the influence of the particular newspaper - or that it reflected a pre-determination to act in a particular way.  Whilst the <span style="font-style:italic">Venables</span> case (see paragraph 400) was, I fully accept, different from the present case, I am not wholly convinced that the distinction sought to be made by Mr Eadie between a Secretary of State being called upon to act judicially and one who is called upon to act fairly in making an administrative decision is that significant in this context.   The <span style="font-style:italic">Venables</span> case illustrates the danger that a decision-maker who is required by law to act fairly faces of being seen to be too close to a populist cause, no matter how well-intentioned the cause may be, and of crossing the threshold into the forbidden territory of the irrelevant consideration.  However, just as I consider it too simplistic to say that the Secretary of State embarked on the process he did on 12 November because of “party political” reasons (see paragraph 141 above), I think it also far too simplistic to say that he took the decision that he did on 1 December because of being presented with a petition from a national newspaper a few days earlier.  No media outlet could claim a monopoly of coverage, influence or wisdom on the matters the Secretary of State had to consider at the time and against that background, and the wider background referred to by Ms Pugh, it is quite impossible to draw the inference that Mr Maurici invites me to draw.</p>

That could be seen as seeking to put pressure upon the authority which, as a public body, was obliged to consider properly, fairly and with due regard to its own legal powers what it should do in what was almost certainly a complex legal position: cf.<span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:Verdana"> </span><span style="font-style:italic">Gibb v Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust</span> [2009] EWHC 862 (QB).  He should, in my view, have remained entirely detached from the employment consequences for the individuals affected by his direction and have emphasised that that was the case.  However, he was not alone amongst senior national and local politicians in making comments of this nature and, in any event, the comments have nothing to do with the merits of the decision he had made by then or whether the procedure he adopted prior to making it was fair or otherwise.</p>

It has not been argued that the Secretary of State’s decision could stand if the Ofsted report was flawed, so I proceed on the basis that if the report should be the subject of relief so too should be the Secretary of State’s decision.</p>

Mr Maurici has in effect argued that Ofsted exceeded its statutory remit by agreeing to fulfil a request from the Secretary of State, purportedly within section 20, when it could not fulfil it within the parameters set by section 20.  However, this does seem to me to be the most technical of arguments and ignores the true realities of the moment.  As I have said elsewhere, it would theoretically have been open to the Secretary of State to form a view about Haringey’s capacity to carry out its obligations in relation to the safeguarding of children on the basis of the material he had on 12 November.  He chose not to do so, but invited an inspection on safeguarding in Haringey from those normally charged with the responsibility for inspecting such an issue.  I do not think that there can be any rational or sustained criticism of Ofsted for accepting the invitation even if it meant compromising its usual approach to such a task.</p>

Indeed I am not sure that, on a true analysis, this is what the Claimant says.  Her case, articulated through Mr Maurici’s written submissions in particular, is that the way in which the findings of the inspection were written up in the final form of the report reflected the implementation of an agenda designed to put her in the worst possible light.  I will return to that suggestion (to the extent that it is relevant to the matters before me) later, but it would have been contrary to the way in which Ofsted inspections were carried out for any inspection to focus on the role that specific individuals played.  </p>

The evidence that he used this expression, or something like it, was revealed in Ms Pugh's witness statement on behalf of the Secretary of State of 24 July 2009 and in the original Ofsted disclosure.

Mr Ward's note was indeed sparse from that point of view.  He had relied on the evidence of Ms Brown which suggested that leadership and management of safeguarding were discussed with the Claimant during the interview with her as DCS which was supported, not extensively, but certainly in one respect, by the RoE.  He suggested that leadership and management issues "were a constant theme in the duty room and case-tracking feedback meetings."

On 25 November Ms Brown had sent the first draft to Mr Pullen, Mr Shippam and others at 09.35 that morning and various suggestions and amendments were made during the morning.  At 12.12 a revised version was sent to Ms Gilbert and Ms Rosen as an attachment to an e-mail from Mr Shippam.  He described it as "very much work in progress" but was enough to "give the flavour and ... enable you to give steers as necessary."  It is right to say that the draft sent did not include the words that appeared in the final version.   Mr Hart was charged with the task of producing something in relation to leadership and management and the words "Leadership and management of the children’s service are inadequate" appeared in the next draft on the morning of 26 November as did, in a separate sentence, the words “There has been a failure to use the outcomes from qualitative audit activity to critically self evaluate and inform operational and strategic management.”</p>

I say nothing about whether the overall judgment reflected in this particular finding was justified or not.  However, it only has to be read as it stands to appreciate that it <span style="text-decoration:underline">is</span> a judgment and one that reflects on <span style="text-decoration:underline">all</span> agencies within Haringey with responsibility for child protection.  It represents a drawing together of various strands of practice (or substandard practice) across the Borough.  It is not of itself directed at the Claimant personally – it is a criticism directed at all those who have a role in “strategic leadership” and “management oversight” matters.  Assuming that the criticism is justified, then in relation to “strategic leadership” matters the Claimant would have to accept her share of it as DCS, particularly given her role as Chair of the LSCB, which has a wider remit than merely the child protection arrangements of the Council.</p>

There is no evidence or suggestion that anything like this was ever said to her.  There is no evidence that the words “strategic leadership” were ever used by the inspectors in her presence.  However, as I have said, this was a broad generalisation based upon an overview of a number of specific criticisms.  It is difficult to believe that the Claimant could have said anything which would have changed the general criticism even if she had been given an opportunity to do so.</p>

The criticism, as I understand it, went to all levels of management and reflected issues that were raised at the duty room feedback meeting.  I have already concluded that the Claimant and Ms Hitchen must have appreciated that there were levels of concern on the part of the inspectors arising from that meeting and that those issues reflected on management oversight, something that Ms Doe had identified (see paragraph 102).</p>

I have observed already that there is not very much contemporaneous evidence about this, but there can be little doubt that some discussion about the relevant cases took place at the duty room feedback meeting and it would be surprising if Ms Hitchen, whose primary responsibility this would have been, had not been invited to consider the position further.  As it was, she was interviewed the following day (when she became very upset) and was probably in no fit state to take matters much further in the next 24-48 hours.  I suspect that that is why no response was ever given.  </p>

Within the limits of this very unusual and significantly truncated inspection process, it is impossible to say that she was not given notice of the gist of the inspectors concerns on this issue.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I have already commented on the unsatisfactory way in which this finding came to made in the form in which it ultimately appeared (see paragraph 298).  Mr Maurici has suggested that it was entirely absent as a finding in the first draft and represented a "new addition".  Mr Ward is undoubtedly justified in saying that this finding is reflected in the body of the first draft of the report where recommendations from the Victoria Climbié inquiry are referred to in six particular paragraphs.  However, the way in which it came into the first draft needs to be noted.  Ms Brown e-mailed Mr Pullen and Ms Anna Lis (the Deputy Director for Education) at 09.13 on 25 November to say that the first draft would be with them "imminently" and she alerted them to the fact that she had "included some Climbié recommendations at the end of certain [paragraphs]" which had been highlighted in blue font, but indicated that she would welcome "your advice about whether we retain these in the text".   It was sent out to them and to the whole team at 09.35.  In due course, comments were received from the team.  It appears that Mr Hart and Ms O'Brien were concerned about the inclusion of these references on the basis that "many of the recommendations [of the Climbié inquiry] were not agreed by the [government] and [are] not therefore in guidance and statute."  It is possible that that is why Ms Brown was hesitant about referring to them.  As Mr Hart and Ms O'Brien put it, "we are not sure we should rely on [the] Climbié inquiry" for the reason I have set out.  It appears that these words of concern were acted on, at least partially at any rate.  When Ms Brown sent the draft to Ms Gilbert on 27 November 2008 she said this: " ... in this version, we have removed the references to Climbié throughout the main body of the report, but it remains in the main findings. We are happy to delete that reference, also, or reinstate the other references, depending on your advice please."  Apart from the final version recording that "police training provision is compliant with the Victoria Climbié recommendations" and to the need for written feedback to those making referrals to social care services, no other reference was made to those recommendations in the body of the report.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Again, let me emphasise that my task is not to decide whether any of the criticisms based on an alleged failure to implement recommendations from the Victoria Climbié inquiry are justified or not and my reference to the way this matter was considered within Ofsted is not part of a investigation into whether the report was unfairly strengthened in the process. The issue is whether an opportunity to address the concerns was presented during the inspection.  I put it more broadly than simply questioning whether the Claimant personally had such an opportunity.  Some of the issues would, I would have thought, been of the kind that Ms Hitchen, who was in day-to-day control of child protection matters, would (or should) have been able to address if raised with her.  Since Mr Ward has been anxious to say that this was an inspection into a department and not the roles of individuals, it would have been open to him to say that, whilst the Claimant did not have the matter raised with her, it was raised with Ms Hitchen.  He has not done so.  The highest it is put on Ofsted's behalf in relation to discussions with the Claimant is by Ms Brown who draws attention to Recommendation 53 of the Victoria Climbié inquiry which was in these terms:</p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">"53. When allocating a case to a social worker, the manager must ensure that the social worker is clear as to what has been allocated, what action is required and how that action will be reviewed and supervised."</p>
	  </content>
	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">She said that the inspectors "found that some allocations of cases were made electronically and without prior discussion with the social worker in question" and that this, therefore, constituted a breach of that recommendation.    She says that she has "a clear recollection of discussing these matters with [the Claimant]."  The Claimant, as I understand her position, disputes this.  She says that this particular instance of suggested non-compliance with the inquiry recommendations arose in an interview with health visitors and that there is no record of this being followed up.   She appears correct in that assertion.  If Ms Brown did raise it with her, then I do not think she could have done so in a way that created any impression upon her and there is no contemporaneous record, in the RoE or elsewhere, that it was raised with her or anyone else.  My attention has been drawn to no other contemporaneous record of discussions with anyone at Haringey about any other feature of the recommendations of the Victoria Climbié inquiry.</p>

I suspect that the hesitancy of Ms Brown (fortified by the views of Mr Hart and Ms O'Brien) about the extent to which reference should be made to the inquiry recommendations is the reason why it was not at the forefront of any discussions during the fieldwork part of the exercise.   At all events, for whatever reason, I do not think that this aspect of the criticism made on the final report was properly communicated to those within Haringey who could have addressed it.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">"Current management arrangements within the council and across the partnership do not facilitate sufficient independent challenge on safeguarding matters.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Whether that entirely negative message in the final version was justified or fair is not my concern in these proceedings.  It is clear from the further disclosure that at least two members of the team (Mr Hart and Ms Ryan) had reservations about what was proposed by way of comment on the issue of chairing the LSCB.  However, what is clear in this particular instance (which was not clear in relation to the second 'Main finding') is that this issue was discussed with the Claimant, even if only relatively briefly.  The notes indicate that at her first interview the Claimant was asked if consideration had been given to the appointment of an independent chair when the answer appears to have been that this might have happened but for Baby P's death when she thought it right to take the lead.  At all events, it is clear that the inspection team did look into the workings of the LSCB in some detail, not merely in the conversation with the Claimant, but with others including Dr O'Donovan.  Since the Claimant will have known from at least Prime Minister's Question Time on 11 November that her position as Chair of the LSCB was questioned, it is difficult to believe that she was not ready (to the extent that the circumstances of the inspection permitted) to deal with it.</p>

If it had been the only matter relied upon by the Secretary of State in removing her from her position, the Claimant might well have had a legitimate grievance.

Her own notes of a meeting with Ms Brown on 19 November contain the following two entries: "one of the things we can see from the files is a lack of multi-agency" and "not assessing together but in parallel".

However, closer analysis shows that the word "assessment" refers to the relevant paperwork (or electronic equivalent) rather than the mental process that a caseworker goes through in deciding whether a child is at immediate risk.  It is difficult to believe, for example, that any social worker who decided that a child was at immediate risk of harm would go home at night and do nothing about it even if they had not completed the relevant paperwork or its equivalent.  However, because so many individuals may be involved in an individual child's welfare (both within an agency and across agencies) the records are important for continuity purposes and for helping to identify children who may become at risk or more seriously at risk.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Focusing on the final version by comparison with the first version, Mr Maurici contends that the conclusion in the final version had been significantly strengthened by the inclusion of the suggestion that assessments “too often ... fail to identify those who are at immediate risk of harm” as opposed to “not always" focusing on "the needs of the child".  This is a serious allegation, he contends, which, if true, was absent from the main findings in the first draft and which was inconsistent with Mr Hart's view that, notwithstanding what was discussed during the duty room feedback meeting, no cases of children in <span style="text-decoration:underline">immediate danger</span> had been identified.  Mr Maurici's argument, for this purpose, is that if concerns as to children in "immediate danger" were not flagged up in the first draft it cannot have been a "main concern" and, accordingly, would not have been reflected in discussions with the Claimant - which, of course, is her case.</p>

Nonetheless, I do not think that it is an argument than can be ignored completely in this context.  An examination of the final report demonstrates that the words "immediate risk of harm" appear only once and that is in the finding set out in paragraph 449 above.  In the paragraphs in the body of the report dealing with 'Quality of recording, assessment and child protection planning' (paragraphs 16-24), which presumably reflects the evidence-base for the findings in the 'Summary judgement', those words do not appear.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">So where does this analysis lead on the issue I have to decide?  Without, I trust, trespassing into an assessment of the merits, it does appear (at least without the benefit of hearing evidence from those with experience in the field) that there is a fair degree of overlap between a number of the findings.  A number appear to be based on essentially the same evidence base and each appears to reflect concerns as to practice at different levels within the overall safeguarding structure.  With the exception of Finding 2 (relating specifically to whether the Victoria Climbié inquiry recommendations had been implemented), I have concluded that the gist of Ofsted’s concerns on the other matters were raised with the Claimant, or at least were raised with Haringey personnel (largely, in the form of Ms Hitchen), in a way that enabled comment to be made.  If one leaves out of account for this purpose the intense personal pressures that the Claimant was (and indeed others in Haringey were) under during the inspection, then it has to be said that as someone who was DCS during an earlier Ofsted inspection and who was once a former Ofsted inspector (albeit in educational matters), she would have been better placed than most to pick up the signs of matters of concern and, if there was an answer to them, to give that answer clearly and persuasively.  That combination of circumstances seems to me, at least objectively speaking, to validate the inspection process from Ofsted’s point of view to the extent that there was an obligation to communicate the gist of the developing concerns.  Ofsted was engaged to look into the workings of a department of which the Claimant was head and to report on what they found.  The Claimant was, within the limits of the very truncated process, kept abreast of what was being revealed during the inspection.  For my part, I cannot see what else, realistically, could have been done.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I have approached the evaluation of the evidence about what was or was not communicated to the Claimant on the basis that there was an obligation to tell her of the gist of the concerns that drove the main findings in the report.  That was, as I understood the argument, the most that Mr Ward suggested the obligation of fairness required in the circumstances.  Since feedback in the sense normally required when a JAR is prepared was not contemplated by Ofsted, he could certainly not rely upon the feedback element of the full JAR process to show that any obligation of fairness was discharged.  Equally, since Ofsted’s whole approach is predicated on the basis that what an inspection looks at is the working of a department or system as a whole rather than at the conduct of individuals within it, the inspection process would never involve formulating some kind of allegation against an individual in respect of which an explanation is sought.  Mr Maurici, of course, argued that Ofsted, even on its own case as to fairness, had failed to discharge the obligation because the gist of the main concerns had not been made plain to the Claimant as the inspection proceeded.  However, he submitted that the obligation went further than that.   Relying on the decision of the Privy Council in <span style="font-style:italic">Mahon v Air New Zealand Ltd</span> [1984] AC 808, at 820-821, he suggested that the relevant rules of natural justice applicable in respect of a report are the two propositions set out in that case, neither of which, he submitted, had been complied with in this case:</p>

The first rule is that the person making a finding in the exercise of such a jurisdiction must base his decision upon evidence that has some probative value in the sense described below. The second rule is that he must listen fairly to any relevant evidence conflicting with the finding and any rational argument against the finding that a person represented at the inquiry, whose interests (including in that term career or reputation) may be adversely affected by it, may wish to place before him or would have so wished if he had been aware of the risk of the finding being made.</p>

This was not, as Mr Ward quite rightly submitted, a disciplinary investigation by Ofsted even though, as things turned out, the Secretary of State and Haringey used the findings for removing the Claimant from her position and then dismissing her from her employment respectively.  In my judgment, Ofsted’s duty of fairness was simply derived from a duty to carry out a <span style="font-style:italic">bona fide</span> and open-minded inspection into what they found and to report accordingly.  Discussing matters that arose with those “on the ground” in the local authority would have been the only way to form a worthwhile view of what was happening.  Concealing emerging concerns would have been unlikely to produce a balanced and fair report.   Discussing those concerns with those who could illuminate the position from the local authority’s perspective was plainly important and would obviously have alerted those with whom the issues were raised to possible adverse findings and conclusions.  It seems to me that it was at that time that the opportunity to influence the outcome of the inspection came to arise.</p>

Whilst that cannot operate to invalidate the Secretary of State’s decision to replace members of the management team, it is arguably of very considerable importance in considering the outcome of any dispute about whether grounds for dismissal (certainly, summary dismissal) by Haringey were made out.</p>

I am proposing to set out its terms below.  On two separate days in January 2009, presentations by some of those from Ofsted involved in the inspection took place in which slides were prepared showing what had occurred and the comments of some of those involved.

Whilst this does not mean that there was no opportunity for the Claimant to address the issues as they were presented, it reflects a significantly diminished quality of opportunity.</p>

If the local authority considers in this kind of situation that the Secretary of State has exceeded his powers or has acted irrationally or unfairly in making the decision, judicial review seeking the quashing of the directions could be sought.  Equally, the DCS affected by the directions has the right to challenge the decision by way of judicial review as has occurred here.

Because of the high emotions engendered by the background to this case, and indeed in the light of statements made publicly by a number of influential people (including the Secretary of State himself) at the time of the Secretary of State’s directions and in the weeks thereafter, it is, perhaps, important, to record clearly and unambiguously that <span style="text-decoration:underline">no party to this application has suggested that the Claimant does not have the right to make a claim for compensation for loss of her job if she wishes to make one</span>.  Each party may have its own view as to her entitlement to compensation if she pursues such a claim, but those views are wholly irrelevant for present purposes.  So too are the views of any influential person, any other commentator or the signatories of any petition.  None will have access to all the information upon which to base a fair judgment on the issue according to the law.  In a civilised society, where the rule of law must prevail, everyone has the right to an independent judicial consideration of a claim of this nature whether it is perceived by others to be meritorious or not.  The <span style="text-decoration:underline">only issue</span> that arises in the present case is the avenue that the Claimant must follow in order to make such a claim if she chooses to make one.   It is, of course, to be borne in mind that Mr Maurici has said on her behalf that compensation is not the sole objective of the claims she presently makes (see paragraph 32 above).</p>

The reason for asking the question is that, at first blush, the process ought, in principle, to be the same whether the DCS had been employed by the particular local authority for 364 days or 366 days.  However, the unfair dismissal avenue is plainly denied to the former, but not the latter.   It may well be said that, since this case does involve a DCS who qualifies for the unfair dismissal avenue, the issue is academic.  To some extent it is, but the approach in a case where the DCS cannot bring unfair dismissal proceedings may shed some light on the options available to a DCS who can.</p>

In each case, the reasonable and proportionate test was applied in order to reduce the risk of legal challenge, which is always open to a local authority, and an essential part of that process is allowing the local authority the opportunity to make representations once notified of ministers' intention to invoke statutory powers. This means that Secretary of State's statement after receiving the Ofsted report on Haringey could only indicate an intention to use such powers ie that he is "minded" to intervene and allow a period for the local authority to make representations. In previous cases, the final decision to intervene has followed on from a period of discussion with the local authority about performance issues and options for addressing them which has typically lasted several weeks."</span>

Her argument is that any remedy the Claimant may have against Haringey is solely a private law remedy.  She relies upon the well-established principle (not disputed by Mr Maurici) that employment disputes are ordinarily not amenable to judicial review.  Mere employment by a public authority does not invest the situation with a sufficient public element to render a decision to dismiss such an employee reviewable on public law grounds:  see, e.g., <span style="font-style:italic">R v BBC, ex parte Lavelle</span> [1983] 1 WLR 23.  Her argument, as it stands, is not that judicial review is precluded because an alternative remedy has not been pursued:  it is that judicial review is simply not available as a remedy.  Although not canvassed in argument, the logic of her position is that if a DCS (or someone in an equivalent position) is dismissed before having qualified to make a claim for unfair dismissal, that person would simply have to rely upon his or her contractual rights under the contract of employment.</p>

When that occurred Haringey took a <span style="text-decoration:underline">private law</span> decision about whether to continue the Claimant’s employment in the light of removal from her statutory office. It decided it could not, and the Claimant’s employment with Haringey was determined for all practical and effective purposes.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Ms Simler submits, accurately, that prior to the introduction of the employment protection legislation there were three categories of employment case in respect of which only the third attracted the remedy of judicial review. The first two categories covered (i) what was then called the ordinary “master/servant” relationship and (ii) those who held office “at pleasure” – in other words, simply at the mercy of the appointer to the office.  In both these categories dismissal could take place without any reason being given and there was, accordingly, no duty to afford the employee or the holder of the office an opportunity to be heard or otherwise to be given the protections afforded by the rules of natural justice. The third category, namely, that of officeholders, was a category in respect of which there was an obligation on the part of the employer to give reasons for the termination of the office and to respect the principles of natural justice.  A failure to do so gave the officeholder the right to apply to the court to quash the decision.   All this was confirmed in the well-known case of <span style="font-style:italic">Ridge v Baldwin</span> [1964] AC 40.  With the advent of the employment protection legislation (starting, for this purpose, with the Industrial Relations Act 1971 and as now consolidated and developed in the Employment Rights Act 1996) in order for a dismissal to be fair, the reason for any dismissal of a qualifying employee must relate to conduct, capability, redundancy or “some other substantial reason” and, in broad terms, the dismissal must be procedurally fair and accord with the basic requirements of natural justice: see section 98 of the 1996 Act (and see further at paragraph 513 below).  The concept of the right to natural justice for an employee facing termination of his or employment is now, Ms Simler submits, subsumed within the statutory protection from unfair dismissal and it is highly unlikely, she says, that the older cases decided before the advent of the employment protection legislation would now be decided in the same way.  In the vast majority of cases, she contends, that the appropriate forum for resolving disputes about natural justice in relation to dismissal will be the employment tribunal.</p>

I would accept that, if only from a practical point of view, a DCS (or equivalent office holder within a local authority) who is replaced pursuant to a direction of the Secretary of State under section 497A and who is then arguably unfairly dismissed by the local authority will find a claim for unfair dismissal in the Employment Tribunal to be the most advantageous way of proceeding.  The merits in the broadest sense (see paragraph 513) can be reviewed, there are no significant costs risks associated with the proceedings and the tribunal is comprised of those with considerable experience of the employment law field.  If the purpose of the proceedings is simply to demonstrate that the dismissal was “unfair” with a view to clearing the name of the employee involved, this can be achieved in the unfair dismissal proceedings:  see, e.g., per May LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Walsh</span> when he said “[how] much more quickly and cheaply this could be achieved by obtaining a finding from an [employment tribunal] that he had indeed been unfairly dismissed.”</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">However, as I have observed already (see paragraph 499), there may be (doubtless very rare) circumstances in which a DCS (or equivalent) is replaced by a direction under section 497A, and is then dismissed by his or her local authority, but who has <span style="text-decoration:underline">not</span> acquired the right to claim for unfair dismissal.  Leaving aside any remedy that he or she might have against the Secretary of State (which, if my general conclusion above is correct, is likely to be highly circumscribed), there would be no opportunity to argue that the local authority’s decision to dismiss was unfair unless a right to seek judicial review of the local authority’s decision was available.  I cannot think that Parliament intended, or that the courts would countenance in modern times, a situation in which a challenge to dismissal on the broad ground of unfairness was denied in these circumstances.  A theme to that effect ran through many cases before the incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into the national law (see, e.g., see <span style="font-style:italic">Nagle v Feilden</span> [1966] 2 QB 633; <span style="font-style:italic">Breen v Amalgamated Engineering Union</span> [1971] 2 QB 175 and <span style="font-style:italic">McInnes v Onslow-Fane</span> [1978] 1 WLR 1520), but it is reinforced by a case such as <span style="font-style:italic">R (Wright and others) v Secretary of State for Health</span> [2009] 1 AC 739.  In my judgment, in that situation if it arose, the court would afford the DCS an opportunity to challenge the fairness of the dismissal by the local authority on traditional public law grounds because the position that he or she occupied until replaced by virtue of the Secretary of State’s direction was a public office.  That would be the only means by which such a challenge could be maintained.  Sufficient statutory underpinning would be afforded by the dual position of a contract of employment and an office specifically provided for by statute.</p>

However, in that situation a far more convenient route exists for establishing the unfairness (if it took place) than the route of judicial review for the reasons I have summarised above.  Whereas, as it seems to me, where a claim for unfair dismissal cannot be made, a claim for judicial review has to be the claim of first resort for a DCS in the position I have described, where the opportunity to seek a remedy for unfair dismissal does exist, it seems to me that a claim for judicial review should be the remedy of “last resort” rather than “first resort”.  This means that, whilst the jurisdiction to grant judicial review exists, it may be inappropriate to consider the application or to grant relief.  </p>

However, Haringey’s case, as I have indicated, has been that there is no public element to the Claimant’s position and that when she was dismissed by Haringey it was “entirely a private law matter” (a position advanced in an e-mail on behalf of the Head of Legal Services as early as 20 March 2009 and repeated in the Summary Grounds of Resistance) and, as a result, there was thus effectively no jurisdiction to entertain a judicial review claim.  Accordingly, on this argument the issue of an alternative remedy does not arise – and thus did not arise at the permission stage.  I have, however, taken a different view in terms of pure jurisdiction, but am of the view that the alternative remedy should, in accordance with normal principles, be exhausted before consideration is given to any relief within the public law jurisdiction.  Since, in the circumstances, that relief would probably only amount to a declaration that her dismissal was unfair on procedural grounds (if that is established), it is plainly an issue that is best considered by the Employment Tribunal which, as I have said, can look at the matter more broadly and with all the specialist expertise at its disposal.</p>

These reasons are presumably said to amount "some other substantial reason of a kind such as to justify the dismissal of an employee holding the position which that employee held" (s.98(1)(b), Employment Rights Act 1996).

However, since the effect of reaching the conclusion that I have means that I must dismiss the Claimant’s judicial review case against Haringey, it is, of course, possible that the Claimant will wish to appeal against that decision.  Although I was told during the proceedings in October last year that the Claimant’s resources ran only to pursuing the case then advanced and no further, I cannot (and indeed, would not wish to) regard my decision as one which may not be the subject of appeal.

I should make it absolutely plain that, if the case does not go to the Court of Appeal, but the Claimant does pursue her claim for unfair dismissal, my reference to those various factors is not intended in any way to influence the outcome of those proceedings, one way or the other.  As I have emphasised more than once in this judgment, a judicial review claim has a narrow focus and the Employment Tribunal has the opportunity for a wider focus on the issues.  Further, again as I have said on a number of occasions, I have not had the advantage of any oral evidence and have had no basis for assessing any of the witnesses as witnesses or the personalities of those involved.

First, the Claimant had by all accounts given excellent service to Haringey for some seven years or so before her dismissal.  I have already noted the comments made about the Claimant by Dr O’Donovan (see paragraph 14 above) and the support she received from many local head teachers with whom she had had dealings when she had been in charge of the education arrangements within the Borough.  Second, she had become the first DCS within Haringey after the relevant provisions of the Children Act were implemented.  That was a position, given Haringey’s particular history, that carried huge responsibilities and a huge risk element.  Anything that went wrong in Haringey so far as child protection was concerned was bound to have high profile implications.  Anyone who took on that role and who continued it with apparent success would be entitled to expect, at least as a starting point, significant support if something did go wrong.  The presumption, it may be thought, would be one of collective responsibility for a failure in the systems in place if something did go wrong.  Against that background, the starting point for a responsible and considerate employer (<span style="text-decoration:underline">acting as an employer</span>) would be to be concerned that a respected and loyal employee who is the subject of critical comment, whether by a Government Minister, a national newspaper or any other commentator, is treated fairly in any ensuing consideration of his or her position within the Council.  </p>

I recognise fully and unreservedly the enormous pressures to which its members and officers were being exposed at the time that the Ofsted report was made public and the Secretary of State’s decision was being announced.  There were, as I have recorded elsewhere in this judgment, calls by many people and newspapers for the Claimant’s dismissal without compensation.  Whether that ultimately was to be the decision made is in one sense irrelevant for present purposes.  What is relevant is that when calls of that nature are made those to whom the calls are directed must act with, and must be seen to act with, scrupulous fairness.  Otherwise, fair processes according to law will simply be subverted by the political or media pressures of the moment.  Anyone who holds public office must be expected to ensure that, whatever the pressures, proper process is observed.

That has to be accepted as the position the Council was faced with on the day it was published and I do not think the Council can be criticised for not disputing the core findings at that point.  However, as a crucial document in any consideration of the employment position of the Claimant (and the others), it demanded, in my view, rather further investigation before steps were taken pursuant to it.  (I should, perhaps, say that I had formed that view before Ofsted’s further disclosure took place, but it has been reinforced by that disclosure.)  The Council will have appreciated the speed with which events starting after Prime Minister’s questions on 12 November took place.  Within a week of that the Ofsted inspectors had already completed two days of their fieldwork at Haringey.  The pressures were so great that the Service Manager had not reported for work on 17 November, the Deputy DCS did not return to work after 20 November and two senior Council members were reduced to tears.  During that week the Claimant had been so significantly under the media spotlight that Haringey had considered applying for an injunction designed to protect her – indeed instructions to Counsel had been prepared with a view to pursuing such a case.  Leaving aside anything that the Ofsted inspectors might have said about the Claimant’s ability to focus on things that week had they been asked about it, Dr O’Donovan had been very concerned about her (see paragraph 160 above) and her “variable ability to concentrate during this very difficult period.”</p>

Indeed, even if, as it turned out, Ofsted had been unwilling to share its evidence base with Haringey, the inspectors, if asked, might have been prepared to accept that they too were concerned about her ability to focus properly.

The allegation that was to be made against the Claimant was that the Ofsted report evidenced a failure on her part to maintain the relationship of trust and confidence between her and the Council.  Apart from the broad suggestion that the findings of the report demonstrated this failure, no particulars of that suggestion were drawn up and presented to the Claimant.  Whilst, in one sense, it is correct to say, as Ms Simler reminded me, that this was not a potential dismissal based upon matters of conduct (which would require the particularisation of allegations), the essential matter being suggested was that aspects of what the Claimant did or did not do resulted in the breach of that implied term.  To that extent, one would have thought that ordinarily some more precise particulars of what it is that she did or did not do would be provided to her.  It does seem to me at least to be arguable (although this would really be a matter for the Employment Tribunal) that some rather more precise particulars were required of that assertion.  There is a considerable amount of learning in the employment law field about what may or may not in particular circumstances constitute a breach of the implied term as to the preservation of mutual trust and confidence and an issue certainly arises as to whether some reasonably precise particulars of what is relied upon ought to have been given.  At all events, there is no evidence that this was done in this situation.  All that appeared in Mr Young’s letter was the suggestion that the issue of the failure of the effectiveness of the management of child protection services at the most senior level would be addressed at the disciplinary hearing.</p>

They were capable of being interpreted as seeking further evidence and, in the right hands, that could have been deployed to suggest that Haringey was uncertain about whether it had a proper basis for any disciplinary action against the Claimant – and perhaps the others involved.  It follows that she was disadvantaged (or potentially disadvantaged) at that hearing.  A little less haste, coupled with some clear thinking about the nature of the process to be followed, would have been better.

It is largely a question of appearance, although (i) and (iii) are somewhat more substantive.  However, as I have said before, I have put forward these conclusions simply so that my view on the case is known should my principal conclusion (namely, that the Employment Tribunal is the right place for this dispute) is challenged on appeal.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The overall impression gained of Haringey’s approach (perhaps understandable given all the external pressures) was that the sooner the Claimant was dismissed with no compensation, the better, and that everyone could “move on” once that had happened.  However, simply because the Ofsted report was in the terms it was, and the Secretary of State acted as he did and he, others and various national newspapers called for the Claimant’s summary dismissal was no proper justification for taking such an approach and it created the appearance of an unfair process.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I do not wish to trespass further into what would truly be the province of the Employment Tribunal if the matter goes there.  The Employment Tribunal is not confined (as I am) to issues of purely procedural unfairness.  However, there is one matter upon which I have already touched that I would mention once more.  The Employment Tribunal will have before it the Claimant’s contract of employment.  Since the obligation on the local authority is “to ensure that the DCS’ … responsibilities are aligned with the guidance in this document” (ie. the statutory guidance to which I referred in paragraph 76 above) this presumably means that the contract to which a DCS is required to sign up spells out the guidance, refers to the statutory guidance or articulates the effect of the guidance in some other words.  I have not seen the contract entered into between the Claimant and Haringey, but a contractual obligation seeking to give effect to the concept of “accountability” in the manner defined in paragraph 4.16 of the statutory guidance (see paragraph 77 above) would be a matter that would require careful consideration in order to determine precisely what her contractual obligations were if “accountability” is a concept that can justify summary dismissal.  I have already alluded to how the concept of “accountability” was given prominence in the Secretary of State’s decision to promulgate the directions of 1 December and to the fact that it was something mentioned specifically by the Appeal Panel in January.  An important issue for the Employment Tribunal may be how that concept plays in the field of the employment contract: I venture to think that it is, in that context, not an entirely straightforward matter (see paragraph 386 above).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Nonetheless, it is clear, in my view, that (i) Ofsted was not carrying out a disciplinary inquiry into the Claimant's conduct as DCS on behalf of the Secretary of State and (ii) he was not performing a true disciplinary function in removing her from her office.  It is unfortunate that words were used at the time that may have created the public perception that this was what happened.  Some of the media reporting will have added to that perception.  The Secretary of State’s true concern, and Ofsted's true ambit of inquiry, was into the working of Haringey's CYPD and the other agencies with responsibility for child protection.  Because of the public reaction to the verdicts in Peter's case and the questions it raised, there was an urgency in finding out whether those agencies were operating effectively (a) because there were other vulnerable children in Haringey whose interests demanded protection and (b) because what had happened raised concerns that in other places across the country the relevant safeguards were not in place.  That judgment made by the Secretary of State has not been called into question.  Although the request to Ofsted to conduct the investigation has been called into question, I cannot see any rational basis for doing so unless the whole venture was a "put up job" to secure a specific result for some ulterior motive.  I cannot reach that conclusion on the evidence before me.</p>

Ofsted cannot be criticised for that.  Unless they went in with preconceived notions of what they would find, the inspectors did the best they could in the difficult circumstances with which they were presented and did raise most of the matters that drove the final conclusions of the report with representatives of Haringey, including the Claimant. The manner in which the final version of the report came to be drafted would not have been revealed in these proceedings if the additional disclosure by Ofsted had not taken place.  Questions have been raised about that process, but it is beyond my legitimate remit to answer those questions.</p>

In the somewhat unusual legal structure whereby the Claimant’s contract of employment was with Haringey, it was Haringey that had the ultimate responsibility for acting fairly in relation to her employment status and her future.   They were responsible for protecting her rights.  I have already made it clear that, in my view, the Secretary of State should not have gone on to express a view about what should happen in that regard.  His statutory role in relation to the Claimant and her Deputy ended when he made the directions he did on 1 December.  If newspapers or other commentators wished to suggest what the outcome should have been, they were entitled to do so.  But the Secretary of State should not have been seen to give support to those views nor, in my view, should he have made critical comments of the Claimant and her Deputy publicly based upon things not in the report and said behind closed doors when they had not had an opportunity to refute them.  And, as I have made clear, those who did have the responsibility for making the relevant decisions should not have been influenced, or have been seen to have been influenced, by such views.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">First, I am not sure to what extent the inter-relation between the Secretary of State’s powers under section 497A and the contractual obligations of a local authority towards an employee who has to be removed from a position because of a direction under that section has been considered by Parliament.  The Court is left having to try to fill a gap in the procedures that is not easy to fill.  There is, as it seems to me, a danger that someone in a position such as that occupied by the Claimant will fall between two stools. (I venture the thought, in passing, that there should be discussions in due course between central government, local government organisations and representatives of those who are employed in positions that might be affected by a direction under section 497A in order to establish a protocol for dealing with this kind of situation if it arises in the future.  I cannot think that any party will truly look back at how matters were handled in this case with complete satisfaction.)</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Second, although her detractors will doubtless never have a good word for her and will say that she has brought everything upon herself, there may be those who fear that the Claimant has been made a scapegoat.  In her appeal hearing at Haringey she said of the day of Prime Minister's Questions and the conversations in the afternoon about her suspension that her "head had been sent for and wasn't delivered and as far as I'm concerned what happened next delivered it."  That neatly sums up the way those who consider she was made a scapegoat would see the position.  It is, of course, no part of my task to decide whether she is right or her detractors are right.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">However, of one thing I am absolutely clear: a concerted mission to make someone a scapegoat for the failings of others or for the failings of a system that was doomed to be characterised as a failure in any event is repugnant to ordinary notions of fairness and justice in a civilised society.  The law will always do what it can to overturn the consequences of such an exercise if it is shown to have occurred.  If there had been a sustainable case that the Ofsted report had been 'made to order' at the instance of, or on behalf of, the Secretary of State and that the results of the inspection were thus either a foregone conclusion or had been manipulated to give grounds for his decision, the outcome of this case would have been different.  Suggestions of such dark processes have been made during the proceedings.  Ofsted’s inept handling of its obligation of candour during the case may at the time it was revealed have appeared to provide a key to an otherwise locked door.  When the further disclosure took place, the suggestions were renewed with greater vigour. However, on the evidence as deployed before me, those suggestions could not be translated into anything of greater substance whatever suspicions, on one interpretation of the material, might have been engendered.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The point simply is this:  the court’s power to intervene in respect of an administrative decision exists to ensure that it is not made unjustly in the sense that, when a fair process is required, the adoption of an unfair process will operate to undo the decision.  For the reasons I have given I have not been persuaded that the grounds for intervention have been made out as against Ofsted and the Secretary of State.  Whether Haringey was unfair in the way it dealt with the Claimant's dismissal (not merely procedurally, but substantively) will, if she pursues the case, be decided ultimately by the Employment Tribunal.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In his powerful closing written submissions, Mr Maurici made a strong plea for the conclusion that the Claimant was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Because my review of the evidence has been limited to a consideration of the written statements and other documentary material, it is impossible for me to reach an informed view about that submission.  It is possible that there is at least a grain of truth in the suggestion.  Had Dr Sabah Al-Zayyat diagnosed correctly Peter's physical condition a few days before he died, the chances are that he would have lived and the Claimant and her colleagues may not have faced what they have had to face as a result. The child protection system in Haringey might in the meantime have acquired at least an established “adequate” status in Ofsted terms before something as tragic as the death of a young child occurred.   Furthermore, if in the immediate aftermath of the verdicts in the criminal case the Claimant had presented a somewhat more overtly apologetic approach at the press conference that day she might not have faced the hostility from some sections of the public that she has faced.  In short periods such as these fates are sealed.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify">6.<marker name="tab"/>The issue relates to the extent to which the Claimant had the opportunity during the course of the Ofsted inspection to address the points of concern arising during that inspection.  It is accepted by all parties that it is <span style="text-decoration:underline">not</span> my task in these judicial review proceedings to adjudicate upon the validity of the conclusions reached by the Ofsted inspectors or to evaluate the evidence upon which they rely.  I would add to this that it is not my responsibility to consider the competence or otherwise of those engaged in the process.  However, one issue that has been raised for consideration is whether the Claimant had a fair opportunity to respond to matters upon which, in due course, critical comment was made in the report upon the basis of which the Secretary of State’s decision was made.  The Claimant’s case is that not even the gist of what was said in the report to be matters of serious concern were communicated to her during the inspection.  Accordingly, her case is that she had no opportunity to respond to them.  Ofsted’s case is and has been that she had been given the opportunity to comment on the central concerns relating to her areas of responsibility in a series of meetings and interviews during the inspection.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify">8.<marker name="tab"/>It is right to say that the issue of fact has existed from the time the evidence was exchanged in the proceedings and, of course, it pre-dated the additional disclosure from Ofsted that has given rise to the recent sequence of submissions.  Indeed it is something upon which detailed submissions were made by all parties, though principally by the Claimant and Ofsted, at the hearing in October.  No party sought an order for cross-examination of the witnesses (which would, in the context of judicial review proceedings, have been unusual in any event) and all parties made submissions based upon the witness statements and the documentary material that had been disclosed, each contending that the contemporaneous documentary material supported their case and undermined that of the other.  </p>

	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify">9.<marker name="tab"/>There has now been further disclosure by Ofsted and some of it undoubtedly reflects on the circumstances in which the inspection took place and the extent to which discussions with the Claimant were or were not feasible during the period of the inspection.  It is argued on the Claimant’s behalf that this adds to her case on the issue I have identified.  Ofsted contends that it does not do so and that there is plenty of material, both in the original disclosure, the Claimant’s own evidence and indeed the new disclosure that supports its case.  Each side to this issue is asking me to resolve the conflict in their favour by reference to the contemporaneous documents.  Mr Maurici, for the Claimant, submits that I should prefer the Claimant’s evidence where it conflicts with that of Ofsted’s witnesses.  Mr Ward, for Ofsted, submits that various points made by the Claimant are “irrelevant, largely misconceived and provide no basis at all upon which to invite [me] to reject Ofsted’s evidence on the contested issues.”</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify">10.<marker name="tab"/>Mr Maurici says that if I do not accept his invitation to prefer the Claimant’s evidence when it conflicts with Ofsted’s witnesses, I should take the unusual (though not unheard of) step of ordering cross-examination of Ofsted’s witnesses.  Mr Ward says that it is too late to take such a course and that it is, in any event, unjustified.  He says that if, contrary to that position, I do order cross-examination, Ofsted would have “no choice but to seek an order for cross-examination of the Claimant”.  Mr Maurici responds to that by saying it is too late for such an application to be made and it is unjustified.  </p>

Because I have not had an opportunity to review all the material, including the new material, I am quite unable to say, one way or the other, whether I can accept the Claimant’s version of events as against the version given by Ofsted’s witnesses.  If I do so, then, of course, her case (subject to any other arguments that arise) gains strength.  If I do not then, on Mr Maurici’s approach, I should direct cross-examination.  </p>

I am, of course, aware of Ofsted’s position in relation to this.  Whilst Haringey in its submissions suggests that there is no basis in the new disclosure for ordering cross-examination of witnesses, the Secretary of State’s submission was silent on the issue.

The costs premise on which we made that submission is not in accordance with Your Lordship's indication, which is to the effect that we would have to make an application for some sort of protective costs order, and we have therefore reconsidered our position having regard to the costs consequences of, and the delay occasioned by, a further oral hearing if one were to take place.</span>

Following such oral evidence a further round of oral and/or written submissions would likely be required as to the impact of the oral evidence on previous submissions and generally. Preparation time for a hearing involving cross-examination of all these witnesses would be substantial. The hearing itself would likely require 4-5 days or more and, it seems to us, would not be possible until some time after Easter.</span>

But the process of disclosure can be costly, time-consuming, oppressive and unnecessary, and … the general rules governing disclosure [have not] been applied to applications for judicial review. Such applications, characteristically, raise an issue of law, the facts being common ground or relevant only to show how the issue arises.

But where the authority's deponent chooses to summarise the effect of a document it should not be necessary for the applicant, seeking sight of the document, to suggest some inaccuracy or incompleteness in the summary, usually an impossible task without sight of the document. It is enough that the document itself is the best evidence of what it says.

Ms Ryan had, as I understand it, made her notes available and yet their full significance had not been appreciated.  There was an issue about whether Mr Hart’s e-mail had previously been disclosed or not, though the ultimate position appears to be that it had not been disclosed.  I am not sure that it matters greatly, though it is not a very edifying spectacle for this kind of issue to swing from one side to the other.</p>

Unless I have overlooked something in the welter of argumentation about the additional disclosure, it was Mr Pullen, not Ms Brown, who revealed the memorandum that she prepared about the circumstances of the inspection that I quoted fully in paragraph 487 above.  It is, of course, Mr Pullen who has, albeit in circumstances that raise questions (see below), produced the sequence of the emerging drafts of the report.  It is very difficult to understand why others in the team were not able to produce drafts even accepting, as I do, that there may have been no particular reason for all members of the team to retain every version of the draft on his or her laptop once the inspection was complete and the report had been finalised.  However, for the purposes of evaluating to what extent, if any, the emerging drafts assist on one of the issues I have had to consider in the case, the important thing is that those drafts have been revealed.  For reasons which I will give later, I am still unclear as to how it was that the specific questions raised on the Claimant’s behalf about these drafts were answered in the varying ways to which I referred at the hearing on 10 November.</p>

I indicated in paragraph 43 that I could not accept Mr Maurici’s submission that I should presume everything against Ofsted because of what he submitted represented the destruction of evidence.  I propose to give my reasons for that shortly, but before doing so I will need to review the evidence given about the instruction to delete e-mails which represents an important background to Mr Maurici’s submission.  Not unnaturally, it is a matter that has caused me considerable concern particularly against the background of the unsatisfactory way in which the issue of the duty of candour on the part of Ofsted has been handled.</p>

This meant keeping such information confidential to the inspection team and relevant managers. We were extremely concerned to avoid unauthorised disclosures of information beyond those individuals, and we felt that the risk of such disclosure was very real. We were, for example, aware that there had been two attempts by reporters to infiltrate child protection conferences in Haringey in the period leading up to the inspection. This made the need to seek to protect the confidentiality of the inspection all the more compelling.</p>

The confidentiality concerns were that, internally, there was the risk that other Ofsted staff not involved with the inspection (and any visitors to the office) might be able to view data on laptop or desk top computer screens, as we work in open plan offices and Ofsted is a large organisation. As such, when high profile issues are being dealt with it is necessary to put in place additional restrictions in order to preserve confidentiality and ensure that there are no unauthorised disclosures.</p>

Mr Ward has argued strongly to the contrary.  If I am being invited to reject the general thrust of Mr Pullen's account in this respect I am unable to do so.  Leaving to one side the fact that I have not heard him give evidence and be challenged about his account, the chances are that those involved in this apparently short-lived episode in November 2008 will have some difficulties recalling the precise sequence of events in November or December 2009 and to that extent some differences at the margins can be anticipated.  I have not detected any major discrepancies.  But irrespective of any view that might be formed about that, it does seem to me that the debate does not advance Mr Maurici's case.  As I observed in my Interim Ruling when mentioning this issue, the fact is that a large number of internal e-mails both before and after 18 November have been disclosed and, whilst I am sure there are some gaps, the question is whether they are significant and whether those gaps are likely to distort the picture to be distilled from all the material available.  I do not think that that is so.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:-0.48in">23.<marker name="tab"/>If the evidence demonstrated that, as the result of Mr Pullen's initial instruction, a large number of potentially highly material electronic communications were erased from the records, then I would accept that it would represent a very serious state of affairs.  However, the preponderance of the evidence before me does not suggest that that occurred.  There is no doubt that some members of the Ofsted team were surprised by Mr Pullen's instruction and regarded it as unprecedented.  I suspect that it was.  But this was a highly unusual inspection conducted against the background of intense press and media interest and where there had been some evidence of members of the press gaining entry to child protection meetings.  It is not difficult to see why an unusual and unprecedented step was taken.  It may not have been wise, and indeed wiser counsels prevailed, but it is at least possible to see why Mr Pullen felt he had to do something.  Unless the situation has been wholly misrepresented in the statements put before me, I do not think I could possibly conclude that material evidence has gone missing, still less that any that has gone missing went missing because of fear of disclosure in these proceedings.  These proceedings were in no-one's contemplation at that time.</p>

However, it is equally to be observed that, apart from Ms Ryan's note, there is no contemporaneous documentary evidence to demonstrate that the instruction was given.

As a matter of fact, that must be correct.  Only Mr Pullen appears to have retained any electronic versions of the emerging drafts, yet these drafts plainly went back and forth through the inspection team and those, like Mr Pullen and others, who were either “quality assuring” what was emerging or contributing to the drafting depending on what view is formed about what each person did.  None of the others has been able to produce an electronic version of any draft – and indeed the “hard” versions of the drafts available were, as I understand it, limited to those that emerged near the very end of the drafting process and were taken to the Secretary of State on 1 December.  This might seem strange. On the other hand, there is nothing intrinsically suspicious about enhancing the memory capacity of a PC by deleting documents when they no longer seem relevant to the task in hand.</p>

I do not think in the end that the Claimant has been prejudiced by the fact that other members of the team have not produced (or did not retain) electronic versions of the emerging report.  Mr Maurici has been able to make detailed submissions by reference to the drafting process on the issue that matters (namely, the extent to which the concerns of the inspectors were discussed with the Claimant during the inspection), some of which I have accepted, others of which I have not.</p>

Obviously, if it was done when the Claimant’s judicial review proceedings were commenced (or even, perhaps, were simply anticipated), that would be a potentially serious matter and might have given rise to the invocation of the presumption to which I have referred above (see paragraph 25).  However, since the history (or, as it seems to me, a very substantial part of the history) has now been traced, all this seems rather academic and I do not think I need pursue it further for the purposes of evaluating the evidence in the case.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:-0.48in">39.<marker name="tab"/>It appears that on 4 and 5 November (the latter being the day I had indicated informally to Counsel that I hoped to be able to hand the judgment down the following week) Mr Pullen discovered the documents that have since been disclosed.  He has said that on 4 November he looked in the 'My Documents' folder on his laptop and found a sub-folder within a folder entitled 'Haringey Review' containing copies of e-mails that he had gathered together for the purposes of a Freedom of Information request.  He printed these e-mails off and gave them to Ofsted's legal team that day.  He also searched his network e-mails and discovered a folder in Microsoft Outlook called 'Haringey Review' containing around 250 e-mails. They were all e-mails, he said, that he had received from other people and so knew that some of them may already have been disclosed by the senders. However, he said that he does not know how he also overlooked this sub-folder previously.<span style="font-size:11.5pt">  </span>He found in this sub-folder a number of e-mails which contained draft copies of the JAR inspection report. As he was aware that he had been asked if copies of drafts existed at an earlier stage in the proceedings he realized, he said, that the e-mails would need to be disclosed urgently to the legal team which is what he did.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:-0.48in">40.<marker name="tab"/>That then is the story behind the discovery of the drafts leading to the final emergence of the draft report, plus certain other documents.  Mr Pullen has apologised unreservedly for overlooking these matters and, of course, for being unintentionally responsible for giving the Claimant's solicitors misleading answers about the existence of the drafts.  His apology must, of course, be accepted and I fully accept that he is a very busy man.  However, the story is hardly a satisfactory one and it raises the question of how vigorous were the efforts, both by the Ofsted team and the legal team, to look for documentation that was plainly present on his laptop.  Mr Maurici is right to say that this discovery did not require any sophisticated retrieval by computer experts.  Presumably, typing in the word 'Haringey' in the general search facility would probably have revealed the folders or the documents.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:-0.48in">41.<marker name="tab"/>I cannot take the matter much further for the purposes of this judgment.  The documents have now been revealed and deployed in the proceedings.  However, I am proposing to raise with the Treasury Solicitor personally the question of whether he is satisfied that proper efforts were made to obtain all documents from Ofsted for the purposes of discharging its duty of candour.  I will want to know to what extent Ms Ryan’s notes, which as Deputy Lead Inspector would inevitably throw some light on the way the inspection progressed, were analysed by the legal team.  It was, of course, only when those notes were looked at in detail that Mr Pullen’s instruction to delete e-mails emerged.  I should like to know why the letter of 8 September (paragraph 33 above) was phrased in the way it was bearing in mind that at that stage the instructions from Ofsted were that no drafts of the report had been retained other than the one taken to the meeting with the meetings on 1 December 2008.  Furthermore, I will want to know how it was that the letter from the Claimant's solicitors of 21 September went missing.  Since each of these matters might raise issues of legal professional privilege, I may have to consider to what extent any reply I receive in relation to these matters can be published.  However, it is right that I should record that I propose to follow this matter up along the lines indicated.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:-0.48in">42.<marker name="tab"/>It is difficult for me to determine where the true responsibility lies for the wholly inadequate way in which Ofsted’s duty of candour was addressed initially in this case.  At the end of the day, it has to represent a collective failure that, frankly, shakes one’s confidence that the scope of the duty was fully understood by those involved.  It appears now to have been rectified, but at some considerable cost, not merely financially, but by way of increasing the anxieties and pressures on the Claimant and delaying the outcome of a case that is of widespread interest.  It should not have happened.</p>
