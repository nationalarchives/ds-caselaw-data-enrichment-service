	      <span style="color:#000000">This is an application for Judicial Review of a decision by the London Borough of Brent (“the council”) to close its Short Breaks Unit at 24 Crawford Avenue earlier than had previously been decided. The unit is one of two residential units run by the council for the provision of short term respite care for disabled children.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000"> In April 2010 the council had decided to relocate both units into a single new Short Break Centre as part of a new Village School for disabled children. First admissions for the new unit were scheduled to take place in December 2012. Following the reduction of local authority funding consequent on the government spending review the new administration in Brent which was elected in May 2010 was faced with an immediate need to make savings to the council’s budget in the order of £37million and in February 2011 the council’s budget for 2011/2012 reduced the Children and Families Department’s budget by £10.5 million in comparison to the financial year 2010/2011. Early closure of Crawford Avenue was identified by the council as a means of saving £517,000 over two years, which savings were said by the council’s Director of Children and Families in a report to the council’s executive dated 23 May 2011 (“the 23 May 2011 report”) to be necessary to achieve a balanced budget.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">The decision to close Crawford Avenue earlier than originally decided was taken by the council’s Executive on 23 May 2011. It was called in by the council’s Overview and Scrutiny Committee (“OSC”) which, at a meeting held on 8 June 2011, rejected a proposal made by councillor Lorber, a member of the committee and, under the previous administration, leader of the council, to recommend to the executive to retain Crawford Avenue until the Village School facility was ready. The OSC split on party lines and councillor Lorber’s proposal was defeated by the Labour councillors who had a majority on the committee. Instead the committee noted the decision made by the executive on 23 May 2011. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">The claim for judicial review is brought by the Claimant who is the mother of a severely disabled 12 year old boy, AP, who uses the short break care facilities provided by Crawford Avenue. The claim is also supported by the parents of six other children with behavioural disabilities who, together with the Claimant, have made witness statements in support of the claim.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">AP has hydrocephalus or water on the brain. He has a ventricular – peritoneal shunt to drain the fluid to relieve pressure on the brain. He has an overactive bladder and has fluid in the ears. He experiences collapsing episodes and is under the care of a heart specialist at Great Ormond Street children’s hospital. His condition causes him to present with challenging behaviour and when he becomes frustrated he lashes out. He has an older brother with whom he shares a room at home. His behaviour is such that his mother needs short breaks from caring from him and his brother needs time and space to himself to study. Until November 2010 AP received 472 hours of short breaks care at Crawford Avenue which was later  reduced to one session of after school care from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. once a week and one session of day care once a month. AP has attended Crawford Avenue since he was five. The attraction to the Claimant of Crawford Avenue is that it provides respite care which she considers is able to deal effectively with AP’s challenging behaviour. In particular because he becomes frustrated and lashes out if he is in a small space she considers that he derives benefit from the large garden and the large sensory room in Crawford Avenue which allows him and other children to move around freely.</span>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">
	      <span style="color:#000000">The Claimant is strongly opposed to the closure of Crawford Avenue. She has a small house and a very small garden and her older son who is 18 shares a room with AP and needs time to himself. She therefore considers that it would be inappropriate to have respite carers in her house and does not wish to receive direct payments from the council to pay for it. Nor does she consider that Clement Close is a proper alternative to Crawford Avenue. Clement Close is the other short care respite residential unit run by the council, whose functions and services are due to be replaced by the new unit in the Village School when it opens in December 2012. Clement Close currently houses physically disabled children. It is not currently suitable for providing services to children with behavioural disabilities and as part of the decision to close Crawford Avenue in October 2011 the council decided to spend £50,000 adapting Clement Close to the needs of children with behavioural disability. However, because of the risks presented by children with behavioural disabilities to children with physical disabilities, in particular those in wheelchairs, it would not be possible even after the proposed adaptation for Clement Close to provide services to children with behavioural and physical disabilities at the same time. The plan was that residential facilities should be provided to each category of child on alternate weeks. The Claimant considers that this would deprive her of the flexibility she currently has to arrange when she would like AP to attend the unit. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">RB is the mother of ZB. ZB is 15 years old and has attended Crawford Avenue since the age of four. ZB currently receives 472 hours a year of respite care at Crawford Avenue including both day and overnight stays. She frequently goes to school from Crawford Avenue and returns there from school. ZB has autism, which her mother states results in her needing routine and a stable environment in familiar surroundings. She has challenging behaviour which means that she can lash out at any time at anybody. She likes to move around freely and paces up and down exhibiting inappropriate behaviour such as taking her clothes off in public, approaching strangers and touching them inappropriately. RB has a small ex-council house which restricts ZB’s movements. She is unable to go into the garden as it is too small and the children on the estate often throw things into the garden and hurl abuse at ZB. RB says that Crawford Avenue provides the space which she cannot provide at home. In 2009 ZB suffered a psychotic breakdown which, according to her mother, was due to her being placed in a school that was not suitable for her needs. She stayed there for one and half years. The breakdown was so severe that ZB attacked her mother and RB’s other daughter had to call the police for help. RB states that it was agreed that ZB could not be left in the house with her or her other daughter as she was uncontrollable. She was taken to Crawford Avenue which offers respite emergency care for situations such as that. </span>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">
	      <span style="color:#000000">RB opposes the closure of Crawford Avenue on the ground that it provides routine structure and a safe environment for ZB. ZB is familiar with the surroundings which for her are like going from home to home. RB asserts that if Crawford Avenue were to close there would be no other suitable unit which could cater for ZB’s complex needs. RB states that she has been told by ZB’s social worker that if Crawford Avenue were to close there would be no other emergency respite provision in Brent. RB is also concerned that if RB’s movement is restricted, as she says it would be at Clement Close which is much smaller than Crawford Avenue, that could have very serious negative consequences. According to RB due to the nature of their challenging behaviour the children who attend Crawford Avenue need space between themselves and she considers that Clement Close lacks the necessary space indoors and outdoors and is too cramped and congested. Clement Close has a very small sensory room that is less than a quarter of the size of that at Crawford Avenue and in the view of RB is not suitable for her daughter’s needs. She is opposed to direct payments as an interim measure because they would not meet her needs as a single parent. She would have to employ someone suitable to assist with ZB who would struggle to get used to the person. Her house is too small and more importantly she would not herself have any respite from looking after ZB if she stayed at home.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">FL is the father of KL, a 17 year old girl who has attended Crawford Avenue since the age of seven. She currently receives 420 hours a year support at Crawford Avenue including both day and overnight stays. She attends Crawford Avenue every Friday after school, which, together with the day care, allows her stimulation which FL says she cannot get at home and which allows both her parents and her younger sister some respite. KL has Classic Autistic Spectrum Disorder, characterised by obsessive behaviour, hyperactivity and no understanding of social norms. FL states that if she does not have routine or familiarity with her surroundings she becomes extremely hyperactive which often results in her needing emergency respite. He states that she has settled in well at Crawford Avenue becoming excited when she knows she is going there. He is of the view that Clement Close cannot meet her needs and states that he would not allow her to attend there, fearing the repercussions as she does not respond well to changes in her routine. If Crawford Avenue closes FL states that he would have no alternative but to make arrangements to have KL brought home from school on a Friday to the detriment of her and her family. He states that this would be to the detriment of his 15 year old daughter who is preparing for her GCSEs because when KL is around all members of the family have to supervise her intensely to ensure that she does not put herself in danger. For that reason he is opposed to direct payments and asserts that the family would lose its right to respite completely. He feels that the council has not thought through these changes and has not assessed the impact they will have on the children and their families. FL has made it clear to the council that his family are not in favour of direct payments.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">JL is the father of JAL, a 13 year old girl who has attended Crawford Avenue since the age of six. She currently receives 472 hours a year support at Crawford Avenue including both day and over night stays. She frequently goes to school from Crawford Avenue and returns to Crawford Avenue from school. JAL suffers from Kabuki Syndrome which is a mixture of autism and delayed cognitive skills. JL says that her condition results in her needing familiarity and routine in a safe and spacious environment. He is opposed to his daughter attending Clement Close which he considers could never replace Crawford Avenue as a respite unit. Both he and his wife are adamant that they will not be sending her to Clement Close or accepting direct payments as they do not consider that would give them respite and quality time to spend with the rest of their family. He considers that Clement Close is not fit for purpose for his daughter because it is too small and has no proper garden, his daughter needing a lot of space to move around as she can become extremely agitated and lash out in restricted spaces. In addition he considers that Clement Close is too long a distance from his home. Crawford Avenue is just around the corner which is very convenient for JL and his wife and something he considers of particular importance if JAL has an outburst and they are in need of emergency respite. He considers that if, in addition to the disruption caused by the temporary arrangements for her full time care pending the opening of the Village School, his daughter had to move to Clement Close for respite care it would cause her and the other children to suffer unnecessarily. His daughter is a very sensitive child who does not like change and he states that it is a well known fact and his experience that children with behavioural difficulties cannot cope with change. He considers that the impact of having to move and be placed in unfamiliar surroundings will cause the children to become extremely agitated and tantrums to increase with an adverse effect on the rest of the family. His daughter has already been adversely affected by the break up of her parents’ marriage.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">AT is the mother of TT, a 13 year old boy who has attended Crawford Avenue since the age of 11. He currently receives 472 hours a year of support at Crawford Avenue including both day and over night stays. TT attends Crawford Avenue every Wednesday after school. TT has Classic Autistic Spectrum Disorder, which is characterised by obsessive behaviour, hyperactivity and violence. If he does not have routine or is unfamiliar with his surroundings he becomes extremely hyperactive, which often results in him needing emergency respite. AT is opposed to her son attending Clement close which she considers to be unsuitable for his needs. TT is very active and needs a lot of space and AT considers that Clement Close is too small and that her son and the other users would no longer be able to move freely from  room to room as they can at Crawford Avenue. AT states that when the special needs school which TT attends learned about the closure of Crawford Avenue in July 2011 it expressed a number of concerns about the effect the closure will have on TT. AT states that the professionals at that school advised that TT needs consistent predictable routines and that any change beyond TT’s control will have detrimental effects on his behaviour and progress and cause considerable anxiety and erratic behaviour. Familiarity is crucial for children with autism. AT is opposed to direct payments as she works full time. She has two other children aged two and nine and would not be able to use direct payment to organise alternative care for TT. If Crawford Avenue closes she states that she will have no respite care and will be unable to spend quality time with her other children. TT’s behaviour has a huge impact on her family. Her children and AT are very isolated as she does not have family living nearby to support them in difficult times. </span>

From the ages of 5-11 JB attended Clement Close but, according to AB, he had to leave Clement Close as it was not deemed suitable for his needs. He has Global Development Delay which means that he is severely incontinent and unable to speak or eat solid food. His father says that he is mobile and a very happy young person able to express his wishes and feelings in a non-verbal manner. However if he does not get his way he can become agitated and violent. He was allocated to Crawford Avenue because he became more mobile and had a tendency to hit and lash out at other children especially those who were wheelchair bound. JB currently receives 572 hours of day care and overnight stay at Crawford Avenue. AB is strongly opposed to the closure of Crawford Avenue. He says that JB is very much an outdoor person who spends many hours in the garden and moving from room to room at Crawford Avenue. He says that it was decided that JB would benefit from being at Crawford Avenue as the unit has better facilities and activities that are suited to his needs as a growing young person. AB regards the decision to relocate JB and others back to Clement Close as a backward step as Crawford Avenue was the place suggested to suit his needs. The closure of Crawford Avenue is very distressing to AB’s family as JB really enjoys being there and has benefited immensely from it. In addition his family has benefited from the respite as AB has a daughter aged 11. AB’s wife died last summer and as a single parent and step-parent AB has been determined to do the best he can for both his children. He is opposed to direct payments as an alternative to residential respite care for JB because of his other family responsibilities.</span>

He cannot communicate at all, walk or sit up or care for himself and is a wheelchair user. He is fed through a gastronomy tube. Caring for him is said by PM to be very challenging and exhausting. At the age of three he was assessed and allocated respite hours to relieve the pressure from his family. PM states that it took KM a long time to settle and the carers at Clement Close a very long time to understand him as a disabled person. He has settled very well at Clement Close attending the centre on a regular basis. However, when he is at Clement Close the staff make sure not to have any other child of similar needs around so as to ensure they are able to address his needs to the maximum. PM is concerned that the closure of Crawford Avenue would have a negative effect on KM because emergency provision would be at a new unknown centre where staff do not know KM. PM is concerned that once Clement Close and Crawford Avenue are combined it will no longer be possible for her to take a break and make a block booking at Clement Close. She is also concerned that children with varying needs should not be mixed as there can be extreme outbursts of violence leaving many defenceless and raising issues of health and safety when mixing the two groups. </span>

If it was irrational, there was no need for the court to adjudicate on the alternative argument that there was a breach of section 149 of the Equality Act since that challenge was based on the same arguments. By the same token if the irrationality challenge failed the allegation that section 149 was breached must also fail. While Mr Greatorex did not demur from that analysis, he emphasised throughout that the sole basis on which the legality of the decision to close Crawford Avenue was now sought to be challenged was an irrationality ground for which permission had not been given by Collins J on 6 September 2011. The grounds for which permission had been given had subsequently been abandoned.

	      <span style="color:#000000"> October 2011 the Claimant had served a document entitled “Claimant’s additional decision to be judicially reviewed and further additional grounds of judicial review”. In it the Claimant sought in the alternative to challenge the council’s decision to implement the decision to close Crawford Avenue and to transfer existing service users to Clement Close before Clement Close has been refurbished and alternative placements have been identified and assessed as suitable for all current users of Crawford Avenue including suitable emergency placements. It was alleged that the council’s initial intention had been to implement the closure decision on 9 September 2011 but that that had been prevented by the injunction granted by Collins J on 9 September 2011. The new challenge was said to have become necessary in the light of the council’s evidence served on 28 September 2011 and instructions taken from the Claimant and other opponents of the closure of Crawford Avenue which suggested that the council proposed to close Crawford Avenue immediately if the injunction of Collins J was lifted without ensuring that adequate alternative provision is in place. It was alleged that the council is under a duty to provide the Claimant and the other service users at Crawford Avenue with short breaks service in accordance with their current levels of assessed need under section 17(2) and Schedule 2, para 6 of the Children Act 1989. It was therefore alleged that the council cannot lawfully close Crawford Avenue if that leads to a reduction in the hours of short breaks care without carrying out a lawful reassessment of the needs of current service users at Crawford Avenue both under the Children Act 1989 and in accordance with the Care Planning Placement and Case Review (England) Regulations 2010/959.

	      <span style="color:#000000">In the summary the report proposed a restructuring of the residential short breaks services currently provided at the Crawford Avenue and Clement Close units. The proposals were said to be in line with the longer term strategy for reducing residential provision and increasing more flexible options for families for short breaks which are community based. It was said that this is being achieved through promoting the take up of direct payments and working in partnership with families and providers to develop skills and increase community provision. The move to direct payments was said to be reflected nationally and to be central to the council’s Aiming High Joint Commissioning Strategy. It was said that the eligibility criteria for the provision of short breaks had been reviewed in consultation with parents and remained unchanged. If it were not possible to provide the assessed level of short breaks provision through Brent’s in house residential provision alternative short breaks arrangements would be made.</span>

There is no lift in the property and it is therefore not able to accommodate children with mobility difficulties. Some recent improvements had been made to the garden following recommendations from OFSTED. Crawford Avenue was said to have a higher staff establishment than Clement Close. The property at Clement Close was said to be not ideal although fully accessible to disabled children and to have been improved last year through a Youth Opportunity Fund grant with a sensory room and garden play equipment.</span>

It was said that the transfer of the current service to the new centre would require consultation with staff and parents. It was planned that the new unit located on the Village School site would be able to provide overnight care for between 6-8 children and be able to offer a service to children with all types of need (that is to say including both children with physical disabilities and children with behavioural difficulties). There would be four places available for short breaks for Brent children and the remaining places would be available to other local authorities who would be charged for that service.</span>

The proposal to close Crawford Avenue was said to have been made in order to protect and increase alternative more cost efficient short breaks services and to have been in keeping with the council’s long term strategy to reduce residential provisions by offering more community based alternatives. It was said that many local authorities do not provide their own residential short breaks services and that nationally there is a drive to increase personal budgets (directs payment) and reduce the time that children spend in residential care away from their families and communities. Under the recommended proposals it was said that the council would still retain an in house residential option at Clement Close which would continue to provide overnight care for the majority of the most vulnerable of the client group. Furthermore it was stated that, having regard to the costs of maintaining Crawford Avenue, the shortcomings in its sustainability and the longer term plans to transfer all the respite provision from both Crawford Avenue and eventually Clement Close, the proposal to close Crawford Avenue was a cost efficient option and consistent with the wider policy objectives. </span>

It was said that there has not been a corresponding decline in the demand for places at Crawford Avenue for children with significant challenging behaviour although there had been a reduction in the number of parents requesting overnight care with parents preferring day care support. It was said that the consistent demand is because there are limited number of providers and carers with the appropriate skills and training, available to parents of children with challenging need in the community. There was however said to be an indication that the market is beginning to grow to meet those needs.

There would however always be a small group of children who would require such residential breaks. Further growth in the direct payment budgets had been considered as part of the 2011/12 budget setting process and the service was reported to have benefited from growth of £300,000 which would be used to meet the growing demand for direct payments. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Brent was said to be one of a declining number of local authorities which still manage their own residential provisions. In other authorities when overnight provision is required that was said to be provided either through commissioned placements in residential units, foster homes or direct payments to families where they can purchase their own overnight care. Under the heading “impact of the proposal” the report stated that, because it is not safe or practical to mix children with severe physical disabilities in the same building and space as more boisterous children with challenging behaviour, the only safe way that this could be managed in Clement Close would be to offer separate sessions. It was proposed “at this point” to offer alternative weeks to each group of children. The final arrangements of how the children would be safely managed in one unit would be agreed after consultation with staff and parents as part of the managing change process following a decision on the proposals. With the implementation of the proposals there would be overall decreases in the hours available for in house short break care by approximately 25-30%. Clement Close would be able to increase its occupancy through an increase in staffing levels which would enable the unit to offer overnight care to four children every night. The children who currently received overnight care would be given priority over children who currently only received day care. This would mean that the main reduction in in–house respite care would be for children receiving day and after school provision. It was said that those families would however be provided with alternative short break arrangements through an increase in direct payments, enabling them to directly commission support from private and voluntary groups or by domiciliary care at home. Where it was not possible to provide overnight stays and where such provision was assessed as necessary, and alternate overnight placement out of borough would be sought. Those situations were said to be unpredictable but might result in additional costs to the council.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Currently it was reported that parents were offered a number of hours of short breaks at the unit (apparently a reference to both Crawford Avenue and Clement Close) which was dependent on their needs which were identified through an assessment. Families were normally offered 472 hours if they were assessed as requiring overnight stays which was the equivalent to 28 nights each year. For families requiring day care breaks there was normally an allocation of 260 hours which was the equivalent of five hours per week. The actual booking of the breaks was then agreed between the unit manager and the parent and was dependent on the capacity for the unit, the need of the child, the time that the parent wanted and the age and ability of other children booked in during that period. It was said that although there might be a loss of flexibility for some families, all families would be offered alternative short breaks provision based on their allocation of hours. That would be provided through direct payments or care at home. Where parents who had been assessed for overnight short breaks did not wish to take those alternative options other over night options such as foster care or out of borough resources would be considered. It was reported that both units were currently able to take children in an emergency but that this would not be possible when the service was provided from Clement Close as a child with physical disability could not be accommodated safely if the emergency happened in a challenging behaviour week. In that event provision would need to be made through the Commissioning team for an emergency placement with a foster carer or in an out of borough residential resource. Similarly there had been times when children had had to be accommodated for an interim period as was the current situation at Clement Close due to a family emergency. In those situations an alternative provision would have to be commissioned at additional cost to the local authority. </span>

Those families and organisations were individually sent letters and questionnaires and current users of the service were offered a choice of three meetings with senior managers and an open morning to view Clement Close was arranged. Ten families attended those sessions. There were 16 responses from parents and carers and 24 responses from service users who would be eligible to use the service. There was a 19% response rate from parents and carers who currently used the service and a 6% response for the potential service users. The families who responded were reported as having the following concerns: (a) the mixing of the different groups of children; (b) the ability of their child because of the nature of their disability to cope with the change and then to have to move again the following year to another new building; (c) the loss of flexibility of provision and reduction in hours available at council residential respite units; (d) a belief that they would not be offered emergency care if required; (e) a concern the Clement Close would not be suitable for the needs of children with challenging behaviour because it is too small and (f) a belief that alternative provisions would not meet their family’s need because of poor experience of care packages, preference for their child to be cared for in a residential setting rather than with carers in their own home and lack of trained carers in the community.

	      <span style="color:#000000">Under the heading “mitigation of concerns” the following points were made in the report. (a) It had never been the intention to allow the different groups of children to be offered the service at the same time. Children would be offered a place when there was peer group suitability, that is to say children with physical health needs and mobility difficulties would not be offered a session with children with more complex behavioural challenges. (b) It was appreciated that any move for a disabled child could pose challenges but the staff were sensitive to the needs of the children and would work at the individual child’s pace with planned introductions and careful monitoring. (c) There should not be any loss in short breaks hours as alternative provision would be provided to meet a family’s assessed allocated hours. In order to ensure the careful managing of a child during its stay with a peer group and to meet the needs of the family there would inevitably need to be some negotiation around times and flexibility. The only fully flexible option for parents were direct payment when parents were in control of when and where they had their break. (d) Emergency care would still be provided but it might not be possible within the unit. (e) It was acknowledged that Clement Close is a smaller unit with less garden space than Crawford Avenue. However the unit had a minibus and was close to parks and Willesden Green leisure centre. Staff would make better use of community facilities and outside spaces to compensate for the more limited accommodation. (f) Support would be given to parents if they chose alternative provision whether through direct payments or care at home. The council used a number of care providers and had quality standards and would attempt to assist, negotiate and/or resolve all problems with care providers and/or change providers if families were dissatisfied. Council officers were currently working with providers to support the training and recruitment of carers. There would however always be a small number of parents whose preference was for a residential unit and in exceptional cases based on assessed needs alternative residential short break provisions would continue to be commissioned. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Under the heading “financial implications” the report stated that the proposed savings from the proposal were £190,000 in 2011/12 and four years savings of £327,000 in 2012/13. The savings would arise from staff reductions of approximately eight full time equivalent posts. Those savings formed an important element of the total savings planned by the Children and Families department to meet its departmental budget set for 2011/12 and if they were not realised other compensating savings would need to be identified to stay within that budgetary limit. There was a risk of additional costs. In an exceptional emergency situation a child who previously would have been offered an emergency bed in one of the units would have to be placed in an out of borough provision. Non-staffing savings in relation to rent had already been factored into the financial plan set out in the report for developing the new unit at the Village School site and could not be counted as savings contributing to the Department’s savings for 2011/12. The estimated £50,000 cost of adapting Clement Close to meet health and safety requirements would need to be met from existing budgets.</span>

The duty was said to be to provide an appropriate level and range of services for children in need. Assessment had to be undertaken and eligibility criteria could be used to determine provision of service. Services under section 17 might include cash and accommodation. Paragraph 6 of Schedule 2 of the Children Act 1989 was said to impose a duty on the local authority to provide breaks from caring to assist parents and others who provide care for disabled children. Reference was also made to the Breaks for Careers of Disabled Children Regulations 2010 which came into effect on 1 April 2011. Those regulations were said to provide that in the performance of the duty under the Act the local authority must have regard to the needs of carers who would be unable to continue to provide care unless breaks were given and the needs of carers who would be able to care for their disabled children more effectively if breaks were given to enable them to undertake training, education or leisure activities, carry out day to day tasks and meet the needs of other children in the family. The Regulations were said to provide that local authorities must as so far as is reasonably practicable provide a range of day care, over night care and services available to assist carers.

Those steps included steps to take account of the persons’ disabilities. Due regard to the need to eliminate discrimination advance equality and foster good relations must form an integral part of the decision making process when considering and making decisions on the provision of services for children and families.

	      <span style="color:#000000">The report advised that there is no prescribed manner in which the equality duty must be exercised. However the council must have an adequate evidence base for its decision making. That could be achieved by means including engagement with the families who used or were eligible to use the service and other interest groups by gathering details and statistics on who used the respite service and how it was used. The report stated that the service in question was one which by its nature directly affected those children with disabilities and their families. The potential equality impact of the proposed changes to short break respite service for children with challenging behaviour and disabilities had been assessed and the assessment was attached as an appendix and summarised under the heading “diversity implications” in the main report. Councillors were advised that a careful consideration of that assessment was one of the key ways in which they could show “due regard” to the relative matters. Where it was apparent from the analysis of the information that the policy would have an adverse effect on equality then adjustments should be made to avoid that effect. Councillors were advised that the duty was not to achieve the objective or take the steps set out in section 149 but rather to bring those important objectives relating to discrimination into consideration when carrying out their public functions which included functions relating to children and families. “Due regard” was said to mean the regard that is appropriate in all the particular circumstances in which the authority is carrying out its functions. There must be a proper regard for the goals set out in section 149 but at the same time councillors must also pay regard to any countervailing factors which it is proper and reasonable for them to consider. Budgetary pressures, economics and practical factors were said often to be important. The weight of those countervailing factors in the decision making process was said to be a matter for councillors in the first instance. Under the heading “Diversity Implications” it was reported that Crawford Avenue and Clement Close had a diverse ethnic representation as over 70% of the children who currently received a service from the units were from ethnic minority communities. There would be an impact on that client group by the closure of Crawford Avenue in that there would be less in house provision of residential short break respite care places by approximately 25 to 30%. However there would be no reduction in the number of hours of respite provision made available to the service users and where the reduced number of places in the units resulted in a shortfall in places alternative means of respite care such as direct payments to commission respite provision, care at home, foster care and in some circumstances residential placement in non council owned units would be provided. The Children and Families department would actively assist families in the identification of alternative respite arrangements. It was recognised that the flexibility currently offered to families would be more difficult to achieve although that would be progressively improved with the development of personal budgets. The council would therefore mitigate as far as possible the adverse impacts by offering families alternative provisions as detailed in the body of the report.</span>

That would allow growth and expansion of alternative short breaks options for families such as direct payments and care in the home. As a result of the government autumn spending review which reduced funding to the council an internal review of all expenditure in the service was carried out. A number of options were considered and priority given to retaining services that provided the most cost-effective service and those that were the most highly valued by the majority of children with disabilities and their families i.e. holiday play scheme provision. One of the options considered was said to be restructuring the way residential short break services were currently provided.</span>

Families would continue to have a choice of short breaks and alternative non-residential provisions would be expanded to meet the additional demands for those families who wanted it. Residential short break provision would be targeted to those most in need and would be consistent with the services eligibility criteria and the council's equality policy. The eligibility criteria had recently been reviewed in consultation with parent carers and was sent out to all parents who requested an assessment. It was based on a matrix of need. The council would continue to provide residential care under the Children Act 1989 duties for children and families in need.</span>

It was anticipated that there might be some loss in hours at the unit for some families who currently used the unit. In order to mitigate those effects the council would work with families to minimise them by direct payments, care at home and overnight stays with approved foster families and for the most vulnerable overnight accommodation in out of borough provisions, for example hospices or residential schools with short breaks facilities. Residential or out of borough provision was more costly but the council has a duty to provide accommodation when there were significant concerns about the welfare of a child. As many of the current users were single parent families consideration would be given to the full assessment of the needs of any specific impact brought out through a reduced overnight service at the unit. It was not possible to determine the number of families who would be negatively impacted at that stage as individual consultation was necessary to determine whether alternative short breaks options would meet their needs. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">In relation to emergency care, the EIA acknowledged that it might not be possible to offer emergency care at Clement Close when that was required. However it was also acknowledged that the council had a duty under the Children Act 1989 to provide emergency accommodation and stated that it would in such situations provide an alternative provision for example foster carers or an out of borough residential placement. It was intended that the unit at Clement Close would be able to offer full overnight occupancy (four bedrooms) which was a higher occupancy than that currently achieved. A limited historic budget had meant that both units had rarely been able to achieve full occupancy on a regular basis. The average occupancy was around 70% for Clement Close and 80% for Crawford Avenue. Crawford Avenue had been closed for two nights a week since November 2010 to reduce its budget overheads. The number of children who could be offered an overnight service in the future would depend on their care package, which would vary dependent on the assessed needs of the child and their family. Based on an average of two nights per month the unit at Clement Close if adequately staffed could offer 58 children an overnights service. Families would be individually consulted with about using alternative short breaks services which could include increased direct payments, care at home and breaks in family or for the most vulnerable other out of borough residential settings. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">In answer to the question whether if in its judgment the proposal had an adverse impact that impact could be justified the EIA stated that the impact of the closure of Crawford Avenue could be justified in that there was a need to make financial savings in the order of £517,000 over the next two years in order to achieve a balanced budget and there were already long term plans in place based on the decision of the Executive dated 12 April 2010 to move to one unit. It was stated that the proposal would mitigate the impact on the provision of residential short breaks for families by ensuring that there were alternative short breaks options for families. The council had increased its budget for 2011/12 for direct payments and care at home support. Care at home and direct payments were used by many more families than those who used the short break units. Direct payments were currently used by 105 families. Such payments were made available directly to parents following an assessment of needs. They could be used to purchase breaks which included the employment of personal carers and other services. Care at home services were provided directly by the council by agency workers who supported the parents in carrying out personal care and also provided short breaks. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">In answer to the question what was the justification for the proposal the EIA stated that a review of services was carried out and alternative service reductions were considered. However the closure of Crawford Avenue was considered the most efficient reduction and would affect numerically the least number of families as the majority could be offered alternative provision. The effect of not closing the unit would be to make savings from current packages of care which would numerically affect more families and would not be consistent with their assessed needs. With reduced support many more families would have had difficulties managing and would be more likely to suffer health and other adverse effects which would increase the demand for out of borough residential schools and permanent care placements. It was also stated that the council was aware that many local authorities do not provide their own residential short breaks services and that nationally there is a drive to increase personal budgets (direct payments) and reduce the time that children spend in residential care away from their families and communities. The council by the proposal would still retain a residential option for families which with increased and better trained staff and an effective and efficient management would continue to be able to provide overnight care for the most vulnerable families in Brent.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">At the meeting of the council Executive on 23 May 2011 at which the decision to close Crawford Avenue was taken FL addressed the meeting on behalf of a number of parents / guardians of children who use the Crawford Avenue centre who opposed the proposal. He expressed a concern that the proposal was driven by the need to save money and said that children in Brent currently using both Crawford Avenue and Clement Close would have reduced levels of access. The 23 May 2011 report was introduced by Councillor Arnold, the lead Councillor for Children and Families. She said that although the government spending review had reduced available levels of funding, the council was still trying to retain the option of offering residential breaks within the borough which was not the case in all local authorities. The eligibility criteria remained unchanged. She said that it was likely that all available places at Clement Close would be used so that any emergency provision would have to be out of borough. The Director of Children and Families advised that the estimated costs for works to Clement Close had reduced by almost half to £27,000. In answer to questions from Councillor Gladbaum, the chair of the Children and Families Overview and Scrutiny Committee, as to why Crawford Avenue had been chosen and what alternative provision outside Brent there would be, the Director of Children and Families stated that the council was trying to ensure that the facilities were suitable for all children and that to close Clement Close would not yield the same level of financial savings. Moving to alternative forms of provision had not been straightforward but direct payments were being promoted and there had been some successes. She felt it was likely that provision for emergency placements would need to be sought outside the borough. That was common practice in many local authorities. He said that the new respite centre at the Village School was due to be available towards the end of 2012, earlier than the school itself which was due to open in September 2013. Councillor Arnold said that there has been a funding reduction of £4 million leaving local authorities to prioritise needs. The minute of the meeting recorded that “she assured that no child would be left without some form of respite.” The deputy manager of Crawford Avenue told the meeting that the number of hours offered to families on an annual basis for overnight stays was in excess of the 472 hours referred to in the 23 May 2011 report as that did not account for holidays. Additionally emergency care was very expensive, 1200 hours having already been provided as of May 2011.</span>

She said that more details were needed as to how Clement Close would accommodate the additional users and asked if it was feasible to delay the closing of Crawford Avenue until 2012. Councillor Lorber queried why Barnardos had already been given notice of termination of lease while the decisions had been called in. Whilst the original decision to move to the Village School had been to improve service and increase efficiency he felt that the current proposals primarily focussed on costs. He asked for clarification as to where emergency cases would be accommodated once Crawford Avenue closed. The requirement for two successive moves would be too disruptive for both the users and their parents and Clement Close would not be able to provide an adequate service. He felt that the proposal should be reconsidered to see what was the best way to provide the service until the Village School opened. Councillor Ashraf, the chair of the committee, acknowledged that personalisation was being promoted but said that there were a number of parents who did not wish such provision and he asked whether facilities such as a sensory room could be provided through direct payments. Although there were financial reasons behind the proposals he stressed that Crawford Avenue was very popular with users whilst the needs of their parents also needed to be taken into consideration. Clement Close would not be suitable for those with learning and behavioural difficulties. Councillor Choudhry, not a member of the committee, felt that it was imperative that the council provided emergency overnight accommodation.

The decision to bring forward the closure of Crawford Avenue was unavoidable because of budget pressures. Children and Families were required to make overall savings of £12.5 million, meaning that many difficult decisions needed to be made. If the closing of Crawford Avenue were delayed then savings would need to be made elsewhere within the Children and Families budget. The assistant director Achievement and Inclusion Children and Families said that in respect of direct payment providers a network was in place although he acknowledged the need to expand the list of potential providers. Whilst there was to continue to be an overall shift to personalisation, the need to provide short breaks provision on a residential basis was recognised and for that reason the centre would remain in Brent to provide that. The impact on users and their parents of closing Crawford Avenue was appreciated but Clement Close had been fully risk assessed and deemed fit for purpose to accommodate the users from Crawford Avenue. He confirmed that emergency cases were currently accommodated at Crawford Avenue or Clement close and that in future such cases could be accommodated in out of borough locations while Clement Close might also be available for such provision.

	      <span style="color:#000000">The issue was addressed in a second witness statement by Ros Morris, the head of planning and resources in the social care section of the Children and Families Department of the council dated 28 September 2011. In that statement she responded to the Claimant’s first request for further information. In answer to the question how many alternative providers of short breaks services there are in Brent or within reasonable distance which families of service users might access, whether on an emergency basis or by using direct payments, she stated that there are seven domiciliary care agencies in Brent which provide domiciliary care for children with disabilities including respite/short breaks service. They can provide care at home, including on an emergency basis but do not provide residential respite care. A number of current users of Crawford Avenue and Clement Close attend schools which offer residential respite care (but not on an emergency basis), and two private providers of residential respite care in Finchley and Ilford (including on an emergency basis). She said there is also one other new private provider in Hounslow which the council would be evaluating shortly. There were also a number of providers of short breaks services (play schemes) during school holidays. She said the list is not and could not be exhaustive because the direct payments could be used by parents to purchase any other sort of short beaks provisions. </span>

However all users of Crawford Avenue and Clement Close would continue to receive the level of short break care which they have been assessed as needing, whether by way of direct payments or otherwise.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">In relation to the impact, for current in-borough service users seeking alternative placements once Crawford Avenue is closed, of any service users of Crawford Avenue or Clement Close from out of Brent, Ms Morris stated that there were no such out of borough users of either Crawford Avenue or Clement Close in 2009 and one each in 2010 and 2011, but they were both originally Brent residents who continued to use Crawford Avenue for a limited time after moving to neighbouring boroughs. At present there were no service users from out of the borough placed at either Crawford Avenue or Clement Close and that was expected to continue. She said that the council considered that the proposal to provide services at Clement Close on alternate weeks for physically disabled service users and those who are behaviourally challenged was feasible. It was a provisional plan and there would be flexibility to adjust it once parent’s choices had been made. At the moment of the current users of Crawford Avenue and Clement Close 65% were behaviourally challenged, including those with autism, and 35% were physically disabled. Finally she stated that the council did not anticipate any significant change in the demand for short breaks services in the short term 12 to 15 month period between the proposed closure of Crawford Avenue and the opening of the Village School care facility. The council anticipated that the use of direct payments and care at home facilities would increase. She said that this was a different point to that made in the April 2010 report which stated that it had been projected that there was likely to be an increase in the number of children over the medium term requiring special educational need provision in Brent.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">In her second witness statement Ms Morris also responded to the Claimant’s proposed additional grounds of judicial review, namely that the council acted irrationally and/or in breach of section 149 of the Equality Act in failing to obtain information concerning alternative provision of short breaks care. Those grounds were advanced in the documents served on 13 September 2010 on the basis that the decision to close was based on two assumptions said not to be supported by evidence: first that the closure of Crawford Avenue would not lead to a reduction in the number of hours of short breaks care that each of the 67 current users of the service would receive; and second (the assumption upon which the first assumption was said to be based) that alternative means of provision would be available, namely a combination of direct payments, foster carers and out of borough placements in alternative residential settings, to meet the assessed need of all service users and their families. The Claimant asserted that there is no evidence that before making its decision the council established whether in fact the assessed needs of all 67 users of Crawford Avenue could be met by those alternative means of provision. It was submitted that direct payments are not an alternative means of meeting assessed needs but rather an alternative means by which services to meet such needs are commissioned and paid for. If a child has an assessed need for short breaks care that must be provided in some suitable physical environment with suitably qualified staff. If short breaks care was to be provided in some other environment – whether an out of borough residential placement, foster care, or in the service user’s own home – it was still necessary for the council to satisfy itself that such placements were available and suitable for the service user before reaching its decision. Reliance was placed on the covering letter dated 3 March 2011 sent by the council to service users inviting consultation which stated “that the proposal to relocate Crawford Avenue short breaks service to Clement Close from September 2011 would “result in a reduction of service provided to users of both units.” Neither the letter nor the questionnaire attached explained what such alternative means might be other than to ask whether service users would consider moving to a direct payment scheme. The EIA dated 13 April 2011 was said to recognise that the closure of Crawford Avenue might lead to a loss in hours </span>
	      <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#000000">at the unit for some families </span>
	      <span style="color:#000000">(emphasis added). No detail was said to have been given as to how in practice the alternative means of provision referred to in that document which it was said would mitigate that loss, namely direct payments, care at home, overnight stays with approved foster families and out of borough provision in residential placements (hospices, residential schools with short breaks facilities) were to operate.</span>

Reliance was further placed on Councillor Gladbaum’s statement at the OSC meeting on 8 June 2011 that there was no evidence as to how the alternative means of provision would operate in practice and his recommendation that more evidence was needed to show that the network-based system was sufficiently developed to enable direct payments to work effectively in the light of the reduced residentially based short beaks provisions and the fact that her suggestion that a list of out of borough providers and their associated costs be made available was not taken up. </span>

She said that not only are direct payments perfectly proper means of ensuring that such provision is made, it is increasingly popular with parents. The council she said is one of a declining number of local authorities that still manage their own residential provision. Other authorities provide it through commissioned placements or direct payment. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Ms Morris gave the following explanation of the assessment process. In relation to care plans she said that an assessment of the needs of the child and his parents/carers is undertaken at the outset and it is then decided as to how best to meet the needs and what resources are required, taking into account parental preferences and the department’s eligibility criteria. In relation to children with disabilities, such resources could include respite care, direct payments, care at home, nursery provision, family support and parenting work. The amount of service provision, for example the number of hours of respite care to be provided is determined by the needs and the eligibility criteria. The needs assessment and care plans of each child receiving respite care would remain unchanged by the council’s decision to close Crawford Avenue as the criteria of the council’s provision of respite care remained unchanged and the council had stated that it would continue to meet its statutory duties.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Ms Morris clarified the 23 May 2011 report in two respects. First she said that if following the review of placement options with parents there was greater demand for respite provision for those children with challenging behaviour than those with physical disabilities the provision at the new refurbished Clement Close could easily be organised at a higher ratio than alternate weeks. Second she said that the provision of emergency respite care had never been one of the criteria of the core service delivery of either Crawford Avenue or Clement Close. However on occasions if emergency respite care has been required and there had been spaces at the appropriate unit and this would not impact adversely on the planned respite then that had been made available. If Crawford Avenue closed she said the same would apply in relation to Clement Close: that is to say emergency respite care would be provided where possible, but where it was not, it would be provided in the private and voluntary sector as had been the case over the last three to four years when either Crawford Avenue or Clement Close had not been available for the required emergency respite at the time. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">In response to a request to identify the schools and private providers of alternative residential respite care in Finchley, Ilford and Hounslow referred to in Ms Morris’ second statement, it was said that the residential schools referred to are Pield Heath House Residential School at Pield Heath House in Uxbridge Middlesex and Sybil Elgar School at Havelock Road, Southall Middlesex. The alternative residential respite providers were Buckets and Spades at 1 Fairholme Gardens, in Finchley Barnet and MIG House in Ilford. The address of the Lighthouse, indirectly referred to by Ms Morris, had been obtained and was in fact based in Surbiton and not in Hounslow. In response to a request to confirm the capacity in terms of numbers of children that can be accommodated at any one time of each placement and the number of vacancies currently available at each one it was stated that Buckets and Spades in Finchley can provide short break respite care for up to a maximum of nine children but this is dependent on whether the children are mobile. If the children in the placement are all mobile then the unit can accommodate up to six children. The vacancies were dependent on the child’s profile and needs and whether the child is mobile or not as the unit can offer room sharing if the children are not mobile. MIG house in Ilford is registered to accommodate up to eight children for both long term and respite care. It is currently supporting four children from various other local authorities on a long term basis. There are currently three vacancies at the unit. The information provided by the Lighthouse was that they can cater for up to six children with either learning disabilities or autistic spectrum disorder. In relation to the residential schools, the issues of capacity and vacancy were said not to arise as it is very rare that a residential school would agree to provide respite care for a child who does not attend the residential school. It was said to be not unusual for the Commissioning Resources Team at the Children and Families Department of the council to arrange overnight respite care at the residential schools where the children are already attending as day pupils. Pield Heath and Sybil Elgar are schools which have a mixture of residential and day pupils with special needs. </span>

The work done included working out the total amount of provision which Clement Close would provide after the refurbishment as well as the existing usage of Crawford Avenue and Clement Close, a considered estimate of how many users would want to continue with overnight respite provision and how many parents they thought would need and choose direct payments, consideration of the rising trend of numbers in the past two years of how many parents wanted and chose direct payments. It was said that it was anticipated that there would be some parents who chose direct payments based on looking at the take up of direct payments over the past two years. It was said that officers took into account the number of children approaching eighteen years of age and reaching the point of needing support of adult services. It was further said that they also brought into the equation some estimation as to how many new cases there would be between April / May 2011 and the end of 2012 when the Village School would be open requiring respite as they would affect the numbers coming through the system of children who would come to the age of needing respite care. It was said that the responses to the further Part 18 request for further information show that to a large extend those predictions had been proved accurate. Even if the court finds that the council was on some sort of duty to satisfy itself that needs would be met it was submitted that that duty was discharged. It was stated that even on the Claimant’s case which was not accepted that the council made a bare assumption that needs would be met, there is no evidence in support of the suggestion that they will not be. Neither it was said is there any evidence to suggest that there is any assessment of need for a particular type of respite care or for any particular frequency. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Ms Morris said that it was the position of the council when taking the decision to close Crawford Avenue that after the planned refurbishment Clement Close would be suitable for meeting the assessed needs of children and carers such as the Claimant and her child and the other carers and children in respect of whom witness statement were served. She said that officers considered that after the refurbishments and adaptations and staff training have been completed the needs of the service users at Crawford Avenue including the Claimant and her child and the other carers who have submitted witness statements and their children can be at a refurbished Clement Close. Children with behavioural disorders would not be supported at Clement Close at the same time as those with physical disabilities. Although Clement Close is not as big as Crawford Avenue it has four bedrooms on the first floor and a lift linking the ground and first floor whereas Crawford Avenue has no lift. On the first floor in addition to the bedrooms there is an extra room which is used as a meeting room and which doubles up as a “music room”. On the ground floor there is a lounge, a dining room, a kitchen, a sensory room and an extra room which will be converted into a break out room as part of the refurbishment works to be carried out. The garden in Clement Close surrounds the building in an “L” shape and the distance between the building at Clement Close and the back of the garden is approximately 50 feet. Officers took the view that although the garden is not as large as that at Crawford Avenue it is of a sufficiently reasonable size for it to be suitable for children with behavioural disorders. As to whether the council was satisfied and if so on what basis that sufficient places would be available to meet the assessed needs of children and carers such as the Claimant and her child and the other carers and children in respect of whom witness statements have been served, Ms Morris stated that the council could not be certain that there would be sufficient places available at Clement Close for all users at Crawford Avenue. That was because although both Crawford Avenue and Clement Close were only being used at approximately 70 to 80% capacity there was expected to be a loss of capacity of 25 to 30% as a result of the closure of Crawford Avenue. However she said that even if the council could have been certain at the time because for example a number of families moved away and/or the children transferred to adult services it would be aware that this could change at any time if the number of children needing respite increased for any reason.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">However Ms Morris said that the council considered it likely that there would be sufficient places at Clement Close. This was based on the following matters. Professional officers from the Children and Families department of the council with day to day experience in this area first estimated how many they believed would want to continue with overnight respite provision since as stated in the 23 May 2011 report those children would be give priority over children who only receive day care. They also estimated how many parents they thought would need or choose direct payments as an alternative to Clement Close. They looked at the rising trend in numbers in the past two years as to how many parents wanted and chose direct payments in respect of other matters. It was anticipated that there would be some parents who would choose direct payments based on looking at the take up of direct payments over the past two years. Officers also brought into the equation some estimation as to how many new cases there would be between April / May 2011 and the end of 2012 when the Village School would be open requiring short breaks as they have details of the numbers coming through the system of children who would be the age of possibly needing respite care. As stated in the 23 May 2011 report where there were carers who had been assessed for overnight short breaks and did not wish to take up the options of direct payments and care at home, other options including specialist foster care and out of borough resources would also be considered as the report stated that the carers would receive the same allocation of hours although there would be limited flexibility for them in how the council met the carer’s needs in respect of their allocated hours of respite short beaks care provision. </span>

Even if Clement Close could not meet all the demand it would be able to meet most of it so that the number of any unsatisfied service users was judged likely to be small. The council has a Commissioning and Resources Team (“CRT”) referred to as the Commissioning Team in the 23 May 2011 report which commissions all child care placements (not just respite care provision) in the private and voluntary sectors. The CRT commission and manage the arrangements of approximately 350 care placements for children including respite care in the private and voluntary sector including Bucket and Spades in Finchley and MIG in House in Ilford. They also liaise with the residential schools to provide overnight respite care to service users who attended those residential schools during the day. If there was more respite care to be provided in the private sector Ms Morris stated that CRT already have resources in place as they are an experienced team with the contacts, negotiating skills and knowledge, including referral details and London database of private care placement providers.</span>

She said that the council already has a direct payments system in place which will develop further in line with council tendering for contracts for direct payments in the next 12 months with other west London boroughs. At present 113 parents with children with disabilities in Brent, excluding those currently supported at Crawford Avenue and Clement Close, are receiving direct payments. As for care at home, the council already provides a care at home service on a spot purchase basis with three or four private providers. The care at home service is being developed further as part of a framework contract so as to have a better commissioning process. At present approximately 60 parents with children with disabilities in Brent excluding those currently supported at Crawford Avenue and Clement Close use care at home services. It was the council’s position that the need for respite / short break provision could lawfully be met in either of these ways because they would permit the parents / carer to have the allocated hours of respite per year.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Ms Morris elaborated on the issue of the process of assessing needs and deciding what provision is regarded as suitable for meeting those needs. She said that there is no separate assessment of the child’s need for respite / short breaks. Rather it is part of the overall assessment of need. An assessment of the parents / carer’s needs is also carried out at the same time. If the child in need assessment identifies that a child has a significant high level of challenging needs and behavioural difficulties and that the carers are struggling to meet such levels of needs a more detailed assessment is required and undertaken in order to determine if they need to be accommodated under section 20 of the Children Act 1989 and an appropriate placement is then identified for the child. This only applies to a small number of children and in most circumstances an appropriate placement would be a 52 week residential school placement. Ms Morris stated that none of those small groups of children are supported at Clement Close or Crawford Avenue as that level of need is beyond the provision of what short break respite care units can provide.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Where the parent/carer’s needs are assessed to be significant the parent/carer can request a separate and more detailed assessment of their needs separately from the child in need assessment. This has only been the case for a small number of parents/carers within the whole of the Children with Disabilities Service of the Council. With regard to the Claimant and the witnesses in this judicial review claim, Ms Morris stated that she was only aware of one such carer’s assessment and that assessment was previously carried out in respect of PM. </span>

At this stage, a number of factors are considered including family circumstances, housing, and parents’ ability to manage finances. After discussion and negotiation with carers regarding the available options, including short break respite care at a unit, direct payments, specialist foster care and care at home, a decision is made by the council on how to meet the assessed need. </span>

However, because the need being addressed by short breaks provision is that of the parent/carer for respite, issues such as a large garden or a sensory room would not be identified as part of that need or the provision to meet it (although of course if what is desirable – from any point of view – can be provided then it would be). If home care would not be suitable because, for any reason, it was judged that this would not meet the parents/carer’s need for respite then that need would be met either by ensuring it took place at Clement Close or in the private and voluntary sector or by explaining how direct payments could be used to pay for a carer to take the child out of the home to a suitable venue or activity. That is how some parents use direct payments. </span>

There was a section addressing what changes there had been in AP’s needs. This referred to AP having tantrums when he does not get his own way and difficulty listening to instructions. AP’s mother was recorded as saying that AP would kick hit and throw things when he becomes angry and that the family are affected by this as they have objects thrown at them. She said that the behaviour happens quite regularly. In answer to the question whether there were further changes that needed to take place in order for AP’s needs to be met it was stated that he would benefit from more structured activities during the school holidays whereby he and his family would benefit from respite. He would also increase his socialisation with members of the Brent community. There was no reference to what kind of respite AP and his family would benefit from or for how many hours. However in the 5 August 2004 documents there was a record of the council’s Disabled Children and Young Persons Service Resource Panel having agreed an allocation of 472 hours respite care for day care and overnight break.</span>

The purpose of the plan was said to be to minimise the impact of his condition, supporting to reach his full potential, develop his independence and explore options for his to access mainstream provision. In the plan itself there were three desired outcomes identified: for AP to access mainstream school community services, for CMHS to support his family and establish issues relating to his toileting and thirdly to support AP’s parents in their ability to continue to care for AP by providing short breaks services which meet AP’s needs. In relation to the third desired outcome the action identified was: “Crawford Avenue to continue to offer day care short breaks for a minimum of seven hours per month to [AP]. After school care to be offered one day per week. This service may transferred to Clement Close. Option of direct payments.” The meeting which generated the plan was recorded as having taking place on 11 July 2011 and been attended by AP’s mother, a consultant neurologist, a consultant neurosurgeon, a consultant community paediatrician from Brent community services, a neurologist, a nurse at the Village School and a social worker. It was stated that Crawford Avenue had continued to offer day care and after school care for AP and it was reported that he was doing well at the unit and was described as a bright boy and good at articulating needs. The only concern reported was that he withdraws from group activities when he soiled himself. Under the heading views and comments it was recorded that AP likes to attend short breaks services and enjoys physical activities.</span>

The duty imposed by section 17(1) is a general duty owed to all the children who are in need within the local authority’s area and not to each child in need individually. On the other hand Lord Hope of Craighead, with whose speech Lord Millett agreed held that the specific duty imposed on the local authority by Paragraph 1 of Schedule 2 will involve assessing the needs of each child who is found to be in need in their area as paragraph 3 makes clear. Paragraph 3 provides that where it appears to a local authority that a child within their area is in need, the authority may assess their needs for the purposes of the Children Act 1989 at the same time as any assessment of his needs is made under three specified Acts or any other enactment. </span>

That cannot be read as a duty to meet the needs of any particular child. It is sufficient that the authority maintains services for which his particular needs make him eligible. He also held that the social services authority is obliged to assess the needs of the individual child. The existence of a power to provide assistance to a class involves a duty to consider whether a particular individual is eligible for such assistance and in the present context he held that that involves assessing the needs of the child in order to decided whether and the extent to which the authority will meet his needs. Like Lord Hope he also held that the relevant duty is expressly provided by paragraphs 1 and 3 of Schedule 2 to the Children Act 1989  (paragraphs 109 and 110).</span>

She held that no duty under section 20 (1) arises where the most that can be said is that without assistance, even assistance by way of temporary accommodation, a parent may (or possibly, even, will) be prevented from providing the child with suitable accommodation or care. She added that she did not have to go so far as to say that short breaks can never come within section 20 (1), that being an issue which would have to be determined if it arose within a particular case. It would in my view appear to follow that there is no specific duty imposed on a local authority under section 20 (1)(c) owed to an individual child to provide emergency short break residential care until and unless an emergency has arisen such as to bring the circumstances within the wording of the subsection.</span>

It further states that before making, and when reviewing, a decision about whether to provide accommodation under section 17 (6) or section 20 (4) of the 1989 Act there would be a careful assessment of the child’s and family’s needs that addresses a number of factors which are set out. One factor is the length of time away from home and the frequency of such stays and it is stated that the less time a child spends away from home the more likely it is to be appropriate to provide accommodation under section 17 (6). Another factor is stated to be whether short breaks are to be provided in more than one place. It is stated that where the child spends short breaks in different settings, including residential schools, hospices and social care placements, it is more likely to be appropriate to provide accommodation under section 20 (4) (paragraph 2.8).</span>

(Paragraph 2.10). Different requirements as to making of care plans applied depending on the legal provision under which short break care is provided. The positions is summarised in table 1 on page 16 of the Guidance. Where a child is provided with accommodation under section 17 (6) of the Children Act 1989 the Care Planning, Placement and Case Review (England) Regulations 2010 do not apply. No short break care plan is required but a Child In Need plan is required in accordance with the Assessment Framework. Where a child is provided with accommodation under section 20 (4) for a continuous period of more than 24 hours the authority must make a short break care plan. The Guidance states that the responsible authority should not make any significant change to the care plan unless the change has been further considered at a review. (Paragraph 2.27). This appears to apply to care plans where the 2010 Regulations apply as distinct from Child In Need plans where they do not.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">The council relies heavily on what it characterises as unacceptable delay on the part of the Claimant. It submits that by reason of delay the Claimant should not be given permission to rely on the proposed additional grounds of judicial review served on 13 September 2010 namely “irrationality / breach of section 149 in failing to obtain information concerning alternative provision of short breaks care”. Alternatively the council submits that by reason of delay even if permission is granted relief should be refused. The council makes the same submission in relation to the Claimant’s alternative application to challenge the decision to implement the decision to close Crawford Avenue before Clement close has been refurbished and alternative placements have been identified and assessed as suitable for all current users of Crawford Avenue including suitable emergency placements. In the further alternative the council submits that in respect of the sole surviving ground of challenge against the initial decision to close Crawford Avenue for which permission was granted by Collins J on 6 September 2011, namely breach of section 149 of the Equality Act, relief should be refused by reason of delay.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">On 1 September 2011 Ms Morris signed a witness statement opposing the Claimant’s application for permission to apply for judicial review and an interlocutory injunction to prevent the council taking further steps to close Crawford Avenue and to continue to fund existing placements there until final determination of the claim. She said that the council would face numerous practical difficulties some of which were very considerable and some of which were near insuperable if either order was made. First she relied on the fact that the council had served notice to terminate its lease of Crawford Avenue on Barnardos, the landlord on 2 June 2011. The notice expired on 7 December 2011. The lease was entered into on 16 July 2007 for a ten year term from 1 August 2007. She acknowledged that, although the notice to terminate was served six days before the OSC was due to decide whether to refer the decision under challenge back to the Executive for reconsideration, the erroneous view had been expressed by some council officers that it could be withdrawn if the OSC decided to refer the decision back. Ms Morris said that she had been advised that this was wrong in law. The council could not unilaterally withdraw its notice to terminate the lease so that it would be impossible to keep Crawford Avenue open after 7 December 2011 without the agreement of Barnardos and even if the council were compelled by a court order to keep it open it would be forced to agree whatever terms were insisted on. She did not know what plans Barnardos have for Crawford Avenue after 7 December 2011 but said that there was no intention at that stage to enter into negotiations to seek to waive the notice to terminate the lease or otherwise enable Crawford Avenue to remain open after 7 December 2011. That was because even if negotiations were successful and the terms reasonable if the claim was dismissed the council would have to serve a further notice to terminate giving another six months notice during which time the council would have to pay the rent, currently £32,250 per annum.</span>

Ms Morris said that if the council were forced to keep Crawford Avenue open it would be in a very weak position to negotiate a lower level of rent which would impact on the amount of savings it could make in this area. She added that Barnardos had contacted the manager at Crawford Avenue following the 6 September 2011 hearing to assess what works need to be done before the expiry of the lease. She said that if Barnardos were to serve a schedule of dilapidations and use that as further leverage against the council in relation to the amount of rent for continuing to use Crawford Avenue after 7 December 2011 that could put the council in further difficulties.</span>

If the council was compelled by court order to keep Crawford Avenue open it would be forced to agree whatever terms were insisted on by the staff. It was not known whether the members of staff involved had already made other plans or sought or obtained alternative employment. The possibility of hiring new staff even on a temporary / locum / agency basis was extremely unattractive. It would be very difficult to find and place such a significant number of staff with sufficient expertise in a relatively short period. It is difficult to recruit members of staff of sufficient quality on a temporary basis. It would also be more expensive than employing permanent staff. In her second statement Ms Morris said that meetings had been arranged with the nine employees to negotiate what would happen if the judicial review is allowed. The first meeting would not take place until 28 September 2011. She expected all the meetings to have taken place before 6 October 2011 and said that she would provide a further update via the council’s counsel at the date of the hearing or sooner if possible. In fact so far as I am aware no such update was in fact provided. Ms Morris said that it would have an immense detriment to staff morale to have a duplicate consultation process and create new anxieties in respect of staff future employment stability given that there would in any event need to be a totally new and additional consultation with staff in respect of the eventual closure of both units in line with the move to the new respite care unit at the Village School.</span>

That contractor was on standby to start carrying out the works on 12 September 2011 with a view to completing the works within three works so that Clement Close would be ready by 3 October 2011. The council would not suffer a financial penalty if after the hearing on 6 September 2011 it were forced to postpone or cancel that contract. However it was concerned that it might not be able to obtain such a favourable quote in the future and it was concerned as to the impact which carrying out the refurbishment works at a later date would have on service users. It had been expected that the training for the staff who would work at the new Clement Close facility to enable them to care for both categories of children (those with severe behaviour difficulties and those with physical disabilities) would last for three works between 12 September and 30 September 2011. If the interim relief was granted (which in this event it was) Ms Morris said that the training would have to be cancelled and take place at a later time.

She said that placement plans were reviewed in July and August 2011 and the parents using both units were given four post-closure options: respite care services to be provided at Clement Close, provision of care at home, use of direct payments and other private or voluntary arrangements. In respect of the first option the Clement Close manager was in contact with parents to organise the service with them. The parents who preferred the other options had been referred back to the Children with Disabilities Social Work Team so that the children’s care plans could be considered and amended accordingly. All of that work would be put on hold or undone if interim relief or the final relief sought were granted. </span>

It was said that if the application for interim relief were granted Crawford Avenue would have to be kept open and that would mean that Clement Close would also be kept open as it would make no sense to carry out the refurbishment works at Clement Close and the training programme would also not go ahead. That would mean that respite care bookings for both Crawford Avenue and Clement Close for September 2011 would have to be made at short notice and it was very likely that Crawford Avenue and Clement Close would not be used at full capacity in September 2011 as some parents were likely to have made alternative arrangements. Moreover if the claim for judicial review were to fail the three week closure of Clement Close would have to be rebooked to allow the refurbishment and staff training to take place. The bookings taken for that period would then have to be cancelled and that would mean the service users having to experience major disruption in reorganising their respite care arrangements with the council.</span>

The court was invited to find that time started to run on 8 June 2011 when the OSC refused to refer the closure decision back to the Executive for consideration. On that basis she submitted that the claim was brought well within time. If she was wrong and time started to run on 23 May 2011 she contended that the challenge to the substantive decision was brought on the last available day within three months. It was accepted that this may not constitute a prompt response but submitted that there was good reason for delay on the part of the Claimant. Reliance was placed on the fact that it was only after the OSC on 8 June 2011 that she realised that she needed to take legal advice and that it was only after she had approached a number of local solicitors who did not take public law cases that she was referred to the Harrow Law Centre on 1 July 2011. As the parent of a seriously disabled child it was submitted that that was not an unreasonable delay. Reliance was also placed on the very limited resources available to the Harrow Law Centre. Ms Cole works part time as do her colleagues and she has responsibility for all the administration of the law centre as well as case work. Any delay by the law centre in those circumstances was not unreasonable. Reliance was further placed on the prompt issue of proceedings after receipt of the council’s response to the letter before action. If necessary the court was invited to extend time for service of the claim for judicial review. </span>

In particular I was not told whether he extended time for bringing the claim or considered that it had been brought not later than three months after the grounds to make the claim first arose. However since the sealed order made on 6 September makes no reference to an order extending time I infer that it was the latter. Nor on the papers before me is it entirely clear when the claim for judicial review was issued. It is referred to in the claim bundle indices and skeleton arguments as having been issued on 23 August 2011. The grounds and statement of facts relied on however are dated 21 August 2011 and there is a fax confirmation report dated 22 August 2011 timed at 12:01 from Ms Cole to the council enclosing Form N463, the application for urgent consideration and interim relief.

	      <span style="color:#000000">In granting the Claimant permission to apply for judicial review Collins J appears to have taken the view either that the claim for judicial review was issued promptly in  all the circumstances or that having regard to all the circumstances the Claimant’s delay in issuing the claim for judicial review did not justify refusing permission in the exercise of the discretion conferred on him by section 31 (6) of the Supreme Court Act 1981 which permits a court to refuse to grant permission to make an application for judicial review if it considers that there has been undue delay. In reaching that conclusion it is to be inferred that Collins J took into account both the Claimant’s explanation for her delay in getting legal advice from the Harrow Law Centre until 1 July 2011 and Ms Cole’s explanation of the limited resources available to the law centre and the considerable demands on it. It is also to be inferred that Collins J took into account the matters relied on by Ms Morris in her first witness statement as constituting prejudice to the council in the event that permission were granted, including in particular the council’s inability to keep Crawford Avenue open after 7 December without the consent of Barnardos who could force it to agree whatever terms it insisted on for a new lease and the fact that redundancy notices had been served in respect of nine (as she then incorrectly thought) members of staff which were due to take effect on 2, 9 and 26 October 2011 respectively. The inference in my view is that Collins J is likely to have considered that the potential detriment to the Claimant and her child together with other users of Crawford Avenue in the event of Crawford Avenue being closed down as a result of an unlawful decision on the part of the council outweighed any detriment to the council and/or members of staff and/or any inconvenience to users of Crawford Avenue and/or Clement Close flowing from delay caused by the judicial review proceedings in the event that those proceedings were ultimately dismissed.</span>

However, given that some of the detrimental consequences alleged by Ms Morris in her first witness statement were on her case likely to flow from the granting of permission even if the claim for judicial review were ultimately refused (such as the asserted impossibility of keeping Crawford Avenue open after 2 October 2011, the date the first redundancy was due to take effect, the risk of escalating the costs of refurbishment of Clement Close if the contractor with the £27,000 “was unable to start” on 12 September 2011 and the cost of deferring the retraining of staff for Clement Close planned for the three weeks between 12 September and 30 September 2011), it is in my view to be inferred that Collins J did not consider that those matters would in themselves justify refusing the Claimant relief to which the court ultimately concluded she was otherwise entitled on those grounds alone.  Rather it is in my view to be inferred that what he had in mind was that the council should be free to resist the relief sought by the Claimant at the substantive hearing by relying on additional matters not considered by him which the council might wish to rely on as constituting substantial hardship to or substantial prejudice to the rights of any person or detriment to good administration as set out in section 31(6)(b) of the Supreme Court Act 1981.  </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000"> Sedley LJ held: “The critical question in this case however is at what stage or stages the prescribed tests may be applied or – importantly – re-applied.  Here the Rules and the Act provide most of the answers.  Regardless of whether it involves repetition of arguments on promptness already considered at the leave stage, undue delay is placed by section 31(6)(b) on the agenda at the substantive hearing.  On this short ground it seems to us that, notwithstanding Keene LJ’s finding of promptness, the related question of undue delay lay within Turner J’s jurisdiction at the substantive hearing.  … But it does not follow, in our judgment, that the judge at the substantive hearing should proceed as if the issue had never previously arisen in the case, at least where it has been properly argued out between the parties at the leave stage.  It is necessary to place beside Simon Brown J’s example of a full Divisional Court being told that it is bound by a single judge’s view of promptness the equally undesirable – and today more likely – situation of one judge of the Administrative Court effectively acting as a Court of Appeal from another, or (as happened here) deciding an issue without reference to a fellow judge’s earlier decision inter partes on substantially the same question and upon the same materials.  While ultimately it is a matter for the judge hearing the substantive application, we consider that the appropriate course in a situation such as arose both in (RSPB) and before Turner J is that the Respondent should be permitted to re-canvass, by way of undue delay, an issue of promptness which has been decided at the leave stage in the Applicant’s favour only (i) if the judge hearing the initial application has expressly so indicated, (ii) if new and relevant material is introduced on this substantive hearing, (iii) if, exceptionally, the issues as they have developed at the full hearing put a different aspect on the question of promptness or (iv) if the first judge has plainly overlooked some relevant matter or otherwise reached a decision per incuriam.  This is today no more than practical case management under the Civil Procedure Rules, in particular CPR 3.1(2)(k) which permits the court to exclude an issue from consideration but more generally under CPR 1.4(2)(c) and the overriding objectives set out in CPR 1.1.

	      <span style="color:#000000">As to the need to negotiate a new lease from Barnardos if the effect of the Claimant succeeding in her claim for Judicial Review is that any reconsideration by the Council which it is ordered to do would require the Council to keep Crawford Avenue open after 7 December 2011, that was identified by Ms Morris as a prejudice to the Council in her first witness statement and, it is to be inferred, was taken into account by Collins J on 6 September 2011 when he granted both interim relief and permission.  In her second witness statement Ms Morris put a figure on the additional rent which Barnardos would seek, namely £10,000 a year.  However it is in my view highly material in the context of this delay argument that the event which has given rise to the additional rent to which the Council would be exposed if Crawford Avenue has to remain open after 7 December 2011 was the decision taken by Council officials to serve notice of termination on Barnardos on 2 June 2011.  Not only was this decision taken in the mistaken view that the Council could unilaterally withdraw its notice of termination without the consent of Barnardos, but it was taken six days before the OSC meeting which, to the knowledge of the Council’s officers, had been convened specifically to consider whether to recommend that the Executive reconsider the decision to close Crawford Avenue.  If the OSC had decided to make that recommendation and the Executive had reversed its original decision taken on 23 May 2011, the Council would have been exposed to precisely the same rent increase.  Further, and critically in my view, it cannot realistically be suggested that the promptness requirement in CPR 54.5 or the implicit absence of undue delay requirement in section 31(6) of the 1981 Act required the Claimant to file a claim for Judicial Review against the 23 May 2011 decision before 2 June 2011.  Thus even if the Claimant’s filing of its claim for Judicial Review on 23 August 2011 was not prompt, the prejudice to the Council arising from the rent increase triggered by its unilateral notice to terminate the lease on 2 June 2011 cannot in my view be laid at the door of the Claimant or be said to have been caused by her lack of promptness.  Although section 31(6) entitles the court to refuse relief if it considers that the granting of the relief sought would be likely to cause substantial hardship or prejudice or be detrimental to good administration the mischief in my view of that provision is the avoidance of prejudice, hardship or detriment caused by or attributable to the undue delay in making the application for judicial review.  </span>

She states that there will be an immense detriment to staff morale in having to have a duplicate consultation process, one necessitated by the decision taken in April 2010 to transfer Crawford Avenue and Clement Close to the village school, the second ensuing from what she described as the late issuing of the judicial review claim.  It is not clear whether the immensity of the detriment to which she refers was intended to refer to the former, the latter or both.  The Claimant in her third witness statement dated 3 October 2011 in response to Ms Morris’s second witness statement stated that she had spoken to staff at Crawford Avenue and that their morale has been low since they found out about the closure of Crawford Avenue rather than the judicial review.  She stated that the staff was extremely happy when the news filtered back that there would be a delay in the closure of Crawford Avenue.  She said that from what the parents had observed staff morale had improved in the hope that there would be a better outcome for the service users and that jobs could be protected.  If staff morale had been low it was due to the fact that there had been a poor consultation coupled with the fact they were not happy about the closure.  </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">In principle it was in my view foreseeable and should have been foreseen by the Claimant that once the council took the decision on 23 May 2011 to close Crawford Avenue prematurely and the OSC decided not to refer that decision back to the Executive on 8 June 2011 it was likely that there would need to be staff redundancies which will need to be implemented or at any rate initiated relatively speedily.  At the hearing I raised the question what the council would have done if a letter before action had been received before the redundancy notices were issued.  In written additional submissions Mr Greatorex submitted that the answer to that question was not relevant and required a very difficult degree of speculation.  I do not accept the first submission since it goes in my view to the question whether any prejudice to the council arising out of the extra cost consequential upon reversing the redundancy notices or finding alternative staff would be likely to be caused by the Claimant’s delay in issuing proceedings or would have been suffered in any event.  I do however accept that it may well be that the council might not have issued redundancy notices when it did if it had already received a letter before action.  The first three notices were served on 22, 23 and 25 July 2011.  Although in my view it was reasonable for the Claimant to wait to see what happened at the OSC meeting on 8 June 2011, once the outcome of that decision was known it was incumbent on her to proceed promptly.  The relief which she seeks is in effect to keep Crawford Avenue open until the new unit at the village school is ready to admit children in December 2012, a consequence she asserts would follow from a reconsideration on the part of the Council acting in accordance with its legal obligations.  Given that what is in issue is a period of at most some 15 months it should in my view have been obvious to the Claimant that the council would have to take a number of consequential steps which would have both financial and logistical implications.  Against that background, while I am not unsympathetic to the personal circumstances of the Claimant or the practical constraints under which the Harrow Law Centre was operating, it does not seem to me that service of a letter before action on 1 August 2011 can be said to have been served promptly.  Nor can it be said that the filing of a judicial review claim form on 22 or 23 August 2011 was prompt.  </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Accordingly it follows that in my view the consequences flowing from the service of the redundancy notices can fairly be attributed to undue delay on the part of the Claimant. However, as already stated, in my view it is to be inferred that in so far as they were identified by Ms Morris in her first witness statement those consequences were taken into account by Collins J and did not lead him to conclude that either permission or interim relief should be refused. In the light of the Claimant’s third witness statement I do not consider that Ms Morris’ point about the staff morale raised in her second witness statement takes the matter decisively further. Were it the case that the effect of requiring the Executive to reconsider its decision to close Crawford Avenue having taken the additional fact finding steps which the Claimant invites me to hold that it is required to take would be to add significantly to the council’s costs and/or to create significant logistical staffing difficulties I do consider that such adverse consequences would need to be considered very carefully in deciding whether to grant or refuse the relief sought by the Claimant under section 31 (6) of the 1981 Act (if I were of the view that the council acted unlawfully). However Ms Morris’ second witness statement gave no further detail than her first on these matters. Nor was the outcome of negotiations with the staff made known to the court at the on 6 October 2011. Thus in the event this is not a factor in respect of which the evidential position was materially different when the matter came before me than it had been when the matter came before Collins J.

If the claim for judicial review had been filed earlier, there is no reason to believe that the council would have obtained that quotation in the first place. As it is, the quotation having been obtained by the council, its loss resulted in my view from the making by Collins J of the interlocutory injunction and cannot fairly be attributed to the delay by the Claimant in filing the claims.

If that savings target is not made the amounts would need to be found and cut from another part of the council’s Children and Families’ budget for 2011/2012 at a late stage in the financial year and 2012/13. Again, while this would plainly be a potential detriment to the council in the event of an order requiring the council to reconsider the decision to close Crawford Avenue, particularly if it led to a reversal of that decision, that detriment, as it seems to me, if it occurred would be the result not of any delay on the part of the Claimant in bringing the claim but rather of the decision to close Crawford Avenue having been held to be unlawful and thus in effect as a result of the position in which the council found itself in May 2011 of having to make unwelcome cuts in its budget.

	      <span style="color:#000000">In her second witness statement Ms Morris relied on the impact on other service users of the claim for judicial review. She said that the effect on the existing 76 service users who currently use Crawford Avenue and Clement Close was a serious concern. Placement plans had been reviewed in July and August 2011 and the parents using the facilities were given four post-closure options: respite care services to be provided at Clement Close, provision of care at home, use of direct payments and other private or voluntary arrangements. In respect of the first option the manager there was currently in contact with parents to organise the service with them. The parents who preferred the other options had been referred back to the Children with Disabilities Social Work Team so that the children’s care plans could be considered and amended accordingly. All that work would be put on hold or undone if interim relief or the final relief sought were granted. If the claim for judicial review failed, the three week closure of Clement Close planned for September would have to be rebooked to allow refurbishment and staff training to take place. The bookings taken for that period would then have to be cancelled and that would mean the service users having to experience major disruption in reorganising their respite care arrangements with the council. Of all the matters relied upon by the council this struck me as potentially the most serious. Although the basis of the claim is the apprehended loss or diminution in the quality of respite care services to the Claimant, her son and the other carers who made witness statements in support of the Claim and their children, they constitute only a small proportion of the users of Crawford Avenue and Clement Close. Whatever the merits of the claim it is not hard to imagine that the premature closure of Crawford Avenue may have caused concerns or apprehension on the part of service users. There is an obvious importance in the careful and sensitive management of the process of making the necessary alternative arrangements consequent upon the decision to close Crawford Avenue. Any avoidable disruption to that process and in particular to individual arrangements made for particular service users would be a matter of legitimate concern. Again however it is to be inferred that this was a matter taken into account by Collins J and it is not a matter which was taken further in Ms Morris’ third witness statement.</span>

Further while I am mindful of the importance of protecting good administration from the disruptive and potentially expensive consequences of claims filed with undue delay, I do not consider that in the circumstances of this case that factor would justify withholding from the Claimant relief to which I considered she would otherwise be entitled.</span>

The principal ground on which the Claimant seeks to rely is the additional ground, notice of which was served on 13 September 2011. That ground is put in two alternative ways: irrationality and a breach of section 149 of the Equality Act, albeit the latter breach is said to arise differently from the breach originally pleaded. The latter breach is said to be equivalent to the common law irrationality challenge although hung on a different legal peg.</span>

In his skeleton argument Mr Greatorex submitted that the new proposed grounds of challenge have not been brought promptly or within three months. In a supplementary skeleton argument in response dated 4 October 2011 Mr Bowen submitted that the question of whether additional grounds may be relied upon has nothing to do with CPR 54.5 and section 31 (6) of the Supreme Court Act 1981. The requirement in the former is that the claim form seeking judicial review must be filed promptly and not later than three months after the grounds to make a claim first arose. The requirement in the latter is that the trigger for the existence of a discretion on the part of the court to refuse to grant leave for the making of an application for judicial review or any relief sought on that application is a conclusion by the court that there has been undue delay in making an application for judicial review. He submitted that the question as to whether permission should be granted to the Claimant to rely on the additional proposed grounds is governed by CPR 54.15, which provides that the court’s permission is required if a Claimant seeks to rely on grounds other than those for which he has been given permission to proceed and paragraph 11.1 of Practice Direction 54 A which provides that where the Claimant intends to apply to rely on additional grounds at the hearing of the claim for judicial review he must give notice to the court and to any other person served with the claim form no later than seven clear days before the hearing.</span>

He accepted that if the delay in raising them had caused unnecessary hardship, prejudice or detriment to the council or any other parties that would be relevant to the court’s discretion under CPR 54.15. However he submitted that any detriment which the council has actually been caused is due to the fact that permission was granted to proceed with the claim. In my judgment that concession was rightly made. It would offend the obvious policy which lies behind CPR 54.5 and section 31 (6) of the 1981 Act if, in a case where the claim form was filed promptly and within three months after the claim first arose, the court were powerless to refuse to grant permission to amend the claim for the purpose of relying on new grounds, on the ground that the application to amend was not made promptly or within three months of the new grounds arising and/or that there had been undue delay in making the application to amend, even if the court considered that if permission to amend were granted and the claim on the new grounds succeeded, the relief sought would be likely to cause substantial hardship to or substantially prejudice the rights of any person or would be detrimental to good administration. </span>

That is because there would by definition have been no prior finding by a judge on the question whether the relief sought arising out of the amended grounds of challenge would cause prejudice, hardship or detriment. Nonetheless where the likelihood of substantial prejudice, hardship or detriment is raised by a Defendant at the stage of opposing the granting of permission to amend the grounds for challenging the impugned decision, in  my view it would be open to the court to refuse permission to amend on the basis that it would be a waste of time and money to grant permission in circumstances where the Court could already form the view that even if permission to amend were granted the relief sought would not ultimately be granted following a substantive hearing for the reason that the relief sought would be likely to cause substantial hardship prejudice or detriment to good administration.</span>

In my view there is no indication that if the Claimant were permitted to amend the claim so as to rely on the proposed additional grounds that the council, the users of Crawford Avenue and/or Clement Close, the staff or any other persons would be likely thereby to be caused substantial or any hardship or that it would substantially or at all prejudice the rights of any person.

The reason why there are strict time requirements in bringing claims for judicial review is that failure to do so can and often does cause significant difficulties to public authorities. One such difficulty is the particular burden involved in responding to a challenge to a decision long after it was taken. Relevant officials may have moved on, relevant documents may have been destroyed or archived and memories may have faded. Other pressing public duties may have intervened.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">In this case there is in my view some support for Mr Bowen’s submission that the new irrationality ground was anticipated by the existing grounds. In particular in support of the originally pleaded ground alleging breach of section 149 of the Equality Act 2010 the statement of facts relied on submitted that the only way in which the council could have complied with its obligations under the single equality duty was to have conducted a proper consultation exercise on the closure decision which would have generated the information necessary to allow the impact of the decision to be properly analysed and evaluated. A primary concern identified by the parents of the affected children was alleged to be that the two stage transition necessitated by the closure decision would adversely affect their children’s wellbeing. (Paragraph 49). It was further alleged that the equality impact assessment was fundamentally flawed in that it failed to record the number of children and families who would be adversely affected by the closure decision and failed to consider whether its conclusion that the closure option was the best of an unspecified range of options open to the council as it would affect numerically the fewest number of children was outweighed by the extent of the impact on each child. It is also the case that central to the proposed new irrationality ground is the Claimant’s submission that none of the 23 May 2011 report, the equality impact assessment of the same date, the minutes of the Executive meeting on that date or the minutes of the OSC held on 8 June 2011 contained information suggesting that the council had sufficiently informed itself so as to be in a position to make a properly informed decision. All those documents were already in play in the dispute arising out of the original grounds. </span>

However although the council’s evidential response to the allegation that it was insufficiently informed came in piecemeal fashion by way of Ms Morris’ second witness statement dated 30 September 2011, the draft answer to the second request for further information which was produced on the day of the hearing, an account of matters known to the council conveyed to me on instructions orally by Mr Greatorex at the oral hearing and finally in the form of Ms Morris’ third witness statement dated 13 October 2011, in my judgment at the end of that process the council was in a position fairly to place before the court its substantive response both evidentially and by way of submission to the proposed new grounds. Thus even though it seems to me clear that the new proposed grounds are materially different even from the original and surviving allegation that section 149 was breached by reason of the council having failed to have due regard to the relevant objectives, nonetheless the undoubtedly late application to rely on these new grounds by way of amendment has not disadvantaged or prejudiced the council in the sense of depriving it of a fair opportunity to respond to the substantive complaint made against it. In those circumstances having regard to the serious nature of the adverse consequences alleged by the Claimant to be likely to flow in the event that Crawford Avenue is closed, in my judgment none of the matters relied on by the council would justify me in refusing permission to the Claimant to amend the claim so as to rely on the two additional grounds and I give leave accordingly.</span>

Rather it seeks to challenge a subsequent very much later decision. It is convenient to deal with the question of delay and whether permission should be granted to challenge this second decision separately after I have considered the merits of the principal challenge to the first.</span>

In summary it was submitted that the decision to close Crawford Avenue from September 2011 rather than from December 2012 was based on two assumptions which were not supported by evidence: first the closure would not lead to a reduction in the number of hours of short breaks care for each of the 67 current users of the service would receive and second , the assumption on which the first was said to have been based, that the alternative means of provision would be available in the form of a combination of direct payments, foster carers and out of borough placements in alternative residential settings to meet the assessed need of all service users and their families. It was submitted that the council was obliged but failed to satisfy itself that alternative placements were both available and suitable for the service users before reaching its decision. Reliance was placed on the acknowledgment in the 23 May 2011 report that closure of Crawford Avenue would lead to an overall decrease in the hours available for in house short break care of 25 – 30 % at Clement Close as compared to the number of hours currently available at both Crawford Avenue and Clement Close. It was submitted that neither in that report, nor the Equality Impact Assessment, nor the minutes of the meetings of the Executive on 23 May 2011 or the OSC on 8 June 2011 was there any evidence that the council had satisfied itself on the basis of evidence that the acknowledged reduction in the number of hours available at Clement Close could be adequately provided by suitable alternative means.</span>

He acknowledged that the following evidence might be said to support the assumption that alternative provision would meet children’s needs: (i) Since average occupancy at Clement Close was 70% and at Crawford Avenue 80%, which had been closed for two nights a week since November 2010 to reduce overhead, it was hoped that with a higher occupancy rate at Clement Close more children could be accommodated there. (ii) There was evidence of a decline in the use of Clement Close as more parents of physically disabled children had taken up the option of home-care through direct payments; (iii) The 23 May 2011 Report noted that there were currently 105 families receiving direct payments in Brent, an increase of 80% over the last three years; and (iv) Brent was one of a declining number of local authorities that still managed their own residential provision. In other authorities when overnight provision was required it was provided either through commissioning placements in residential units, foster homes or by direct payments to families where they could purchase their own overnight care.</span>

At the meeting of the Executive on 23 May 2011 it had been acknowledged that the move to alternative forms of provision had not been straightforward. Accordingly it was submitted that the overwhelming likelihood was that all 67 users of Crawford Avenue would continue to want to receive residential based short breaks care despite the availability of home-based domiciliary care through direct payment.</span>

The only option would be an emergency placement with a foster carer or in an out of borough residential resource at additional cost to the local authority. No figures were given in the report or at any stage of the decision making process as to the number of emergency placements that would be likely to be affected. However the council’s response to the first Part 18 request had revealed that there were nearly 100 emergency placements between June 2010 and September 2011 or pro rata 75 a year.

However those had not been carried out. The need for individual assessments was particularly important for children receiving only day or after school care like the Claimant. Because priority for residential short breaks care was to be given to those assessed as needing overnight care, children receiving day or after school care would suffer the brunt of the closure as anticipated in the report. For those children the assumption was that domiciliary care at home or from private or voluntary groups would meet the child’s needs.

The available evidence it was submitted suggested that Clement Close would be unsuitable for many if not all of the behaviourally challenged children at Crawford Avenue even with the planned refurbishment and additional staff, given its small size and the lack of the large sensory room and garden compared to Crawford Avenue. That was particularly so if Clement Close was expected to operate at a higher capacity than it had until then. Reliance was placed on the opinion of Noreen Scott, a care worker at Crawford Avenue who gave evidence at the OSC meeting on 8 June 2011 that Clement Close had neither the capacity nor the facilities to accommodate children form Crawford Avenue. That view was said to have been shared by the Chair of the OSC, Councillor Ashraf, who had said that the move to Clement Close would not be suitable for them. Reliance was placed on the witness statements of the parents who objected to a move to Clement Close on the ground that it is too small for their children who, given their behavioural disorder require much more space to be cared for safely. Reliance was also placed on the statement of RB that the social worker for ZB had told her that he did not think that Clement Close was suitable. Until individual assessments of need had been completed it was submitted that it was not possible for the council to know how many children from Crawford Avenue could be accommodated at Clement Close.</span>

Ms Arnold’s account of the discussion at the Leader’s Briefing on 9 May 2011 threw no further light on the question as to what in practical terms was to happen to those children whom Clement Close would be unsuitable or unavailable, in particular those receiving day or after school care only and those whose conditions were such that emergency placement were regularly required.</span>

First there had been no decline in the demand for places at Crawford Avenue.

The flaws were identified by parents and opposition councillors at the OSC meeting on 8 June 2011 but had been ignored. It was now clear following the council’s response to the first Part 18 request that there was a significant demand for emergency short breaks care but alternative providers had only been identified in the most general of terms in Ms Morris’ second statement. While wholly coincidental, the council’s response was said to coincide with the coming into force of its duty under Regulation 5 of the Short Breaks Regulations which requires authorities to prepare a short breaks services statement by 1 October 2011 setting out details of the range of services provided in accordance with Regulation 4, any criteria by which eligibility for those services will be assessed and how the range of services is designed to meet the needs of carers in their area.

First the decision was said to be one that is likely to have a significant impact on the wellbeing and happiness of a number of very disabled children and on the family lives of their parents and carers. It therefore falls within the ambit of Article 8. The council’s duty under section 11 of the Children Act 2004 was also said to be engaged which requires the authority in discharging its public functions to have regard to the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of children. Given the disabilities of the individual children equality issues were also relevant. A particularly anxious scrutiny of the decision was therefore required. Second the decision was said by its nature not to be one for which the council should be afforded any particular discretionary area of judgment. It did not involve any particular expertise which the Court lacks. It was not part of any long term strategy but rather a short term measure conceived of to meet an immediate budgetary crisis. Although the decision involved judgment the criticism made of it by the Claimant related to the information on which that judgment was based: namely the lack of any detailed analysis and evidence to support the conclusion that alternative provision would make up for the closure of Crawford Avenue – see </span>

He further submitted that the council’s obligation to have a reasonable expectation that the factual premise would be correct arose also out of its obligation to be satisfied that it could continue to discharge three discrete duties: (1) its duty under section 17 of the Children Act 1989 to continue to provide short breaks care to meet the assessed needs of the service users at both Crawford Avenue and Clement Close; (2) its duty under Regulation 4 of the Breaks for Carers of Disabled Children Regulations 2011 (Short Breaks Regulations) “to provide, so far as is reasonably practicable, a range of services which is sufficient to assist carers continue to provide care or to do so more effectively”; and (3) its duty under section 20(1)(c) of the Children Act 1989 to continue to provide emergency short breaks care for families in crisis.

The Claimant did not understand the discrepancy between the original assessment in the Equality Impact Assessment that 58 children could be offered an overnight service and the assessment in the draft reply to the second Part 8 request for further information served on 6 October 2011 that 76 service users could be accommodated at Clement Close (paragraph 2). (2) whether Clement Close was suitable for all the service users who would now be there in particular given its size and configuration. That it was submitted would require at the very least some assessment of needs and individual consultation with individual families having a regard to the matters identified in Regulation 3 of the Short  Breaks Regulations (3) if Clement Close did not have sufficient capacity or was not suitable for some of the children whether alternative arrangements could be made elsewhere. That would require identification of suitable alternative placements in consultation with service users and their families (4) in particular, for those children only receiving day care at Crawford Avenue and Clement Close – over whom children with a need for overnight care would take priority – whether alternative arrangements were available and suitable especially for those parents who worked or were single parents or with other children, for  whom it would/might not be suitable to have short breaks in their own home. This it was said would require some kind of assessment of needs and individual consultation to ascertain the wishes and feelings of parents and children having regard to the matters in Regulation 3 and to identify suitable alternative placements. (5) What arrangements were to be made to accommodate children on short breaks in emergencies. At least on 23 May 2011 the council acknowledged that emergencies would no longer be accommodated once Crawford Avenue closed, the intention being for provision to be made through the commissioning team for emergency placement with a foster carer or out of borough residential resource.

It was enough that the assessed number of hours of respite would continue to be given. Mr Greatorex had said on instructions that no specific steps were taken to ascertain the suitability of the alternatives. However very careful consideration was given by the council through its officers who know about this to what the position would be if Crawford Avenue were closed. That included judgments based on the way Clement Close operated as to what the situation would look like after Crawford Avenue closed including the health and safety risk assessment. There had been no specific steps beyond that. What was relevant was the knowledge that the council has of other providers whom they use the whole time. Mr Bowen submitted that the council has been rather coy about its knowledge of alternative providers. The response in Ms Morris’ second statement was said to have been vague, and the draft response to the second Part 8 request suggested, he submitted, that even now it is not possible to identify where the beds will be available either for planned short breaks or emergencies in the event of Clement Close not being available or suitable for a particular child. </span>

It was not and never had been the function of the court to do either of those things. It was submitted that the council had been clear throughout that it would continue to make the provision to which service users of Crawford Avenue and Clement Close are entitled. Further it was submitted that the Claimant does not suggest that the effect of the decision under challenge is that the council would inevitably fail to discharge its statutory duties. Should it occur in the future that the council did fail in its duties in that regard no doubt appropriate relief would be ordered to ensure compliance. The 23 May 2011 report acknowledged the possibility that in some instances the council would incur additional costs because of the closure of Crawford Avenue but that it was submitted did not give rise to any ground of public law challenge.</span>

When first raised on 13 September 2011 the argument had been that the decision was based on two assumptions that were not supported by evidence. The Claimant’s skeleton argument it was submitted now accepted that there was evidence, just not sufficient evidence. Thus it was submitted that the court was being asked to get very close to the evidence and intervene on a very narrow basis. In any event it was submitted that the rationality challenge is not even arguable. It cannot be said that no reasonable local authority would take the decision taken by the council.

It was anticipated that there would be some parents who chose direct payments based on looking at take up direct payments over the past two years. Officers took into account the number of children approaching 18 years of age and reaching the point of needing support from adult services. They also brought into the equation some estimation as to how many new cases there would be between April/May 2011 and end of 2012 (when the Village School would be open) requiring respite - as they would have the numbers coming through the system of children who would come to the age of needing respite care.

No alternative placements were ever identified. A place in for example a geriatric nursing home would not it was submitted be a suitable alternative placement. Against the background of the home for life promise the identification of alternative suitable homes for Ms Coughlan and the other residents should have been of paramount importance, but it was impossible to consider suitable alternative placements without the information which would have been derived from a multi disciplinary assessment. Mardon House had been assessed by Devon County Council as “ideally suited” to Ms Coughlan’s physical and psychological needs.

It argued that under the 1995 Guidance what was required was such an assessment of the patient’s needs before any decision was made about the discharge of the patient from NHS care or on how their continuing care needs might best be met. The closure decision was not, as Ms Coughlan contended, a collective decision to discharge the individual patients. Under the 1998 Guidance the health authority argued that there were four distinct stages in the transfer process, the first of which was the closure decision and it was only after that that the detailed transfer procedure operated. The health authority submitted that it would be impracticable and unrealistic in the vast majority of cases to carry out the assessments and to identify alternative placements prior to a closure decision, let alone prior to consultation on a proposed closure. Funds for the development of alternative facilities might only become available after the closure decision is taken; only then would the range of alternative available placements become clear; large closure programmes might take years to implement, in which case assessments and alternative facilities considered at the time of consultation or assessments and alternative facilities considered at the time of consultation or closure would change over time; and in practice the necessary cooperation of individual patients for effective assessments and alternative placements might be more difficult to obtain before rather than after a final decision has been taken on closure.

To the extent that the required assessments had not been carried out in accordance with the 1995 Guidance it was submitted that the judge had failed to address the question whether that was the result of Ms Coughlan’s unwillingness to cooperate in the assessment with the health authority and social services in the manner and to the extent contemplated by the Guidance.

Therefore this is not, in my view, a case, of which there are many in the authorities, in which it has been held that it is premature in challenging a decision to close an institution, to do so on the basis that there has not yet been an assessment of the needs of the residents or users of that institution. That is because it often happens that there is a multi-staged decision making process and that it is not possible at the first stage of the process or of closure to identify where the people will go, what their needs will be and whether those places will satisfy their needs. In my view this is not such a case. This is rather an exceptional case where the two stages are in effect linked. The decision to close and the decision to move the users to Cherry Orchard, in my view both explicitly and implicitly were linked both by the officials and the council with each other, that is to say the decision to move and the decision to close, and it seems to me that the matter can be tested this way: if it had been said to the Cabinet or the OSC in answer to a question or otherwise: “We do not know whether we will be able to meet the needs of the users at Cherry Orchard, but can we please close Pershore now?” the answer could only have been “No of course not”. Because that is not the basis upon which the closure of Pershore was put. It was an integral part of an overall package which was designed to review and reform the provision as between Pershore, Perryfields [the third centre] and Cherry Orchard as well as the satellites. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">“The second ground of challenge is that there was a breach of duty by the Council in failing to make psychological and risk assessments in respect of the effect on the applicants of the transfer to new homes. In my judgment the evidence before me establishes that there is no need for any such assessments. The general principle is that such assessments may be necessary or appropriate when making the placement of a resident elsewhere and deciding what home would be suitable for the resident, but are not necessary or appropriate when making a decision on closure: see Ex parte Coughlan [2000] 2 WLR 622. Special circumstances may exist which do require an assessment before a decision is made on closure. An example is to be found in the case of Ex parte Perry [2000] 3 CCLR 378 where the evidence established that the psychological effect of uprooting a profoundly disabled group of people from their homes where they had lived for 20-30 years and the consequent loss of the continuing care of a consultant were matters of importance.

The situation here is quite different. Mr Nagra in his witness statement makes clear that the needs of both applicants will be met equally well in other residential homes. So far as the Council had a duty to ensure that it possessed the relevant information to make a decision on closure and this included the impact on the applicants, I am satisfied that the Council possessed it, and I am not satisfied that there is any reason (let alone evidence) to suggest that it did not possess it” (paragraph 9).</span>

As is apparent from that extract, that was a case in which the Master of the Rolls said that neither the statutory provisions nor the guidance issued expressly required assessments to be made or decisions on alternative placements to be taken before a decision to close could lawfully be made and in the absence of special circumstances normally the Court of Appeal said that they would expect it to be unrealistic and unreasonable on the grounds of prematurity alone for the health authority to make assessments of patients and to take decision on placement ahead of the decision on closure.</span>

That was a case in which, as pointed out by the Master of the Rolls in paragraph 98, under the guidance there were four distinct stages in the transfer process, the first of which was the closure decision and it was only after that that the detailed transfer procedures operated. The health authority submitted it would be impractical and unrealistic in the vast majority of cases to carry out the assessments and to identify alternative placements prior to a closure decision, let alone prior to consultation on a proposed closure. Funds for the development of alternative facilities might only become available after the closure decision was taken. Only then would the range of alternative available placements become clear. Large closure programmes may take years to implement, in which case assessments and alternatives facilities considered at the time of consultation or closure would change over time and in practice the necessary co-operation of individual patients for effective assessments and alternative placements might be more difficult to obtain before rather than after a final decision had been taken on closure. Counsel had submitted that those issues were of great practical importance for health and social services authorities throughout the country.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">92.  In my judgment, again, this is a very different situation. This is a case in which the decision to close was specifically proposed and accepted on the basis that these four users would go to specified alternative centres and the decision to close was inextricably linked with a recognition, explicit and implicit, both by the officials and by the Council that the closure would only be justified if the needs of these users could be met at Evesham and Cherry Orchard where it was anticipated they would go. I should add in this context that there were, of course, a number of factors leading to the officials recommending the closure of Pershore and the transfer of the users to Evesham and Cherry Orchard. These included a bona fide, no doubt, view that their needs could be met but were not confined to those considerations. In my view, the Council was perfectly entitled in considering proposals for change to take into account other factors. Meeting the needs of the users is not the only factor in deciding how those needs should be met. There are no doubt all sorts of different ways in which those needs could be met and the Council has had an obligation, and certainly an entitlement to consider alternatives. However, and of course I entirely accept it is not for this court to substitute its view of the balancing of all those factors for the views of the Council, that does not alter the fact that the task that the Council set itself, as I apprehend it, was a task which included satisfying itself that the consequence of closing Pershore would be that the needs of these users would continue to be met at Evesham and Cherry Orchard. In my view, the basis upon which they sought to satisfy themselves was insufficient.”</span>

The importance of the respondent satisfying itself that this was the case is obvious. The applicant and her husband were asking for at least the 12 hours care to continue. Her condition was inevitably and steadily deteriorating. Not continuing the 12 hours care could, it was being said, have serious consequences for the applicant, and was certainly likely to cause deep distress to the applicant (see page 17). The decision to reduce was made at a time when it had been decided that two carers were needed for lifting. It was important that the reduction to six hours care was not driven by the need to have two carers to carry out the task. On the evidence available before me, the reduction could only be justified if there was no continuing need for 12 hours care and not simply because two carers were needed when only one had sufficed earlier.”</span>

I have given this case very anxious consideration, not only because I have reminded myself of the need and importance not to substitute my view for that of the Council, but also because I am conscious both of the fact that there are other factors which the Council legitimately took and had to take into account, and also that these users are not the only people affected by the decision to close Pershore. Indeed, the fact that they are not the only people and that there are other potential users of the Council services at Perryfields, Cherry Orchard and the satellites who may be affected by a decision to quash the decision to close Pershore is, if anything, a factor that underlines the connection between the decision to close Pershore and the question whether the needs of users can be met under the new arrangements. It is, therefore, my view that the court should be very slow before overturning a decision that may have consequences in terms of delay, both for other users and for staff and for the Council. Nonetheless, having given the matter very careful and anxious thought, in my view Miss Markus is right that when this decision was taken the Council was not in a position at the time it took the decision to reach a rational conclusion that the staff availability and facilities under the new arrangement would be sufficient as reasonably to lead to the conclusion that they would meet the needs of the claimants. That being so, in my view, the decision should be quashed.”</span>

There was a rolled up permission and substantive hearing in front of Mr Kenneth Parker QC (as he then was) sitting as a Deputy High Court Judge. The day care centre in question, Belle Grove, was one of six in Bromley serving the needs of older people with physical frailty and low to moderate levels of mental health needs. The application was brought by a single claimant but supported by a number of the 46 other users of the day care centre who were directly affected by its closure. The proposed closure was justified in a report by the relevant council committee on the ground that it would be possible to provide an alternative day care service nearby at a comparatively low cost thus releasing some savings whilst maintaining the same level of service. </span>

The review explored the options for alternative services should the day care centre at Belle Grove be closed and an outline plan was developed for that possibility. The review team considered that the majority of service users should be offered a place at one of the other six day care centres in Bromley, Elmstead, with a small group offered a place at a third day centre at Saxon due to their needs and the services. Preliminary work had been done to identify the capacity required and to ensure that individuals would be able to maintain their pattern of day care, including the weekend service and the later closing time at Belle Grove. Transport arrangements had also been reviewed. It was recognised that in the event of a decision to close Belle Grove a more detailed plan would be developed with each user and their carers to ensure that they would be able to maintain their current pattern of attendance. </span>

The council was entitled to take into account among other factors the fact that Belle Grove and Elmstead were both operating well below full capacity and that closure of one unit would generate cost savings and release resources for allocation for the provision of domiciliary services the demand for which was increasing each year. Indeed the council could fairly have been criticised if it had decided to do nothing and simply let slip the opportunity to achieve economies and to release extra funds for the provision of domiciliary services provided that it could continue to meet the needs of service users at Belle Grove.</span>

At their age and in their condition a significant and abrupt change of environment was something of an ordeal which in turn placed added strain on their carers. However although in an ideal world they would remain at Belle Grove, resources were finite and every decision could deprive others of services they needed. He stated that those responsible for the decision knew what day care facilities were provided at Belle Grove and at Elmstead and by whom and also what were the needs of the service users at Belle Grove. There had been a full review of those needs during the consultation period. That background in his judgment gave sufficient confidence to the decision–maker the needs of the service users at Belle Grove would be likely to be adequately met if they were transferred to an alternative day centre, including, in the present context, Elmstead.</span>

The intention was to maintain an equivalent level of service provision but from a different delivery point.

Quite what was the extent and ambit of the ratio decidendi or the binding part of the decision of the Court of Appeal on this issue is not altogether clear. First the health authority had relied on the fact that it had identified 43 potential new care settings prior to making the closure decision and had to the extent practicable investigated their suitability. To what extent the Court of Appeal’s conclusion was based on a finding that on the facts of that particular case the health authority had made reasonable enquiries prior to its closure decision is not clear. Second two questions in my view arise out of Lord Woolf MR’s observation that: “In the absence of special circumstances, normally we would expect it to be unrealistic and unreasonable, on grounds of prematurity alone, for the health authority in all case to make assessment of patients and to take decisions on the details of placement ahead of a decision on closure. Neither the statutory provisions nor the Guidance issued expressly require assessments to be made or decisions on alternative placement to be taken before its decision to close can be lawfully made.” </span>

It submitted that the obligation to consider the options for where care might best be provided only arose at the third stage and that the new care setting for each individual patient was only identified at the fourth stage.

It is also of note that the Court of Appeal identified two factors which rendered the health authority’s decision unlawful which did not turn on any general principle of whether and in what circumstances a closure decision could lawfully be made prior to assessment of patients and identification of alternative placement. They were the finding of the Court of Appeal that the promise of a home for life rendered the decision to close it at that stage an abuse of power and its conclusion that the eligibility criteria were in themselves unlawful. The former conclusion was said to make it unnecessary to address the question of whether a suitable alternative placement could be found offering conditions similar to those available at Mardon House, a statement which might be thought of as otiose if the Court of Appeal had not considered it to be at least arguable that the question of whether such a placement could be found might be relevant to the lawfulness of the decision to close Mardon House. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Having said that I do consider that the Court of Appeal did intend to give general guidance beyond the facts of the particular case before it whether that guidance was part of the ratio or in the form of obiter dicta. While unquestionably qualified by the words “in the absence of special circumstances” and “normally” the Court of Appeal stated that it would normally expect it to be unrealistic and unreasonable on grounds of prematurity alone for the Health Authority in all cases to make assessments of patients and to take decisions on the details of placement ahead of a decision on closure. In doing so they were plainly sympathetic to the concerns which had been expressed by the health authority that it would be impracticable and unrealistic in the vast majority of cases to carry out assessments and to identify alternative placements prior to a closure decision. However some of the arguments relied on by the health authority may suggest that the Court of Appeal was directing its guidance to particular categories of closure decision. See for example the reference to the possibility that large closure programmes might take years to implement so that assessments and alternative facilities considered at the time of consultation of closure would change over time and the reference to the possibility that funds for the development of alternative facilities might only become available after the closure decision is taken. Those comments would not on their face necessarily seem apt to apply to a proposal to close a facility within a short period of time in circumstances where the needs of the current users were so extreme and pressing as to make it inevitable that the health authority would be in breach of a statutory duty to meet those needs if suitable alternative facilities were not able to be made available immediately upon closure.</span>

Thus Lord Woolf MR’s comments expressly contemplate the possibility that there may be special circumstances where it might be neither unrealistic nor unreasonable for a health authority to make assessments of patients and to take decisions on the details of placement ahead of a decision on closure. Further there is in my view a material difference between whether and in what circumstance there is a duty to make assessments of patients and make decisions on the details of alternative placements for all current users of a facility which it is proposed to close on the one hand and whether and in what circumstances there is a duty to be reasonably satisfied on the basis of information and/or experience that in the event of closure the decision taker will be able to continue to discharge its relevant statutory duties including, where relevant, meeting the assessed needs of existing users. </span>

In other words, it is alleged that the decision to close the facility is taken in circumstances where the authority recognises that users’ needs must continue adequately to be met, but unless an assessment was made the authority could have no reasonable expectation that the needs would be met by the provision of such alternative facilities as were provisionally proposed.

While the council did not accept in principle that there is a universal obligation on a council to have sufficient information as to whether there will be sufficient alternative provision to meet the assessed needs of service users of a facility before deciding to close it, it is clear on the facts that the decision was taken explicitly on the basis that if Crawford Avenue were closed the families of all existing users of Crawford Avenue would be offered alternative short breaks provision based on their existing allocation of hours and that where parents who had been assessed for overnight short breaks did not wish to take up the alternatives of provision through direct payments or care at home other overnight options such as foster care or out of borough resources would be considered (see paragraph 3.18 of the 23 May 2011 report).</span>

By way of example the Claimant’s son was assessed as needing overnight short breaks and was thus entitled to receive 472 hours per annum which correlates to 28 nights at roughly 16 hours each. That was later reduced to one session of after school care from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. once a week and one session of day care once a month.

Indeed that fact is itself reflected in Regulation 4 of the Breaks for Carers of Disabled Children Regulations 2011 which came into force on 1 April 2011. As mentioned Regulation 4 provides that in performing their duty under paragraph 6(1)(c) of Schedule 2 to the 1999 Act a local authority must provide so far as is reasonably practicable a range of services which is sufficient to assist carers to continue to provide care or to do so more effectively. In particular it must provide as appropriate a range of (a) day time care in the homes of disabled children or elsewhere, (b) overnight care in the homes of disabled children or elsewhere, (c) educational or leisure activities for disabled children outside their homes, and (d) services available to assist careers in the evenings, at weekends, and during the school holidays. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">In my view Regulation 4 underlines the point that there is a wide spectrum of ways in which a local authority may lawfully assist parents and carers to continue to provide care or to do so more effectively. It is also pertinent to note that the duty in Regulation 4 is not expressed as a duty owed to a particular child or carer to provide a particular means of delivering short break respite care. Rather it is a general obligation on the part of a local authority to provide a range of services and that is a duty which is qualified by the words “so far as is reasonably practicable” and “as appropriate”. It is also relevant that the focus both of the duty under paragraph 6(1)(c) of the 1989 Act and Regulation 4 is not the provision of service to children but rather the provision of assistance by way of short break respite to individuals who care for children. No doubt the four specified means of providing respite assistance to parents/carers were chosen to reflect the fact that the circumstances of parents/carers vary. Some may have difficulties accommodating respite care in their homes either in the day or overnight. Others may not. No doubt among those circumstances are the nature and extent of the disabilities or behavioural difficulties of the child in question but in the context of Regulation 4 and paragraph 6(1)(c) that is not the primary focus. In her second witness statement Ms Morris stated that the provision of respite care/short break services is primarily to support the parents of children with challenging needs, in particular to try and avoid family break down, although it is accepted by the council that the provision must be suitable for the children in question.</span>

That has only been the case for a small number of parent/carers within the whole of the Children with Disabilities Service of the council. With regard to the Claimant and the witnesses supporting her claim Ms Morris was aware of only one such carer’s assessment. In the alternative scenario which is far more common there is simply an identification of a need for respite/short breaks provision (or not) and whether or not the need (if it is identified) is for overnight respite/short break or not. That need is quantified as a number of hours per annum. Ms Morris stated that that is in line with the practice of most local authorities in meeting their duties under the Children Act 1989 and the Breaks for Carers of Disabled Children Regulations 2010. She was not aware of any case in which the council has ever identified a need for a particular type of respite/short break provision, other than extremely specialised provision such as hospice care which is rare.</span>

If home care would not be suitable because for any reason it was judged that it would not meet the parent’s/carer’s need for respite then that need would be met either by ensuring that it took place at Clement Close or in the private and voluntary sector or by explaining how direct payments could be used to pay for a carer to take the child out of a home to a suitable venue or activity.</span>

The minutes of the meeting recorded various reviews of AP’s progress in terms of health and education. Included in the Plan was an item relating to short break services. Under the heading “Desired Outcome” was recorded “to support Mr and Mrs P in their ability to continue to care for A by providing short breaks services which meet A’s needs.” Under the heading “Actions” was written “Crawford Avenue to continue to offer day care short breaks for a minimum of seven hours per month to A. after school care to be offered on e day per week. This service may transfer to Clement Close. Option of direct payments.” This was of course written after the decision to close Crawford Avenue had been taken. In a much earlier document dated 5 August 2004 there was a record of the council’s Disabled Children and Young Persons Service Resource Panel having agreed an allocation of 472 hours respite care for day care and overnight break. That followed a review assessment dated 14 April 2004 which under the heading “are there further changes that need to take place in order for the child’s needs to be met?” it was stated “[AB] would benefit from more structured activities during the school holidays whereby [AB] and his family would benefit from respite.

This echoes the statement in the Equality Impact Assessment attached to the 23 May 2011 report that nationally there is a drive to increase direct payments or personal budgets and to reduce the time that children spend in residential care away form their families and communities. Thus although it is clear that it was contemplated that much of the need currently met by Crawford Avenue would be met at the reconfigured and refurbished Clement Close, the decision to close Crawford Avenue must be seen in the wider context that there are many other local authorities subject to precisely the same statutory obligations as Brent council which do not currently manage their own residential provision at all.</span>

(The qualification which I have added reflects the evidence of Ms Morris that one of the factors which the council said it had to take into account was the fact that with the passage of time some users might reach the age of majority and other children who were not users of short break respite at the time the decision was made might become so during the period between the closure of Crawford Avenue and the opening of the Village School.) It follows that in my judgment the rationality challenge turns on whether the claimant has established on the balance of probabilities that the council had insufficient information to reach a reasonable conclusion that it would be able to meet those needs, or to use the language of Mr Kenneth Parker QC in </span>

It was recognised that Clement Close would be unsuitable unless changes were made to it and even then unless children with challenging behaviour attended on different days to children with physical disabilities. The first obstacle was addressed in the health and safety risk assessment which had been carried out and which was referred to in the 23 May 2011 report. That set out a schedule of works setting out the health and safety requirements which needed to be carried out including the removal of a number of hazards at Clement Close which could be dangerous for children with severe behaviour difficulties who were currently supported at Crawford Avenue. Those works were necessary to enable Clement Close to be used to support and accommodate children with severe behavioural difficulties including autism. In addition a training programme for staff was identified as necessary to ensure that all staff would be able to support and care for both groups of children. It was contemplated that both the work of refurbishment and the training programme would take place if and when the decision was taken to close Crawford Avenue prematurely. Initially it was anticipated that the cost of works to Clement Close would be £50,000 but by the time of the Executive meeting held on 23 May 2011 that had reduced to £27,000.</span>

It was accepted in the 23 May 2011 report that Clement Close is a smaller unit with less garden space than Crawford Avenue. However it was said that the unit had its minibus and is close to parks and Willesden Green Leisure Centre and staff would make better use of community facilities and outside spaces to compensate for the more limited accommodation. In addition in answer to the second Part 18 request for further in formation it was stated that an additional bedroom at Clement Close would be used as a break out room which could be used for children with very challenging behaviour to address the concerns about the lack of open spaces at Clement Close.</span>

Officers considered that after the refurbishments and adaptations and staff training had been completed the needs of the service users at Crawford Avenue including the Claimant and her child and the other carers who have submitted witness statements in her support and their children could be met at a refurbished Clement Close. Although Clement Close is not as big as Crawford Avenue it has four bedrooms on the first floor and a lift linking the ground and first floor whereas Crawford Avenue has no lift. On the first floor in addition to the bedroom there is an extra room which is used as a meeting room and which doubles up as a music room. On the ground floor there is a lounge, a dining room, a kitchen, a sensory room and an extra room which would be converted into a break out room as part of the refurbishments works to be carried out. The garden at Clement Close surrounds the building in an L shape and the distance between the building and the back of the garden is approximately 50 feet. Officers took the view that although he garden is not as large as that at Crawford Avenue it is of a sufficiently reasonable size for it to be suitable for children with behavioural disorders.</span>

However because the need being addressed by short breaks provision is that of the parent/carer for respite, issues such as a large garden or sensory room would not be identified as part of that need or the provision to meet it although if what is desirable from any point of view could be provided then it would be. In the council’s additional written submission, whose contents were confirmed by Ms Morris in her third statement, the council emphasised that “this decision” was taken very carefully by professional officers with extensive and day to day experience in this area and that the work done included working out the total amount of provision which Clement Close would provide after the refurbishment. I take “this decision” to be a reference to the recommendation in the 23 May 2011 report rather than the decision to close down Crawford Avenue prematurely which of course was taken by the Executive. </span>

It may be that there are some existing users of Crawford Avenue for whom the council may in due course decide that respite care in their own homes is unsuitable, for example because of the size of their home, the number of other children in the family, the number of parents in the family and the working arrangements of the child’s parents and/or carers. However that is a separate question from the question whether the respects in which respite care provided at a reconstituted Clement Close would be less desirable than that currently provided at Crawford Avenue are of such a character as to render Clement Close unsuitable as a means of meeting the needs of current users of Crawford Avenue. The judgment that it would be suitable was reached by managers and professional officers with extensive day to day experience in this area who considered the matter very carefully. It was supported by a health and safety report whose recommendations were accepted. It is not for the court to substitute its judgment for the judgment of the relevant decision taker, particularly where, as here, it is supported by the judgment of professional officers with extensive day to day experience in the relevant area following careful review. Mr Bowen’s submission in his skeleton argument that the council’s assumption that Clement Close could, with appropriate refurbishment and increased staffing levels be suitable for children currently cared for at Crawford Avenue who continued to require residential short breaks care had not been based on any expert assessment as to the suitability of Clement Close for that particular group of individuals save for what he described as a vague reference to a risk assessment mentioned by Rik Boxer at the OSC meeting on 8 June 2011 was of course made before the Claimant had sight of the Defendant’s additional written submissions and Ms Morris’ third witness statement. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Ms Morris stated that the council could not be certain that there would be sufficient places available at Clement Close for all existing users of Crawford Avenue but judged it likely that there would be sufficient places. To the extent that the council could not be certain about the demand for Clement Close it was satisfied that the other premises identified in the draft answers to requests 6,7 and 9 of the Claimant’s second Part 18 request for further information would be suitable and that sufficient places would be available even if Clement Close could not meet all the demand it would be able to meet most of it so that the number of any unsatisfied service users was judged likely to be small. As already mentioned it was expected that there would be a loss of capacity of 25 to 30% as a result of the closure of Crawford Avenue, even allowing for the fact that both Crawford Avenue and Clement Close were only being used at approximately 70 to 80% capacity. However it is clear that the views referred to above were based on a careful analysis of likely supply and demand by professional officers from the Children and Families department with day to day experience in the area. They first estimated how many existing users they believed would want to continue with overnight respite provision since as stated in the 23 May 2011 report those children would be given priority over children who only received day care. They also estimated how many parents would need or choose direct payments as an alternative to Clement Close. They looked at the rising trend in numbers in the past two years of parents who wanted and chose direct payments in respect of other matters. Based on the take up of direct payments over the past two years they anticipated that there would be some parents who would choose direct payments. There was also brought into the equation an estimate as to how many new cases there would be between April/May  2011 and the end of 2012 when the Village School would be open requiring short breaks as they had details of the numbers coming through the system of children who would be  of the age of possibly needing respite care.</span>

The background in which the decision was taken and the calculation was made was that the April 2010 report, which recommended the closure of Crawford Avenue and the transfer of the provision of services for both categories of children to the proposed new unit at the Village School, was based on the premise that of the eight beds at the new unit only four would be available for residents of Brent the other four being available for people from other boroughs. That is the same number of beds as were going to be available at Clement Close once it had been restructured and refurbished. Of course the new unit at the Village school was not due to open initially until 2013 and then until late 2012 so that there was more time to make the necessary arrangements for meeting the needs of users at Crawford Avenue when it was ultimately closed. However in my judgment it is a relevant part of the background in so far as it supports the conclusion reached by the council in May 2011 that it was likely that most of the demand would be able to be met by Clement Close. If there had been no alternative means of providing short break respite for the existing users of Crawford Avenue other than at Clement Close, there might, given the comparatively short time between the decision to close Crawford Avenue and the contemplated time at which it would be closed, be more force in Mr Bowen’s submission that the council could not be reasonably satisfied that it would be likely to be able to meet the needs of all existing users of Crawford Avenue without more detailed consideration of the numbers and the individual circumstances of the existing users of Crawford Avenue whose needs would have to be accommodated at Clement Close.</span>

Having regard to the statutory framework, the existing practice of the council, the practice of other local authorities in the country, the nature of the relevant needs, the nature of the available alternative means of providing short break respite care and the experience of the relevant council officials, in my judgment that was a reasonable position for the council to adopt. </span>

Details of the capacity of the latter were provided in the draft response to the Claimant’s second Part 18 request for further information in which it  was said that all the placements in Pield Heath, Sybil Elgare, Buckets and Spades and MIG House were suitable to take children with behavioural disorders, the Lighthouse was registered to take children with either learning disabilities or autistic spectrum disorder and Bucket and Spades was said to be suitably adapted and staffed to take children with physical disabilities as well as children with behavioural disorders.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">It is also in my view necessary in this context to bear in mind the evidence in relation to the use of direct payments and domiciliary care in the home as a means of providing short break respite care both by the council and many other local authorities and to the statutory guidance in that regard. Notwithstanding the large number of existing users at Crawford Avenue, in my judgement there is no evidence to suggest that the council acted unreasonably in anticipating that there would be some parents that would choose direct payments. That of course would reduce the number of parents opting for residential care either at Clement Close or elsewhere.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000"> challenge in that by definition its results were not known at the time the decision was taken, they do in my judgment lend some support indirectly to the reasonableness of the conclusions actually reached by the council at the time. In those reviews, the carers of 10 of the 64 service users at Crawford Avenue indicated that they wished to take up direct payments for care at home and the carers of two of the service users at Clement Close indicated that they would consider the provision of direct payments. Further carers of eight of the existing service users at Crawford Avenue indicated that they wished to take up residential provision in the private or voluntary sector.</span>

Nonetheless in my view it lends some support to the proposition that faced with a choice between Clement Close on the one hand and either alternative residential provision in the private or voluntary sector or direct payments for care at home a significant number of parents or carers would be likely to opt for one or other of the latter options.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">So far as the issue of emergency respite care is concerned, in my judgment that is not decisive in the current context. The 23 May 2011 report stated that if Clement Close was not available to provide emergency respite care provision (which would be the case for children with behavioural difficulties on any day when Clement Close was being used to provide care for children with physical disabilities) there would be alternative emergency placements provided with a foster carer or out of borough residential school such as Bucket and Spades and the MIG House and other resources that became available which might include the Lighthouse after it had been evaluated by the council. There is in my view no evidence to suggest that the council would be in breach of any statutory duty in the event that it were to make arrangements and pay for emergency respite care outside the borough rather than at Crawford Avenue should the need arise. No doubt that would be more inconvenient and less desirable for parents carers and children alike. However that is not the same thing as a breach of statutory duty. It was in any event presumably inherent in the current set up that, notwithstanding the general under occupancy at Crawford Avenue, there might be occasions when under the current regime an individual emergency might not be able to be catered for at Crawford Avenue. Whether that is so or not I do not consider that this is an issue which changes the overall conclusion which I have reached.</span>

The council was faced with an unenviable task. It had to make savings in its Children and Families budget. It further concluded that that decision would lead to less hardship than any available alternative. Those facts in themselves are highly relevant but not in themselves dispositive or the question whether in reaching its decision the council acted unlawfully. However for the reasons which I have given in my judgment it has not been shown on the balance of probabilities that the council did act unlawfully. It concluded that the savings could be made by the decision which it took without </span>preventing it from continuing to meet the needs of existing users of Crawford Avenue.

However it was not until 3 October 2011 at 3:50 p.m., three days before the hearing in front of me that the Claimant served the document entitled “Claimant’s additional decision to be judicially reviewed and further additional grounds of judicial review” on the council. I have set out the most important contents of that document in paragraph 22 above. In that document it was asserted that this separate challenge had become necessary in the light of the council’s evidence served on 28 September 2011 and instructions taken from the Claimant and other opponents of closure suggesting that the council proposed to close the unit immediately without ensuring that adequate alternative provision was in place.</span>

In the Claimant’s supplementary skeleton argument dated 4 October 2011 Mr Bowen repeated that it only became necessary to challenge the closure decision once the council had served its further evidence but added that that included its response to the Part 18 request. He said that the letter from the Harrow Law Centre to Brent dated 30 September 2011 explained why it was necessary to raise this additional ground. In fact that letter said that there were a number of potential grounds to support the new challenge which were identified but not in any way expanded on and many of which did not find their way into the 3 October 2011 document. He submitted that it would be unacceptable and unlawful for the council to go ahead with the closure of Crawford Avenue before Clement Close had been refurbished and alternative placement had been identified and assessed as suitable for all current users of Crawford Avenue including suitable emergency placements. The court was invited to exercise its discretion to disapply the requirement in Practice Direction 54.11.1 to give notice of intention to apply to rely on additional grounds no later than seven clear days before the hearing. In his additional written submission dated 7 October 2011 Mr Greatorex challenged the assertion that the Claimant had only very recently learned of the decision to close Crawford Avenue. He submitted that that decision had been communicated on 21 June 2011 and explained in full with Ms Morris’ first witness statement date 1 September 2011.</span>

On 21 June 2011 the council notified all parents and carers of the 23 May 2011 decision to cease to provide a service at Crawford Avenue from 1 October 2011. In that letter it was also explained that there would be a planned closure for a three week period from 12 September to 3 October to provide time for the new staff team to attend training and for the refurbishment work to be completed at Clement Close. In her first witness statement dated 1 September 2011 Ms Morris said that a contractor was on standby to start carrying out the works at Clement Close on 12 September 2011 with a view to completing the works within three weeks so that Clement Close would be ready by 3 October 2011. Moreover she said that the council’s plans were that from 9 September 2011 “when Crawford Avenue closes” members of staff would use up their annual leave entitlement and thereafter take gardening leave until the expiry of their redundancy notices.</span>

It is not clear to me which part of Ms Morris’ second witness statement dated 30 September 2011 is relied on as putting the Claimant on notice for the first time of the possibility that Crawford Avenue might be closed before the training and refurbishment programmes were completed for Clement Close.</span>

Although foreshadowed in an email dated 30 September 2011 it was not until 3:50 p.m. on 3 October 2011, three days before the hearing that the details of the grounds were spelled out. The council was already struggling to respond to the second Part 18 request for further information which dealt with a wide range of factual matters relevant to the substantive challenge to the first decision and the proposed new irrationality challenge to it. In my judgment they simply did not have enough time to be in a position to adduce such evidence as they might think necessary or appropriate to deal with this completely new challenge to a completely new decision.</span>

As I understood it he said that in the circumstances then prevailing it would be necessary for both Clement Close and Crawford Avenue to be closed at the same time for three weeks for logistical reasons. However no details were given and this was of necessity not supported by evidence which the council had had no time to prepare. Again as I understood it Mr Greatorex submitted that if both Clement Close and Crawford Avenue had to be closed for a three week period during which the necessary refurbishment works and staff training were carried out, there would be no illegality on the part of the council. The provision of short break respite care for those who had been allocated a fixed number of hours per year did not have to be provided every week.</span>

There may be all sorts of matters relating to logistics which the council would have wished to rely on in opposition to the belated challenge to the second decision. Further and in any event matters have moved on since the proposed new challenge was first canvassed. I have now rejected the Claimant’s principal claim for judicial review challenging the first decision and the council will no doubt need to consider the practical consequences of my decision. There may well have been further developments since the hearing relating to staff redundancies at Crawford Avenue, the logistics of arranging training for the staff at the refurbished Clement Close and the refurbishment of Clement Close itself. The Claimant’s proposed challenge may well become otiose. In the council’s response to the Claimant’s second Part 18 request for further information it was said that placement reviews had been carried out for 58 of the service users at Crawford Avenue and Clement Close. Details of their preferences were also set out and I have referred to them earlier in this judgment. In addition Children Act assessments in respect of the children of the Claimant and other carers/parents supporting her had in some cases been carried out. It was also stated that once the outcome of this judicial review claim is known and if the claim is dismissed further planning would progress and arrangements would be made directly with carers by the manager of Clement Close who also currently manages Crawford Avenue. It may very well be that this judgment, the events which have occurred since the hearing on 6 October 2011 and contact between the council and the Claimant and her supporters hereafter will dispose of any concerns which gave rise to the late attempt to challenge the second decision without the need for further litigation. Whether that is so or not I do not consider that it would be fair to the council or in the interest of justice for the belated application to amend at what was the eleventh hour to be granted.</span>
