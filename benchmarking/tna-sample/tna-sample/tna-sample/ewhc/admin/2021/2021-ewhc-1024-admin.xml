The Council accepts that Mr Elkundi, Mr Ahmed and Mrs Ross are owed the main housing duty under section 193(2). The Council had also accepted that it was subject to the same duty in Mr Al-Shameri’s case, but due to developments during the course of the proceedings the Council contends that, in his case, the section 193(2) duty has been discharged. </p>

The Council objects that these paragraphs raise a new ground of review. I accept Mr Nabi’s submission that they do not: no allegation of breach of section 1 of the Homelessness Act 2002 is alleged. Rather the claimants rely on the broader context in support of their claim for relief. While the timetable left the Council with little time to respond prior to the hearing, in circumstances where the Reply was filed in time and addresses a material issue, I consider it should be admitted. The primary objection to Mr McIlvaney’s second statement is the same, and I reject it for the same reasons.

In March 2017, Mr Elkundi told the Council over the telephone that No.40 was unsuitable (inter alia) due to the impact of his osteoarthritis on his ability to use the stairs. In November 2017, the Council offered Mr Elkundi No.40 on a permanent basis and he declined the offer due to his mobility issues. In March 2018, Mr Elkundi submitted a letter from his GP concerning his osteoarthritis, supporting his request to move. The Council advised that an occupational therapy report would be required. Occupational therapist reports dated 23 July 2018 and 8 April 2019 recommended that Mr Elkundi move to a property with level access or a maximum of one or two steps. </p>

Mrs Ross’s evidence is that she spent a night (on 1 September 2018) on the street in her wheelchair without any accommodation, although it appears that this was due to a misunderstanding regarding the arrangements for transporting her to the accommodation provided by the Council for that night. </p>

Mrs Ross was omitted from the version of the PML exhibited to Ms Bell’s second statement in <span style="font-style:italic">Al-Shameri,</span> dated 22 February 2021, and from the updated and expanded version provided on the final day of the hearing. I was informed that the reason for this was that Mrs Ross had made a successful bid for a two-bedroom bungalow in the B45 postal area, resulting on 13 January 2021 in the Council making her a final offer in respect of that property. When that offer was made, Mrs Ross was taken off the PML. However, it transpired that Mrs Ross had made the bid in error, as the property is not within the area into which she wishes to move. The Council accepted that explanation and has not treated its duty as discharged. Ms Cafferkey explained that Mrs Ross’s omission from the PML was an error, due to an administrative difficulty, which the Council intended to correct. He informed me that, but for this error, Mrs Ross would have been placed at number 117 in the two-bedroom queue on 12 March 2021. This placement flowed from the fact that she joined the PML on 23 October 2020; Ms Pumphrey explained that, having been provided with permanent accommodation, when Mrs Ross sought to move she fell to be treated as a new applicant.</p>

When they moved into No.5 in October 2006, the couple had only one young child. No.5 comprises two living rooms and a kitchen (downstairs), and two bedrooms and a bathroom (upstairs). One of the bedrooms is a double room and the other is a small single box room. The two youngest children sleep in the double bedroom with their parents. Since their daughter was born last December, their 7 year old son has moved into the second bedroom where he and his three sisters sleep on mattresses which are laid wall to wall across the floor. There used to be a bunk bed in the room, but Mr Al-Shameri and his wife removed it because their daughters were scared of heights and so never used to sleep on the top bunk. The room is too small for a double bed. In response to the Council’s suggestion that the living rooms could be used as bedrooms, Alyena Rahman explains in her second statement that this does not appear appropriate in view of the size, configuration and functions of the living rooms. In particular, the front door opens straight into the front living room and access to the rest of the house is through this room, which is used for the children to study. The back living room is a thoroughfare for the kitchen and the stairs leading upstairs, and it is the room where the family eat. </p>

Although no date is given in the Council’s evidence, it is apparent that he was first placed on the PML at some point after the pre-action protocol letter of 1 September 2020; the Council did not put him on the PML in April 2018. Mr Elkundi (with a total of 7 family members) and Mr Ahmed (with a total of 8 family members) were placed, respectively, in the fourbedroom and five-bedroom queues on the PML (matching the size of properties for which they were eligible to bid). The Council’s evidence does not address which bedroom queue Mr Al-Shameri was placed in or where he was placed in the queue by reference to the date on which he had applied for assistance (or, perhaps, the date he had joined the PML). If his case had been treated in the same way as theirs, Mr Al-Shameri would have been placed in the four-bedroom queue and at least 20 applicants would have been ahead of him.

Similarly, Ms Pumphrey’s evidence is that the “<span style="font-style:italic">list is prioritised in date order</span>”. The PML includes a number of dates: “<span style="font-style:italic">TA status update</span>” (the date the temporary accommodation status was last updated); “<span style="font-style:italic">TA Admissions Date</span>” (the date that the households are first accommodated in temporary accommodation); “<span style="font-style:italic">Tenancy start date</span>” (the date the current temporary accommodation tenancy commenced); “<span style="font-style:italic">TA tcy end date</span>” (the date occupation of the temporary accommodation ended); and “<span style="font-style:italic">stage status date</span>” (the date, for example, when the main housing duty was accepted).

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">It is possible that the entries in the “<span style="font-style:italic">Planned Move Date</span>” column (and “<span style="font-style:italic">Days Waiting</span>” column) for Mr Elkundi and Mr Ahmed were erroneous and ought, in accordance with Ms Bell’s evidence, to have given the dates on which they were placed on the PML (and days waiting since then). I have no information regarding the other applicants on the PML by which to assess whether their entries, like those for the claimants, show the date on which they first made their application for assistance, or whether as Ms Bell states they give the date the applicant was put on the PML. If Ms Bell’s evidence as to what the “<span style="font-style:italic">Planned Move Date</span>” shows were right, it would mean that the entries for the only two applicants on the PML for whom the court has data just happen to be wrong in precisely the same way. It would also mean that on 12 March 2021, there were applicants who had been waiting more than 12 years, not just since they had first applied for Part VII housing assistance, but since the Council had decided they needed to move to alternative temporary accommodation. It seems more probable that the “<span style="font-style:italic">Planned Move Date</span>”, which undoubtedly determines an applicant’s place in the bedroom queue, reflects the date on which assistance was first sought. But given the uncertainty, when considering Ground 2 I have addressed the operation of the PML on the alternative bases that the queues are ordered (a) by reference to the date on which the applicant was admitted to the PML or (b) by reference to the date on which the applicant made a homeless application. </p>

The council entertains a very substantial number of homelessness applications each year. I have reviewed the MHCLG statistics which show that for the financial year 2019 to 2020 there were a total of 304,290 initial assessments carried out across England. Of these, Birmingham carried [out] 6,569, more than any other local authority in England, with Leeds carrying out 6,482 and Manchester 5,315. In the same year, the relief duty was accepted in 139,800 cases across England. Birmingham accepted the relief duty in 4,450 cases, which is 1,500 more cases than the second placed council – Manchester City Council who had 2,906 acceptances.  </p>

But if long-term accommodation is not readily available, homeless households who are occupying temporary accommodation will stay in that accommodation longer, making it more difficult to find temporary accommodation for others. In addition, other councils are suffering from similar housing shortages and those from London and the South East are able to offer private landlords in the West Midlands higher rents (while saving money) than the Council is able to offer. The increased competition inflates rents and makes it harder to procure accommodation that is affordable and therefore suitable for applicants. </p>

It is only owed to those who are not only currently and unintentionally homeless, and eligible for assistance, but who have also been classified by Parliament as having a “<span style="font-style:italic">priority need</span>” for housing assistance because, for example, the household includes children or a person who is vulnerable by reason of disability. While the unqualified duty is onerous, it is moderated by the elasticity of the concept of suitable accommodation.

The Council submits that in the absence of an express time limit, the Parliamentary intention must have been to give local housing authorities a reasonable period (having regard to all the circumstances, including the availability – or lack of availability – of the type of accommodation sought) to secure suitable accommodation for those owed the main housing duty. </p>

In my judgment, section 206(1)(c) is not inconsistent with this conclusion. The ability to perform the duty by providing advice and assistance which will secure suitable accommodation for an applicant would only be inconsistent with the duty being immediate if it were anticipated that the duty would be performed by a single act of securing suitable accommodation. But that is not the case. The nature of the accommodation duties under Part VII is such that a local housing authority will often be looking for suitable accommodation in which to place an applicant in the future (or giving advice and assistance to enable him to secure such accommodation in the future) at the same time as it is performing the duty by (currently) securing accommodation that is suitable at that point in time. For example, the authority may be performing their duty by securing bed and breakfast accommodation for an applicant and, at the same time, recognising that such accommodation will only be suitable for the applicant for a brief period, it may provide advice and assistance to enable the applicant to secure alternative suitable accommodation. Or the local housing authority may give advice and assistance to a homeless applicant who is in a women’s refuge which enables her to secure suitable accommodation at the point when she is ready to move into it.</p>

First, they are taken into account in determining whether a person is homeless under section 175(3) (see §122 above). Second, the flexible concept of suitability imports considerations such as the length of time an applicant has been in a particular type of accommodation and the dearth of availability of the type of accommodation the applicant requires in the longer term. However, if the local housing authority has determined that the accommodation it has secured is unsuitable (that being a question for it, subject to appeal) then it follows from the unqualified nature of the duty that so long as the applicant remains in that unsuitable accommodation the authority will be in breach of the main housing duty. </p>

It may be that the confusion arose because of the way counsel argued the case, but it is clear from the scheme of the Act that the Part VII duty is quite distinct from the authority's functions under Part VI. It may be that the conclusion in favour of Southwark was justified on the facts of the case because, having regard to what the council had done, no relief was appropriate in the exercise of the court's discretion. But the council was not complying with its duty under section 193 because no suitable accommodation had been provided since the duty arose in May 1997.

But he felt constrained by the authorities to say that accommodation under section 65(2) 'does have to be secured without limit of time, and so . . . be indefinite.' Dillon L.J. said, at p. 536, that 'the accommodation to satisfy the council's duty must . . . be 'permanent' in the sense in which that term is used in the cases.'” </p>

Under the substituted section 69(1), <span style="text-decoration:underline">the accommodation must be 'suitable,' but this</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">does not import any requirement of permanence.</span> In determining whether accommodation is 'suitable' the council is instructed to 'have regard to Part IX (slum clearance), X (overcrowding) and XI (houses in multiple occupation) of this Act.' This points to suitability being primarily a matter of space and arrangement, though no doubt other matters (such as whether the occupant can afford the rent) may also be material. <span style="text-decoration:underline">But there is no reason why</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">temporary accommodation should ipso facto be unsuitable.</span> If the tenure is so precarious that the person is likely to have to leave within 28 days without any alternative accommodation being available, then he remains threatened with homelessness and the council has not discharged its duty. Otherwise it seems to me that the term for which the accommodation is provided is a matter for the council to decide. In some cases, such as a person in priority need because he is old, mentally ill or handicapped ( section 59(1)(c)), the council may decide to provide permanent accommodation as soon as reasonably possible. In other cases, such as the pregnant woman in my earlier example, it may prefer to use temporary accommodation and wait and see. But provided that the decision is not <span style="font-style:italic">Wednesbury</span> unreasonable (<span style="font-style:italic">Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd. v. Wednesday Corporation </span>[1948] 1 K.B. 233), I do not think that the courts should lay down requirements as to security of tenure.” (emphasis added) </p>

It was accommodation which the authority considered was currently suitable (albeit they acknowledged the need to look for alternative accommodation that would be suitable on a long-term basis), and the applicant had not requested a statutory review of its suitability. In my judgment, Jowitt J was right to find that the appropriate course was for the applicant to pursue her right to review of the suitability of the accommodation. However, insofar as he took the view that the authority was entitled to a reasonable time to find suitable accommodation this was based on the combination of a concession by counsel, a misperception that the duty could only be performed by finding permanent or long-term accommodation and the erroneous analysis in <span style="font-style:italic">Anderson</span>. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">Although I readily acknowledge that the paragraph could be read in the way the Council contends, I am of the view that Auld LJ was addressing the threshold for the grant of relief in circumstances where a local housing authority has not secured suitable accommodation for an applicant who is owed the main housing duty. Auld LJ began the section at [33] by indicating that he was drawing a number of propositions from the authorities to which he proceeded to refer. The fourth of these propositions is stated in the first sentence of [38] which concerns relief: the court will not order a local housing authority to do the impossible. The implication is that Auld LJ is approving the passage drawn from <span style="font-style:italic">Begum </span>that is quoted in [38] and drawing his fourth proposition from it. That passage includes Collins J’s statement that the duty is unqualified and then addresses relief. Auld LJ could not have drawn from <span style="font-style:italic">Begum </span>the proposition that the duty is to secure accommodation within a reasonable time as that is precisely the submission that Collins J rejected in the clearest of terms. Moreover, as this was an appeal in circumstances where the authority had determined that the accommodation it had offered was suitable, no question as to the time within which suitable accommodation must be secured arose. As I read the passage, Auld LJ was expanding his statement that the court will not force an authority “<span style="font-style:italic">to do the impossible</span>” by saying that, in considering what (if any) relief to grant where an applicant who is owed an accommodation duty is in unsuitable accommodation, the court will not require an authority to do more than secure the availability of suitable accommodation within a reasonable time. </p>

First, there is the approach to be adopted by a court, when considering the question whether a local housing authority have left an applicant who occupies “accommodation which it would [not] be reasonable for him to continue to occupy” in that accommodation for too long a period. The question is of course primarily one for the authority, and a court should normally be slow to accept that the authority have left an applicant in his unsatisfactory accommodation too long. <span style="text-decoration:underline">In a place such as</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">Birmingham, there are many families in unsatisfactory</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">accommodation, severe constraints on budgets and personnel,</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">and a very limited number of satisfactory properties for large</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">families and those with disabilities.

I wish also to associate myself particularly with Baroness Hale's observation, in para 36, that both sections 175(3) and 191 look to the future as well as the present. I would make the same point about the duty in section 193(2), which requires the housing authority to secure that accommodation “is available for occupation by the applicant”. The equivalent provision in section 31(2) of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987 uses the phrase “becomes available”. In my opinion the effect of these two provisions is the same. In <span style="font-style:italic">Codona v Mid-Bedfordshire District Council</span> [2005] LGR 241, para 38 <span style="text-decoration:underline">Auld LJ said that the duty of</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">the authority was to secure the availability of suitable</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">accommodation within a reasonable period of time, the</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">reasonableness of the period depending on the circumstances of</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">each case and on what accommodation was available</span>. Collins J took a different approach in the Birmingham case: <span style="font-style:italic">R (Aweys) v Birmingham City Council</span> [2007] HLR 394. He said that it was a breach of the authority's duty for it to require families to remain in unsuitable accommodation even for a short time. <span style="text-decoration:underline">I prefer the</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">approach which Auld LJ adopted</span>.

In the Court of Appeal Arden LJ disagreed with the way the duty was expressed in Codona: <span style="font-style:italic">R (Aweys) v Birmingham City Council </span>[2008] 1 WLR 2305, paras 62–65. She said that the duty in section 193(2) was expressed in terms of producing a result in the context of homelessness, which of its nature requires some urgent action. But the words of the subsection need to be seen in their overall context. The urgency of the action that is needed will vary from case to case, including the way the authority fulfils its interim duty under section 188(1). Each of these two duties needs to be seen in the light of what can be done in the performance of the other. There may be cases where it would not be unreasonable for a homeless person to be expected to continue to occupy for a short period accommodation which it would not be reasonable for him to occupy for a long time <span style="text-decoration:underline">while the</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">authority looks for accommodation which will release it from its</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">duty under section 193(2)</span>. I agree with Baroness Hale that the court must have regard to the practicalities of the situation. As Auld LJ said in <span style="font-style:italic">Codona</span>, at para 38, the court will not make an order to force a local authority to do the impossible. On the other hand it may well feel that it is proper for it to step in where the time that is allowed to elapse becomes intolerable. <span style="text-decoration:underline">The point</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">which I wish to stress is that the description of the duty in</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Codona</span><span style="text-decoration:underline"> is, with respect, the one that should be adopted in</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">preference to that recommended by Arden LJ</span>.” (emphasis added) </p>

This may well be because, at the time of the council’s decisions in these cases, the difference between the concepts of “homelessness” and “suitability” which the House of Lords identified had not been sufficiently clearly established in law, so that the council’s admissions could not fairly be regarded as binding.

Subject to what I have said about the number of cases in which the Council had made a concession of unsuitability, I agree with the view expressed by Linden J at [89]-[90] (see §218 above). Given that the way the cases were argued “<span style="font-style:italic">meant that it was unnecessary </span>[for the House of Lords]<span style="font-style:italic"> to consider the detailed facts of their respective cases</span>” (<span style="font-style:italic">Birmingham v Ali</span>, [49]), in my view, the fact that a finding of breach was not made in Mr Ali’s case, despite the concession that he was in unsuitable accommodation, does not show that Baroness Hale considered the duty is to secure suitable accommodation within a reasonable time. </p>

Lord Hope’s reasoning – that “<span style="font-style:italic">there may be cases where it would not be unreasonable for a homeless person to be expected to continue to occupy for a short period accommodation which it would not be reasonable for him to occupy for a long time while the authority looks for accommodation which will release it from its duty under section 193(2)</span>” ([4]) – supports a flexible approach to the concept of suitability, as elucidated by Baroness Hale. It does not lead to the conclusion that, allowing for such a flexible approach, the duty should also be interpreted as qualified in the way described by Lord Hope. </p>

The Council was, therefore, under a statutory duty to notify him of the decision on the issue Mr Elkundi raised, pursuant to section 203(3) (see §150 above). In addition, if the Council decided any issue against his interests, it had a statutory duty to give reasons for the decision (see section 203(4)). It is well established that reasons must be intelligible and deal with the substantial points. An obligation “<span style="font-style:italic">to give reasons for a decision is imposed so that the persons affected by the decision may know why they have won or lost and, in particular, may be able to judge whether the decision is valid and therefore unchallengeable or invalid and therefore open to challenge</span>”: <span style="font-style:italic">Ermakov </span>at p.826 (Hutchison LJ).</p>

When the claimant brought judicial review proceedings, the authority adduced evidence from the reviewing officer that he had not disbelieved the claimant’s story but nevertheless considered it would have been reasonable for them to have continued occupying their accommodation.

I have in mind cases where, for example, an error has been made in transcription or expression, or a word or words inadvertently omitted, or where the language used may be in some way lacking in clarity. These examples are not intended to be exhaustive, but rather to reflect my view that the function of such evidence should generally be elucidation not fundamental alteration, confirmation not contradiction. Certainly there seems to me to be no warrant for receiving and relying on as validating the decision evidence – as in this case – which indicates that the real reasons were wholly different from the stated reasons.” </p>

Nothing said in §§11-12, or in the decision read as a whole, is capable of leading to the conclusion that the outcome of the review was an adverse finding that the accommodation is suitable (even if in the medium rather than long term). In my judgment, the statement that it is reasonable for Mrs Ross to continue, for the time being, to occupy her current accommodation forms part of the commentary in which the Council explains the reasonableness of the approach it has taken and, in effect, urges a degree of patience and understanding while it seeks to solve the difficult problem of securing suitable accommodation for Mrs Ross.  </p>

The ambiguity in the 14 October letter created by, on the one hand, statements that the accommodation is, at present, unsuitable, and on the other hand the statement that it is suitable to occupy in the short to medium term (which necessarily covers the present), was resolved by the Council deliberately withdrawing the latter statement. I note that, as Ms Shaib had done, Mrs Ross issued a statutory appeal, which was stayed by consent while this claim was pursued.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">The answer to the question whether accommodation is suitable for an applicant can change over time. One common reason for this is the changing size of applicants’ households. The size of the household may increase, for example with the birth a child, or when an elderly parent joins the household to be cared for by their adult child, potentially resulting accommodation that was suitable becoming overcrowded and unsuitable. Or the needs of the household may change, rendering the accommodation unsuitable, for example, if a child or adult has or develops a disability. There is no question of a local housing authority that has decided that accommodation is <span style="font-style:italic">suitable</span> being precluded by the doctrine of <span style="font-style:italic">functus officio </span>from later determining that it is <span style="font-style:italic">unsuitable</span>.

The Council has been in breach of the duty owed to Mr Elkundi under section 193(2) throughout the 15 months that he and his family have remained in unsuitable accommodation since the review decision. In Mr Ahmed’s case, the review decision was made on 18 December 2019. He and his family have remained in unsuitable accommodation throughout the 16 months since then, and the Council has been in breach of the duty owed to Mr Ahmed throughout that period. Mrs Ross has remained in her accommodation for about 7 months since the Council first determined that it is unsuitable, and the Council has been in breach of the duty owed to her throughout that period. While a decision as to the suitability of her accommodation ought to have been made in response to her request for a review in September 2019, her remedy for the failure to make such a decision lay in the county court. Given that there is a temporal element to the assessment of suitability, I reject the claimant’s contention that because the accommodation was found to be unsuitable in October 2020, it follows that it must have been unsuitable on 13 January 2020 when the review decision omitted to determine the issue. </p>

As I have explained (see [29] and [86(ii)] above), that involves an evaluative exercise by the authority, which might conclude that the accommodation occupied by a homeless at home applicant is “suitable” for him to occupy temporarily, for the whole (or at least part) of the period in which the homeless application is being considered. However, <span style="text-decoration:underline">the Council</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">do not make an assessment of “suitability”. As a matter of policy,</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">if it considers an applicant may be homeless and in priority need,</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">then it will provide him with interim accommodation, if he</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">requires it.

In these circumstances, the Council does not seek to assess the current accommodation for suitability: it relies upon the applicant’s “self-certification” of the fact that the relevant accommodation is such that the applicant can reasonably be expected to stay there temporarily. Of course, as the Local Government Ombudsman’s report “Homelessness: How councils can ensure justice for homeless people” (July 2011) (the LGO July 2011 Report) emphasised (at p.5): “People must be made aware of their right to make an application if they wish to”.

At the point in time when Mr Al-Shameri was asked whether he needed temporary accommodation, the only accommodation duty owed to him was the interim one under section 188(1). Choosing to move out of a secure tenancy into temporary accommodation at that stage would have potentially left his family roofless, if the Council had subsequently determined that the section 193(2) duty was not owed. In addition, it is apparent from Ms Fenton’s evidence that he would have been told that answering ‘yes’ to the question whether he needed temporary accommodation may have resulted in his family being placed in bed and breakfast accommodation for a time, located anywhere in the city.

He was not informed, for example, that he could remain homeless at home for a short period (rather than moving his family into bed and breakfast accommodation) while the Council secured suitable, alternative, self-contained accommodation for him and his family.

There is force in the claimant’s submission that in circumstances where the Council had found, 18 months earlier, that it would be unreasonable for the Al-Shameri family to continue to occupy No.5, and since then a severely disabled child had been born into the family and another child was expected, making their accommodation difficulties worse, a decision that the accommodation could be regarded as suitable is hard to fathom. But it was open to the claimant to seek a review of the decision that No.5 was suitable (and if that decision was unfavourable to appeal to the county court). In these circumstances, and given the Council believed Mr Al-Shameri had chosen to remain homeless at home until he sought temporary accommodation on 1 September 2020, I am not prepared to conclude it was irrational to decide that it was suitable for the family to remain in their home for a few more weeks (rather than move into bed and breakfast accommodation) while alternative accommodation was urgently sought.

For the reasons I have given in addressing Ground 1, I have concluded that the Council has misunderstood the nature of the duty under section 193(2).

In such cases, the Council is currently meeting its duties to secure suitable accommodation and there can be no objection to the Council looking to the future by maintaining a spreadsheet of those for whom in a matter of weeks, months, perhaps even a year or so in some cases, it needs to find alternative suitable accommodation. Indeed, that would accord with the approach encouraged in <span style="font-style:italic">Birmingham v Ali.</span> But many of the applicants on the PML, including Mr Elkundi and Mr Ahmed (or those who have been inadvertently omitted, such as Mrs Ross) are in accommodation that is unsuitable. While I recognise the grave difficulties the Council faces in finding accommodation for the homeless, putting applicants who are owed the section 193(2) duty, and who are in unsuitable accommodation, on a waiting list for temporary accommodation is not a lawful means of fulfilling the unqualified and immediate duty to secure suitable accommodation for their occupation.</p>

A queuing system by reference to the date of joining the PML does not meet the obligations in section 149 of the Equality Act 2010. I recognise that the Council’s evidence indicates that there is some discretion to take applicants out of their order in the queue and an example is given of a property with level access becoming available, which may be offered to an applicant with a disability who requires such level access, rather than to the first person in the queue. This is not underpinned by any policy and it is hard to see how it is implemented given, for example, the lack of any data on the PML specifying the disabilities of Mr Elkundi or two of Mr Ahmed’s children. Moreover, this approach does not account for cases, for example, where the effect of a child’s disability is not that he needs <span style="font-style:italic">specialised</span> accommodation, but that he has a greater need for space to develop than others without his disability. It appears that no regard would be had to whether a household with such a child should be treated more favourably. </p>

For example, in a case where an applicant’s “<span style="font-style:italic">Days Waiting</span>” are 12 years and 10 months, if that is how long the applicant has been on the PML then the Council must have been in breach of its duty for many years. Even if the applicant may have been in accommodation that, at the outset, could be regarded as suitable for the medium-term, on any view, that period must have long passed. While this is the longest period, there are more than 60 applicants on the PML whose “Days Waiting” come to over three years. However, if (as I consider more likely) “<span style="font-style:italic">Days Waiting</span>” reflect the time since the applicant first applied for assistance, this point would fall away because the date of first application does not indicate the extent to which the applicant has been in suitable temporary accommodation since first applying.</p>

For example, family C may have applied for assistance under Part VII 8 years ago. Suitable temporary accommodation has been secured for them throughout that time until six months ago when, as a result of an increase in the size of the family, it was decided their accommodation is no longer suitable. Even though family C has been in suitable temporary accommodation for all save the last six months, this family would be much higher up the list than family D who applied for assistance 4 years ago and have been in unsuitable accommodation throughout that time.</p>

That is because, on the evidence before me, beyond a decision whether an applicant cannot remain where he is for another night, no thought goes into the question what period is reasonable in the individual case. The system operated by the Council is premised on a reasonable time being however long it takes an applicant to reach the head of the bedroom queue and be made an offer. The placement in the queue takes no account of the fact that time spent in unsuitable accommodation may be worse in some cases than in others. Taking just a few examples from these cases: mobility difficulties may have the effect that accessing the unsuitable accommodation causes a member of the household pain; a child’s operation may have to be postponed until suitable accommodation is available; unsuitable accommodation may affect the physical development of a disabled child; or unsuitable accommodation may result in a parent being effectively housebound for much of the day with a baby and disabled child.</p>

I consider that Mr Al-Shameri has standing, because he was not put on the PML when he made his homeless application in January 2018 or told about its existence and he was then put on the PML briefly in October 2020, before being offered a three-bedroom flat. Given the lack of explanation as to why he was not put on the PML in 2018, which bedroom queue he was placed in, and where, when he was put on the PML in 2020, and whether the offer that he rejected was made outside the operation of the PML, Mr Al-Shameri has a sufficient interest in the transparency and lawfulness of the system to pursue this ground of claim. I do not consider that the developments in Mr Al-Shameri’s case are such as to deprive him of standing in respect of this ground.</p>

When a two-bedroom property became available in Mrs Ross’s preferred area, Handsworth, the Council immediately, on 3 December 2020, notified Mrs Ross’s solicitors. Unfortunately, she did not bid for it. While it is understandable that she was concerned that there was insufficient information available as to whether the property would be adaptable, the Council has explained that if she is successful in a bid, steps can then be taken to ascertain whether the property can be suitably adapted and, if not, she will have an opportunity to bid again.</p>

This accommodation is 1.6 miles from Mrs Ross’s mother’s property and it is fully wheelchair adapted, ground floor, self-contained accommodation. Since October 2020 there have been eight two-bedroom properties at Pannel Croft available on Birmingham Choice. Mrs Ross chose not to place bids for any of these properties. Nevertheless, the Council explored the option of making a direct nomination. Ultimately this was unsuccessful because Pannel Croft took the view that “<span style="font-style:italic">Mrs Ross’s demands and behaviour in respect of the assessment</span>” were such that it was “<span style="font-style:italic">felt that she would not fit into the Scheme with the other residents</span>”.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in">In respect of Ground 1, Mr Al-Shameri is not entitled to mandatory relief, as I have dismissed his claim that the Council is in on-going breach of section 193(2) on the basis that the review decision determining that the offer of Flat 7 was suitable has not been challenged, and he has an alternative remedy. However, I have made a finding of a past breach of section 193(2). A claimant who establishes that a public body has acted unlawfully will normally be entitled to a declaration to mark the illegality in cases where no other relief is appropriate (<span style="font-style:italic">R (Good Law Project) v Secretary of State for Health </span>[2021] EWHC 346 (Admin), Chamberlain J at [152]). I will therefore grant Mr AlShameri a declaration that during the period from 27 April 2018 to 28 September 2020 the Council was in breach of its duty to him under section 193(2). </p>

The Council’s system of putting applicants who are owed the section 193(2) duty, and whose accommodation is currently unsuitable, onto a waiting list for temporary accommodation is not a lawful means of performing the duty. </p>
