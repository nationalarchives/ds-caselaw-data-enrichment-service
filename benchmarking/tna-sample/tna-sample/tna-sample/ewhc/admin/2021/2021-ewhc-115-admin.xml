	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">This is a case with a complicated procedural history.  The Claimant, who is a national of Portugal, was deported to Portugal on 2 July 2019 following a decision to deport him and a deportation order made on 17 September 2018.  He was at that time coming to the release date of a sentence of detention in a young offenders’ institution (“YOI”) for 6 counts of robbery.  The date of the decision was his 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> birthday.  About a month before his 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> birthday, the Claimant was served with a notice of liability to deport (a “DLN”) whilst still at a YOI. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The Claimant’s claim for judicial review arises out of the decision to deport and the deportation order each dated 17 September 2018, the regulation 33 certificate also dated 17 September 2018 and the earlier DLN made on 16 August 2018.  An order is sought to require the Defendant to return or facilitate the return of the Claimant to the UK.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">In recent months, there have been important developments.  In July 2020, the Court of Appeal found that the regulation 33 certificate was unlawful but adjourned the judicial review and the question of a mandatory injunction to the Administrative Court.  Since then, in September 2020, the Secretary of State issued a fresh certificate, albeit long after the deportation had taken effect.  There had not been a notice of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal (“FTT”) against the deportation order until at earliest 24 June 2019, many months out of time.  On 19 October 2020, time was extended by the FTT for bringing the notice of appeal, but the hearing of the appeal was stayed until after the hearing before the Administrative Court.  </p>

I had a meeting at Wetherby, a woman from the Home Office said that they would be looking into my case and that they might deport me. The woman gave me a letter that also said that I could be deported, I read some of it but I didn’t really understand it. The woman from the Home Office told me that I could appeal this but didn’t tell me how I could do it. I wasn’t told that I could be removed before any appeal. I wasn’t provided with a lawyer, or told how to contact one. My YOT worker, Ruth James came to the meeting with the Home Office. She didn’t say anything to me either before or after the meeting, she was there I understand because I was still only a child when they told me they were thinking of deporting me and so they needed to have someone there to act as an appropriate adult. She didn’t give me any advice and after that meeting I didn’t see her again. </p>

The judge's approach was therefore wrong in law; and the resulting exercise of his discretion in relation to interim relief consequently unlawful. It cannot be said that that error is immaterial. In those circumstances, in my view, the appropriate course is to grant permission to appeal, allow the appeal and quash Murray J's order refusing the Appellant's application for interim relief. </p>

I have set out Mr Bedford's submissions above (see paragraph 29). Mr Blundell submitted that the merits of the underlying appeal could only be indirectly relevant in an application for interim relief pending a judicial review of certification, because the focus in such an application must be on the merits of temporary removal pending the ultimate outcome of the certification decision, rather than permanent removal as a result of deportation; and, in respect of the former, the merits of an appeal against the deportation order can only be obliquely relevant. However, even on the basis of Mr Bedford's submissions on this issue, in my view this is not a case in which it would be right for this court now to determine the interim relief application taking into account the merits of the underlying appeal, because that was not envisaged by the Order of 12 May 2020 and, even if we were able properly to conduct such an exercise involving consideration of the merits, that would to an extent usurp not only the certifying function of the Secretary of State granted to her by the EEA Regulations (which she is in the process of (re)exercising in the Appellant's case), but also the function of the FtT (if the Upper Tribunal were to extend time) in determining whether there was (e.g.) procedural unfairness as alleged. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.04in;text-indent:0.5in">However, more importantly, leaving aside the systemic challenges (to which I shall return), as I have described, the ultimate substantive point in the judicial review claim is whether the treatment of the Appellant involved procedural unfairness when the notice of liability to deportation was first served upon him as a child. That involves factual assessments and decisions which, in my view, this court is not in a position now to make, even if we were to admit the fresh evidence that Mr Bedford asks us to admit. That this evidence is late, and was not before Murray J, only strengthens my view. </p>

In this case, it would require evidence (e.g. as to the Appellant's circumstances in Portugal) and/or submissions not currently before the court.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">As regards the future steps, Hickinbottom LJ concluded at para. 41 as follows: “having set aside the order of Murray J refusing the application for interim relief in the judicial review, that application should be remitted to the Administrative Court for re-determination of the application, in accordance with this judgment including the concessions made by the parties as recorded herein. I would encourage the court to use its case management powers to ensure that, so far as possible, all the Appellant's applications now before it are determined together and as soon as reasonably possible. I would also encourage both the FtT to proceed to determine the appeal before it with all expedition and, in the meantime, the Secretary of State to decide very soon whether or not she wishes to (re)certify. If she does not, the litigation becomes redundant. If she does, it is highly desirable that any challenge to the certificate is dealt with alongside the issues raised by the current proceedings.” </p>

The Appellant has now been excluded from the UK for over a year: that is a long time if his appeal against deportation eventually succeeds. The sooner there is some resolution of whether he can return on an interim basis (as a result either of a decision of the Secretary of State or of a decision of the court) the better. Of course a final resolution will be achieved once the Appellant's appeal against his deportation order is determined one way or the other. We now know that the First-tier Tribunal will be reconsidering his appeal, and I would hope that in view of the history that can be done as soon as possible.” </p>

The CD2 rejected the assertion that the Claimant did not speak much Portuguese at the time of deportation.  The view was taken that since he lived in Portugal for his first 13 years, the Claimant was able to speak Portuguese to a sufficiently high standard to be able adequately to communicate in Portugal: see para. 13.  It was also considered that he had a sufficient knowledge of the culture and customs of Portugal to be able to re-integrate into Portuguese society pending the outcome of the appeal.  He was young enough to adapt to life in Portugal: see para. 14.  In respect of his inability to get a job in Portugal and to afford to go to college, there was no evidence of any attempts to get work and of failure to do so.

This further information was not submitted before the Secretary of State’s CD2, but since most of it substantially repeats his statement of 30 April 2020, most of the substance was taken into account. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The Claimant was unaware in Portugal that the appeal against his deportation was not pending, believing that the appeal had been lodged on 24 June 2019.  When inquiries were made in January 2020, it was discovered that the Notice of Appeal had not been received.  A further Notice of Appeal was lodged in January 2020.  Both notices of appeal of June 2019 and January 2020 were considerably out of time.  There was a case management review hearing at the FTT on 19 March 2020, and a decision promulgated on 26 March 2020 refusing permission to appeal out of time.  There was a request for an adjournment by BIDUK to obtain legal aid.  That request does not appear to have reached the FTT.  On 10 July 2020, FTTJ Campbell set aside the decision of 19 March 2020 (promulgated on 26 March 2020).   </p>

Although long after the decision to detain an appeal notice was issued or there was an attempt to issue such a notice on 24 June 2019, it is not apparent why it was that no appeal notice was brought against the notice of deportation until June 2019.  This was despite the apparent rejection of bail on 30 November 2018 because no appeal against the decision to detain had been lodged.  It is not apparent why that did not trigger a discussion at least at that stage about a possible appeal out of time.  Very little is known about the triggers to an intended judicial review in April 2019 and to how Instalaw came to be instructed in June 2019.  Although much of the above was after the time of the decision to detain and the detention notice, it may be informative in respect of the representation or absence of representation at and before that time.      </p>

He must have understood rather more than he says as evidenced by the fact that he did prepare and submit the written representations of 3 September 2020.   There are points which go to his credibility over and above his offences of dishonesty.  He said in his representations that he had not committed the robberies, but he pleaded guilty to them.  In his letter to the FTT in his attempt to appeal on or about 24 June 2019, he said that a reason for his appeal was that “English is my second language”, whereas in his statement of 5 October 2020 (at para. 16), he said that he did not remember much Portuguese. </p>

The reference in the deportation one-stop notice to the Home Office making a deportation order if there was not a reply was badly drafted.  It does not bear an over literal meaning that the deportation order would be in default of representations as if like a default judgment.  Properly read in the context of the totality of the documents, it means that the decision whether or not to deport would be made without any representations.   The Claimant was informed by Home Office employees that he might be deported when he was eighteen (his statement of 30 April 2020 at para.6), so the Home Office employees and the Claimant understood the position.  The fact that there was a planning ahead for the decision to be made does not mean that the decision was a fait accompli.  There was a willingness to consider representations which were made.  It follows that the final decision was not made until the time it was made on 17 September 2018. </p>

However, an expulsion decision could not be taken against a Union Citizen who is a minor in view of Citizens’ Free Movement Directive Article 28(3), except if the decision were based on imperative grounds of public security or in the best interests of the child.  Those grounds were not alleged.  In fact, there was no intention to deport before he became an adult.  He was told that when he turned 18, he could be deported back to Portugal as he accepts in para. 6 of his statement of 30 April 2020 quoted above.  If it had been the case that there was an intention to deport whilst the Claimant was a minor, that might be a reason to challenge the DLN.  Further, if the decision to deport and/or the deportation notice had been issued whilst the Claimant was a minor, this might affect the validity of the DLN.  However, in circumstances where this did not happen and was never going to happen, to the extent that it amounts to a defect in the DLN, it is not a basis for setting aside the DLN or any remedy in the circumstances of this case. </p>

On the facts of this case, this had and could have no practical consequence whilst the Claimant was under 18.

This applies to how children are looked after while decisions about deportation or removal are made and to the decisions themselves: see an acknowledgment of this point by Counsel for the Home Secretary and Baroness Hale’s observation in respect of the same in <span style="font-style:italic">ZH(Tanzania) v Home Secretary</span> [2011] 2 AC 166 at [24-25].

As to General Comment No. 6 (treatment of unaccompanied and separated children outside their company of origin), relied on by both the Claimant and the Intervener, the Claimant has not been involved in asylum procedures, and any proceedings have taken place when he is an adult.  Art. 12(2) of UNCRC provides simply that a child shall be provided the opportunity to be heard in judicial or administrative proceedings: this does not support the submission that a child is required to be given free legal representation, and by the time the proceedings took place, he was an adult in any event.  Contrary to the Claimant’s skeleton argument, Articles 18 (assistance to parents) and 20 (care for a child removed from his parents) of UNCRC have nothing to do with, and provide no support for, a proposition that free legal representation should be provided. </p>

If the complaint is established on the facts, then the remedy needs to be considered.  In the first place, the question is what effect it has on the decision to deport which is before the FTT.

However there are other interests at stake as well. Another important rationale is the avoidance of the sense of injustice which the person who is the subject of the decision will otherwise feel.

The rationale for this proposition lies in the underlying reasons for having procedural fairness in the first place. It is conducive to better decision-making because it ensures that the decision-maker is fully informed at a point when a decision is still at a formative stage. It also shows respect for the individual whose interests are affected, who will know that they have had the opportunity to influence a decision before it is made. Another rationale is no doubt that, if a decision has already been made, human nature being what it is, the decision-maker may unconsciously and in good faith tend to be defensive over the decision to which he or she has previously come.” </p>

It remains to ascertain the primary facts as to whether the Secretary of State has been able to prove that a proper opportunity was so afforded to the Claimant both as a matter of fact and as a matter of law.  It is relevant that he was still a minor until the day of the day of the decision to deport, albeit about to be 18 years old.  A part of it, according to Mr Bedford, is to consider whether the Claimant as a child would, if he had been afforded a full opportunity to state his case, have called for his file and the AssetPlus report or for other evidence such as from his mother and stepfather or for evidence as to what would await him in Portugal or on his ability to defend himself from abroad.   </p>

He relied on the case of <span style="font-style:italic">R v Bouchereau</span> (Case 30/77) [1978] QB 732, recently cited at length by Foster J in the case of <span style="font-style:italic">Hafeez </span>at paras. 6569.  The Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Bouchereau</span> decided among other questions, whether the recommendation only of a Court for deportation could be described as a "measure" within an earlier iteration of the Citizens' Directive, Directive 64/221. The Court held that it could: it was a step on the way to a final order.  A measure was taken to mean any action which affects the rights within the field of the application of article 48 freely to enter and reside in the member states.  <span style="font-style:italic">Bouchereau</span> was a case concerning a challenge to the process then attaching to the decision of a Crown Court to deport an EEA national and the proper characterisation of that step within the deportation process. </p>

He submits that notice of liability to deportation is not a “measure” for the purposes of the Directive: it does not itself interfere with the exercise of any rights; it simply gives a person a chance to set out their position as to why an adverse decision (which would interfere with their rights) should not be taken.   </p>

It simply gives a person a chance to set out their position as to why an adverse decision should not be taken. According to domestic law, it gives the potential deportee an opportunity to make representations in advance of the decision whether to deport.  This does not make it a “measure” in the sense of being a necessary step in the process of arriving at any decision to make a deportation.  Contrast here with the “measure” in<span style="font-style:italic"> Bouchereau</span> (the decision of a Crown Court to deport an EEA national) or in <span style="font-style:italic">Hafeez</span> (a certification precluding the EEA national from remaining in the country pending the in-time appeal).

There might not be such a decision prior to the deportation notice.  Further, in this case, there would not be such a decision if the decision to deport were made, as occurred in this case, prior to the end of the sentence of detention for the robberies.  The relevant decision here is the decision to have immigration detention and not the happening of an event which could make it possible.  I reject the submission of the Claimant that the DLN ought to have warned the Claimant as a child that he was expected to give reasons why he should not be removed in advance of any appeal against deportation and/or that, following certification, his remedy would be by judicial review.   This did not invalidate the DLN itself which was simply a notification that the Secretary of State was considering making a decision to deport, and its purpose was to elicit representations.  If such notices were required at all, this was at the stage of the decision to deport.  In the statutory appeal, there may be considered what opportunity ought to have been afforded to him as a child in advance of the notice of the decision to deport, and further the adequacy or otherwise of the notices given on 17 September 2018.  This may form a part of the statutory appeal. </p>

That part of the enquiry may include what happened at the meeting on 16 August 2018 and the communication with the Claimant thereafter and up to the time of the decision to deport.  It will include the matters relating to Barnardo’s.  It will include the facilities available for him in the YOI.  There is also the issue as to whether in the circumstances of this case, there was an obligation to provide legal representation or what other level of assistance may have been required.  As noted above, this is at least in part a question of fact.  It is possible that it will include consideration of the opportunities thereafter to challenge the notices both before the time of the removal of the Claimant and thereafter: it is an area emphasised by the Secretary of State, but here too there may be factual controversy.  Within that consideration, there may arise other matters raised by the Claimant including whether he was informed wrongly that he could only appeal from outside the UK and/or not advised at the time of the decision to deport of his right to claim judicial review.   All of this inquiry may entail consideration of whether any inadequacies were alleviated by whatever happened to the Claimant at a later stage whether before or after his removal. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1.29in;margin-right:0.04in">The FTT is better suited than this Court to consider the matters relating to the decision to deport.  The reasons for this are that “an appeal before a tribunal is a preferable procedure in this context to judicial review…the tool of judicial review has proved to be flexible, capable of being shaped to different levels of intensity and intrusive inquiry, depending on the matter in hand.  However, the hearing of an appeal before the tribunal is a probably somewhat better as procedure for an intense review of the facts…”.  These remarks of Irwin LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Khan v Secretary of State for the Home Department</span> [2018] 1 WLR 125 at para. 46 were made in the context of a refusal to grant a residence card to a person claiming to be an extended family member.  This recognises that which was submitted by Mr Cox on behalf of the Intervener that “factual review is routinely conducted by the FTT and only rarely through judicial review”: see para. 49 of the skeleton argument for the Intervener.  The FTT judges are specialists in the area building up what Lord Toulson described as a “body of knowledge” in the case of <span style="font-style:italic">R (TN Afghanistan) v Secretary of State for the Home Department </span>[2015] 1 WLR 3083 at para. 38.  They are therefore particularly suited to the factual inquiry in question, very frequently seeing witnesses and having them cross-examined.</p>

Apparently, the decision to stay the FTT proceedings pending this hearing was taken by the Tribunal of its own motion.  Whilst it is for the Tribunal to make its own directions, if it were to decide to have an expedited disposal of this matter, that would be entirely appropriate and justified.  The Tribunal will have in mind the concerns of Hickinbottom LJ in the instant case at para. 41 encouraging the FTT to proceed to determine the appeal before it with all expedition, and to the related concern of Underhill LJ at para. 43 as quoted above.  Despite this, in my judgment, it is not appropriate for this Court to determine the matter which the Claimant has properly and understandably brought before the Tribunal. </p>

Although the statutory appeal may be more confined, in practice, it is likely to extend to matters beyond the decision to deport itself, and to include the European law challenge and  the challenge of common law procedural unfairness, in respect of the alleged failure to extend an adequate opportunity to make representations against a decision to deport.    It is likely that given that the statutory appeal is to consider whether the decision to detain can stand, that it will also be considering matters subsequent to the decision to detain as above set out.

The scope of that enquiry may be greater than the judicial review as the FTT considers factually and legally whether there were grounds to deport the Claimant.  For the reasons set out above, any shortcoming in the opportunity to address the decision to deport may come within the scope of the inquiry of the FTT. It remains to be seen to what extent the FTT will be able to take these all into account.  If they take them all into account, then there may be nothing or little more that remains to be considered in this regard in the judicial review.  Even to the extent that it does not, at that point, and with the benefit of the findings of the statutory appeal, there will be an opportunity to restore the judicial review and for this Court to consider a focused judicial review with the benefit of the finding of the statutory appeal. </p>

It is submitted on behalf of the Secretary of State that the matter can be corrected by a subsequent certificate taking into account proportionality.

The Court of Appeal in this case recognised that the Secretary of State would be considering re-certification.  This was mentioned at paras. 36 and 41 of the judgment of the Court of Appeal in the instant case.  Indeed, at para. 36, Hickinbottom LJ did not wish to usurp the certifying function of the Secretary of State which she was in the process of (re-)exercising in the case of the Claimant.  At para. 41, he referred to the Secretary of State deciding whether or not she wished to (re-)certify.  There was no criticism about this process.  On the contrary, it appears to be treated as the corollary of the unlawful first certificate that the Secretary of State should carry out the proportionality exercise, and if the removal pending the appeal was considered proportionate, to certify accordingly.  If there was no re-certification, that might be fatal to the case of the Secretary of State: on the other hand, if there was recertification, the FTT could still decide whether or not the decision to deport was proportionate: see Article 27(2). </p>

The Claimant says that this is wrong as a matter of statutory construction.  Even if the Claimant were right, the key point here is as to whether the decision to deport complied with proportionality (see Article 27(2)).  If it did not, notwithstanding the re-certification, then the FTT will be able to make a determination to that effect.  If it did comply with proportionality, then there is no obvious reason why the non-compliance of the first certificate due to failure to deal with proportionality should lead to the decision to deport and all subsequent steps being quashed for that reason.  This all underlines the sense in the FTT deciding matters at this stage, and the question of whether there is still any further scope for judicial review being stayed until after the decision of the FTT.</p>

There are various features here.  However, it is to be noted that in the event that the challenge in the FTT is successful as regards the decision to deport, this may impact directly on the removal of the Claimant.  If, on the other hand, the decision to detain was lawful, then it may be that the judicial review will either fall away or be far more limited.  Further and in any event, although there may be concerns about the period of detention until the deportation, there are real questions as to why the Claimant as an adult did not take steps himself to bring matters to a head earlier by an appeal and/or a judicial review before 24 June 2019.  If there are issues relating to the removal, it is important to have the statutory appeal first, which is likely to affect the scope of any issue relating to the removal whether the statutory appeal is resolved in favour of or against the Claimant. </p>

That discretion is wide, and there is no presumption in favour of return, even where certification is unlawful. The exercise of the discretion will be fact-sensitive.

If the court assesses that, even if the exercise would be more difficult than pursuing his appeal in the UK, the deportee could effectively pursue his appeal from abroad, that is likely to be finding of great weight and will often be determinative in favour of exercising the court's discretion not to make a mandatory order for return. On the other hand, if the court assesses that he could not effectively pursue an appeal from abroad, then that may well be determinative in favour of exercising that discretion in favour of making a mandatory order for return.” </p>

The detailed analysis in the CD2 leads to a conclusion that on the information before the Court, proportionality requires the removal to be maintained at this stage.  On the one hand, the Claimant is able to point to his evidence as to his difficulties in Portugal being away from the UK where he has lived for a number of years.  His evidence is that he feels that he is a burden on his grandmother, he says that he has difficulty with language, he is unable to work, he has no social assistance, and he wants his independence.  He feels that there are more opportunities for him in the UK.  As Underhill LJ stated in the Court of Appeal, there is concern about the length of the period of his living in Portugal if he is going to be allowed back in the UK after the decision of the FTT or the judicial review. </p>

If the Claimant were to be at liberty, there is according to the assessments which have been done a high risk of reoffending and of committing serious crimes with a high risk of serious harm to the public.  This is based not only on the serious and escalating convictions, but also the conduct of the Claimant in detention, the company with which he has associated, the lack of control of the members of his family, the failure to face up to his own criminality and his protracted absences from family and college.

It is right to say that there is scope for some caution about the fact that the CD2 was an ex post facto certification, and therefore might be considered with some care.  Nevertheless, as set out above, the Court of Appeal made no adverse comment about the intended re-certification.  Further, there is scope for concern that there are matters referred to in CD2 which were not considered in CD1 including behaviour in prison.  If it had been of concern, it is suggested that the behaviour would have been recorded in CD1.  These are matters of comment which can be made in the FTT.  They do not invalidate the comments because ultimately the consideration of whether there were grounds of public policy or public security are objective matters to be considered by the FTT.  As regards the behaviour in question, it was all documented at the time.

Instead of a presumption, Article 27(1) of the Citizens’ Free Movement Directive recognises explicitly that Member States may restrict the freedom of movement and residence of Union citizens and their family members, irrespective of nationality on grounds of public policy and public security: see also Regulation 23(6) and especially sub-paragraph (b) of the EEA Regulations 2016 referring in turn to Regulation 27.

However, for this purpose, I shall assume that it is the American Cyanamid threshold of a prima facie case, and not any higher threshold.  The nature of the interim relief is then a balance of convenience, or as Mr Bedford submits, a balance of injustice on both sides if the interim order proves to have been incorrect.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.04in">“The principal dilemma about the grant of interlocutory injunctions, whether prohibitory or mandatory, is that there is by definition a risk that the court may make the 'wrong' decision, in the sense of granting an injunction to a party who fails to establish his right at the trial (or would fail if there was a trial) or alternatively, in failing to grant an injunction to a party who succeeds (or would succeed) at trial. A fundamental principle is therefore that the court should take whichever course appears to carry the lower risk of injustice if it should turn out to have been 'wrong' in the sense I have described. The guidelines for the grant of both kinds of interlocutory injunctions are derived from this principle." </p>

The Claimant is a serious offender, who is regarded as being at high risk of reoffending and of causing serious harm to the public.

In my judgment, the appropriate course is to stay the claim for judicial review until after the hearing before the FTT.  By keeping alive the claim for judicial review, in the event and to the extent that the statutory appeal does not cover the same ground as the claim for judicial review, such matters as can only be dealt with by way of judicial review can still be considered.  In my judgment, it is likely that the effect of the decision of the FTT, subject to any appeal, will show the way forward in respect of the matters not overlapping with the statutory appeal.  The fair solution here is to stay the claim for judicial review pending the statutory appeal, but with liberty to apply to restore the rolled-up hearing at any time after the decision of the FTT.    </p>

If there is a finding that the decision to deport was not justified, this may make unnecessary all or a substantial part of the judicial review: as regards such part as remains, it may send a clear signal as to the result of a claim in judicial review whether about the claim itself or the appropriate remedy (if any). </p>

That will also be the moment to consider the No Substantial Difference Threshold, with the benefit of the findings of the Tribunal. Alternatively still, the Tribunal may reject the appeal.  At that stage, taking into account the findings of the FTT, it may still be appropriate to consider what is left of the judicial review, and whether in fact the rejection of the appeal cuts across the judicial review entirely or in parts in respect of the claim or remedies sought. </p>

There was no intention to issue a deportation notice before the 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> birthday and that was understood by the Claimant, as set out in paragraph 6 of his statement of 30 April 2020 referred to above.

That was important both from his perspective of advancing matters which might lead to the decision not being made or being postponed and from the perspective of the Secretary of State to take into account all relevant considerations: see Article 27(2) of the Citizens’ Free Movement Directive.  As stated above, the question of any failure to give sufficient opportunity to make representations stands to be considered in the light of the evidence before the FTT and can properly be considered as a part of the adjudication in respect of the notice of intention to deport.   </p>

It was also to elicit informed representations from a person to make an expulsion decision, as the Intervener submits.  If there was a deportation earlier than that, which there was never going to be, that would have been unlawful in this case prior to the Claimant’s 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> birthday.  Further, this was not a case where there was any possibility of immigration detention prior to the Claimant’s 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> birthday. </p>

At that stage, a more focussed pleading may be possible.  I shall hear from the parties as to which course is preferred.  It should be made clear that if it is the latter, it will be recorded that the Court was not minded to refuse the amendment due to delay in bringing the claims, and that any postponement of any adjudication should be treated as a matter of case management rather than a reason to disallow an amendment.

If the Claimant is right that there had to be a certificate, the unlawful nature of the certificate is likely to be subsumed by the matters which the FTT is to consider including whether the decision to deport complied with the principle of proportionality: see Article 27(2) of the Citizens’ Free Movement Directive.  If the FTT decides that it was proportionate or not proportionate, the question as to the lawfulness or otherwise of the first certificate may be a matter of no consequence and is rectified by the re-certification.  This all adds to the sense of not determining the judicial review until after the FTT has made its decision, and then considering after this and in the light of its decision (and whichever way the decision goes) whether there is any need or scope still for judicial review. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The Court rejects the submission of the Secretary of State that thus the application for judicial review fails due to the availability of an alternative remedy.  It is not known at this stage how far the FTT will deal with the matters in issue relating to the decision to deport and how that will affect the other matters in the judicial review, namely the deportation notice, the certificate, the detention issues and the removal.  It may be necessary for these matters to be considered consequentially upon the decision of the FTT, or in the event and to the extent that the matters are not decided by the FTT, they may still arise for determination. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The Court also rejects the submission of the Secretary of State at this stage that it is highly likely that the outcome for the Claimant would not have been substantially different had the matters complained of not occurred.  It is premature to embark upon any such consideration until after the decision of the FTT.  The Court should not decide such a matter prior to the factual findings of the FTT or based upon hypotheses which may become invalidated as a result of the evidence before the FTT and/or its decision.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The matter has been stayed by the FTT pending the decision of this Court.  This Court will not direct the FTT as to how to decide the matter.  However, there is a concern expressed in particular by the Court of Appeal as to the length of time that the Claimant has been in Portugal before resolution of his case.  In the light of that, the FTT may be asked to expedite the hearing of the appeal.  If that is possible, it would be highly desirable.  </p>
