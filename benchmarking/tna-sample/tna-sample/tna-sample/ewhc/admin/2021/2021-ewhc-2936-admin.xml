	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">The first claimant is 7 years old. She is a pupil in year 2 at Misterton Church of England First School (“Misterton”). Misterton is a voluntary controlled school located in the village of Misterton, near the town of Crewkerne in Somerset. Misterton is a first school, educating children in the five year groups from reception to year 4, that is, between the ages of 4 and 9. It is also, as its name indicates, a Church of England (“CofE”) school. Misterton has been designated a rural school for the purposes of the Education and Inspections Act 2006.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Currently, the schools in the area are in a three-tier structure, consisting of first, middle and upper schools (save to the extent that there are already three primary schools). The effect of the decision is to change the existing three-tier structure to a two-tier structure, consisting of primary and secondary schools. In broad terms, the proposals involve: (i) the closure of Misterton; (ii) the amalgamation of Greenfylde and Swanmead Community School (a middle school for children aged 9-13) to form a single new primary school on a split site; (iii) changing Wadham School (an upper school for children aged 13-18) into a secondary school (admitting children aged 11-18); and (iv) changing four other first schools and one middle school into primary schools.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">The principal focus of the first claimant’s challenge is the decision to close her current school, Misterton; while the main focus of the second claimant’s challenge is the decision to amalgamate Greenfylde and Swanmead, and so close Swanmead, the non-denominational middle school which his mother wished him to attend from year 5 to year 8. However, both claimants challenge the decision as a whole.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">The evidence is that Wadham’s deficit flows from the school structure and the demography of the area. The funding that the defendant receives from the government for mainstream state-funded schools is based on the National Funding Formula (“NFF”). The NFF is a per pupil formula which is standardised across the country. The defendant then allocates that funding to schools in the county. Local authorities are not required to follow the NFF in distributing the funds they receive to schools, but Ms Walker states that they are encouraged by the government to do so. The defendant has adopted the NFF and so the funding each school in Somerset receives is calculated by reference to the NFF. Any decision to deviate from the NFF would entail allocating less money to some schools than they would receive if the formula were followed and redirecting it to other schools within the area. Such a decision could only be made with the agreement of the Schools Forum. In other words, the leaders of some schools would have to agree that their school should receive less money than the defendant has received by reference to the number of pupils attending their school.</p>

Across three years of Key Stage 3, there would be 15 classes worth of pupils. For Key Stage 3 in this example, pupils exceed discrete subjects (12 compared to 15). For Key Stage 4, most schools will offer more than 12 distinct subjects, as the range of GCSE and vocational subjects available nationally is very wide. However, even if a school did not expand choice beyond the 12 subjects in Key Stage 3, there are only two years of Key Stage 4 and therefore only 10 classes worth of pupils. This means that teachers needed now exceeds classrooms worth of pupils. The funding for Key Stage 4 is higher than for Key Stage 3 for this reason. However, as the number of pupils diminishes, the harder it becomes for the school to able to balance the number of pupils against the number of specialist teachers needed, and as pupil numbers diminish this problem becomes acute more quickly for Key Stage 4 than for Key Stage 3.”</p>

By contrast, the other local authority-maintained secondary school in Somerset, Frome Community College, has around 1200 pupils compared to around 470 pupils on the roll at Wadham. At more than twice the size it can comfortably deliver the Key Stage 4 curriculum within funding. For Wadham to reach a similar level of efficiency it would need to make drastic and brutal cuts to the curriculum in Key Stage 4. This would have an immediate negative impact on children’s education by curtailing the options available for GCSE or other national qualifications. Further, this impact would be felt most by children whose economic circumstances meant they had no other choice of school, as there is no other school that teaches GCSEs within the funded transport area.”</p>

Increasing the average class size across the school will support the current curriculum offer and thereby balancing the finances with the educational experience.

While several of the existing schools were under-utilised with pupil numbers below site capacity (particularly across middle and upper schools), it was projected that additional school places would be needed across first and middle year groups to meet educational needs. Consequently, Scenario 1A (‘do minimum’) was developed to serve as the “baseline” for testing the other six options. This was the same as option 1, save to the extent that it involved making some preparation for growth in numbers of first and middle school pupils.</p>

If the proposal failed to carry the support of the Schools Forum, this would place other aspects of the Schools Budget at risk.

They will also look at the impact on pupils with Special Educational Needs, early years provision (pre-school and nursery), staffing implications, transport costs, impact on communities and the costs of making any change. </p>

On 16 September 2019, the South West Regional Schools Commissioner (on behalf of the Secretary of State for Education) granted Swanmead’s application to become an academy and to join BTCT. The defendant successfully challenged that decision in judicial review proceedings on the basis, amongst others, that the Commissioner had failed to have regard to the prejudicial impact that making an academy order would have on the defendant’s ongoing review of the educational structure of schools in the area.

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">A. This option has been investigated. In the last consultation, people told us that they wanted to keep as many schools as possible and avoid closure. However, if all schools in the Crewkerne area, including Misterton, were retained, this would result in far too many places compared to how many children there would be. The council cannot close Maiden Beech, and it is unlikely the remaining schools could accommodate all the children without this large school. Hinton St George, Haselbury Plucknett and Merriott are significantly further away from Crewkerne. Ashlands is the only school in North Crewkerne and the likelihood is that this will be the location for housing growth. There would be too many spaces in and around South Crewkerne. To reduce this oversupply either St Barts or Misterton could be closed. Misterton is a smaller school and therefore the number of children disrupted by closure would be fewer. Around half the pupils in Misterton live in Crewkerne.</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">A. This is not the first time we have consulted on this matter. In the last consultation multiple options were provided. The outcome of that consultation was entirely inconclusive, and no options received general support, including no change. The council is required by law to precede any decision to reorganise by a publication of one clear and definitive plan. It was judged to be most transparent to consult on that plan widely before a decision was taken whether to progress with that statutory stage. The law states that a proposal that is taken to Cabinet must be the same as the statutory notices. By consulting on one option it provides the opportunity for the community to influence what that model looks like or stop the progress of the decision-making process.”</p>

In this scenario the Diocese and upper school have an  effective veto. This is because academisation decisions have to be taken by the  school’s governing body in the first instance, and the decision to join a trust must additionally be agreed by the trust and the Regional Schools Commissioner, with advice from the headteacher board. However, where the school is a church school, the trust must hold church articles, and the Diocese must agree that the trust meets the criteria to hold church articles. Therefore, unless all parties are in agreement, a church school such as Wadham cannot academise and join a  particular trust.</p>

If 60 were reallocated to  Misterton, this would result in 140 pupils on roll at Maiden  Beech. The building would be more than two thirds vacant.  This is financially and operationally inadvisable as the school  would not have sufficient funding with such a low intake to  carry the cost of such a large site.  For Misterton, this would result in a two-class school of 56  pupils. This would involve redirecting pupils out of Crewkerne  as there are only around 30 pupils in the village. In past years  the first preferences for this school were 5 in 2020, 1 in 2019,  and in 2018 there were 3.  A two-class primary negatively affects the ability of the school  to deliver high standards and the minimum being proposed in  the current model is three classes. This is because to avoid mixing key stages one class would be 24 pupils and the other  32.   It would not be viable to allocate an intake of 4 to Misterton  with one class of 28. This would also leave Maiden Beech with  six classes which is not deliverable within the 30-pupil limit for  Key Stage 1 without mixing key stages.</p>

Our decision to consult on a single model was a positive decision to do so. It was clear to us that this was an exceptionally complex scenario, and that any option, if pursued, could easily result in unintended consequences. Were we to consult again on multiple options, the feedback we would likely receive would be primarily in the form of lobbying for one option rather than another, and we would likely fail to receive detailed consideration of all aspects of the various models. The regulations require that statutory proposals include extensive consideration of a wide range of factors. It was my view that, without testing a specific model, we would be unable to progress a statutory proposal that was sufficiently detailed and insightful. <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">If the consultation feedback had revealed that the model was fatally flawed, or if a more desirable model had come forward, we would have the latitude to make fundamental changes at that stage.</span> Once we advance to statutory consultation, a decision must be taken within a defined time period that relates to those proposals, and while they may change, this does not allow for a complete about turn at that late stage.

If a decision is taken to move forward, one of the things we would be investing in is a detailed study of the accommodation options for an Ilminster school. Money has already been committed, subject to a decision to progress on the 17th, to invest in reconfiguring the accommodation so that Swanmead could serve Key Stage 2 pupils. It would be counterproductive not to look at the longer term at the same time, so if this goes ahead we would take the opportunity to think more widely about the future, including what the old Adult Education building on Ditton Street could be used for (because it sits right next to Swanmead). Or whether Swanmead could be expanded to bring all pupils onto one site. Or in what circumstances the time would be right to consider a whole new building. If the decision on the 17th is that change is coming, this would create opportunities as well as challenges.

In other words, by the point of publication of its Statutory Proposal – after the Stage 1 consultation and prior to Stage 2 - the defendant was required to narrow down to a single proposed model. However, the Q&amp;A Factsheet and Ms Walker’s evidence make clear that the defendant <span style="font-style:italic">chose</span> to consult on a single model during the Stage 1 consultation in the knowledge that it was not required by law to limit the options at that stage.</p>

He held that the omission of any Gatwick option was unfair because the effect was that when expansion of Gatwick came to be considered in the future, representations in its favour would have to argue against Government policy enshrined in a White Paper, having been prevented from making representations about Gatwick prior to the adoption of that Government Policy: see [29]-[32].

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Thirdly, it was important that consultation at Stage 1 should be upon proposals of some specificity because of the identity of those being consulted (<span style="font-style:italic">Moseley </span>at [26]), which here included parents. Specificity was desirable as it would give consultees proposals into which they could “get their teeth” (as Hodgson J put it in <span style="font-style:italic">Gunning</span>) and enable the proposals to be properly tested. At the same time, particularly given that a significant body of consultees consisted of parents of pupils, it was crucial that “the consultation documents should be clear and understandable, and therefore should not be unduly complex or lengthy”: see <span style="font-style:italic">Moseley, </span>Lord Reed<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>at [41]. If, as the claimants contend, the defendant had been required to <span style="font-style:italic">consult</span> at Stage 1 on each of the “most viable” scenarios identified in the FS Report, the consultation documents would have been far too long and complex. It has to be borne in mind that each alternative, if set out with any specificity, would have been multi-faceted, each one affecting numerous schools in the area in a variety of different ways.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Fourthly, the defendant’s reasons for deciding to consult on a single model were rational and show the defendant’s aim was to ensure that a primary purpose of the consultation, namely, to secure better decision-making, was achieved: see paragraph 124 above. The outcome of the Stage 0 consultation exercise had been inconclusive. It had enabled the principles to which I have referred to be developed, but the defendant’s view that consulting again at Stage 1 on multiple proposals was unlikely to result in any significant progress was a reasonable one. Although I accept that the word “lobbying” was inapt, and sympathise with the claimants’ objection to it, I reject the contention that the defendant was dismissive of the purpose of consultation. Ms Walker’s concern that the defendant would be less likely to receive focused and detailed feedback, properly testing any model, if there were multiple options on the table was not unreasonable, as the existence of multiple proposals would have enabled (and likely led) consultees to support or oppose the various proposals according to how any particular school in which they were interested was affected, without engaging more deeply with the proposals.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Fifthly, it cannot sensibly be said that it was so unfair as to be unlawful for the defendant not to re-consult at Stage 1 on all of the options consulted upon at Stage 0. Options 3B, 4A and 4D were all (like the model on which the defendant consulted at Stage 1) two-tier models. None of these models were unviable. But each required the closure of many more rural first schools than the model consulted on. The defendant decided, “recognising the strength of feeling in the first consultation against school closure, as well as the presumption against the closure of rural schools and the impact on rural communities of closure”, that “while school closure was potentially unavoidable, we should aim to close as few schools as possible”. Consequently, these three options were dropped prior to the Stage 1 consultation precisely because the defendant conscientiously took into account the outcome of the Stage 0 consultation. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Notably, none of these three options would have made it more likely that Misterton would remain open – quite the contrary. And as these were two-tier options, whatever the precise proposal in respect of Swanmead, it would not have remained a middle school. It is evident that the only reason for suggesting that the defendant was required to consult on these options is to support the submission that option 1A/2 had to be consulted on, having been included by FS amongst the most viable options they identified.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Options 5C and 5D “retained the rural schools, but at a cost of inefficiency”. The defendant’s view that there was “no merit in undergoing the pain of reorganisation only to create a new inefficient system” cannot be faulted. From the claimants’ perspective, option 5C would have resulted in Misterton remaining open, and Greenfylde remaining a first school, but it involved the closure of Swanmead. It was assessed by FS as <span style="font-style:italic">worse</span> overall than the baseline option and it received strongly negative feedback in the Stage 0 consultation. Option 5D was the less inefficient of the two hybrid options, but it was open to the defendant to conclude that it was not a significant enough gain, compared to the status quo, to be worth pursuing given the even stronger negative feedback on this option at Stage 0.</p>

However, I am not prepared to proceed on the basis of that concession which was based on the understanding that FS concluded that option 1A was not viable. When the FS Report concluded that “‘doing nothing’ is not an option” and that “do nothing is not feasible if sufficient educational places are to be realised”, the option being addressed was option 1 (not 1A). FS did not determine that Option 1A was not viable and it was one of the options addressed in section 12 of the report, under the heading “Most Viable Options”. This does not mean that it was not open to the defendant to determine, at the end of the process, that it was not an acceptable option. But retaining the status quo was a realistic alternative throughout the process: it would have been the outcome if the defendant had decided to reject the proposals, rather than accept them (with or without modifications).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Nevertheless, in my judgement, having regard to the points I have made above, fairness did not require the defendant to put forward option 1A as an alternative proposal at Stage 1. The defendant was entitled to consult on a preferred option: see <span style="font-style:italic">Royal Brompton</span> at [10], [142] and [151]. Normally, it is for the body carrying out a consultation to decide how to pitch it and what options to include or exclude, albeit the exclusion from consideration of a particular proposal may, depending on the factual and statutory context, be so unfair as to be unlawful. As Jefford J observed in <span style="font-style:italic">AA, </span>numerous authorities emphasise that the body carrying out a consultation has a large measure of discretion as to what it consults on (see [84]-[92]).

Although the FS Report included Option 2 amongst the group of scenarios it described as the “most viable” options (just as it included 5C in this group, even though it was worse than the status quo), on a fair reading of the FS Report, the authors’ doubts about the feasibility or efficacy of Option 2 are manifest.

In addition, option 2 was otherwise the same as option 1A.

Therefore, when the authority resolved to change to a two-tier system, it precluded the possibility of the middle schools remaining open (even subject to prescribed alterations). In consulting about the closure of specific schools for the first time after resolving to change to a two-tier system, the authority failed to consult at a formative stage on the closure of those schools.</p>

In the Detailed Stage 1 Proposals document, the defendant expressed interest in hearing views as to how the school building might be used if the school were to close (albeit no question seeking such views was included in the Stage 1 Questionnaire). This is not evidence of predetermination. A mandatory consideration in formulating any statutory proposal to close Misterton was “the likely effect of the discontinuance of the school on the local community” (s.15(4) EIA 2006). Information as to how the building might be used if the school were to be closed would have been potentially relevant to the defendant’s consideration of that issue. If the consultation had only addressed <span style="font-style:italic">how </span>the proposal should be adopted, that would have demonstrated that the defendant was not willing to reconsider in the light of the consultation process whether the case for closing Misterton was made out.

I agree with the defendant that, properly understood, the FS Report was addressing the possibility that non-cooperation by certain bodies would prevent implementation of proposals the defendant might choose to pursue. For example, proposals to change the age ranges of academies would be in the hands of the BTCT and the Regional Schools Commissioner, not the defendant.

As the defendant has said, change which commands the support of all stakeholders would be preferable. But in reality, re-organisation of the structure of education in a particular area, such as this one, will almost invariably face challenges and objections.

It was noted that one of the steps that must be considered, with a view to avoiding closure of such a school, namely becoming part of a federation of schools, had already been taken as Misterton is part of a federation with Ashlands. The reasons given to justify the proposal to close Misterton were that there were surplus places elsewhere in the local area which could accommodate displaced pupils and there was not predicted demand for the school in the medium to long term.

But I do not consider that the consultation is so unfair as to be unlawful by reason of the detailed analysis being provided after the Stage 1 consultation. First, the issues were sufficiently raised prior to Stage 1 to enable intelligent response in the documents to which I have referred. Secondly, the fairness of the consultation must be judged as a whole, bearing in mind that the process is an evolving one. It is indisputable that consultees were fully informed of the defendant’s analysis regarding the presumption prior to the Stage 2 consultation.

The requirement to have regard operates throughout the process of formulating the proposal. Second, he submits that the duty to have regard to the s.15(4) considerations arises in parallel with the pre-publication consultation duty in s.16. Mr Broach placed reliance on the headings above sections 15 and 16 which read, respectively, “Proposals for discontinuance of schools maintained by local authority” and “Consultation in relation to proposals under section 15”. Third, he submits this interpretation gives effect to Parliament’s intention that regard should be had to the s.15(4) matters throughout the process, not just at a point far into the process when there is a risk that it may be difficult to backtrack.</p>

It is clear that the references to the “proposer” and a “proposal” relate to the publication of a statutory proposal pursuant to s.15(1) of the EIA 2006 by a local authority (or pursuant to s.15(2) where the proposer is a governing body). The Closure Guidance requires all of the matters referred to in s.15(4)(a) to (d), and some additional matters, to be considered when producing a statutory proposal and for evidence of careful consideration to be contained in the statutory proposal.</p>

Second, the defendant adopted the presumption, prior to the Stage 1 consultation, when devising the principles that should guide the drawing up of any model. Third, the defendant had regard to the presumption when determining, prior to the Stage 1 consultation, that options 3B, 4D and 4A, which would have involved the closure of seven, five or two designated rural first schools, respectively, should not be pursued, despite option 3B achieving the highest score overall in FS’s evaluation and both options 4D and 4A scoring well on the revenue assessment. </p>

So argument raised is not that there is a bar to the grant of permission: it goes only to the question of relief (if it arises).</p>

This adverse impact flows from losing the staged transition at the age of 13 to the upper school. While the decision results in one transition rather than two, the second claimant emphasises that (i) the transition to Wadham will take place when pupils are two years younger; and (ii) it will be a transition to the bigger environment of Wadham as an enlarged secondary school.</p>

This will be difficult for all children, especially those who are classed as ‘vulnerable children’ and those with SEND, to adapt to as they will find the new, bigger school intimidating and uncomfortable.”</p>

On the contrary, its expert view is that the reduction in transition points, as a result of the decision to move from a three-tier to a two-tier system is beneficial for such pupils. In this regard, the defendant relies on the evidence of Ms Walker at paragraph 72 of her statement.</p>

The fact that FS identified two transitions as potentially having a negative impact on vulnerable pupils, whereas there was no suggestion that moving the single transition point to even younger than under the ordinary two-tier system would be disadvantageous, supports the defendant’s submission that it is well established that reducing the number of transition points is better for pupils with SEND and those with vulnerabilities.</p>

The effect of the decision is that he will remain in a CofE school for two years longer than she had intended and he will not be able to attend a CofE middle school. It also appears that Wadham will be his closest secondary school, and so the effect of the decision is that he will only be able to attend a non-faith school if he chooses a secondary school that is more distance both from his home and his mother’s work. This will make it harder for him to attend a non-religious school for part of his education.</p>

Given that the only other middle school was an academy, even the options identified in the FS Report which sought to retain a hybrid version of the three-tier system involved the proposed closure of Swanmead. No alternative has been identified which would avoid the loss of non-denominational places at Swanmead while addressing the identified problems.</p>

It is not disputed that providing a coherent and efficient system of education, and saving public resources, are legitimate aims. I agree with the defendant that the disadvantage is modest, and particularly felt in Ilminster. In the Crewkerne and Ilminster area, the decision creates a choice between two non-faith primary schools, and increases the overall numbers of secular primary school places. There will be no secular secondary school, but that situation is not brought about by the decision: it is because there is, currently, no non-faith upper school. For those in the area who choose one of the non-faith primary schools, the decision has the beneficial effect that if they wish to continue in a non-faith secondary school, they will transfer at the natural transition point for neighbouring schools.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">There are two aspects to this ground of challenge. First, the claimants rely on the warning in the FS Report that changes would most likely prove non-deliverable without the support of key stakeholders, taken together with the evidence that a high proportion of respondents to the consultations objected to the proposals, and in particular there was overwhelming opposition to the closure of Misterton. In this context, the defendant contends the decision is irrational in both the senses described by the Divisional Court in <span style="font-style:italic">R (Law Society) v Lord Chancellor </span>[2018] EWHC 2094 (Admin), [2019] 1 WLR 1649 (at [98]), that is, it is outside the range of reasonable decisions open to the decision-maker and there is a demonstrable flaw in the reasoning that led to it.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">I have rejected the claim that the consultation was unlawful, so the first premise falls away. I have addressed FS’s warning in paragraphs 189 to 193 above. The evidence (including the confidential annex to the Officer’s Second Report) shows that the defendant paid proper heed to the risk of non-cooperation scuppering implementation of the proposal, but rationally assessed that the risk was low.

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“[I]t became clear once cost/analysis was commenced that this would not be the finely balanced affair that it first appeared. At first glance, the costs of ‘do nothing’ versus ‘re-organise’ are relatively similar, and it involves a lot of detailed work to account for all factors and weigh one against the other over twenty years. However, having started this work with the pre-supposition, it only then because [sic] clear that there was one, very expensive factor that made more detailed work unnecessary. That factor was that there was a longstanding pre-existing planning proposal in Crewkerne (the Key Site) which included a new first school to replace Ashlands. The finances for this build were only ever expected to partly cover the cost, with an expectation that SCC would fund £5 million from borrowing alongside the developer’s contribution. Once it was identified that the new model would mean it would be no longer necessary to take forward a new first school in Crewkerne, the scale of the saving meant that any further, more detailed analysis was never going to outweigh this very significant advantage to the proposed change. I do not believe this was a factor that FfS took into account in their judgement about the complexity of weighing cost and benefit. As it happens, the  detailed financial analysis that was undertaken in establishing the cost of change,  still resulted in an overall saving over 20 years of £7.9 million in total.”</p>
