	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In his oral and written submissions, Mr Matthias QC treated the Plan and Guidance as one, and challenged both.  Mr Jaffey QC interpreted the claim as a challenge to the Guidance.  At my request, Mr Jaffey QC took instructions and explained that the Plan consisted solely of the Mayor’s public statement on 6 May 2020, which was set out in the Guidance. Whilst section 3 in the claim form in CO/2854/20, only identified the Guidance as the decision under challenge, in the Statement of Facts and Grounds, there were repeated references to the challenge to the Plan.  Undoubtedly, the Plan and the Guidance were very closely linked. The Guidance adopted the objectives of the Plan, and its purpose was to provide advice on the implementation of the Plan.  In those circumstances, I consider it is appropriate to consider the lawfulness of both the Plan and the Guidance, whilst bearing in mind the distinctions between them. As the Defendants observed, a key distinction is that only TfL issued the Guidance.   </p>

It is a temporary measure, due to expire by 15 January 2022 at the latest. It imposes extensive restrictions on motor vehicles, other than buses, along the A10 at Bishopsgate and Gracechurch Street in the City of London, from 7 am to 7 pm on weekdays. There are limited exemptions, but not for taxis.  </p>

The policy has always permitted exceptions. The Claimants’ real complaint is that taxis are not being treated in the same manner as buses. But that is a considered decision made for good reason. Taxis have no automatic right to use all bus lanes. Nor should taxis automatically be equated to buses when allocating scarce and highly constrained road space during a pandemic. The great majority of bus lanes remain open to taxis. However, it was necessary to exclude taxis from using Bishopsgate during peak hours as a through route. </p>

The A10 Order is (at most) part of a temporary package of measures controlling the use of a possession – a taxi - on particular streets during peak hours. A temporary emergency restriction on taxis using Bishopsgate as a through route as part of an urgent response to a pandemic is a modest and entirely justifiable interference. The restriction was necessary, because if taxis were permitted to continue to use Bishopsgate as a through route, the objectives of the emergency measures taken in the A10 order would not be achieved. </p>

The first and third of those expectations are vague and fall short of a clear, unambiguous statement. The second is wrong in fact. There have always been a number of bus lanes that are not open to taxis. That number has been reduced in recent years, where compatible with appropriate traffic management. But there is no expectation or right for taxis to use all bus lanes. There has never been any representation or promise to that effect, nor could any such policy be applicable in the context of a novel pandemic emergency. Even if there were such a legitimate expectation, an emergency measure in response to a pandemic is a paradigm example of a case where a public authority would not be bound by a legitimate expectation, for powerful reasons of public interest.  </p>

First, there was an obvious risk of infection from close contact with others in the confined space of a bus or train.  The Government discouraged the use of public transport, as did the Mayor, and TfL reduced its underground train and bus services. Second, there were fewer travellers. People were either no longer working at all; or they were working from home, and no longer commuting.  This resulted in a marked reduction in travellers going into central London.  Very few students were attending school or college. Also, because of the restrictions on non-essential shops and entertainment and hospitality venues, there were fewer leisure travellers at evenings and weekends.  Tourism declined.      </p>

Proposals include increasing the Congestion Charge to £15 and extending its hours of operation to 7am to 10pm, seven days a week, from 22 June.

Approximately 24,000 motor vehicles used the corridor each day, and about 6,000 cyclists.

The model assessment looked at taxi trips arriving and departing the different station taxi ranks in the morning peak periods, and a second assessment reviewed taxi flow in the PM peak. The model indicated the routes that taxis were taking to access and leave the ranks and pinpointed some key destinations. Private hire vehicles were not part of this assessment. </p>

However, as the contemporaneous documents show, extensive modelling was conducted in respect of the Bishopgate corridor for the previous work in December 2019. The modelling indicated that over 40% of traffic on the Bishopsgate corridor was made up of taxis: [SM1/9] [40/1353]. The design team were aware of this work and noted the potential impact of such high numbers of vehicles negatively affecting the outcomes of the project: [SM1/13] [40/1396]. In those circumstances, my view and that of my colleagues was that it was not possible to achieve the aims of the Streetspace Guidance, and the A10 Order specifically, while continuing to allow taxis to use the bus lanes on the Bishopsgate corridor. The contrary views of the taxi trade and TfL’s response to those concerns are set out in the decision documents.” </p>

The design of the scheme carefully balances the need to reduce overall levels of motor traffic on the corridor to allow for the reallocation of space for the purposes set out in this report. However, through the use of bus gates and banned turns the proposal allows access by the taxi and private hire trades and the freight industry to the maximum number of properties on and adjacent to Bishopsgate and Gracechurch Street, in addition to providing access across and around the restricted area. Access to and from Liverpool Street station is maintained in the proposal. The hours of operation of the bus gates are selected both to provide benefits at key times of day and for driver comprehension in aligning with the hours of operation on adjacent City of London-managed streets. Buses are mass transit vehicles and they are the predominant road transport choice for commuters hence why they are being granted access. With overall levels of general traffic on the corridor low, and access maintained to the majority of the corridor for all vehicles who require access, it is expected that reassignment onto alternative routes will be minimal and this will be monitored. </p>

The locations of the bus gates have been considered to maintain as much accessibility as possible.

The All London Knowledge involves learning approximately 25,000 streets and 30,000 landmarks and places of interest within a six-mile radius of Charing Cross plus an overview of suburban areas.

I do not reach this conclusion simply or mainly by reference to the disabled – though there are many people who are disabled, but are not in wheelchairs, and, even on the identification of disabled with wheelchair users and accepting Mr Griffin’s premise set out in paragraph 51(iii) above, there would still be 21% of wheelchair users who may not pre-book. I am certainly not persuaded that the problem for the disabled of hailing a taxi which is not in a lane adjacent to the pavement is “vanishingly small”. In any event, from the point of view of the public generally, I consider it makes entire good sense for black cabs to be travelling in bus lanes.

The distance was about 128 metres, and it was raining.  Mr Peverall had a small suitcase on his knees, he had to overcome hazards on the pavement, such as building works, hoses left across the footway, and a drainage gully running along the centre of the pavement, and he had to cross a side road.  I consider it is unlikely that a frailer or less confident wheelchair user could have undertaken this journey.  TfL observed that he could have been dropped off at the junction with Middlesex Street, which would have been only about 50 metres to his destination.  But, as Mr Massett explained, Mr Peverall was coming from the south (London Bridge), and so it would have taken much longer for his taxi to drive further north, around the bus gate, avoiding various road closures and banned turns, to reach Middlesex Street, and the fare would have been considerably higher.  Mr Massett calculated the difference as 7 minutes 18 seconds, at a cost of £7.60, to Liverpool Street, compared with 20 minutes 26 seconds, at a cost of £15.40, to Middlesex Street.  </p>

It noted that capacity on public transport would remain reduced because of social distancing requirements.  People should be encouraged to cycle and walk instead, and the likely car-based recovery would result in congestion and increased air pollution, and discourage cyclists and pedestrians.  It concluded that, although road traffic levels had been reduced, they were beginning to rise again.   </p>

The other evidence relied upon was  “increasing traffic also being seen in other areas inc. Greater Manchester and Merseyside”;  “China had seen congestion return to 90% of the previous level already” and “recent survey data suggests that people will be less likely to want to use public transport (48% nationally) and that 56% of UK driving licence holders who don’t own a vehicle now considering one”.

Elsewhere it expressed the aspiration that London could “lead the way, working with other likeminded cities to be bold in shaping a new normal defined by more active travel, cleaner air, healthier streets and citizens and action on climate change.”   From the way in which these proposals were described, it appears to me that TfL expected that these changes would become permanent.   </p>

In a supplemental statement, on 15 May 2020, the Mayor announced “plans to transform parts of central London into one of the largest car-free zones in any capital city in the world” with main routes and bridges restricted to all traffic, apart from buses.

The proposals were inconsistent with TfL’s Bus Lane Policy which allowed access to all bus lanes by taxis, unless their “inclusion would cause significant delay to buses or would materially worsen the safety of road users including pedestrians”.   The same exception was formulated slightly differently in the Policy Guidance - “except where specific safety or bus operational issues made this impractical”. In my view, the proposals for bus/cycle corridors plainly went far beyond the limited exception in paragraph 2, which has only been applied for specific space/safety reasons in a small number of locations, on a case by case basis (see Mr Monck’s first witness statement, paragraph 29 and 30).  As the Mayor stated on 26 March 2020, the policy of the Mayor and TfL has been to increase access to bus lanes.  As a result, taxis can now access 95% of bus lanes on the TLRN and 93% of all bus lanes across London (including the Boroughs).

But the duty is also qualified in terms of practicability and other responsibilities of the authority. This means that the duty is placed alongside all the other things that an authority has to consider, and it does not take precedence. So, for example, securing the expeditious movement of vehicles should not be at the expense of an authority’s road safety objectives. But, the statutory duty reflects the importance placed on making best use of existing road space for the benefit of all road users.”   </p>

TfL considered alternative options, such as allowing only taxis and buses along Bishopsgate, but decided in favour of the bus/cycle/pedestrian corridor along Bishopsgate, with some limited access for vehicles, except in the bus gates.  Taxi access to and from Liverpool Street Station was assessed.   The EqIA assessed the impact of the scheme on protected groups, in particular, the difficulties of gaining access to Liverpool Street Station and premises within the bus gates, where vehicle access would be banned.  </p>

The assessment and modelling was focussed on how best to overcome the identified problems of congestion, air quality and road safety.  The position of taxis was only considered in the context of providing access to Bishopsgate and Liverpool Street Station.  However, the status of taxis and policies were drawn to TfL’s attention by the LTDA letter and the letter was considered by officers before TfL made its final decision. Although there is no evidence that they applied their minds to the significance of the Bus Lanes policy, or gave effect to its terms, it was drawn to their attention.

I accept Mr Matthias QC’s submission that the duty should be applied rigorously at the point of formulating policies and guidance of wide application, because they are setting the trajectory for future decision making, and will be important material considerations when future decisions on individual schemes are taken.  As the duty had not been applied before the Plan was announced, I consider that it was all the more important that it was applied before the Guidance was issued. </p>

If this was indeed intended to be a discharge of the public sector equality duty, it fell far short of the detailed and conscientious scrutiny which was required.  It amounted to a mere justification of the decision already taken.  The specific needs of the elderly and disabled which were not capable of being met by public transport or active travel, and were met by taxis instead, were well known to TfL – see the Bus Lanes Policy and TfL’s evidence in the<span style="font-style:italic"> IWU </span>case, at paragraph 136 above.  However, these needs were not assessed in the context of a policy which described “suppressing motorised traffic” including taxis as a key objective.  Prior to issuing the Guidance, there was no investigation or consideration of the adverse impacts that restricting road use by taxis could cause to those with the relevant protected characteristics.  Therefore TfL did not pay due regard to the equality duties in section 149(1) of the 2010 Act.  </p>

It identified the “main risk” was for “people who may require door to door travel arrangements and will not be able to access the two areas that will be restricted to pedestrians, buses and cycles”. It was envisaged that such persons may have to walk “up to 85 and 90 metres respectively to or from premises from the closest point of access at the end of the section”.   It did not address the position of those with protected characteristics who could not walk that distance. Other than pointing out that it was still possible to access the taxi rank in Liverpool Street, and there were alternative shops nearby, neither the mitigation nor the implementation/explanation columns proposed any solution for people in protected groups who were not able to walk from a taxi drop-off point to their destination.  By way of implementation/explanation, it stated that access would become easier for those on foot, cycle or bus.  That may be so, but the adverse impact on the people with protected characteristics ought to have been addressed as well.  The residual risk code was orange. If the position of people who could not walk to their destination had been properly taken into account, then the assessment of residual risk may have been that they would be unable to make the journey at all, meeting the criterion for code red.    </p>

If they are unable to be dropped off close enough then they may not be able to make the trip”. The proposed mitigation was for them to be dropped off in the side street closest to their destination to reduce the overall distance to walk.  Obviously this would not assist those who were incapable of completing the journey on foot.  The implementation/explanation column was simply left blank.  This was an unacceptable omission.  The residual risk code was green, denoting no negative impact, which I found inexplicable as it had concluded that those who could not be dropped off close enough might not be able to make the trip, which was the criterion for code red, the most serious risk.  </p>

Locations, hours of operation and restrictions introduced by the bus gates and banned turns will affect the existing access routes using Bishopsgate corridor”.  There was no mention of the fact that additional cost would probably elevate the cost of journeys above the level of capped subsidy under the Taxicard scheme.  The proposed mitigation was to permit access through bus gates for taxis and private hire vehicles or remove the bus gates. The implementation/explanation rejected the proposed mitigation simply by restating the policy of reducing levels of through traffic and improving conditions for cyclists, pedestrian and bus passengers. There was no rigorous consideration of the equality duty at all.  The residual risk code was orange, but the degree of impact on those with protected characteristics may well have justified a risk code of red, in the absence of any mitigation. </p>

It stated that new layouts can be confusing for those with sensory impairments, neurodegenerative conditions and poor mental health.  They can create confusion, anxiety and inability to travel.  The mitigation proposed was to consider how local groups could be assisted and the implementation/explanation was for TfL to inform stakeholders of the new layouts and offer meetings to explain the changes.  As Mr Matthias QC submitted, these proposals do not suggest that conscientious consideration was given to the disorientating effect for, say, a blind passenger being dropped off 100 metres from their destination, without any ability to find it.

The summaries of the EqIA’s findings in the two “request for decision” reports did not give details of the negative impacts and residual risks that the EqIA had identified, nor did they consider how they might be mitigated or avoided.  The option of better access arrangements for taxis carrying the disabled was not even considered. In my view, the weaknesses in the EqIA were not addressed and remedied by a conscientious and genuine consideration of the equality duties by TfL. The reports read as if the EqIA was merely a formality, and the outcome was a foregone conclusion.</p>

However, I am not persuaded that the third and fourth conditions would be met. In my judgment, the proposals in the Plan and the Guidance to implement “radical changes” and a “lasting transformation” of London streets by suppressing all motorised traffic, except buses, went far beyond what was necessary in response to the pandemic. Particularly since the public’s response to the pandemic has been to stay at home where possible, and the number of people and vehicles in central London have remained below pre-COVID levels. Less intrusive measures could have been used which focussed on the specific problems identified e.g. widening pavements to improve social distancing and increasing road space for cycles, where needed.  On the A10 Bishopsgate corridor, where there is not space for two lanes in each direction, through traffic could have been limited to buses and taxis only, to reduce traffic volume.  The reduction in traffic, in response to the pandemic, called into question the pre-COVID modelling on traffic volumes in 2019.   These trends were already apparent by July 2020 when the A10 Order was made.  Thus, if the taxi drivers were able to demonstrate that they had suffered economic loss in consequence of unnecessary road restrictions, in addition to the loss of custom due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I would conclude that the measures had not struck a fair balance between the rights of taxi drivers and the general interest, and were disproportionate.

	    <p style="margin-left:1.02in;margin-right:1.00in">42. It follows that, unless an authority provides evidence to explain why it has acted in breach of a representation or promise made to an applicant, it is unlikely to be able to establish any overriding public interest to defeat the applicant’s legitimate expectation. Without evidence, the court is unlikely to be willing to draw an inference in favour of the authority. This is no mere technical point. The breach of a representation or promise on which an applicant has relied often, though not necessarily, to his detriment is a serious matter. Fairness, as well as the principle of good administration, demands that it needs to be justified. Often, it is only the authority that knows why it has gone back on its promise. At the very least, the authority will always be better placed than the applicant to give the reasons for its change of position. If it wishes to justify its act by reference to some overriding public interest, it must provide the material on which it relies. In particular, it must give details of the public interest so that the court can decide how to strike the balance of fairness between the interest of the applicant and the overriding interest relied on by the authority. As Schiemann LJ put it in <span style="font-style:italic">R (Bibi) v Newham London Borough Council </span>[2001] EWCA Civ 607, [2002] 1 WLR 237, at para 59, where an authority decides not to give effect to a legitimate expectation, it must “articulate its reasons so that their propriety may be tested by the court”. </p>

The representation is sufficiently clear and unambiguous to found a legitimate expectation. I do not consider that the exception, which enables TfL to exclude taxis from specific bus lanes in limited circumstances, renders the representation unclear or ambiguous and therefore incapable of founding a legitimate representation.  There is a clear policy presumption in favour of granting access.  In practice, taxis can access 95% of all bus lanes on TLRN roads, and the exception has been interpreted strictly, and exercised sparingly.  </p>

In my judgment, the measures proposed in the Plan and the Guidance, and implemented in the A10 order, were extreme, and went beyond what was reasonably required to meet the temporary challenges created by the pandemic.  It was possible to widen pavements to allow for social distancing, and to allocate more road space to cater for an increase in the number of cyclists, without seeking to “transform” parts of central London into predominantly car-free zones.  The stated justification for the restrictions on vehicle access, namely, that after lockdown there would be a major increase in pedestrians and cyclists, and excessive traffic with risks to safety and public health, was not evidence-based.

It must have been apparent to the Mayor and TfL that people were responding to the pandemic by staying at home, especially office workers, and so it was possible that they would continue to do after lockdown, to avoid infection. Central London was deserted during lockdown. Even once the lockdown was relaxed, and the government exhorted people to return to work to boost the city centre economies, people chose to remain at home where possible.  There was no evidence to indicate that the predicted five-fold increase in the number of pedestrians and ten-fold increase in the number of cyclists in central London occurred.    </p>

The Claimants challenged the reliability of the 43% figure, contrasting it with the much lower figures in TfL’s statistics based on ANPR data (e.g. taxis comprising 17.8% of all vehicles in the congestion charging zone from 2 – 6 March 2020, and only 5% of all vehicles across Greater London over the same period).  Mr Low, the Claimants’ expert, criticised TfL for its failure to capture data from other less busy times of the day, and not considering limiting the restriction for taxis to the AM Peak, instead of imposing it for 12 hours per day. Remarkably, TfL continued to justify the A10 Order by reference to the 43% figure without taking into account the drop in the volume of traffic caused by COVID 19.   </p>

See also the adverse impacts identified in the EqIA (paragraphs 189-192 above).  Taxis are a form of public transport.  Travellers may wish to travel by taxi for legitimate reasons. Taxis have been valued by the NHS and vulnerable groups during the pandemic because they are safer than trains, buses and private hire vehicles.  The detriment suffered by taxi drivers and the potential impact on their A1P1 rights, is set out in Ms Proctor’s first witness statement, paragraphs 26 - 30, and Mr Da Costa’s first witness statement at paragraphs 10 - 11.
