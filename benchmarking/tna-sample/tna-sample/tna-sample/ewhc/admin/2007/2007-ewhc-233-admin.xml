His appeal against certification was dismissed by the Special Immigration Appeal Commission (“SIAC”) on 29 October 2003. His case was one of those considered by the House of Lords in <span style="font-style:italic">A and others v Secretary of State for the Home Department</span> [2004] UKHL 56, [2005] 2 AC 68 when it was held that the provisions of the 2001 Act were incompatible with Articles 5 and 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights (“the Convention”). E is one of ten people who had been detained under the 2001 Act in respect of whom control orders were made in March 2005. The orders of eight of the ten were revoked in August 2005 and they are now either detained pending deportation, on bail pending deportation or have left the country.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005 distinguishes between “derogating” and “non-derogating” control orders. The former impose obligations which are incompatible with the right to liberty under Article 5 of the Convention. They may only be made by the Court, and only if the specified conditions are satisfied. One of these is that there is a public emergency in respect of which there is a designated derogation from the whole or a part of Article 5 within section 14 of the Human Rights Act 1998 (the “HRA”). As there is no designated derogation from Article 5 at present there is no power to make a derogating order. Non-derogating orders are made by the Secretary of State with the permission of the court (except in cases of urgency) and are subject to the supervision by the court pursuant to section 3 of the PTA. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This is the third supervisory hearing under section 3 of the PTA but the first full hearing with evidence about the factual issues. The first case, <span style="font-style:italic">MB</span>, dealt only with the compatibility of the court’s jurisdiction under section 3(10) with the right to a fair hearing under Article 6(1) of the Convention. Sullivan J’s decision that it was incompatible with Article 6(1) ([2006] EWHA 1000 (Admin)) was reversed by the Court of Appeal: [2006] EWCA Civ. 1140. The Court of Appeal held that proceedings under the PTA do not amount to the determination of a criminal charge for the purposes of Article 6 and are compatible with the requirements of Article 6 for civil proceedings. The second case, <span style="font-style:italic">JJ and others, </span>dealt only with whether the restrictions in the control orders imposed on the respondents in that case amounted to a deprivation of liberty within Article 5. Sullivan J held ([2006] EWHC 1623 (Admin)) that the restrictions in the orders deprived the respondents of their liberty and quashed the orders. His decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal: [2006] EWCA Civ. 1141. Leave to appeal to the House of Lords has been granted in both cases.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">By the time of the hearing before me E’s control order had been in force for nineteen months. Accordingly, it was both the hearing required by section 3 of the PTA in relation to the order made on 12 March 2005 and the hearing of E’s appeal pursuant to section 10 of the PTA against the renewal of the order. Since section 3(2)(c) of the PTA requires that the substantive hearing at which the court is to supervise a control order is to be “as soon as reasonably practicable after it is made”, some explanation is necessary. Much of the delay is attributable to the fact that on 1 June 2005 E’s and other control order cases were stood out to await the judgment of the House of Lords in <span style="font-style:italic">A and others (No 2) </span>v. <span style="font-style:italic">Secretary of State for the Home Department </span>[2005] UKHL 71, [2006] 2 AC 221<span style="font-style:italic">. </span>That case was concerned with whether, and if so in what circumstances, evidence which had been obtained by torture in a foreign state, could be admitted against a party to proceedings in a United Kingdom court. Pending that decision a number of preliminary matters were dealt with: see [2005] EWHC 1669 (Admin.).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The decision in <span style="font-style:italic">A and others (No 2) </span>was handed down on 8 December 2005. From February 2006 attempts were made to list the cases of E and that of Mr Abu Rideh, now the only other controlled person previously detained under the 2001 Act. Due to problems with the availability of witnesses and counsel, the hearings were not in fact listed until August 2006. They were then fixed for 20 to 24 November in Mr Abu Rideh’s case case, and 27-29 November in E’s case. In October the Applicant unsuccessfully sought to vacate the date. A joint skeleton argument on behalf of both E and Mr Abu Rideh was served on 15 November in which the same issues of law were raised. In the event because some of the notes made by Mr Abu Rideh’s doctors were not disclosed to the Applicant, on the day the hearing in Mr Abu Rideh’s case was due to commence, it was adjourned to 8 January 2007. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The result of this was that E’s hearing took place eleven months after the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">A and others (No 2),</span> and eight months after the renewal of his control order. Such delays to the substantive hearing in control order cases should not be allowed to occur. Apart from the requirement in the PTA that the hearing be “as soon as reasonably practicable after” the order is made, there is also the requirement in Article 6 of the Convention of a fair and public hearing “within a reasonable time”. While the complexity of the factual and legal issues are factors in determining what constitutes a reasonable time, so also is what is “at stake” in such cases and the personal circumstances of those adversely affected by the delay. Control orders and the obligations they impose constitute significant coercive action by the state against individuals. Those individuals are entitled to have the legality of that action tested without delay.</p>

His asylum interview notes refer to his claim as based on membership of ‘Islamic Jihad’ but in his statement in support of his appeal against certification under the 2001 Act E stated this was a translation error and he was referring to the Tunisian Islamic Front (‘FIT’). His claim was refused in January 2001 but he was granted exceptional leave to remain until 2005. He is married to S, who is 32 years old and of Jordanian descent. They have four young children now aged between 7 and 1 year. At the time of the hearing S was 5 months pregnant.</p>

He was sentenced to ten years imprisonment and five years administrative control.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There are three central issues for decision. Logically, the first issue is whether the power conferred by section 1(3) of the PTA, when read together with section 2(9) renders the scheme of the PTA incompatible with the requirement under the Convention for legal certainty so that the interferences with protected rights do not have a basis in law. This was not considered in either <span style="font-style:italic">MB </span>or <span style="font-style:italic">JJ and others </span>and was not the principal ground put forward on behalf of E by Mr Starmer QC<span style="font-style:italic">. </span>His principal ground was that the obligations imposed by the order are so severe that they amount to deprivation of E’s liberty contrary to Article 5. That is the second issue for decision. If, as in the <span style="font-style:italic">JJ cases, </span>the order amounts to a deprivation of liberty, the Secretary of State had no power to make it. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The third issue arises if the order does not amount to a deprivation of liberty. It concerns the exercise by the court of its supervisory and appellate functions under sections 3 and 10 of the PTA. These require the court to consider whether any of the decisions of the Secretary of State in relation to the making and renewing of the control order and its contents are flawed. The decisions in question are that the Secretary of State has reasonable grounds for suspecting that E is or has been involved in terrorist related activity, that it is necessary to make a control order imposing obligations on him, and that the particular obligations imposed on him are necessary. The court is required to apply the principles applicable on an application for judicial review on the broad basis laid down by the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">MB</span>. On behalf of E it is denied that he has engaged in any conduct at any time that would permit the making of a control order. It is also argued that the Secretary of State's continuing decisions to make, and to maintain in force, the control order for this length of time are flawed and should be quashed on the grounds that:-</p>

With regard to Article 3, it is submitted that the control order is having such a significant impact on the mental health of the children that the  threshold required for Article 3 has been met. The joint skeleton argument and Mr Singh QC’s separate skeleton argument on behalf of the families of both E and Mr Abu Rideh also argued that the restrictions on the communications equipment that can be brought into their home violate Article 10. In the event that argument was not pursued in relation to E’s family.

The decisions are thus to be reviewed having regard to the evidence before the court at the time it conducts the review. The reviewing court must consider whether at the time it conducts the review there was any interference with the controlled person’s human rights. The position in relation to appeals under section 10 of the PTA against the renewal of or the refusal to modify a control order was not considered by the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">MB </span>but there is no discernible difference as to the applicable principles at the stage of an appeal.

The first is that he must have reasonable grounds for suspecting that the controlled person is or has been involved in terrorist-related activity, which involves an assessment of fact. The second is that he must consider that it is necessary, for purposes connected with protecting members of the public from a risk of terrorism, to make the order. This requires a value judgment as to what is necessary by way of protection of the public. </p>

It referred to a number of factors to be taken into account: the nature of the suspected involvement in terrorism-related activities, the resources available to the Secretary of State, the demands on those resources, and the arrangements that are in place, or that can be put in place, for surveillance.

It considered that the provisions of the PTA for the use of a special advocate and the rules of court in respect of control order proceedings made pursuant to paragraph 4 of the Schedule to the PTA constitute appropriate safeguards. </p>

Again, CPR Part 35 concerning expert evidence, is not excluded and thus applies. In the present case in August 2006, when the date for the hearing was fixed, there were no directions for a discussion between the medical experts to identify the areas of agreement and disagreement. By October when the case first came before me, neither medical report had been prepared and it appeared that there would be no time for such a discussion or for the operation of rule 35.6 enabling a party to put questions to an expert instructed by another party. Dr Phelan, the Applicant’s psychiatric expert, only saw E on 13 November, very shortly before the hearing.

S claims that the Secretary of State’s control order decisions have interfered with her Convention rights and there is also an issue between her and the Secretary of State which is connected to the matters to be considered in the main control order proceedings. Mr Singh also claimed that the Secretary of State has not complied with the requirements of fairness under common law. I have concluded that where, as in the present case, the claims based on common law are related to and bound up with claims based on the Convention, those claims also fall within the provision in CPR part 19.2. Accordingly, at the outset of the proceeding I gave permission for S to be joined to the main control order proceedings. In these circumstances, it is not appropriate to grant permission to apply for judicial review.</p>

Pursuant to CPR Part 76.30 on 10 March 2005 the Applicant, the Secretary of State, filed and served an Open Control Order Statement setting out the grounds for his decision to make a control order against E and the evidence relied on in support of those grounds. In October 2005 a Second Open Control Order Statement updating the First Open Statement was served. In March 2006 an Open Statement in support of the renewal of the control order was served. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:-0.50in">52.     On 20 September 2006, pursuant to the Rule 76.29 process, an amended and updated version of the First Open Control Order Statement was served. The amendments substantially amplified the case in support of the control order. In particular they included judgments of the County Court of Brussels dated 30 September 2003 and of the Court of Appeal of Brussels, dated 21 February 2005, in cases in which associates of E were successfully prosecuted, and in which there are references to their association with E and to his activities. There were exchanges about disclosure of closed material between the special advocates for E and those acting on behalf of the Secretary of State between July and September 2005, including consideration of whether any material deployed in the Belgian proceedings was public. Following a hearing before Ouseley J on 29 September 2005 the Belgian judgments were requested by a Commission Rogatoire. They were received from Belgium on 25 November 2005. Initially, a translated version was only available of the judgment of the Court of Appeal. A translated version of the first instance judgment was subsequently served on E’s Special Advocates on 16 January 2006. A note agreed by the Special Advocates and the Applicant states that there were then “further discussions between them as to the impact of the judgments on what could be made open (but not as to the disclosability of those judgments)”, and the judgments were put into the open material on 20 September 2006.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:-0.50in">53.      In November 2006 a Third Open Control Order Statement updated the previous statements and, as a result of the process under Rule 76.29, put before the court and E any potentially exculpatory material held by the Security Service. Corrections to the amended First Open Control Order Statement were filed and served on 21 November 2006. Where sections from these Statements are set out in this judgment, updating additions and passages added after the Rule 76.29 process are underlined. The control order Statements setting out the national security case are supported by a Statement dated 17 November 2006 by witness J, a member of the Security Service, who gave evidence at the hearing. </p>

The other evidence on behalf of the Applicant was given by civil servants in the Home Office, and by Dr Michael Phelan, a consultant psychiatrist, whose report on E is dated 16 November 2006. Dr Phelan gave evidence at the hearing. Robert Whalley, the then Director of the Division in the Home Office containing the section dealing with control orders, made a statement dated 8 April 2005. Mr Whalley’s statement deals with the ten control orders made on 11 March 2005 in a generic way and without considering the position of the individuals subject to the orders. Christopher Jones, a grade 6 civil servant at the Home Office made a statement dated 22 November 2006 and gave evidence at the hearing. Since April 2006 he has been leader of the team of civil servants concerned with the implementation of the control order system, and he chairs the quarterly meetings of the Control Order Review Group (“CORG”). A document dated November 2005 is headed “The Secretary of State’s Evidence in Reply to the Appellant’s Evidence”. This document states that in the light of the statement of Mrs Gareth Peirce dated 10 June 2006, about the effect of the control order on E and his family, the Secretary of State reconsidered whether the obligations in the control order were necessary and proportionate and remained of the view that they were. The document is, however, not made by an identified individual, is unsigned, and, although adopted by Mr Jones, is not in itself evidence. </p>

In the case of Mr Abu Rideh the Home Office witness was Catherine Byrne, a Deputy Director and the senior civil servant in the group dealing with control orders, and one of Mr Jones’ superiors.  She was able to give evidence on a number of matters not addressed in Mr Jones’s evidence and to put additional documents before the court. It was agreed by the representatives of all parties in both cases that evidence concerning the process of making control orders in general given by Mr Jones and Miss Byrne could and should be considered in both cases. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:-0.50in">56.     The evidence on behalf of E and S consists of a statement by E dated 18 October 2006; two statements by S dated 18 May 2005 and 18 October 2006, dealing both with the effect of E’s control order on her and their children and its effect on him; four statements by their solicitor Mrs Gareth Peirce dated 10 June 2005, 18 October, 21 November, and 28 November 2006; a statement by another solicitor Ms Madeleine Corr dated 29 November 2006, and medical evidence. The medical evidence consists of three reports, dated respectively 12 March 2001, 4 November 2003 and 24 May 2005 from Dr Stuart Turner a consultant psychiatrist and, until 2003 Director of the Traumatic Stress Clinic, two reports, dated 26 April 2004 and 23 October 2006, from Professor Kopelman, Professor of Neuropsychiatry in the University of London and a consultant neuropsychiatrist at St. Thomas Hospital; and letters from Professor Kopelman dated 30 January, 6 March, 26 June, and 4 September 2006. There is also a report dated 19 October 2006 from Renée Cohen, a psychoanalytic psycho-therapist and independent social worker who considered the impact of the control order on the family and in particular on S and the children. Professor Kopelman gave oral evidence about E. There are also reports, dated 24 May 2004 and 23 October 2006, from Professor Kopelman about S. The Applicant did not seek to cross-examine Professor Kopelman or Ms Cohen in relation to their statements about S and the children. While Professor Kopelman’s oral evidence touched on the position of S and the children, this was primarily in relation to its effect on E.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:-0.50in">57.      On behalf of E, Mr Starmer also relied on a number of other reports. The first is “The psychiatric problems of detainees under the 2001 Anti-Terrorism Crime and Security Act”, published in December 2001 by eight psychiatrists and psychologists who had provided care and assessments for detainees (“the psychiatrists' report”) and the statement issued at the same time by the Royal College of Psychiatrists about detainees’ psychiatric problems.  He also relied on reports on the condition and treatment of those detained under the 2001 Act and the effect of their detention on their mental health by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. These are dated 12 February 2003, 23 July 2004, 9 June 2005, and 10 August 2006. The third source was Lord Carlile of Berriew QC’s first report as the independent reviewer of the PTA made on 2 February 2006.</p>

During the course of the hearing, with the consent of the Secretary of State, a number of statements concerning material in the closed evidence were communicated to E’s legal representatives by his special advocates. These concerned matters such as whether, and if so what, information had been sought about prosecutions in other European countries, and what information had been considered by the Home Office’s Control Order Review Group (“CORG”), which since May 2006 has conducted quarterly reviews of those who are subject to control orders.<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold"> </span> I shall refer to such communications when considering the evidence.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Before turning to the evidence put before the court in support of the decisions to make and to maintain the control order, I make two observations. The first concerns whether the exclusionary rule laid down in <span style="font-style:italic">A &amp; others (No. 2) </span>about evidence which may have been obtained by torture raises issues in this case. The Applicant and E’s Special Advocates have agreed that no such issues are raised by the matters requiring determination in relation to the closed evidence relied on in this case. Secondly, it will be seen from my reasons that I have not relied on decisions of SIAC for evidence of E’s involvement in terrorism-related activity prior to his detention under the 2001 Act. Neither has the Applicant.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Tunisian Fighting Group (“TFG”) was formed in 2000 by Saifallah Ben-Hassine, then based in London. It was an offshoot of the Tunisian Islamic Front (“FIT”). At the time of E’s detention, a London travel card in the name of S Ben-Hassine was found in E’s car. The Security Service believes this to be Saifallah Ben-Hassine. Earlier in this judgment I refer to E’s statement in his appeal against certification under the 2001 Act that the reference in his asylum claim to membership of “Islamic Jihad” was a translation error. He maintained that he was referring to FIT but had exaggerated his involvement with FIT. </p>

However, J also said that the Tunisian authorities considered FIT and the TFG to be terrorist organisations. In the proceedings before me it was not denied that the Tunisian Fighting Group (“TFG”) had links to Al-Qaida and an Algerian terrorist group, the Salafist Group for Call and Combat (“GSPC”).  Paragraph 5 of the amended and updated version of the First Open Control Order Statement states that “<span style="text-decoration:underline">the TFG also aimed to recruit new members and send them to Afghanistan for training</span>”.  </p>

With regard to the former, the assessment was that E was a significant member of the TFG involved in providing funds, false documents and facilities for extreme Islamists. J stated that, most significantly, he was responsible for a key network involved in preparing and moving people from London to training camps in Afghanistan. </p>

His associations prior to his detention were not limited to the TFG and that organisation was not central to the present case against him. He was connected with several attack plans, although he entrusted the Strasbourg Christmas Market attack plan in December 2000 to Essif Ben Khemais (or Sabre) and the Abu Doha networks. In the closed session witness J gave further evidence in support of the assessment by the Security Service that E’s links were not solely with the TFG. J stated that because the Security Service considered that Al-Qaida was a network with many but rather nebulous links, it no longer looked at individuals on the basis of membership of groups but considered them on their own merits. J also relied on Reuters documentation which showed interlocking European cells and references to Ben Khemais with which, it was assessed, E was involved. J stated that the networks with which E was involved were very resilient and could easily be replenished. J stated that this assessment was not only based on E’s links with Ben Khemais but this was not a matter that could be dealt with in an open hearing.

Witness J considered that he would re-engage with them. Before his detention E had excelled in building up a wide range of contacts with extremists. He continued to do this on his release from detention although curtailed by the obligations under the control order. There was no evidence that he would reform, and the Security Service considered that he would extend his activities if released from those obligations.  </p>

The Belgian judgments were obtained and made available as a result of the efforts of E’s Special Advocates. The circumstances are summarised in paragraph 52 above. Translated versions of both judgments were available to the Special Advocates by 16 January 2006 and they were put into the open material on 20 September 2006. It is argued on E’s behalf that the delay in disclosing the material contained in the Belgian judgments has adversely affected his prospects of properly answering the case. No particulars of why this is so are given. It is, moreover, not denied by E that he is the person referred to in the Belgian judgments. In these circumstances and in the absence of any explanation of why the delay has adversely affected E’s prospects of properly answering the case against him, I consider that the position is not materially distinguishable from that in S’s case.</p>

I accept that they provide substantial grounds for believing that E was a senior terrorist recruiter and facilitator, with a wide range of contacts, and was involved in terrorism-related activity as defined in section 1 (9) of the PTA. The court must be satisfied that the Applicant had “reasonable grounds for suspecting” E was involved in terrorism-related activity and, as has often been observed, this test is a low one: see <span style="font-style:italic">O’Hara  v  Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary</span>  [1997] AC 286,298 (Lord Hope);  <span style="font-style:italic">R ( S) (Sexual Abuse Allegations) v Swindon BC and Wiltshire CC </span>[2001] EWCA 334; <span style="font-style:italic">S  v  Home Secretary, </span>SIAC, 27 July 2004, paragraph 41.

The second is E’s willingness and capacity to do so. The third is the extent to which the potential harm can be adequately addressed without a control order. Section 1(4)(d) of the PTA makes it clear that “the public” includes the public outside the United Kingdom. I consider “necessity” here solely in terms of the national security case. The submission that the Applicant’s decision that the control order remains “necessary” is flawed on other grounds, in particular the failure to consider whether E could be prosecuted in the light of the material contained in the Belgian judgments, is considered in paragraphs 107-124 below. </p>

Thus, I have regard to the relative institutional competence of the courts and the executive branch of government. The Secretary of State has the benefit of the advice of the Security Service, the Police and other bodies in assessing the measures necessary to protect the public against the activities of a terrorist suspect. As was stated in <span style="font-style:italic">MB’s </span>case, he is better placed than the court to decide the measures that are necessary to protect the public. I also recognise that the factors to be taken into account in determining the restrictions that it is necessary to impose include the nature of the suspected involvement, the resources available to the Secretary of State, and the arrangements that are, or can be, put in place for surveillance. </p>

I am sceptical about the significance of the fact that E has not assured the Secretary of State or the Court that he intends to refrain from terrorism-related activity in the future. While a carefully worded statement might avoid exposing him to the risk of prosecution, such assurances are likely to be assessed as self-serving.

Reliance is placed on his level of commitment, his seniority, the extensive range of his contacts, and the fact that not all his associates may necessarily always be known to the Security Service. The assessment is that as a senior and significant organiser and facilitator E would be slow to give up his commitment to the cause. </p>

I have had regard, in particular, to evidence about the senior and leadership position E held in the London network, his experience in preparing and moving people to Afghanistan for terrorist training, and providing accommodation, false documents and other assistance to those engaged in terrorism or involved in support networks. The first instance Belgian judgment states that the degree of indoctrination is relevant and that a high level of ideological commitment may render a person highly prone to recidivism: see page 83 of document 4b to Amended and Updated First Open Control Statement. This is consistent with and supports the Applicant’s assessment. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Starmer is undoubtedly correct in submitting that the lapse of time and the effect of detention and the control order on E must be taken into account. But the impact of this factor depends on the evidence. Other than the effect of the lapse of time itself, in the absence of evidence from E, the only evidence in support of the submission that it has reduced the risk posed by E is his mental state. My findings on E’s mental health are set out in paragraphs 179-180 below. In short they are that he has a moderately severe depression and lifting the control order is likely to result in an improvement in his mental health. Accordingly, this factor is, at best, neutral. More importantly, the Applicant’s case that it remains necessary to subject E to a control order is not solely based on the historical evidence. </p>

I have referred to the concern expressed by the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">MB </span>about the use of closed material. The potential for unfairness to the party denied the right to know the details of what is said against him is manifest. Although the Special Advocate system provides undoubted safeguards, and E’s Special Advocates have played a crucial part in this case, it is important for a Court considering closed material to scrutinise it very carefully, to examine its weaknesses and gaps, and to distinguish evidence based assessments from those based on speculation. I have done so and, while I in part accept the submission of E’s Special Advocates that some of the closed material does not in fact assist the Applicant, I have concluded that, discounting that, the remainder of the closed material does support the Applicant’s assessment. </p>

Nor was J cross-examined as to the necessity of any of the individual obligations. The implications of this are considered in paragraphs 296-297 below. However, underlying some of Mr Starmer’s questions and submissions was the idea that the monitoring of E by the Security Service could address any risk without the need for a control order. The implication was that since the Security Service takes a close interest in E, any re-engagement by him in terrorism-related activity would be quickly detected because either he or those with whom he was associating would be monitored.  </p>

Moreover, such an approach does not take account of the resource implications of a number of forms of monitoring, in particular surveillance. The argument that it is proper for the Secretary of State to conclude that someone assessed to be a risk should be subjected to a control order simply because the level of risk he poses does not justify the resources that would afford a high level of monitoring is one which should be treated with great caution<span style="font-style:italic">.</span> But the resource implications and the demands on those resources are, as the Court of Appeal recognised in <span style="font-style:italic">MB’s </span>case<span style="font-style:italic">, </span>relevant considerations in the assessment of whether a particular obligation is necessary. The justifications for the particular restrictions placed on E (see paragraphs 125-128 below) recognise that they cannot entirely prevent him from engaging in terrorism-related activities, or seeing people who are of security concern, but state that they reduce his ability to do so without detection. It is not legitimate to argue that because, for example, a 12 hour curfew leaves sufficient time outside the home to permit terrorism-related activity, the Secretary of State’s assessment that the obligations are necessary is, for this reason, flawed.</p>

The procedure for the making and renewing of control orders, including the procedure for consulting the Police, has been in place since the inception of the regime. In paragraph 10 of his statement Mr Jones says, that when considering what obligations should be imposed upon an individual, the Secretary of State must balance the need to protect members of the public from a risk of terrorism with the need to ensure that the rights of the individual concerned are not breached.

He is always willing to take into account any representations that are made, as well as any reports or other materials that are submitted. So, for example, while he would not usually consider it appropriate to interview family members, or to make enquiries of the family’s medical practitioner, or the children’s schools, he would, of course consider any information supplied by them. In particular, he is conscious of the fact that the Control Order will have an impact on the family of the Controlled Person, and is always willing to give careful consideration to any proposals that the Control Order should be varied, so as to minimise the effects on them, so far as is consistent with the purpose of the Control Order.”</span>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Jones was asked whether, on the introduction of the control order regime, those individuals who had been detained under the 2001 Act were subjected to what were described as “template” obligations. He stated that as a result of looking at the documents and talking to colleagues he believed that the obligations were tailored to the individual. Since the hearing the court has been provided with copies of the control orders made in March 2005 in respect of those who had been detained under the 2001 Act. Not surprisingly, a common framework is used in all. This led to the sending out of letters citing an identical basis for all the decisions. Mr Whalley explained in his statement this was due to a clerical error and was corrected shortly afterwards. As far as the obligations are concerned, the basic model is also the same for each control order. All impose a twelve-hour curfew period and all contain the same requirements for a tag and the prior approval of visitors to the residence. The obligations are not, however, identical. Apart from the obvious difference in the addresses at which the controlled persons were required to live, the spouses and children of married controlled persons were authorised to enter the specified address, and, where there were children, so could any person of or below the age of the oldest child. Only three of the controlled persons were prohibited from buying and selling computers and communications equipment.    In all but one case there was an identical exemption from the prohibition on unauthorised prearranged meetings for prayers at mosques. In that case there was an exemption for prayers at mosques but the controlled person was prohibited from leading prayers. </p>

In none of the cases was there identifiable material that was capable of further criminal investigation; where there was anything potentially admissible, it had already been considered and rejected or had been the subject of a criminal prosecution.

It is clear that its purpose was to assist the Police with their reply to the Home Office. After this letter was made available during the hearing, Birnberg Peirce wrote asking how its contents could be reconciled with the CPS’s letter dated 21 November 2006 referred to in paragraph 108 above. In her fourth witness statement, Mrs Peirce states that Miss Hemming telephoned her on 27 November and stated that the visit to Thames House described in the letter dated 19 January 2005 was made by her and that it was a “one-off” visit for the purpose of viewing documents in the possession of Thames House that concerned those then detained under the 2001 Act. Mrs Peirce states that Miss Hemming said that, beyond that visit, no official file was created in respect of the individuals concerned, and that that visit represented the only occasion on which the CPS was asked to consider the individual cases. This was why nothing showed up in the CPS records and why her letter of 21 November was in those terms. Had there been any other consideration, it would have shown up in the CPS records. </p>

An open note on the closed evidence concerning requests to the French and Italian authorities to obtain judgments or transcripts of relevant proceedings in those countries states that as to France there were no statements, judgments or transcripts in the public domain in line with normal procedures in France. The possibility of obtaining these by a Commission Rogatoire was raised, but was not pursued by the Special Advocates.  As to proceedings in Italy, the only information provided to the Special Advocates in relation to potential criminal proceedings against Saber was that he had been arrested for fraud and immigration offences (with no indication that these extended to any terrorist-related offences). </p>

J stated that when the Security Service investigated a target it sought to get as much information as possible and was not considering the question of prosecution. When material came up which looked as if it showed that an offence might have been committed the Security Service would consult the Police. What would then happen would depend on the nature of the information. J stated that the Security Service would regard this exercise as of assistance rather than a necessary irritation; successful prosecution and imprisonment would reduce the threat to national security by an individual.

This was confirmed during Miss Byrne’s evidence in Mr Abu Rideh’s case when the letter dated 22 September 2004 from a member of DAC Clarke’s staff to the Home Office was produced. The letter was a reply to an enquiry from the Home Office in May 2004.

In the section of the minutes of the meeting of 10 May 2006 dealing with E’s case there is a section headed “Police assessment”. In the section dealing with the consideration of his case in the minutes of the meeting of 16 August 2006 there is a section headed “Police assessment of compliance with order”. The available minutes “do not state, either in the sections referring to “Police assessment” or elsewhere, that there was any consideration of the prospects of prosecution of E in relation to terrorism-related offences.” Mr Jones was asked whether anyone had mentioned Belgian proceedings and whether they affected the prospect of prosecution, but he stated that the review only considered activity in the particular quarter and not the whole case. He said that at the May 2006 meeting he, from the chair, asked if there was a prospect of prosecution and the Police said there was not. It was for the Police to respond and to raise matters updating the position at the meeting. Updating evidence about prosecution for the underlying offences is also brought to the meeting by the Security Service.

J did not know whether there had been a review of the possibility of prosecuting E since March 2005 but assumed it had been done.

If the Police wished to copy material to the CPS they would need to get the permission of the Security Service. Asked whether that decision was recorded, J said it would depend on the process in which agreement to share information was made. In the Control Order cases the decision to share was made at meetings attended by the Home Secretary, the Deputy Assistant Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police and the Security Service’s Head of International  Counter-Terrorism and that minutes would be taken of such meetings.  The meeting in March 2005 was such a meeting. J was not aware of any request by the Police after March 2005 for further documents, evidence or intelligence either in general or in E’s case. J had not seen documentation indicating there had been a Police decision about prosecution after March 2005 and did not believe there had been one.</p>

The Secretary of State is under a duty to consider the necessity of the order and of the individual obligations in it. I accept that this must include a duty to consider whether any of the obligations can be relaxed in the light of the current circumstances, including the passage of time since the individual under consideration was first subject to detention and control. This issue will be considered in the context of determining whether the decision to maintain all the restrictions at the present time is proportionate to the interference with the rights of E and his family under Article 8 of the Convention: see paragraphs 294-297 below. It is relevant to note here that witness J and Mr Jones were not cross-examined as to the necessity of any of the individual obligations. Accordingly, the evidential basis is fragile for me to conclude that the Secretary of State’s continuing decision that all the obligations remain necessary is flawed. </p>

E and S state that they asked for her husband’s hours to be extended during Ramadan so that he could go to evening prayers and that they were told he would have to change his hours from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. which would mean he would no longer be in a position to take the children to school. S states that, as she has a ten-month old baby to look after and is four months pregnant, it is not possible for her to take the children to school so her husband did not change his hours and is unable to go to the evening prayers. They also state that E was unable to go to their eldest son’s school during Ramadan for the Ifta, which meant that the son could not go either.  E stated that the curfew obligations prevent him from going on holidays or taking day trips because he worries about the traffic and being back by 7p.m, and that they prevent him from taking his children to evening activities such as swimming, and going to parents’ evenings. Mr Jones said that E made no applications about any of these matters. The 12 hour curfew did not prevent E making day trips with his children. No application has been received from E requesting a variation to allow him to take a holiday within the country although Mr Jones stated that it was highly unlikely that an application to be away from the residence for any extended period would be granted if its purpose was simply to take a holiday. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In relation to what E and S say about the position during Ramadan, Mr Jones said that while other controlled persons had their morning curfew hours put back to compensate for the extension to the evening period  E appeared to have had particularly strong grounds for needing to take his children to school. As, however, E did not raise the possibility of being enabled both to attend evening prayers and to take his children to school with the Home Office, he is not entitled to assume that such a request would have been refused. Mr Jones said one request from another Controlled Person to enable him to both take his children to school in the morning and to attend evening prayers was granted after having been initially refused. Similarly, with regard to E's statement (paragraph 12) that he has not been able to sort out problems with his rent and housing benefit  because he was unable to make an appointment with the relevant officials and had to do so via his sister-in-law and his solicitors, Mr Jones stated that applications for meetings concerning such matters have been granted in other cases but no application was made by E. I have referred to the fact that, although Professor Kopelman said that he saw E seven times between January and November 2006, Mr Jones’s evidence that other than an application to attend hospital appointments with specialist doctors about his kidney condition, the Home Office received no applications for E to attend pre-arranged meetings, was not challenged. </p>

Mr Jones stated that the Home Secretary does not understand it to be the case that E has ever been in regular paid employment in the United Kingdom. During the period between his arrival in 1994 and his detention in December 2001, he lived, as he does now, on benefits. He stated that there are cases in which a person subject to a Control Order is in employment and that the Home Office generally wishes to keep a person in employment unless the nature of that employment is a risk.

The first example is not a serious inconsistency. E stated that he asked for the curfew boundary to be extended to his garden during the summer so he could play with his children after 7 p.m., but the Home Office only responded in September when the summer nights were beginning to close in.  Mr Jones stated the Home Office agreed to this request on 22 August. Secondly, in her statement dated 18 October 2006 S stated that when her mother came from Jordan she had to stay with someone else until she was cleared but Mr Jones’s evidence differs. He stated that approval was granted on the second day after the request was made and the letter from E’s solicitors dated 5 October 2005 indicated that Mrs S’s mother was due to arrive on 15 October so that the Home Office in fact approved her visit 8 days before her arrival.</p>

Her second statement refers to having to leave social engagements to get home by 7pm because she would not wish to stay without her husband, and to an inability to attend weddings and parties as a family because E is not allowed to attend gatherings. She says that whenever they make requests about the restrictions they take so long to answer. They are unable to make a spontaneous decision about anything. She also refers to the fact that when she had her youngest child, although E was cleared to come to the hospital to be with her, he had to call the Police and the monitoring service to let them know because her contractions started in the middle of the night. She called her sister-in-law to go with her while he made the calls. </p>

They were unable to go camping with some family friends in the summer because her husband could not be away from the home in the evening.

Her May 2005 statement states that he did not speak a word for 6 months after his father was imprisoned, that one of the monitoring boxes is in his room, and that at first they had many night-time calls about the tagging equipment which woke him and disturbed his sleep. I wanted to sleep in their room and not to be alone. S does not say that I was wetting his bed at that stage. In her 18 October 2006 statement S says that I still wets his bed although not as frequently as when the control order was first introduced, that he needs somebody with him when he is in his bedroom, and cannot sleep in the bed next to the window in his room. He needs her or her husband to take him to the toilet because he is scared and hates the monitoring boxes which he believes have cameras in them. It is, however, to be noted that Professor Kopelman reports that on 16 October 2006 S told him that I no longer wets the bed.</p>

That, and living without the telephone and with no communication to the outside world, was like living in a nightmare. E describes BT turning up to deal with the matter without an appointment, he not being able to admit them because they were not cleared, and BT putting the job to the back of its queue so they had to wait for two and a half weeks.  Gareth Peirce’s statements also deal with the impact of the control order on S and the children. Her statement of 10 June 2005 states that the most significant difficulties for S arise because the order, and in particular the requirement that visitors to the house must be authorised, restricts her ability to obtain support from friends and family, because they are unwilling to go through the vetting process.</p>

She interviewed S for an hour and a half at the house on 17 October 2006 with E acting as interpreter. S left most of the talking to E who was careful to interpret everything Ms Cohen asked although S did not always answer for herself and appeared very dependent on her husband. The children were present but Ms Cohen said it was not easy to engage with them because they do not speak English and initially were playing with their toys. She was able to ask I, who understands English, a few questions and E translated I’s answers. Ms Cohen later spoke to E’s sister-in-law to clarify and expand on a few points that were not clear to her. </p>

Although S can visit friends, she does not go out alone at all and depends on her husband to take her which means she is not able to attend any function or gathering in the evening, including parents’ evenings at the school which are held at about 6.30 pm. She told Ms Cohen that the only people cleared to visit them at the time of the interview were E’s brother and sister and their families. I note that it was Mr Jones’s evidence, that more than one brother, and in March 2005 ABR a friend of S’s was approved. S told Ms Cohen she feels like a prisoner, that it is embarrassing that they cannot invite a neighbour in if one comes to the door, and that the family have to put up with regular visits from the Police which are disruptive and intrusive. The family is not able to carry on normal activities of daily living and this is very hard to bear in the light of the indefinite nature of the situation. </p>

Routine requests, for example to attend a hospital appointment would be dealt with by the controlled person’s case-worker. Other requests would be referred to him and he would decide whether to deal with them or, in the light of the risks raised or the implications on the rights of the individual, in relation to the practice of his religion, for example, to refer them to senior colleagues or Ministers. The Police and Security Service would be consulted about all requests and there were colleagues in the Home Office with expertise on religious questions. The requests to extend the curfew to enable controlled persons to attend the sunset prayers in the summer of 2005 were referred to the then Director, Mr Whalley. The requests to vary curfews to enable mosque attendance during Ramadan were dealt with without consulting Ministers.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Jones said delays occurred in the early days of the control order regime either because the regime was introduced quite quickly and the section in the Home Office had a lot of work to do to implement it, or because requests threw up new policy issues which needed careful consideration and took more time. He said it took a month to respond to a request to vary the curfew to enable E and other controlled persons to attend the evening prayers at sunset in the summer of 2005 because the request raised new policy issues. The workload of the section was the reason for the almost two months from a request for the approval of certain of E’s family members as visitors on 18 March 2005 and its approval on 13 May, although interim approval for E’s brother had been given on 22 April. Mr Jones said the delay was regrettable but examination of the full file over the whole period showed that the position had improved. An application made on 22 March 2006 on behalf of S to allow a close friend to visit was granted on 31 March 2006. He stated that letters dated 14 and 21 November 2005 from E’s solicitors and those dated 15 and 25 November from the Home Office show that a variation to enable E to accompany his wife to hospital when she went into labour was approved within 4 days of the provision of medical evidence of S’s due date.</p>

The seven weeks it took to sort out complaints first made on 23 June 2005<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>about calls from salesmen, and calls believed to be nuisance calls on the line installed in E’s residence by the monitoring company and dedicated to monitoring purposes, resulted from this.<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>The Home Office responded to E’s complaint on 4 July 2005, and on 1 August 2005 to a letter dated 27 July 2005 stating that the problems were continuing. Asked about the eight weeks taken to deal with E’s request on<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>22 June 2006<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>that he be permitted to be in his garden after 7pm, Mr Jones said this potentially gave rise to significant security and practical considerations which required investigation. The Home Office had to consult the Police, the Security Service and the monitoring company. The Police had to check to see that others could not have access to the garden, and the monitoring company had to check that the tag would work in the garden. It was put to Mr Jones that the Home Office’s agreement to this request on 22 August 2006 came a few days after a Notice of Appeal dated 17 August had been served in respect of the failure to deal with it. He said that it was a coincidence that the request was dealt with 5 days later. August was particularly busy time for the Police and the Home Office with a significant number of arrests as a result of the airport alerts and everyone in his section was very busy.</p>

The restrictions in the control order have had a substantial impact on the social networks of E and his family because of the inhibiting or “chilling” effect of the requirement that visitors must be authorised, and to be authorised may have to provide the Home Office with their details. </p>

Although there is evidence that E saw Professor Kopelman seven times in 2006, only one request to attend a prearranged meeting has been made on his behalf. This concerned a medical appointment about a kidney complaint. It was granted without delay. The requirement that prearranged meetings must be authorised does inhibit accepting invitations at short notice and making social arrangements in this way, and is in this sense an inhibition on the sort of social activity that is a common part of life. But the position of events generally arranged in advance is different. If applications to attend, for example, weddings and parties or meetings with health and welfare agencies are not refused or unduly delayed, the requirement for authorisation will not have a detrimental effect on social networks and more general activity. On the evidence before me it is not possible to conclude that this requirement has in itself significantly impacted on E. Some of any impact that there has been is due to his decision not to apply to attend, for example, weddings and parents’ evenings at his childrens’ school. </p>

No request was made by E to the Home Office to enable him, in the light of his particular family circumstances, to vary his curfew during Ramadan to enable him both to attend evening prayers and to take his children to school in the morning. In the light of Mr Jones’s evidence, it is likely that such an application would have been successful.</p>

The impact of the restrictions on S is in part due to this and to understandable cultural factors in that she does not wish to attend peoples’ houses without E, an unannounced visit is culturally rude, and E needs authority for a prearranged visit. She does, however, sometimes visit other family members alone. </p>

Although the evidence as to the impact on I is not altogether consistent, and the evidence as to future impact on him and the other children is, as Mr Singh QC recognised, somewhat speculative, I find that the atmosphere in the house and the Police searches have affected I and the younger children. I also accept Renée Cohen’s evidence that the long-term impact on the children is likely to be significant and detrimental and damaging to their mental health although I note that her assessment in part depends on what E and S told her.</p>

The Home Office does not have an altogether accurate picture of the situation at E’s flat because it has relied on reports of its monitoring company. This is likely to affect its consideration of requests by or on behalf of E and his family. For instance, the erroneous belief that there was no monitoring box in I’s bedroom was used to counter the suggestion that I was greatly concerned by it and would not sleep in the room at one stage. </p>

While there have undoubtedly been some delays by the Home Office in responding to requests, I have concluded that, after teething difficulties with the new regime in part caused by the pressure on staff in the relevant section, the Home Office has on the whole responded without undue delay to requests for variations to the control order by E and his family. Since the initial period, where there has been delay, it has either been because the request raises a new policy issue or because of the need to consult other agencies. The impact of the restrictions on E and the family has, however, been affected by the delays which occurred.</p>

It is common ground that E continues to suffer from depression. There is, however, disagreement between Professor Kopelman and Dr Phelan as to its severity and whether E has symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (“PTSD”). Professor Kopelman considers E to be “severely depressed” and to show some residual symptoms of PTSD, which he had diagnosed in 2004 after seeing E in Belmarsh Prison. He also considers there is a causal connection between E’s health difficulties and the control order obligations, and that E’s health would improve if the order was lifted. Dr Phelan considers that E is suffering from a moderately severe depressive illness but, if wrong about this, it would be because the depression is a mild one rather than a moderate one. He stated it was certainly not severe. As to PTSD, Dr Phelan’s view is that while E described certain symptoms suggestive of PTSD, the symptoms suggestive of that disorder did not reach the diagnostic criteria. As to the connection between the control order and E’s mental health, Dr Phelan said he did not believe it could be assumed that lifting his control order restrictions would necessarily result in an improvement in his health. This was because although E had told him he would be 100% better if the control order was lifted, E also told him that he had got worse since leaving Belmarsh and that he saw no future for himself in the United Kingdom and was trapped because he was unable to go back to Tunisia. </p>

There are no reports by psychiatrists or psychologists dated 2005 about E, S or the children. Professor Kopelman’s second report is dated 23 October 2006 and was prepared for these proceedings. Professor Kopelman concluded that E remains severely depressed despite treatment with mirtazapine, an anti-depressant. His mood is persistently sad and he experiences biological symptoms of poor sleep and appetite, has difficulty concentrating and making decisions, and easily becomes agitated. The report states that E scored very highly on the Beck Depression Scale indicating severe depression. Professor Kopelman states that E has suicidal ideas but would not carry them out because of his religious beliefs.

He noted that E had not co-operated with Dr. Phelan and wanted to terminate the interview so that Dr. Phelan was unable to clarify how frequent or intense the memories were. He said that E was a difficult patient and it had taken a long time for E to trust him. He considered that while the depression was now more important he still had residual PTSD but might not be that far apart from Dr. Phelan.

He was asked about the report by eight psychiatrists, including himself about the effect on the mental health of those detained under the 2001 Act which was published at the same time as a statement by the Royal College of Psychiatry. The report states that, while the psychotic symptoms of one detainee released on stringent conditions of house arrest receded on release, the underlying depressive features are more slow to respond, that there is a strong consensus that indefinite detention <span style="font-style:italic">per se </span>is directly linked to deterioration in mental health, and that concern with regard to their wives’ mental state exacerbates the mental health problems of many detainees. The report refers to one of the wives showing a phobic anxiety state and Professor Kopelman stated this was S. The report referred to literature showing that the depression of detainees gets worse and their symptoms change over time. The statement by the Royal College of Psychiatry endorsed the report’s findings, stating that “on balance the evidence does point to the particular circumstances of this group’s detention contributing significantly to their mental health problems”. It rejected the suggestion that the provision of psychiatric treatment by highly qualified practitioners can in itself prevent a decline in the detainees’ mental health that may come about as a result of their detention.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Asked about Dr. Phelan’s diagnosis of a “moderately severe depressive illness”, Professor Kopelman said that he considered E’s depression severe because of the factors to which he referred, the evolution of the symptoms and the very high Beck score. He stated that difference between Dr Phelan and himself might not be great because Dr. Phelan described many of the symptoms identified by him. In cross-examination he said he had looked at the ICD criteria for the court hearing and considered that E conformed to them. His view was not altered by Dr. Phelan’s report. Dr. Phelan had seen E once for one and a half hours. His first interview and assessment had taken three hours. He agreed that the criteria were not hard and fast and that some might say the depression was moderate while others that it was severe. Professor Kopelman saw the case not in terms of criteria but in the light of the context of E being a person who had been held under detention and was now subject to restriction orders. He also agreed that in layman’s terms the difference between a moderate and severe depression was a matter of degree, but the Beck scale was used all over the world and the ICD criteria distinguished the two. He stated that in severe depression the person would be unmotivated, would not play with his children, would give up activities and would have long-term sleep disturbance. He would not expect a person with a severe depression to organise covert activities. A person with moderate depression might be incapacitated in his ordinary activities and unmotivated and would show some biological effects such as in relation to appetite and sleep.</p>

Professor Kopelman said that he was not surprised, given the restrictions of the control order, that there was no dramatic improvement on release beyond the benefit of being able to see his family. The re-detention of ten others in August 2005 played into E’s fears and led him to become very anxious. Professor Kopelman said the fact that E felt trapped by his control order (as he had said to Dr Phelan) was an important factor in his depression. Professor Kopelman said that E had not wanted to leave until recently and he now wanted to leave because of the control order. </p>

Although the British National Formulatory (the “BNF”) stated that 15mg was the starting point, a number of psychiatrists did what he did. He said the dose could be helpful in relation to sleep, which was important in addressing depression. He reduced E’s dose because E had said that the medication was making him drowsy. He thought that E would not tolerate the medication and so reduced it with the idea of then increasing it very cautiously. He did not consider changing the medication because E does not tolerate medication well and his idea was to gradually increase the dose rather than to chop and change. He thought that at present E was taking 7.5mg one day and 15mg on the next day. Professor Kopelman agreed that he reduced the dose on 26 June 2006 and arranged to see E again in early September. It was also put to him that he reduced the dose after the arrests of other people in 2005 that Professor Kopelman stated had led to deterioration in E’s condition but he considered that did not affect the issue. </p>

Dr Phelan considered these were consistent with a lesser degree of depression. In cross-examination, Dr. Phelan agreed that there was evidence that E found some activities difficult.

He agreed that E’s perception that the attitude of the authorities to him had not changed, and the effect of the control order on his wife and children were relevant factors in considering his health. He also said that although these factors were all relevant, they were not determinative.

Secondly, there was no comparison made between the mental health of those in detention and those not in detention. While it might be a fair assumption that the mental health of those in detention would be worse, the paper did not make a scientific case for this.

Professor Kopelman considered that S showed “features of quite severe clinical depression” and “features of a phobic anxiety state” but made no diagnosis and did not recommend treatment. He stated the symptoms were directly related to E’s continuing detention. In his second report, based on a consultation on 16 October 2006 and dated 23 October 2006, Professor Kopelman states that S is less depressed than when he saw her in 2004 but has considerable anxieties that E or herself will suddenly be arrested and these keep her awake at night. Her score on the Beck scale indicated “at most a mild or moderate degree of depression”. With regard to the children, Professor Kopelman states S told him that I will not change his clothes in his room because of the monitor and still insists on sleeping in the parental bed but no longer wets the bed. Professor Kopelman noted that I in particular has shown behavioural disturbances and the children, including I, will not sleep outside the parental bedrooms and concludes that the long-term effects of these restrictions upon the children’s psychological well-being and attitudes are likely to be devastating. </p>

It is not disputed that E suffers from depression but Professor Kopelman’s diagnosis is that E is severely depressed whereas Dr Phelan’s diagnosis is of a moderately severe depressive illness.

He reduced the dose after the arrests of others in 2005 which he stated had led to a deterioration in E’s condition, because E had said that the medication was making him drowsy. Professor Kopelman said that a lot of psychiatrists do what he did. There was, however, no other evidence before me in support of this and Dr Phelan said that he had never come across a patient with severe depression or indeed any patient treated with this dose.

In particular Professor Kopelman states E takes his children to school and picks them up because his wife would not do so and so he has to. This may be so, and Dr Phelan accepted that E described difficulties in functioning and dealing with matters. But E does undertake some other activities, and does not altogether lack a social network. Apart from taking his children to school and picking them up, he goes to the mosque, goes shopping, does some cooking, watches TV, and sees family members who live in the area, and others at and around the mosque.  With the exception of attending the mosque which is a matter of religious obligation, it cannot be said that these are activities he has to do. Professor Kopelman did not comment on the other activities, and I accept Dr Phelan’s assessment that the fact E undertakes them is consistent with his depression being moderate rather than severe. </span>

I do not accept the Applicant’s submission that I should conclude that E is unreliable because of his denial to Dr Phelan that the TFG existed and that he was a member of that organization, or because of his account to Dr Turner in 2001. It is clear that E was suspicious of and hostile to Dr Phelan. Although evidence of his membership of the TFG and his role as the London head of a terrorist network, is relevant to determining whether the Secretary of State’s suspicion of E’s involvement in terrorism-related activities is reasonable, it does in itself not suffice to enable me to conclude that his account to the psychiatrists is entirely incredible. On the other hand, E’s continued assertion to Professor Kopelman that he did not know what the allegations against him were and that he was unable to respond to them even after the Applicant had served evidence (principally the Belgian judgments) identifying specific individuals with whom he is said to have engaged in terrorism-related activities, and the specific activities described in paragraphs 65-72 above, shows that the information he provided to psychiatrists instructed on his behalf was not accurate. </span>

As far as PTSD is concerned, Professor Kopelman accepted in cross-examination that whereas E definitely satisfied the diagnostic criteria when in Belmarsh Prison he  “may be a little below the cut-off point now”. Accordingly, there is no significant difference between his view and Dr Phelan’s view that while E has symptoms suggestive of PTSD they do not reach the diagnostic criteria. </span>

	    <p class="Footer" style="margin-left:0.75in">
	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">3. Of more significance is the difference on causation. Dr Phelan considers that it cannot be assumed that lifting E’s control order restrictions would necessarily result in an improvement in his health. This is because E told him that he had got worse since leaving Belmarsh and saw no future for himself in this country but was trapped because he could not return to Tunisia.  Professor Kopelman considers that E’s health will improve if the control order is lifted. On this issue, whilst either view is necessarily speculative, I find that Professor Kopelman’s evidence is more convincing and that the lifting of the order, or a significant relaxation of its restrictions, would be likely to result in an improvement in E’s mental health. Dr Phelan accepted that it was surprising to find no causal connection in relation to E’s depression but relied on what was said to him. In relation to this, however, I take into account E’s suspicion and hostility to Dr Phelan. Professor Kopelman stated that the control order is the reason E wants to leave this country and says he is trapped. Professor Kopelman’s conclusion is consistent with the report (to which he was a signatory) about the effect of indeterminate detention under the 2001 Act on the mental health of those detained. I do not accept the qualified criticism Dr Phelan made of the report of the experts. The fact that it was in substance endorsed by the Royal College of Psychiatrists suggests that the absence of a statement that a systematic review of the literature had been conducted was immaterial and I have since heard evidence from the report’s principal author, Professor Robbins, in Mr </span>

The circumstances in which a control order can be imposed are vague and unforeseeable because of the breadth of the definitions in sections 1(9) and 15(1) of “terrorism-related activity” and “terrorist”, the latter which is given the same broad meaning as in the Terrorism Act 2000. The second limb is that the obligations that may be imposed pursuant to section 1(3) are, on their face, unlimited, and include not only obligations for the purpose of<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>preventing terrorism-related activity<span style="font-style:italic">, </span>but also obligations for purposes connected with terrorism-related activity.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">With regard to the inadequacy of legal safeguards, it is argued that, read literally, section 2(9) permits an obligation to be imposed to prevent or restrict terrorism-related activity in respect of which the Secretary of State does not even have reasonable grounds for suspicion. This is because the sub-section provides that “[i]t shall be immaterial, for the purposes of determining what obligations may be imposed by a control order …, whether the involvement in terrorism-related activity to be prevented or restricted by the obligations is connected with matters to which the Secretary of State’s grounds for suspicion relate”. Paragraph 8 of the Schedule to the PTA provides that a decision by the court to quash a control order “does not prevent the Secretary of State from exercising any power of his to make a new control order to the same or similar effect or from relying, in whole or in part, on the same matters for the purpose of making that new order”. It is argued that this enables the Secretary of State to ignore a decision of the court, and thus displaces the ordinary role of the courts.</p>

The need to avoid excessive rigidity and to keep pace with changing circumstances means that many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague. However clearly drafted a legal provision may be, its application in practice involves an inevitable element of judicial interpretation and assessment of facts, which do not by itself make a legal provision unforeseeable in its application. On many occasions and in very different spheres the Court has held that it is in the first place for the national authorities, and in particular the courts, to construe and apply the domestic law (see, for example, Winterwerp v the Netherlands [24 October 1979] and AUI v Spain, [application 56673/00]; and Slivenko v Latvia [application 48321/99].”</span>

As the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">JJ and others </span>[2006] EWCA Civ. 1141 shows, the Secretary of State has no power to impose conditions which deprive a person of his liberty in the sense that that term is used in Article 5 of the Convention. Moreover, the power conferred by section 1(3) only confers power to impose such obligations as the Secretary of State or Court “considers necessary for purposes connected with preventing or restricting involvement by that individual in terrorism-related activity”. The exercise of such power is susceptible to control by the court in accordance with the principles of judicial review as they apply in this context.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in"> As to control by the court, it is not arguable that the legal safeguards against abuse have been removed by the PTA.  Section 3(11) provides that the court must apply the principles applicable on an application for judicial review, and the decision of the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">MB </span>[2006] EWCA Civ. 1140 has clarified what that means in this context. The Court stated that in considering whether it is necessary to impose any particular obligation on an individual the court will apply the customary test of proportionality. Notwithstanding a degree of deference to the decisions taken by the Secretary of State in a matter relating to state security, the court is required to give intense scrutiny to the necessity for each of the obligations imposed on an individual under a control order: see [63-65] and see also [44]. There is no such deference in relation to whether the Secretary of State has reasonable grounds for suspecting that a person is or has been involved in terrorism-related activity: see paragraph 35 and 82 above.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The fact that section 2(9) enables the Secretary of State to make a control order prohibiting a person from, for example, entering railway stations, ports and airports where the reasonable suspicion of involvement is only in relation to terrorism-related activity concerning airports, does not make the exercise of power arbitrary or capricious. The terms of section 2(9), when read with sections 1(3) and 2(1), show that the aim of every obligation imposed by the control order must be the prevention or restriction of terrorism-related activity. It is also apparent from the preamble to the PTA that this is its aim. Where the obligation imposed has no connection whatsoever with what the controlled person might do, or where the Secretary of State has taken into account objectives other than the prevention or restriction of terrorism-related activity, section 3(11) of the PTA enables the Court to quash the obligation or give directions for its modification. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Finally, with regard to paragraph 8 of the Schedule, it is clear that there may be circumstances where the reason for quashing a control order does not necessarily preclude a new order in the same terms. One example of such circumstances is where the flaw is a procedural one. Mr Tam correctly submitted that empowering a public authority to act in this way in an appropriate case reflects the ordinary position in public law decision-making following the quashing of an impugned decision. So, for example, in <span style="font-style:italic">Attorney General for Hong Kong v Ng Yuen Shiu</span> [1983] 2 AC 629, 639 it was stated that the quashing of an order to remove an illegal immigrant on the ground that he had not been given an opportunity to make representations is “of course entirely without prejudice to the making of a fresh removal order … after a fair inquiry has been held…”.  Where the reason for quashing an order is not purely procedural, and, as indicated in <span style="font-style:italic">JJ and others </span>[2006] EWCA Civ. 1141 at [27], the expectation may be that the decision-maker will have to come up with a different package, this is not inevitable. That this is so is illustrated by the ultimate outcome in <span style="font-style:italic">Padfield v Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food </span>[1968] AC 997, noted in Wade &amp; Forsyth, <span style="font-style:italic">Administrative Law </span>9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> ed 358.

To the extent that a literal reading of paragraph 8 would permit the Secretary of State to make a new order in the same terms when this would be inconsistent with the decision of the court, the interpretative direction in section 3 of the Human Rights Act read together with section 11 of the PTA enables the court to read down the words of paragraph 8 so as to preclude this. </p>

Sections 3(10) and 10(5) provide that the function of the court is to determine whether specified decisions of the Secretary of State concerning the making of a control order or its renewal or modification are flawed. Any decision by the Secretary of State to impose obligations which are found to be incompatible with an individual’s right to liberty under Article 5 would, by definition be flawed because, under the PTA such obligations may only be imposed by the court under Sections 1 (2) (b) and 4 of the PTA. </p>

There were, however, also geographic limits imposed which varied in size from between 12.7 to 62 square miles. These limits had the effect of, for example, limiting the mosques which the controlled persons could attend, although there was at least one mosque in each area.

It emphasises that the court considering the matter must start by considering the concrete or actual situation of the individual concerned and take account of the type of restriction, its duration, the effects and the manner of implementation of the measure (the restriction(s)) in question.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The task of the court is to look at each of these factors, but starting with the physical restriction confining E to his flat for twelve hours a day, and then to consider the cumulative effect of the restrictions and their cumulative degree of intensity. It was common ground that this is not a mechanical exercise. At this final stage of the assessment, in order to determine whether the restrictions go beyond merely restricting the individual’s liberty of movement to depriving that individual of his liberty, the court has to have an idea of what “liberty” is. Mr Starmer submitted that the correct approach is that of Sullivan J in <span style="font-style:italic">JJ and others </span>[2006] EWHC 1621 (Admin). For Sullivan J, at the core of “liberty” is the freedom of a person to lead his life as he chooses within the law, which he stated “for convenience may be described as a ‘normal’ life”. His Lordship’s concern was, accordingly, with the extent to which such freedom has been removed, and with the degree of state control to which an individual is subject. I shall return to this after considering the Strasbourg jurisprudence. </p>

The court held that Guzzardi had been deprived of his liberty while on Asinara. It is important to note that the requirement that he live in a specified area together with the other requirements did not, in themselves suffice to deprive him of his liberty. It is possible to say this because, following the period on the Asinara, he was moved off it to another district, Force, for the remainder of his period of compulsory residence and  (see paragraph 94 of the judgment) the Commission rejected as inadmissible his application in respect of that compulsory residence. Accordingly, it was the fact that the order for compulsory residence in a specified district was implemented by requiring residence on the island of Asinara that was of importance. </p>

Secondly, he was housed in a hamlet many of the buildings of which were in a state of disrepair. He lived there principally in the company of other persons subjected to the same regime and Policemen. The permanent population of Asinara (approximately 200 people) resided almost entirely in a location which Guzzardi could not visit, and they appeared to have made little use of their right to go to the place in which he resided. Consequently, there were few opportunities for social contacts available to him other than with his near family, other people subjected to the same regime, and the supervisory staff.

It rejected Mr Ciancimino’s assertion that he was not allowed to leave his home during the day without authorisation, and stated (at 122) that his living conditions were the same as the rest of the population of the commune. This must be understood as referring to his living conditions apart from the curfew. The Commission considered that checks by the authorities of his presence at home every day and sometimes at odd hours of the night had not been proved to exceed the limits of what was reasonable, bearing in mind the nature and purpose of the preventive measure. This was the prevention of crime and in particular by persons suspected of belonging to the mafia. </p>

So, for example, in <span style="font-style:italic">Guzzardi’s </span>case the government stated (paragraph 91) that “the inviolability of [Guzzardi’s] home and of the intimacy of his family life, two rights that the Convention guaranteed solely to free people, were respected”.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">(5) The prohibition on unauthorised visitors effectively ensured that there could be no semblance of a normal life within the residence. The requirement for visitors to supply their name, address, date of birth and photographic identity had a “chilling effect” because a controlled person would have to explain why such details would have to be supplied and individuals might be reluctant to be seen to be associating with a person who was suspected of involvement in terrorism-related activity. The Court of Appeal agreed, stating that the fact that there were few requests for approval of visitors or authorised meetings could have “reflected the consequences of the obligations”, since the requirement to obtain personal particulars and a photograph from any visitor “was a serious inhibition on social life”: [2006] EWCA Civ 1141 at [16].  The statement of agreed facts in Annex 2 to Sullivan J’s judgment shows that (with the possible exception of NN), there had been no applications for social visits or pre-arranged social meetings.

However, (at [77]) he stated that he would have considered that house arrest for 18 hours each day was, even if it was the only obligation apart from those, such as reporting and tagging imposed to ensure that it was strictly observed, a deprivation of liberty. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Starmer’s submissions on impact fell into four categories. The first concerned the history of E’s detention under the 2001 Act for three and a half years. There is evidence of deterioration in his mental health reported on by Dr. Turner in 2003 comparing his assessment with his earlier assessment in January 2001 and from Professor Kopelman’s 2004 report. Mr Starmer also relied on the fact that at the time the Secretary of State imposed the Control Order, he had available E’s medical records from Belmarsh Prison, Professor Kopelman’s reports, and the reports of the 8 psychiatrists and psychologists and the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture but did not make an informed (and medically based) assessment about the likely impact of the order upon E and his family. He submitted this and E’s history is relevant for the purposes of Article 5 as well as Article 8. Although he accepted there is no Strasbourg case in which purely subjective effects from a restriction of liberty have been critical in the determination whether the restriction amounts to a deprivation, he submitted E’s health is part of his concrete situation which has to be taken into account in assessing in whether he has been deprived of his liberty. </p>

He submits that the Secretary of State has been purely reactive to psychiatric and social issues raised by E and his representatives. He pointed out that Mr Jones, the responsible civil servant for the team working on implementation of the system has no medical qualifications but considered that E’s assessments did not raise a serious enough issue to warrant any action on the part of the Secretary of State. Mr Starmer also relied on delays in responding to critical applications in particular requests for visitors to be authorised, a variation in relation to the garden, which was granted only after the lodging of an appeal under section 10 of the PTA, and enabling BT promptly to enter the residence in order to mend the telephone line. </p>

He relies on SIAC’s generic judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Ajouaou, A and others v Secretary of State for the Home Department </span>(SIAC, 29 October 2003 at [117]). The Applicant has accepted this in relation to the national security issues but not in relation to evidence of impact. Mr Starmer has argued that since the Secretary of State’s amended third statement refers to closed material about E’s activities while under the Control Order and since Professor Kopelman was cross-examined as to his diagnosis if it were proved that E had engaged in covert activities while under the order, the Secretary of State has not chosen to separate the issue of national security and the issue of impact. There is force in his submission that to require E to give evidence of impact without knowing what the Secretary of State’s allegations are about his activities while subject to the control order because of a risk of adverse inferences would be unfair.  The question, however, is the status of what is contained in E’s statement. For the reasons I have given (paragraph 131 above) I concluded that, although no adverse inference should be drawn from E’s failure to give evidence about impact, I am not able to give any weight to those parts of his statement which differ from Mr Jones’s evidence or refer to matters on which Mr Jones was not cross-examined: see <span style="font-style:italic">S v Secretary of State for the Home Department,  </span>SIAC judgment 27 July 2004, paragraphs 27-31.</p>

Reliance is placed on his freedom to come and go from the premises for 12 hours a day, the absence of any geographical restriction placed upon him other than to notify the Secretary of State if he intends to leave the UK, and the freedom to mingle with the general population and to enjoy a large degree of ordinary social contact in public spaces, in mosques, in shops or at entertainment or sporting facilities.</p>

Accordingly, he submitted that the court should not consider the psychiatric evidence about E’s mental state or that of S as relevant to whether the restrictions cumulatively amount to a deprivation of E’s liberty for the purposes of Article 5.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This question is not altogether easy to answer. The factors considered in the judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Guzzardi’s </span>case<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>are objective factors: the size of the area on Asinara available to him, the facilities available in that area, the nature of the building in which he was accommodated, who else lived in the area, the opportunities for social contact, and the intensity of the supervision: see paragraph 95 of the judgment. The nature of the accommodation available for families is not referred to in the judgment, but in the statement of facts. Counsel’s researches have not identified any case in which the Strasbourg court has taken into account the subjective consequences of the restrictions on a particular individual as opposed to any individual in his position. Mr Starmer referred to mental health cases in which, notwithstanding the consent of the individual, it has been held that there has been a deprivation of liberty but did not press the analogy. That scenario does not, however, assist Mr Starmer because what is being considered in those cases is the objective position of a person who is either legally incapable of giving consent or who, although not wholly incapable, is over-compliant. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Moreover, as Mr Tam argued, if one takes into account the subjective effect on the individual subject to the restrictions, identical restrictions might not have identical effects in Article 5 terms. This would not sit comfortably with the idea of an autonomous concept of ‘liberty’ and the need for certainty. Although not explicitly discussed, there is no support for taking account of the subjective effect on the individual in the decision of Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">JJ and others. </span>Mr Sales, on behalf of the Secretary of State ([2006] EWCA Civ 1141 at [14]) had criticised Sullivan J’s reliance on the concept of ‘normal life’ as meaning that “whether measures amounted to a 'deprivation of liberty' might depend upon whether they were aimed at a hermit or a long distance runner”; i.e. their subjective effect.  The Court of Appeal rejected this on the ground that it was not what Sullivan J had suggested. He was considering the extent to which restrictions would prevent an individual from pursuing the life of his choice, whatever that choice might be. There is no suggestion in the judgment of the Court that an approach under which whether measures amounted to a 'deprivation of liberty' might depend upon their subjective effect on a particular individual might be a proper approach. Indeed, the fact that the Court stated that this was not the consequence of Sullivan J’s approach indicates that it considered it not to be a proper approach. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Notwithstanding these considerations, I have concluded that the obligation to start with what Keene LJ described as the “concrete or actual situation of the individual” does mean that some, albeit limited, account should be taken of his mental condition and I do so. Mr Starmer accepted that it is not a critical factor and this must be correct. While <span style="font-style:italic">Guzzardi’s </span>case shows that there can be a deprivation of liberty without classic detention in prison by the Police, or by medical authorities, it is important not to lose sight of the fact that, as was stated in <span style="font-style:italic">Engel v Netherlands </span>(1976) 1 EHRR 647 at [58] Article 5 is concerned with liberty “in its classical sense, that is the physical liberty of the person”: see also <span style="font-style:italic">Guzzardi v Italy </span> at [92] and <span style="font-style:italic">Amur v France </span>(1992) 22 EHRR 533 at [42]. As Clayton and Tomlinson have observed, “physical liberty under the Convention means simply the freedom of physical movement of persons from one place to another”: <span style="font-style:italic">The Law of Human Rights </span>479. In some, perhaps many, cases the subjective effect of a restriction as a result of the individual’s mental condition will not affect that individual’s freedom of physical movement. The reason I have concluded that the mental condition of a person cannot entirely be disregarded is that the Strasbourg Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Guzzardi </span>and the courts in <span style="font-style:italic">JJ and others </span>attached importance to the degree of social isolation resulting from restrictions. A person’s mental health may well affect the extent to which he is in fact socially isolated as a result of the restrictions. Similarly, delays by the Applicant in responding to requests for visitors are of some relevance in assessing the extent of E’s social isolation. </p>

However, even if I had accepted Professor Kopelman’s diagnosis as to the severity of his depression, and notwithstanding the difficulties E describes in functioning and dealing with matters, it is evident that he does function and does not altogether lack a social network. He goes to the mosque, he takes his children to school and picks them up, he goes shopping and he sees family members who live in the area.  Five family members living in the same area have been approved as visitors. In these circumstances only very limited weight can be given to his mental condition in the context of Article 5.</p>

The Strasbourg cases to which I have referred show that a person can be controlled for periods longer than that to which E has been subject to a control order without being held to be deprived of liberty.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Starmer submitted that, taking account of the period of detention under the 2001 Act, and in the light of the evidence of witness J that the Security Service assesses that E is likely to re-engage with his associates, some of whom are due for release in 2007, and the last of whom is due for release in 2011, I should regard the duration as indefinite. Mr Tam argued that in none of the Strasbourg cases did the Court or the Commission consider the possibility of renewal and that to regard the duration as indefinite is to assume that the Secretary of State does not act in accordance with the PTA when considering renewal. The Secretary of State is bound to keep under review whether there are reasonable grounds for concluding (a) that E is or has been involved in terrorism-related activity, and (b) control order obligations are necessary for preventing or restricting such involvement. While this is true, Mr Tam’s invitation that I consider the duration of the order to be the twelve months for which the order was initially imposed and then (it was not clear whether as a separate exercise) the twelve months for which it has been renewed, does not reflect the requirement that the court consider the “concrete situation” of the individual. E was detained in December 2001 under the 2001 Act and has been subject to a control order since his release. His concrete situation is that of a person who has been subjected to preventative measures for five years. I of course proceed on the basis that the Secretary of State will act properly when he comes to consider the further renewal of E’s order. Notwithstanding this, in view of the evidence given, there is in my judgment a strong probability that the order will be renewed in 2007, and, unless there is a material change of circumstances, for further periods of twelve months at a time. </p>

Thus, the fact that the family home would normally be a key focus for Muslim North African women but their flat cannot be, because of the prohibition on unauthorised visitors, primarily affects S, as does the fact that, for cultural reasons and because of what Professor Kopelman describes as her phobic symptoms, she does not wish to go out without E.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I therefore turn to the additional restrictions on E. First, the tagging and reporting obligations increase the practical restrictions on E and are designed to ensure the curfew is strictly observed. The Strasbourg cases referred to in paragraphs 206-209 above, suggest that such requirements will not convert a restriction of movement resulting from a curfew into a deprivation of liberty. Secondly, in some respects the other restrictions to which E is subject are less severe both in their scope and in their effect than the additional restrictions in the <span style="font-style:italic">JJ cases. </span>E is not restricted within a geographical boundary outside curfew hours. Moreover, unlike the majority of the controlled persons in those cases, E is living in the NW10 area in which he lived before his detention under the 2001 Act, although not in the same part of it. He lives with his nuclear family whereas those in the <span style="font-style:italic">JJ </span>cases did not. Although, undoubtedly, some of the family’s social acquaintances will have refused to go through the process of obtaining authorisation as visitors, which I accept has a “chilling effect”, as I have noted, five family members living in the same area have been approved as visitors, as well as a friend of S’s. E is thus significantly less socially isolated than the controlled persons in the <span style="font-style:italic">JJ cases. </span></p>

There are delays where a request raises new policy issues, or where in order to deal with some requests, it is necessary for the control order team to make inquiries of other agencies, notably the Security Service and the Police. While some difficulties on the inception of a new regime are understandable, they concern “the manner of implementation of the measure” within Keene LJ’s third proposition, and account must be taken of them in assessing E’s concrete situation. There is, however, a distinction to be made between a “manner of implementation” which connotes fault on the part of the public authority concerned and one which does not.  Delays caused by the need to consult other agencies also affect the overall practical effect of the restrictions on E but are not necessarily to be characterised as matters for which the Home Office and other public authorities involved are at fault.  Delays which are not the fault of the Home Office or public authorities, such as that in reconnecting E’s fixed telephone line also contribute to the overall practical effect of the restrictions but cannot be regarded as part of the manner of implementation of the measure. </p>

But its generality adds significantly to the intensity and the burden of the restriction. I note that, in the case of pre-arranged meetings outside the house, each such meeting has to be approved, even where it only concerns family members and others who are authorised to visit E at his home. Mr Jones did not appreciate this and accepted that he erred in stating in paragraph 50 of his witness statement that no permission is needed for pre-arranged meetings outside the residence with those cleared to visit the residence. It is perhaps significant that, following the decision of the Court of Appeal in the <span style="font-style:italic">JJ cases</span>, the new control orders imposed on those persons permit them to receive any visitors they wish without notice to the Secretary of State and to meet anyone they wish outside their homes, save persons the Secretary of State specifically identifies. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In none of the Strasbourg cases canvassed before me were there similar requirements concerning visitors and all meetings outside the residence, even with individuals authorised to visit the residence. Guzzardi and Labita were prohibited from attending public meetings and from associating with known criminals and those subject to preventative measures. Labita was also prohibited from going to bars. Guzzardi was required to inform the supervising authorities in advance of the number and name of those with whom he was to be in telephonic contact, but was not required to ask permission. Even if, contrary to the conclusion reached by Sullivan J and myself (see paragraph 209 above), <span style="font-style:italic">Trijonis </span>is to be regarded as a case in which outside the curfew hours the applicant was only permitted to leave his home to go to work, the restrictions only controlled his freedom of movement. He was not subject to restriction of social contact within his home, on the telephone or on the internet. At work – he worked for a private company – his ordinary contact with fellow employees and those who dealt with the company, must have involved pre-arranged meetings. No restriction was placed on these. In a sense therefore, while the restrictions on his freedom of movement were extensive, and (on Mr Tam’s reading of the decision) severe, they were just that and did not affect the other hallmarks of individual liberty. I have concluded that, although E’s is a more finely balanced case that the <span style="font-style:italic">JJ cases</span>, even giving only very limited weight to the medical evidence as I do,<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>the cumulative effect of the restrictions does deprive E of his liberty in breach of Article 5 of the Convention. Like Sullivan J (see <span style="font-style:italic">JJ </span>at [80]), in reaching this conclusion I take comfort from the fact that it accords with the views expressed in the Twelfth Report of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Human Rights (HL 122, HC 915 or 2005-2006). The Committee considered (paragraph 38) that control orders containing the list of obligations set out in the pro forma in Annexe 2 to Lord Carlile’s first report on the PTA “are so restrictive of liberty as to amount to a deprivation of liberty for the purposes of Article 5(1) ECHR”. For all practical purposes E’s control order is in the same terms as those set out in the pro forma. </p>

It is argued that the decisions are flawed because; (a) there the Secretary of State breached his duty under section 8 of the PTA to consult about the possibility of prosecuting E for terrorist offences, (b) the obligations imposed are disproportionate in the light of E’s history and mental condition, their effect on his wife and children, and the failure of the Secretary of State adequately to keep the possibility of prosecuting him under review, (c) the Secretary of State breached common law and Convention-based obligations of procedural fairness owed to E and his family, and (d) the cumulative impact of the obligations imposed have such a significant effect on E’s children that they violate or risk violating their rights under Article 3.</p>

For the purposes of the hearing before me the Secretary of State was prepared to proceed on the assumption that his duty to consult under section 8(2) arose. Given the matters relied on by the Secretary of State in the third amended statement this was, I venture to observe a realistic concession. It was common ground that the reference in section 8 (1)(b) to an offence that “ would fall to be investigated by a Police force " is to ensure that only offences that would fall to be investigated within the United Kingdom are caught. In such cases section 8(2) requires the Secretary of State to consult the chief officer of the Police force about “whether there is evidence available that could realistically be used for the purposes of a prosecution of the individual for an offence relating to terrorism”. </p>

The first is that the Secretary of State consulted on the wrong question, <span style="font-style:italic">inter alia </span>because he consulted on the impact of public interest factors on prosecution. Secondly, the consideration by the CPS of the possibility of prosecution was inadequate because it was based on the statements prepared by the Secretary of State for the SIAC hearings without consideration of the underlying primary material and because the cases of thirteen detainees were looked at on the one day and that was insufficient time. </p>

This last submission is important in determining whether the Secretary of State’s decision to renew and maintain E’s control order is flawed for the purposes of the court’s supervisory and appellate jurisdiction under sections 3(10) and 10(4) and (5) of the PTA. I do not, however, consider that, if made out, it constitutes a breach of his duty under section 8(2). A failure by the Secretary of State to consult pursuant to section 8(2) may mean that a decision to make or maintain a control order is “flawed” for the purposes of the court’s reviewing and appellate power under sections 3(10) and 10(4) and (5) of the PTA. But the reverse is not true. It is not possible to characterise all “flaws” concerning the consideration of the prospect of prosecution as breaches of the Secretary of State’s duty under section 8(2).

The conditions precedent for the making of a non-derogating control order are set out in section 2 (1). Had the obligation to consult the Chief Officer been one of those, it would have been easy to include it as a further sub-provision of section 2 (1).  Mr Starmer submitted that the fact that the policy of the PTA requires prosecution where possible means that the compliance with the duty under section 8(2) is a condition precedent to the Secretary of State’s power to make a control order. There is, however, no need to construe section 8(2) in this way in order to ensure adherence to the statutory policy and adequate judicial control of the Secretary of State’s decision to maintain a control order. It is common ground that there is a continuing duty to keep the question of prosecution under review, although on behalf of the Applicant it is submitted that the duty lies solely on the chief officer of the Police force, whereas Mr Starmer submitted that it also lies on the Secretary of State. In the light of the terms of section 8(4) of the PTA and the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">MB </span>(see paragraphs 30-32 above) the duty lies on both. For reasons I give in paragraphs 281-293, I conclude that a failure to keep the question under review and lawfully to consider whether new material gives rise to a realistic prospect of prosecution, renders a decision to maintain a control order “flawed” for the purposes of the supervisory and appellate functions of the Court under the PTA.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Where no new material has become available, unless a change in the law has affected the status of material previously considered, it is not arguable that the chief officer’s duty to keep the matter of prosecution under review requires him to go back to the relevant prosecuting authority. Where there is some new material, but it is objectively clear, taking account both of that material and material previously considered, that there is still insufficient admissible open evidence to found a prosecution, a decision by the chief officer that it is not appropriate to consult the relevant prosecuting authority would be within his discretion under section 8(5). There remain the scenarios in which it is not clear that the new material together with the material previously considered does not suffice to found a prosecution, or it is clear that it does so suffice, but the prosecuting authority is not consulted. In such cases the chief officer will have either decided not to consult the prosecuting authority or failed to consider whether to do so. However the chief officer’s conduct is characterised, this is likely to be reviewable as an unlawful exercise of his discretion under section 8(5). In my judgment, this conduct also renders the Secretary of State’s decision to maintain a control order “flawed” for the purposes of sections 3(10) and 10(4) and (5) of the PTA. I deal with this in paragraphs 281-293 below. Here it suffices to say that this follows from the Secretary of State’s continuing duty in relation to the control order which was identified in <span style="font-style:italic">MB’s </span>case, and the fact that his decision to maintain the order is in this sense tainted by his failure adequately to keep the issue of prosecution under review.

Such discussions are not relied upon and cannot be relied upon for the purposes of section 8 of the PTA. It is, however, clear that in January 2005 the Home Office consulted the Police about the prosecution of those detained under the 2001 Act, including E. Miss Byrne wrote to Sir David Veness on 11 January 2005 asking that the Police and the CPS review the cases of those detained under the 2001 Act with a view to “determining whether there is yet sufficient evidence to mount a prosecution in any of their cases”. A week later Miss Hemming, the Head of the CPS’s Counter-Terrorism Division, and a Detective Superintendent visited Thames House to consider “whether there would be any prospect of a prosecution” against any of the detainees. The CPS view of the outcome is contained in Miss Hemming’s letter dated 19 January. The consultation of the Police which led to the visit to Thames House satisfied the requirements of section 8 because section 8(6) provides that the duty of the Chief Officer to consult the relevant prosecuting authority before the order is made may be satisfied by consultation “that took place wholly or partly before the passing of  the PTA."</p>

Mr Starmer’s submission has insufficient regard to the language and the context of the statute. Had Parliament wished to confine consideration of prosecution to the evidential test, it could have replicated the words used in the Code in section 8. But it did not do so. The use of the phrase “evidence available that could realistically be used for the purpose of prosecution “in section 8(2) shows that Parliament was not concerned with the objective evidential test and that what it had in mind was a wider test bringing in the second stage of the Code test, the public interest test. This, set out in paragraphs 5.6 to 5.9 of the Code, is whether, although the evidential test is met, there are public interest factors tending against prosecution which clearly outweigh those tending in favour. That Parliament intended the public interest factors to be considered gains clear support from the context, which is the consideration of prosecution for terrorist offences. It is highly likely that the question of prosecution in that context will be significantly affected by public interest factors, in particular national security considerations.  In any event, the evidential stage, which requires assessing whether there is enough evidence to provide “a realistic prospect of conviction”, is concerned with assessing the quality of the evidence and the consequences of its use as well as its admissibility.</p>

This is more problematic. It is true that Mr Whalley’s statement also sets out the terms of the question which the Police were asked to consider and that the question asked uses the statutory language. The fact that the correct question was asked does not of itself show, as Mr Jones suggested, that notwithstanding the terms of the answer the Police considered the correct issue. In considering what was in fact considered, I am, however, assisted by the terms of Miss Byrne’s letter to Sir David Veness dated 11 January 2005, Miss Hemming’s letter of 19 January, and what is recorded in the minutes of the meetings of 7 and 8 March.

This does not suggest that the Police and the CPS were being asked to consider whether a prosecution would succeed. Miss Hemming’s letter dated 19 January states that what was considered by her and the Detective Superintendent was whether there was any prospect of a prosecution. Its conclusion is “there is no prospect of any further criminal prosecutions”.  In E’s case the letter states there was no prospect of prosecution because the evidence is either closed or inadmissible. Closed evidence is evidence which, even if admissible is, in the context of terrorism, unlikely to be used because the public interest factors tending against its use in a prosecution will often clearly outweigh those tending in favour<span style="font-style:italic">. </span>The minutes of the meeting on 7 March state that “prosecution is not possible” and the minutes of the follow-up meeting on 8 March that “the CPS had confirmed … that they could not prosecute…”. The words of the minutes reflect what is stated in the letter of 19 January. The terms of that letter and of the minutes of the March meetings show that what was under consideration was not whether “prosecution would be successful” but whether it was possible, or there was a “prospect” of prosecution. That, to my mind, is substantially the same as the statutory question; evidence which “could realistically be used” in a prosecution.

She concluded that “in none of the cases was there identifiable material that was capable of further criminal investigation; where there was anything potentially admissible, it had already been considered and rejected or had been the subject of a criminal prosecution”.  It is to be noted that Lord Carlile of Berriew QC, who considered the files of those detained under the 2001 Act that were placed before the Home Secretary when he was asked to determine whether a control order should be made, stated that they included “detailed summaries of evidence and intelligence material” (First Report February 2006, paragraph 35), that “much of the information is derived from intelligence”, and that “the sources and content of such evidence demand careful protection in the public interest”, given the need to respond to terrorism (ibid, paragraph 36). </p>

Mr Starmer relied on a statement by Lord Diplock in <span style="font-style:italic">Secretary of State for Education and Science v Tameside MBC </span>[1977] AC 1014, at 1065B and the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">R(Q) v  Secretary of State for the Home Department </span>[2004] QB 35.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The evidence does not support this submission. Mr Jones said that at the time the control order was first made the Home Office had E’s medical records from HMP Belmarsh but his was not a case in which the medical evidence had outweighed the national security risk and the necessity for a control order. Professor Kopelman’s report was only served after the crucial meetings on 7 and 8 March and was then sent to the Special Immigration Appeals Commission under cover of a letter in connection with E’s application for bail, which was copied to the Treasury Solicitor. The evidence as to the position thereafter is as follows. It is not stated in the minutes of CORG that there was any consideration of medical evidence or medical issues concerning E’s case. Mr Jones’s evidence was that a controlled person’s caseworker would be at meetings and could raise health and welfare issues if they arose. The suggestion is that the position was similar under the more informal arrangements in place before CORG was established. Although in August 2005 E’s solicitors wrote to the Home Office stating that further psychological and psychiatric reports about E and the family would be made available, and in November 2005 the Home Office asked E’s solicitors to provide them, Mr Jones said none were received by the Home Office before service of the medical evidence for the hearing in October 2006. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It was suggested that the Home Office civil servants, who did not have relevant psychiatric or psychological qualifications, should have arranged for an appropriate assessment of E and should not have made decisions about whether his mental health was to be raised at review meetings. Mr Jones said that the Home Office did not consider that either the information provided by his solicitors or the reports about the effect of indeterminate detention under the 2001 Act on mental health meant there was a need for it to conduct a separate psychiatric assessment of E. The fact that the medical evidence about E’s mental state available to the Home Office was not considered by a medically qualified person is potentially of concern in assessing the continuing necessity of the control order and of particular restrictions under it. In E’s case, however, it is significant that, notwithstanding the information provided by his solicitors to the Home Office, no requests were made for the authorisation (as required under the terms of the control order) for medical appointments for psychiatric or psychological treatment. The only such request concerned E’s kidney problems. In these circumstances, there was no need for an independent psychiatric or psychological assessment and the absence of references to E’s medical condition in the minutes of review meetings is not something which renders the decision to maintain his control order a “flawed” decision.</p>

The case was one in which it was held that, although lacking in specification, the local education authority’s letter conveyed sufficient information to the experts at the Department, and that the Secretary of State had asked the wrong question. <span style="font-style:italic">R(Q) v  Secretary of State for the Home Department </span>was a case concerning a determination to refuse asylum support to applicants on the basis of their asylum interviews. The information available to the Home Office about the individuals, some of whom had recently arrived in this country, was largely derived from those interviews. In E’s case, however, the Home Office had considerable information about E, his health and his family. In <span style="font-style:italic">Q’s</span> case, moreover, the determination of entitlement to asylum support involved consideration of the individual’s state of mind. In that case the instructions given to the decision makers were inadequate as to the test to be applied and the information needed in order to apply the proper test. The matters addressed on the standard form of questionnaire used did not provide the information needed for that test.    </p>

No further reports on E’s condition were received prior to the receipt of the reports for the purposes of these proceedings in October 2006. Moreover, although information about E’s condition was sent to the Home Office by his solicitors, there were no requests to attend psychiatric or psychological appointments during that time.

He relied on the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Keenan v United Kingdom </span>[2001] 33 EHRR 913 at paragraphs 108-115. In that case the Strasbourg Court held that the lack of effective monitoring of the condition of a mentally ill prisoner and the lack of informed psychiatric input into his assessment constituted inhuman and degrading treatment within the meaning of Article 3. There is, however, a fundamental difference between a person in prison and a person such as E. E is subject to very significant restrictions but is not in prison. In the case of a person in prison, access to medical services is entirely in the hands of the authorities. The particular duties owed by the state to vulnerable people detained either in prisons or in mental hospitals are well established. In E’s case he was not so confined or deprived of access to appropriate medical attention and was indeed receiving it.</p>

In March 2005 they sent a report by Professor Kopelman, a consultant psychiatrist, and in August 2005 stated that more reports on the family would be forthcoming. As stated previously these were only provided shortly before the hearing and Mr Jones’s evidence that that there were no requests for permission to attend psychiatric or psychological appointments during the period the control order was in force was not challenged. I leave aside the fact that E’s attendance without authorisation at the seven appointments Professor Kopelman referred to was a technical breach of the control order, technical because permission would surely have been granted. The importance of this in the present context, however, is that, permission not having been sought, the Home Office cannot be blamed for not knowing that E was regularly seeing Professor Kopelman. In the light of this, and the information the Home Office had about his condition, I do not consider that the Home Office was required to take additional operational steps, such as instructing its own psychiatrist or psychologist.</p>

Mr Singh recognised that, given the national security case against E, while the effect on the family had to be taken into account it was a secondary factor. In weighing the factors and making his assessment, the Secretary of State has a discretionary area of judgment which the court must recognise and allow, although it must scrutinise the weight given to the various factors carefully in accordance with the approach set out by Dyson LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Samaroo v Secretary of State for the Home Department </span>[2001] EWCA Civ. 1139, at [39].

This includes keeping the matter of prosecution under review. Accordingly, if there has been a failure to keep the matter of prosecution under review, the Secretary of State’s decision to maintain a control order is likely to be flawed.

In any event, put in this way, the challenge is to the adequacy of the process of continuing review undertaken originally at the <span style="font-style:italic">ad-hoc</span> meetings described by witness J and Mr Jones, and now at the meetings of CORG.

Unless there are changes in the law (for example in relation to domestic intercept evidence), the latter scenario is unlikely. Where there is new material, or the status of the material previously available changes, the extent of the obligation to reconsider the prospect of a prosecution will depend on the significance of the new material. In the present case the Belgian judgments were received in November 2005, have been available in English since January 2006, and since September 2006 have been part of the open evidence. Both their availability and the fact that they and the information and sources in them have subsequently been made open are of significance.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Their significance for the prospect of prosecution is as follows.

That evidence is, in the light of the authorities culminating in <span style="font-style:italic">R v P </span>[2002] 1 AC 146<span style="font-style:italic">,</span> in principle admissible in England. An assessment of the implications of such evidence for the case against E is needed in order to determine whether the prospects of prosecuting him have changed. Secondly, I accept Mr Starmer’s submission that, apart from the admissibility of such evidence, it was necessary to consider the impact of making that evidence public on the public interest factors in play in E’s case. Thirdly, it was suggested (albeit in the context of section 8(2)) that the Secretary of State is not required to gather evidence in other countries and that it had not been shown that the Belgian judgments constituted evidence. But what is important is the material identified in the judgments. It was not suggested on behalf of the Secretary of State that Mr Starmer was wrong in stating as he did that evidence from the Belgian proceedings was used in prosecutions against three people, Benmerzouga, Meziane, and Al Siri. It is for this reason that the possibility of prosecuting E in the light of the material about him identified in the Belgian judgments needed to be considered. </p>

DAC Clarke’s letter does not identify the material considered or the reasons for his conclusion. Mr Jones stated that he believed that DAC Clarke’s letter was sent to the Home Office with a letter from the CPS to the Police but this was not found. In the absence of any records in the CPS, and Miss Hemming’s telephone conversation with Ms Peirce referred to in paragraph 111 above, it would, however, appear that there was either no consultation with the CPS or that any consultation was oral. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There is no indication on either the Security Service files or the papers held by the Home Office that the Belgian judgments were sent to the Police or to the CPS in order that the prospects of prosecution could be reviewed in the light of them. Mr Jones’s evidence was that at the CORG meeting in May 2006 he asked about the possibility of prosecution and the Police said that prosecution was not possible. He considered that it was for the Police to respond and to raise matters updating the position at the meetings. Asked whether anyone had mentioned the Belgian proceedings and whether they affected the prospect of prosecution he said the review only considered activity in the particular quarter. I infer from his response that there was no reference to the Belgian judgments at the meetings of CORG. The open statement concerning the minutes of the CORG meetings in May and August 2006 show that there is no reference to prosecution for the underlying terrorist offences. It appears from the evidence that, while some consideration may have been given at meetings of CORG to prosecution of terrorism offences, they were primarily concerned with compliance with the terms of the control order. The evidence of J, the national security witness, is of particular significance on this issue. J did not believe that there had been any review of the question of prosecution in the light of the Belgian judgments. Once that evidence was before the court it was open to the Applicant to seek to adduce evidence to show that there had been such a review. No application to do so was made. In the light of J’s evidence and the absence of any evidence on behalf of the Secretary of State that the question of prosecution was reviewed in the light of the Belgian judgments, I conclude that it was not so reviewed.</p>

Whether or not it does, in view of the continuing duty on the Secretary of State in respect of the control order, Mr Jones’s view that at meetings of CORG it sufficed for the Home Office to ask the Police about prosecution was insufficient. The Belgian judgments were obtained by the Home Office in connection with these proceedings. By May 2006 the Home Office was considering their impact on the present proceedings. The decision to make them open was taken shortly after the August meeting of CORG. In the case of a person such as E, where the original consideration of prosecution by the CPS was based on material prepared in 2002, and where towards the end of 2005 and the beginning of 2006 significant material in the form of the Belgian judgments was received by the Home Office, a process which simply relied on the chief officer of the Police force or the Police officer present at the relevant meeting of CORG to bring matters forward is insufficient. </p>

As far as the remedy is concerned, the question of whether the control order remains necessary is intimately bound up with the question of whether there is now evidence which gives rise to a realistic possibility of prosecuting E. In these circumstances it cannot be said that the failure on the part of the Secretary of State is technical.  </p>

I have considered whether these obligations could be relaxed. The possibilities include replacing the need for prior authorisation of such meetings by an obligation to give advance notification of the particulars of meetings or (as in the new control orders in the <span style="font-style:italic">JJ </span>cases) permitting visitors and meetings save with persons identified by the Secretary of State. </p>

Since the Applicant’s witnesses were not challenged about the necessity of the individual obligations, there is no material before me upon which I can conclude that the less restrictive alternatives I have considered would be adequate to meet E’s assessed risk. There is accordingly no material to set against the Secretary of State’s decision that all the obligations remain necessary as part of the “intense scrutiny” referred to by the Court of Appeal. Bearing in mind the “degree of deference” which the Court of Appeal has stated must be given to the decisions of the Secretary of State as to the necessity of the individual obligations imposed, I have concluded that this is not a case in which it can be said that the Secretary of State’s decision is flawed. </p>

This would be part of the Secretary of State’s need, particularly in view of the length of time E has been either detained or subject to a control order, to consider carefully whether the continuing risk E is assessed to pose might be adequately addressed by such relaxation.</p>

This is so whether the process was that under section 3(1)(a), whereby the permission of the court is sought to make the order, or that under section 3(1)(b) or (c), under which the order can be made without the permission of the court.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The following provisions of the PTA show that Parliament intended to exclude any obligation to afford the individual an opportunity to make representations before the order is made.  Firstly there is the requirement in the PTA that the Secretary of State normally seek the permission of the Court to make a non-derogating order (section 3(1)(a)). Secondly the Court may consider such an application without the individual having been notified of it (section 3(5)). Thirdly, the statute requires that the individual be given an opportunity to make representations within 7 days of the Court’s giving permission (section 3(7)). Finally, the provisions governing urgent cases and orders made before 14 March against those certified under the 2001 Act are inconsistent with a duty to afford an opportunity for representations at that stage. Where the order is made without applying to the court section 3(3) requires the Secretary of State to refer it to the Court immediately. Section 3(5) enables the Court to consider the application in the absence of the individual and notwithstanding that the individual has not been notified of it. Additionally, in the context of a perceived need to protect the public from the risk of terrorism, the nature of much of the evidence considered by the Secretary of State and the fact that the individual who is to be subjected to a control order may go to ground if he is notified of the intention to make such an order in advance are all factors which justify not requiring that an opportunity be afforded to make representations before the decision is taken.

Moreover, it was submitted that in November 2005, prior to the renewal of the control order, the Secretary of State pressed E’s solicitors for the provision of the “family psychiatric and psychological reports” that they had indicated they wished to submit but that those reports were not forthcoming until October 2006. Finally, it was submitted that the willingness of the Home Office to maintain an ongoing dialogue with those subject to control orders is shown by Mr Jones’s evidence, for example in relation to varying control order obligations to enable families to follow Ramadan observances without interfering with arrangements for the school run.</p>

In this sense it is similar to Professor Kopelman’s report which was sent to SIAC and copied to the Treasury Solicitor on 9 March 2005. There was, however, no specific invitation to make representations for the purpose of the Secretary of State considering the renewal of the order. Since the hearing, in Mr Abu Rideh’s case Miss Byrne produced the letter dated 12 December 2006 inviting him to make any submissions concerning factors or circumstances he wished to be taken into account by the Secretary of State in considering whether to renew the Control order. Miss Byrne said that this letter was a new procedure bearing in mind what the Home Office had learnt through the process and that it seemed a good way of ensuring that the controlled person can raise material so it can be considered by the Secretary of State. While this letter did not refer to the family, Miss Byrne stated that the Secretary of State would welcome representations made on behalf of the family. </p>

The dialogue referred to by the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">MB </span>envisages that there will be an exchange of information. Where no information is forthcoming it follows from the Secretary of State’s continuing duty and the need for this dialogue that the Secretary of State should invite representations. In the present case, what is argued on behalf of the Secretary of State is that the experienced solicitors acting for both E and for his family made representations throughout the period of the Control order concerning the impact on E and his family of the obligations, the family’s health, and the applications for modification or revocation of particular obligations and the reasons given for them. It is essentially argued that, given these circumstances, there was no need for the Secretary of State to invite E and his family to make any submissions.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Openness to representations made is, however, not the same as affording an opportunity to make representations. In the context of situations in which it has been held that an opportunity to make representations must be given before a decision, openness to representations subsequently made is no answer because it is difficult to maintain that the decision maker can remain as open minded as if no decision had been taken, and there is a danger of becoming defensive and entrenched : <span style="font-style:italic">R  v  Secretary of State  for the Home Department, ex p. Hickey </span>[1995] 1 WLR 734 at 744 and  <span style="font-style:italic">R (Q) v Secretary of State for the Home Department </span>[2004] QB 36 at [91]. Clearly, where there is no such duty in advance of a decision, this argument is weaker but it still has some force. Where, as was Mr Jones’s evidence and may be the case in respect of more recent control orders, the control order is accompanied by a letter indicating that questions about the content of the order or the obligations and representations can be put, there may be no problem. In E’s case, however, this did not occur. Moreover, the considerations that negate any requirement to give an opportunity to make representations <span style="text-decoration:underline">before</span> the control order is initially imposed do not apply to the renewal of the order. The letter, dated 20 December 2006, to Mr Abu Rideh and Miss Byrne’s evidence suggest that the Home Office may now share this view. For these reasons it is in my judgment doubtful whether mere openness to representations is sufficient. Many of the representations relate to specific applications to vary the restrictions, either temporarily or more generally and, as the terms of the letter dated 20 December 2006 to Mr Abu Rideh indicate, the need to consider the position of the family may still not be sufficiently appreciated.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Since the Secretary of State received representations on behalf of E, S and the children, the fact that they were not invited to make representations does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that the control order must be quashed. This is not a version of the argument, now generally discredited, that no remedy should be given because the opportunity to make representations would have made no difference. The point here is that the Secretary of State has received much information from those representing E and his family. In view of my conclusion that E’s control order amounted to a deprivation of liberty, and that in any event it was flawed because of the failure to consider the impact of the availability of the Belgian judgments on the possibility of prosecuting him for terrorist offence, it is, however, not necessary for me to decide this point. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It only remains to consider Mr Singh’s argument based on Article 3. It is clear that there is a particular need to protect the welfare of children (<span style="font-style:italic">R (P and Q) v Secretary of State for the Home Department </span>[2001] 1 WLR 2002), that whether Article 3 has been violated depends <span style="font-style:italic">inter alia </span>on the age, vulnerability and state of health of the person, and that children are considered vulnerable: <span style="font-style:italic">Selmouni  v  France </span>[2000] 29 EHRR 403 at paragraph 100. It is also clear that a violation of Article 3 may be established without specific consequences being identified: <span style="font-style:italic">Keenan v  United Kingdom </span>[2001] 33 EHRR 38 at paragraph 112. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In the case of E’s children, there is evidence of I’s bed-wetting and anxiety, although the evidence on the former is not consistent, and Renée Cohen’s evidence that the long-term impact on the children’s mental health is likely to be significant and detrimental. Mr Singh accepts that the evidence is somewhat speculative.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I have concluded that this is not a case in which the control order restrictions at present pose a risk of such significant impact on the children’s mental health that they are humiliating and debasing them and possibly breaking their moral resistance so as to constitute "inhuman or degrading treatment". The cases relied on by Mr Singh concern significantly different factual situations. In <span style="font-style:italic">A v United Kingdom</span> [1999] 27 EHRR 611 the court was concerned with a child who was severely beaten. The court stated (paragraph 22) that children and other vulnerable individuals are entitled to protection against “serious breaches of personal integrity”. The case of <span style="font-style:italic">Mayeka v Belgium </span>12 October 2006 concerned the detention of a five year old girl, separated from her parents for two months in a centre initially designed for adults, without any measures for psychological or educational supervision or care by qualified staff. Those cases are far removed from that of E’s children. In those circumstances the position of the children rests on the submission that the interference with their Article 8 rights is disproportionate. Despite the need to be especially vigilant about the impact on vulnerable children, for the reasons I have given, I have rejected that submission. </p>

This is also the proper course in respect of the failure to review the prospects of prosecuting E in the light of the Belgian judgments. They only became available in November 2005 and were not fully translated until January 2006, but in view of what I have referred to as the continuing duty of the Secretary of State, it would be appropriate to quash the control order either under the powers in section 3(12)(a), or those (in respect of renewals) in section 10(7(a) of the PTA. </p>
