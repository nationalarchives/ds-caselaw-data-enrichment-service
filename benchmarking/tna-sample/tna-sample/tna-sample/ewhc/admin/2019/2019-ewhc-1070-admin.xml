	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Heathrow is the busiest two-runway airport in the world, being currently full to capacity with further, unfulfilled demand.  It is important to the national as well as the local economy.  However, it is situated in a heavily built-up area of West London, with most aircraft using it passing over Central London in taking off or landing.  As a result, whether its capacity should be expanded by constructing a third runway has been a long-standing question of national importance and acute political controversy.  In these claims, the latest statement of Government policy supporting such expansion is challenged.     </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">On 26 June 2018, the Secretary of State for Transport (“the Secretary of State”) designated “Airports National Policy Statement: new runway capacity and infrastructure at airports in the South East of England” (“the ANPS”) under section 5 of the Planning Act 2008 (“the PA 2008”).  The ANPS set outs the Government’s policy on the need for new airport capacity in the South East of England and its preferred location and scheme to meet that need, namely a third runway at Heathrow to the north west of the current runways (“the NWR Scheme”). </p>

We have set out the grounds in each claim in Appendix A to this judgment, although, as the grounds as originally drafted were in some cases broad and somewhat inchoate (and their scope and nature evolved during the course of the proceedings through to the end of the hearing), we have set them out in what we understand to be their final form in our own words.

Prior to the PA 2008, a proposal for the construction of a new airport or extension to an airport would have required planning permission under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.  An application for permission would undoubtedly have resulted in a public inquiry, whether as an appeal against refusal of consent or a decision by the Secretary of State to “call in” the matter for his own determination.  As paragraph 3.1 of the 2007 White Paper said: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.00in">“A key problem with the current system of planning for major infrastructure is that national policy and, in particular, the national need for infrastructure, is not in all cases clearly set out.  This can cause significant delays at the public inquiry stage, because national policy has to be clarified and the need for the infrastructure has to be established through the inquiry process and for each individual application.  For instance, the absence of a clear policy framework for airports development was identified by the inquiry secretary in his report on the planning inquiry as one of the key factors in the very long process for securing planning approval for Heathrow Terminal 5.  Considerable time had to be taken at the inquiry debating whether there was a need for additional capacity.  The Government has since responded by publishing the Air Transport White Paper to provide a framework for airport development.  This identifies airport development which the Government considers to be in the national interest, for reference at future planning inquiries.  But for many other infrastructure sectors, national policy is still not explicitly set out, or is still in the process of being developed.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Paragraph 3.2 identified a number of particular problems caused by the absence of a clear national policy framework.  For example, inspectors at public inquiries might be required to make assumptions about national policy and need, often without clear guidance and on the basis of incomplete evidence.  Decisions by Ministers in individual cases might become the means by which government policy would be expressed, rather than such decisions being framed by clear policy objectives beforehand.  In the absence of a clear forum for consultation at the national level, it could be more difficult for the public and other interested parties to have their say in the formulation of national policy on infrastructure.  The ability of developers to make long-term investment decisions is influenced by the availability of clear statements of government policy and objectives, and might be adversely affected by the absence of such statements. </p>

It was said that NPSs should have more weight than other statements of policy, whether at a national or local level: they should be the primary consideration in the determination of an application for a “Development Consent Order” (“DCO”) (paragraph 3.12), although other relevant considerations should also be taken into account (paragraph 3.13).

It has two parallel east-west runways, and four operational passenger terminals.  It is Europe’s busiest airport by passenger traffic with about 70% of the UK’s scheduled long-haul flights, its four passenger terminals handling approximately 80m passengers per year.  With its large number of national and international destinations, it has an important aviation “hub” function, i.e. it acts as a passenger exchange point for flights to and from other towns and cities.  Heathrow is also Europe’s third busiest cargo airport, handling just under 2m tonnes of freight and mail per year.  Heathrow is working at more or less full operational capacity; as is London’s second airport, Gatwick, at peak times.  Gatwick is a single runway airport handling 280,000 ATMs per year.   </p>

It is particularly noteworthy that, as recorded in paragraph 1.3 of the ANPS, the AC was established “to examine the scale and timing of any requirement for additional capacity to maintain the UK’s position as Europe’s most important aviation hub…”; and to examine the scale and timing for additional airport capacity to maintain that status.  In this judgment, we shall refer to the aim of maintaining the UK’s position as Europe’s most important aviation hub as “the hub objective”.  It was recognised at the time of the establishment of the AC that increasing airport capacity had the potential for substantial adverse effects; and the AC’s terms of reference required it to look at the environmental impact of meeting any identified needs, and that it “should base the recommendations in its final report on a detailed consideration of the case for each of the credible options.  This should include the development or examination of… environmental assessments for each option…”.  The AC was chaired by Sir Howard </p>

It concluded and recommended that the NWR Scheme was the most appropriate way to meet that need – “the strongest option” (see Executive Summary, page 30) – if combined with a significant package of measures which addressed environmental and community impacts.  It concluded that the NWR Scheme performed best in the Strategic Fit Module, with the Gatwick 2R Scheme more focused on shorthaul European flights without any substantial increase in long-haul connectivity absent a significant change in industry structure (paragraph 6.92).   </p>

At key stages in the evolution of this policy, the approval of the Cabinet Sub-Committee was sought so that its decision would be binding across Government by virtue of collective ministerial responsibility (see Low 1, paragraph 74).  Accordingly, the drafts of the ANPS which were the subject of public consultation and the finally designated ANPS could, as a matter of fact, truly be said to be statements of Government policy.  Indeed, the ANPS plainly states in several places that it sets out Government policy on, amongst other things, the need for new airport capacity in the South East of England (e.g. paragraph 1.13). </p>

Section 5(1) empowers the relevant Secretary of State to designate an NPS if the statement is issued <span style="font-style:italic">by him</span> and “sets out national policy in relation to one or more specified descriptions of development”.  The mere use of the phrase “national policy” does not impose a legal requirement that the policy be agreed by the Government as such.

Consequently, for example, as the Act itself makes clear, even where an NPS has identified a suitable location for a particular description of development, it would be open to the Secretary of State to refuse an application for a DCO if he considered that the adverse impacts arising from such matters would outweigh the benefits of the proposed development (section 104(7) and (9)).  </p>

Section 6(1) requires the Secretary of State to review an NPS whenever he “thinks it appropriate to do so”.  In deciding when to carry out a review, he must consider (amongst other things) whether, since the time when the NPS was first published or last reviewed, “there has been a significant change in any circumstances on the basis of which any of the policy set out in the statement [or relevant part] was decided” and that change was not anticipated at that time (section 6(3) and (4)).  They contend that that provision is exhaustive: the statutory scheme thus excludes the possibility of using the DCO process to argue that policy in the NPS should be disregarded or attract reduced weight because of any change in circumstance.  </p>

It may identify a statutory undertaker to carry out the development, but it may be neutral as to the identity of the developer.

Clearly, where an NPS does not lay down policy on a particular matter, the power to disregard objections does not apply to that matter.  That seems to us to be a modest and obvious proposition.  So if, for example, an NPS does not contain a policy endorsing a particular location for the development identified, those provisions would not allow an objection promoting the relative advantages of an alternative location to be disregarded.  The same analysis would apply where an NPS states that a particular need should be met, but does not require that a particular type of infrastructure or technology be used.  In those circumstances, alternative schemes could be presented and relied upon by objectors.   </p>

It concerned paragraph 3.1 of the NPS for Hazardous Waste, which identified a national need for additional hazardous waste facilities and indicated a range of technologies that could be considered in individual applications.  But the NPS did not identify the scale of the need to be met (e.g. the amount of additional waste capacity required) whether on a national or regional basis, or more locally.  It laid down what Lindblom LJ (giving the judgment of the court) described as a general or “qualitative” need (see [24]).  This national need was a matter to be weighed in the balance when individual applications for a DCO came to be decided (see [29]).  The weight to be given to that factor would be a matter of judgment for the decision-maker in each case (see [31]).  Lindblom LJ accepted that alternative locations could in that case be a relevant consideration (see [68]-[69]); but that was in the context of an NPS which did not select locations and rule out alternatives. </p>

The problem it sought to address was that the capacity of the sewerage system in London was insufficient to cope with demand, resulting in the discharge of untreated sewage into the River Thames in breach of EU Directives.  One option was the construction of the Thames Tideway Tunnel to take the overload to a treatment plant.  The policy considered alternatives, but concluded that there was a national need for the construction of the tunnel, preferring it to various alternative strategies to tackle the problem which it specifically rejected.  On the DCO application, objections which sought to advance alternative solutions were disregarded under sections 87(3)(b), 94(8) and 106(1)(b).   </p>

Ouseley J held that that was unarguable.  It was “inevitable” that objections based on unspecified alternative schemes would be disregarded as challenging the merits of this particular NPS, which had rejected the alternatives (see [32]).  The judge held that alternative schemes could not be taken into account under section 104(3) because the NPS ruled them out in explicit terms; and they could not be considered under section 104(7) because that provision (a) was limited to the benefits and disbenefits of the proposed scheme and (b) could not be used to circumvent the effect of section 104(3) (see [37]-[43]).   </p>

Where alternatives have not been rejected in an NPS, section 104(7) still allows the striking of the planning balance against the development as an exception to the presumption created by sub-section (3) in favour of development proposed in the location preferred by the policy; and that allows objections on the basis that an alternative is preferable.  That is reinforced by section 104(9), and has been confirmed by <span style="text-decoration:underline">Scarisbrick</span>.

Indeed, like Sales LJ, we are reinforced in our view of the relationship between the NPS and DCO processes by the provisions of section 6 of the PA 2008.  National infrastructure projects often give rise to a host of issues and it is quite possible that relevant considerations will change or evolve after an NPS has been designated, particularly where long leadin times are involved.  For example, the science on climate change or risks to public health from pollution may change, along with solutions for addressing such matters.

This formulation clearly lays down the statutory principle that significant changes in circumstance affecting the basis for a policy in an NPS are to be taken into account if, after assessment, the relevant Secretary of State considers that the policy would have been materially different and only through the statutory process of review.  This principle accords with the statutory scheme under which, in sections 5 and 6, Parliament has placed the responsibility for setting national policy on infrastructure projects upon the Secretary of State, subject to complying with the publicity, consultation and parliamentary requirements laid down by the 2008 Act.  If he considers that the designated policy would not have been “materially different”, which is an essential test, then the national policy framework he has set, and to which section 104(3) applies in the DCO process, remains unchanged.  </p>

Instead, it forms part of the statutory definition of the contents of an NPS, which is the subject matter of this part of section 5.  The NPS must contain the Secretary of State’s policy on the development described (section 5(1)), which may include policies of the kind set out in section 5(5).  If an NPS sets out policy in relation to a particular description of development, it must also set out criteria for the design of that description of development (section 5(6)).  Still in the context of defining what an NPS must contain, section 5(7) requires that it must also give the Secretary of State’s reasons (i.e. rationale) for the policy.  In particular, those reasons must include “an explanation of how the policy in the statement takes account of Government policy relating to the mitigation of, and adaptation to, climate change” (section 5(8)).        </p>

However, even in the former case, the duty to give reasons does not require the decision-maker to refer to every relevant consideration which he has taken into account.  Generally, there is no obligation on a decision-maker to refer to every material consideration he has taken into consideration, because that would be “an unjustifiable burden” (see <span style="text-decoration:underline">South Bucks</span> at [34] per Lord Brown of Eaton-underHeywood, citing with approval <span style="text-decoration:underline">Bolton Metropolitan District Council v Secretary of</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">State for the Environment</span> (1995) 71 P&amp;CR 309 at pages 314-5 per Lord Lloyd of Berwick).  In <span style="text-decoration:underline">South Bucks</span> at [25] and [36], Lord Brown reiterated the point made by the House of Lords in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Westminster City Council v Great Portland Estates plc</span> [1985] AC 661, that reasons given for planning decisions can be “briefly stated”.  For example, in relation to the former duty of a local authority to give reasons for its decisions on an Inspector’s report on the inquiry held to consider objections to a draft local plan, the reasons given by Westminster City Council, which the House of Lords held to be legally adequate in that case, were indeed terse.  They responded to the Inspector’s criticisms of highly controversial policies restricting office development outside a “central activities zone” simply by saying “not accepted” and relying in effect upon the very paragraphs in the draft plan which had given rise to the objections (see pages 671G to 673G).  Because of this limited obligation in relation to the giving of reasons for a decision, there is only limited scope for the court to draw an inference that a relevant consideration not mentioned in a decision-maker’s express reasoning has not been taken into account.   </p>

In assessing what this requires, we consider the well-established approach to the statutory requirements for the structure and content of development plans to be instructive.   When taken together, the “local development documents” (i.e. development plans and supplementary planning documents) of a local planning authority must set out that authority’s policies relating to the development and use of land in their area (section 17(3) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).  In addition, regulation 8(2) of the Town and Country Planning (Local Planning) (England) Regulations 2012 (SI 2012 No 767) requires such documents to contain a “reasoned justification” of their policies.  The supporting rationale for the policies in a plan may also be used as an aid to the proper interpretation of those policies, so long as it is not used to contradict or “trump” the language used in those policies (<span style="text-decoration:underline">R (Cherkley Campaign Limited) v Mole Vale District Council</span> [2014] EWCA Civ 567 at [14]).

The inclusion of the policy-maker’s rationale for his policy in a draft NPS contributes to the provision of adequate information to enable consultees to make intelligent responses in the consultation exercise.  But that rationale should not be taken to represent the totality of the policy-maker’s reasons for putting forward the policy.  It is for the Secretary of State to make judgments about what matters to include in the NPS itself, and to what level of detail; and what material used to support those policies should be set out in other documents accompanying the draft NPS published for consultation (e.g. the AoS and any HRA).  In such a complex area as aviation infrastructure policy, plainly it would be impractical to include in the NPS, whether a draft or as finally designated, every matter relied upon by the policy-maker as a reason for his policy; and for the reasons we have given, it is unnecessary for the Secretary of State to give reasons for rejecting every point made in response to consultation.  </p>

The purpose of public consultation in that context is in my opinion not to ensure procedural fairness in the treatment of persons whose legally protected interests may be adversely affected, as the common law seeks to do.

In particular, he had not been obliged to explain why he had set the threshold at one level (ten units) rather than another in response to the representations received (three units).  It was unnecessary for him to descend to that level of particularity or to conduct detailed analysis of alternative options before him.  He was under no obligation to consult on every item of detail – or to consider and respond to every item of detail in the consultation responses (see [49] and [62]-[63]).

He treated the October 2016 Preference Decision as forming part of the process leading to the designation of the ANPS confirming the Government’s preferred location for the delivery of a new runway, which in due course was included in the ANPS.  Consequently, no challenge could be brought until the beginning of that six-week window in the event of the NPS being eventually designated; and the challenge in that case (which was brought before any designation) was struck out (see [73]). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Section 13(1) reinforces the point that Part 2 of the PA 2008 has created a process with a number of steps leading up to the designation of an NPS.  It is an iterative process, which in the case of the ANPS has engaged other procedures as well, notably under the SEA Directive and the Habitats Directive.  Section 13(1) protects that process against legal challenges until it culminates in the designation of an NPS.  It is implicit in the iterative nature of this procedure that, even if a legal error occurs at an early stage, it may be capable of being cured (and, in the event, in fact be cured) by corrective steps taken later on; or the defect may be rendered immaterial by the manner in which the policy-making subsequently proceeds (for example, by being based on different considerations which are not open to legal challenge) or by the way in which one of the participants brings an important aspect to the attention of the Secretary of State.  This aspect of the legislation can be seen in the iterative nature of environmental assessment under the SEA Directive discussed below and in the handling of issues under the Habitats Directive and the scope for amending a Habitats Regulations Assessment.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Pleming suggested that issues on standard of review affected only three of the grounds advanced by the Hillingdon Claimants, namely those expressly pleaded as irrationality challenges: Ground 2 (adoption of a mode share target not realistically capable of delivery), Ground 5 (selection of the NWR Scheme despite a high risk that obligations under the Air Quality Directive would be breached between 2026 and 2030) and Ground 7 (failure to set out the legal test used for compliance with the Air Quality Directive).  However, in our view, the question of the standard of review affects the issues they raise in respect of surface access and air quality generally.  Moreover, for reasons given below under Grounds 8 and 9, the standard of review also affects the approach which should be taken by the court to alleged breaches of the Habitats Directive and the SEA Directive. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Pleming explained that the effect of the errors of law advanced by the Hillingdon Claimants was that the Secretary of State wrongly preferred Heathrow (and, in particular, the NWR Scheme) to Gatwick as the location for the increase in airport capacity.  Plainly, therefore, the context for those challenges is a policy decision at a high strategic level engaging a range of political, economic, social and planning considerations, and involving Parliament, together with a large number of consultees </p>

The former each raised several grounds of challenge relating to climate change, in particular alleged legal errors arising out of the Paris Agreement.  These arguments are not directed at a choice between Heathrow or Gatwick or indeed other locations, but instead the principle of whether a substantial increase in airport capacity should be promoted.  As we explain below, the Paris Agreement raises a policy issue for the Government and for Parliament to address, namely the future carbon reduction target for the UK as its contribution to the revised Paris Agreement target expressed solely in global terms.  This is plainly a policy matter at a high strategic level, which engages the widest possible range of economic and social considerations in the UK.  Most of Mr Spurrier’s submissions involve challenges to the merits of judgments reached by the Secretary of State, and were dependent on him establishing <span style="text-decoration:underline">Wednesbury</span> unreasonableness.

A decision to construct a nationwide network of motorways is clearly one of government policy in the widest sense of the term.  Any proposal to alter it is appropriate to be the subject of debate in Parliament, not of separate investigations in each of scores of local inquiries before individual inspectors up and down the country upon whatever material happens to be presented to them at the particular inquiry over which they preside.

It affects particular local interests only and normally does not affect the interests of any wider section of the public, unless a suggested variation of the line would involve exorbitant expenditure of money raised by taxation.  It is an appropriate subject for full investigation at a local inquiry and is one on which the inspector by whom the investigation is to be conducted can form a judgment on which to base a recommendation which deserves to carry weight with the minister in reaching a final decision as to the line the motorway should follow.  </p>

Because of the time that must elapse between the preparation of any scheme and the completion of the stretch of motorway that it authorises, the department, in deciding in what order new stretches of the national network ought to be constructed, has adopted a uniform practice throughout the country of making a major factor in its decision the likelihood that there will be a traffic need for that particular stretch of motorway in 15 years from the date when the scheme was prepared.  This is known as the ‘design year’ of the scheme.  Priorities as between one stretch of motorway and another have got to be determined somehow.  Semasiologists may argue whether the adoption by the department of a uniform practice for doing this is most appropriately described as government policy or as something else.  But the propriety of adopting it is clearly a matter fit to be debated in a wider forum and with the assistance of a wider range of relevant material than any investigation at an individual local inquiry is likely to provide; and in that sense at least, which is the relevant sense for present purposes, its adoption forms part of government policy.” </p>

He rejected the claim.  An important theme in his reasoning was that the 2009 decisions of the Secretary of State were simply policy statements without direct, substantive effects: they were only preliminary steps in a continuing process which still had a long way to go before arriving at any “substantive event” in the sense of a formal statutory authorisation for the construction of a third runway.  He considered that that limited the scope for judicial review (see [48]).  This view formed a counterpart to the claimants’ concern in 2010 about the extent to which the 2009 decisions would have the effect of restricting the legal scope for making objections to a subsequent planning application.   </p>

The need for the court to give due weight to the considered assessment made by those institutions meant that it had to respect their view unless “manifestly without reasonable foundation”.

As we will explain below (see paragraphs 508 and following), a challenge of that nature must be considered in the context of the statutory framework in which the Secretary of State was operating, and the responsibilities placed upon him.

The court considered the approach to be taken in a judicial review of a decision that is predictive, in the sense that it is based upon an evaluation of assessments as to what might happen in the future and that evaluation is wholly or partly made by reference to scientific or technical material (see [7]).  It was common ground between the parties that an enhanced margin of appreciation should be accorded to decisions involving “scientific, technical and predictive assessments”, but the claimant unsuccessfully argued that that principle did not apply to the error which he purported to identify (see [69]). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.01in">“In the present case the decisions were based on three principal factors.  First, the agency’s assessment on the basis of the shortfall in egg deposition that the salmon fishery in the Wye is at risk of becoming unsustainable, which was not challenged.  Secondly, the views of the researchers and the agency, reflecting a broad scientific consensus, that salmon return to their rivers of origin to spawn.  Thirdly, the genetic data gathered from the 55 fish taken from the estuary and the ONCOR, GeneClass2 and cBayes models used in the Exeter report to estimate their rivers of origin.  The decisions were thus made against an unchallenged assessment as to the risk to the Wye and a background assumption on which there is scientific consensus that salmon return to their river of origin to spawn.  The decisions were then the result of an amalgam of assessments which are in part factual and in part predictive in nature.  They also involved consideration of other factors, such as how to balance the interests of those primarily affected with the wider public interest, and how factors such as the ‘heritage installation’ aspect should be factored into the decision and are in this sense ‘polycentric’.  I respectfully agree with the statement of Lightman J in [<span style="text-decoration:underline">Cellcom</span>] at [26] that ‘if . . . the court should be very slow to impugn decisions of fact made by an expert and experienced decision-maker, it must surely be even slower to impugn his educated prophecies and predictions for the future’”. </p>

At the other end of the spectrum, a proposal to locate airport expansion in a particular locality has very direct implications for the planning of that area and the environment of those living and working there.  Whereas the designation of the ANPS has settled the issues of need and the selection of the NWR to meet that need, the assessment of a specific proposal and the application of criteria laid down by the ANPS, legislation and other policies will be very much in contention through the DCO process. </p>

Examples of errors of this kind could include a misinterpretation of a provision in the PA 2008 governing the exercise of ministerial powers, a complete failure to satisfy a procedural requirement in the statute, or a complete failure to address a legally mandated matter.  But other grounds of challenge may relate to subjects which formed part of a mix of considerations in the development of policy in the ANPS.  Here, it may be helpful to consider where the target of the challenge lies on the policy “spectrum”: the “polycentric” question referred to in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Mott</span>.

The third condition was “the provision of adequate public transport”.  The fundamental question raised in the claim was the status and effect of that statement, the court deciding that it was no more than a policy statement without any direct substantive effect at that stage.  However, in respect of the third condition, Carnwath LJ concluded that it was impossible to determine precisely what the Secretary of State understood to be its scope; and it failed to make clear what he had made of detailed points raised by TfL.  He had simply referred to increased capacity as a result of Crossrail and improvements to the Piccadilly Line without dealing with TfL’s point that, for example, the increased capacity of the Piccadilly Line would have been exceeded by predicted growth in demand even in the absence of a third runway.   </p>

However, things have moved on since the 2009 policy statement.  The ANPS proceeds on the basis that the WRL and SRA (or equivalents) will be required even without expansion at Heathrow.  With mitigation, the Claimants’ own evidence is to the effect that the surface access requirements for 2030 as set out in the NPS can be achieved.  In any event, Carnwath LJ acknowledged (at [92]) that the challenged policy statement in 2009 had implicitly recognised that the surface access issue could only be resolved at a later stage “in the context of a detailed strategy prepared by the operator as part of the planning proposal, including a commitment to expenditure…”, i.e. at the DCO stage.

This identified the change since the Jacobs/AC analysis, namely that, due to pent up demand for Heathrow, even under the NWR Scheme, assuming no phasing of capacity and no barriers to airlines making use of this capacity as soon as it becomes available, Heathrow is now assumed to be capacity-full by 2028 rather than 2035 in the AC assessment – although by and from 2035 the met demand is estimated to be broadly similar to that relied on in the AC assessment (paragraphs 2.19-2.20).  In other words, there is now a higher rate of growth in demand than the AC had forecast: it is expected that a threerunway Heathrow will “fill up” more quickly than was assumed in the AC assessment.  However, as Mr Jones points out (Jones 2, paragraph 12), that does not fundamentally change the nature of the surface access challenge at Heathrow, which is concerned with ensuring the surface access objectives are met when the expanded Heathrow is at full capacity.  Mr Maurici accepted that the Secretary of State did not update the surface access analysis to reflect the updated passenger demand forecast: but submitted that that did not change the growth in passenger numbers, but only the period over which full capacity would be reached.  If unconstrained demand grows at a different rate from that assumed, then that can be managed by requiring mitigation measures to be taken sooner and/or phasing additional capacity by (e.g.) constraining ATMs.  That was Mr Jones’ view (Jones 1, paragraph 38).   </p>

It is article 23 of the Air Quality Directive that specifies the steps a Member State must take to achieve compliance with limit values.  A Member State’s failure to comply with the requirements in article 13 attracts the consequences explicitly provided for in article 23….  Article 23 does not require any steps beyond the preparation and implementation of an efficacious [AQP].  The effect of articles 13 and 23, read together, is that a Member State must meet the relevant limit values by the deadlines imposed…; that where article 13 is breached and no application has been made by the Member State to postpone the relevant deadline, article 23(1) requires it to establish an [AQP] complying with the specified requirements…; that a Member State enjoys some discretion in deciding on the content of an [AQP]…; that the measures included in the [AQP] must be proportionate [i.e. no more than necessary to remedy the continuing breach]…; that those measures must, however, ensure that the period for which the limit values is exceeded is as short as possible…; and that compliance with article 23 must be decided case by case….  The preparation of an [AQP] is the single prescribed means of addressing the breach.  But it does not follow that a breach of article 13 is automatically removed when an [AQP] is adopted.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.01in">33. Dove J’s description of article 23 as providing the ‘specific and bespoke remedy’ for a breach of article 13 therefore seems apt.  This does not mean that Member States may not also adopt other measures to address a breach of article 13, in addition to preparing and putting into effect an [AQP] complying with article 23.  But nor does it mean that Member States are compelled by any provision of the Air Quality Directive to do that.  A demonstrable breach of article 13 does not generate some unspecified obligation beyond the preparation and implementation of an [AQP] that complies with article 23.  The case law does not suggest, for example, that in such circumstances a Member State must ensure that land use planning powers and duties are exercised in a particular way – such as by imposing a moratorium on grants of planning permission for particular forms of development, or for development of a particular scale, whose effect might be to perpetuate or increase exceedances of limit values, or by ensuring that decisions on such proposals are taken only at ministerial level.” </p>

This report was based on the worst case scenario, in the sense that it proceeded on the basis of projections of future activity levels taken from demand forecasts that resulted in the greatest likely air quality impacts consistent with the promoter’s preferred business model (i.e. for the NWR Scheme, the carbon traded global growth scenario) as at 2030 (paragraph 3.5); but on the assumption that the WRL and the SRA would be implemented by then (paragraph 3.7.2). </p>

However, the scheme proposed the realignment of the Bath Road A4 link; and in any event there were mitigation measures that could be employed (paragraph 5.7.1).

We appreciate that that may make mitigation within the scope of any airport development scheme more challenging or less effective – but that is presumably why the WSP analyses (including the WSP October 2017 AQ Re-analysis) <span style="font-style:italic">did</span> take into account updated projections of passenger demand etc.  It is true that WSP did not re-model – it merely adjusted or scaled to take into account the new information and assumptions including passenger demand forecasts.  It is the evidence of Ursula Stevenson (who is employed by WSP, and leads for them on Environmental Assessment and Management Services) that that approach was appropriate and robust in the circumstances, particularly because the principal driver for the uncertainty and thus risk was not the airport expansion but the inherent uncertainty in the PCM modelling, and the scaling was conservative (Stevenson 1, paragraph 3.2; see also paragraph 3.6).

If it transpires over time that the AQP 2017 is not up to that task, then there is an obligation to vary it – in accordance with the procedure set out in the Directive – to ensure that it does.

In respect of the ANPS, given that the Gatwick 2R Scheme has been assessed as not fulfilling the hub policy objectives of the Government – and capacity objectives alone are insufficient to warrant the building of a second runway at Gatwick which would leave the requirement for hub capacity unfulfilled and possibly deepened – a policy to expand Heathrow, on terms which may be extremely challenging for applicants, is clearly not unlawful on grounds of irrationality.

That informed the Appraisal Framework which stated that specific outcomes of the “local assessment” were to quantify pollutant concentrations at locations “substantially affected by the Scheme” (recited in the Executive Summary of the Jacobs May 2015 AQ Local Assessment).  As paragraph 3.2 of the assessment makes clear, the “Principal Study Area” was selected on that basis.  It therefore complied with the Appraisal Framework, which was established only after considerable consultation – and in respect of which no complaint is made.   </p>

Although Mr Spurrier focuses upon the effects of pollutants from aircraft themselves, the AoS which accompanied the ANPS provided a high level assessment of the unmitigated air quality impacts and a qualitative assessment of health impacts of the NWR Scheme beyond the 2km radius but, as Ms Low explains (Low 1, paragraphs 421-425; and Low 2, paragraphs 8-37), more precise quantification could not be done at this stage because it would be dependent on matters which are uncertain at this stage.

If it is properly assessed as not qualifying as an “alternative solution” before an HRA has been conducted, it is not necessary for Habitats Directive purposes to consider that plan or scheme in any later HRA or otherwise at all.  It was also common ground that articles 6(3) and (4) involve an iterative process, certainly for policy-making as a plan proceeds from an initial draft through consultation to its finally adopted form; and, in that iterative process, something which is considered by the competent authority to be an “alternative solution” at one stage may, in the light of further information and/or assessment,  properly cease to be so regarded subsequently. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Second, and more importantly, it is necessary to have well in mind fundamental differences in the operation of the Habitats Directive and the SEA Directive.  Where a proposal (whether to adopt a policy or to grant consent for a project) adversely affects the integrity of a European site, the operation of article 6(3) and (4) of the Habitats Directive (and regulations 63 and 64 of the Habitats Regulations) determines the outcome of the process, according to the results of applying the tests laid down in those provisions.  It is therefore rightly said by Mr Jaffey that these provisions are <span style="font-style:italic">substantive </span>in nature, and not merely<span style="font-style:italic"> procedural</span>.  In our judgment, an option which does not meet a core objective of a policy should not be allowed to affect the application of article 6(4).  By contrast, the requirements of the SEA Directive for the content of an environmental report and for the assessment process which follows are entirely procedural in nature.  Thus, the requirement to address “reasonable alternatives” in the environmental report (or AoS under section 5(3) of the PA 2008) is intended to facilitate the consultation process under article 6 (and section 7 of the PA 2008).  The operator of Gatwick and other parties preferring expansion at that location would be expected to advance representations as to why the hub objective should have less weight than that attributed to it by the Secretary of State or that, contrary to his provisional view, the Gatwick 2R Scheme could satisfy that objective.  The outputs from that exercise are simply taken into account in the final decision-making on the adoption of a plan, but the SEA Directive does not mandate that those outputs determine the outcome of that process.  </p>

They include an obligation to determine whether there are any alternative solutions as at the date of his decision on the application for a DCO.   Accordingly, section 104(3) would not permit a Secretary of State to determine an application in accordance with a policy in an NPS which purports to preclude his consideration of representations made in the examination process and the conclusions of the Examining Panel on the existence of “alternative solutions”.

He will be obliged to do so in the circumstances and on the evidence before him as at the date of his determination of the application for development consent.  Plainly, a relevant and important consideration will be the ANPS.  The Secretary of State will be entitled to apply the objectives of the ANPS as stated in paragraph 1.32 (including the “hub objective”) to those circumstances and evidence, to determine whether any other options satisfy those objectives so as to qualify as “alternative solutions”.

It merely said that it would cause serious social, economic and environmental harm (see [28]-[33]).

In our view, like the other authorities to which we were referred, we do not consider that this case is of much assistance to us on this issue.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">However, we consider the correct approach to “alternative solution” in article 6(4) of the Habitats Directive is tolerably clear.  In respect of an NPS, a proposed option is not an “alternative solution” unless it meets the core policy objectives of the statement.  In this regard, Mr Jaffey’s concern that, at an early stage, objectives may be defined with deliberate narrowness so that potential alternatives are (he said) unreasonably or (we say) unlawfully excluded has some force; but the objectives must be both genuine and critical, i.e. objectives which, if not met, would mean that no policy support would be given to the development.  It would be clearly insufficient to exclude an option simply because, in the policy-maker’s view, another, preferred option meets the policy objectives to a greater extent and is on balance more attractive.  That would defeat the purpose of the Habitats Directive; and, as we have indicated, it was not the intention of the PA 2008 to defeat or otherwise adversely interfere with that purpose.  But the extent to which an option meets policy objectives is different from an option not meeting a core policy objective at all.  The <span style="text-decoration:underline">Castro Verde</span> case was an example of an authority seeking improperly to exclude an “alternative solution”, i.e. a road which connected the same start and finish points but, in doing so, did not go through an SPA.  That alternative met the core policy objective of a road joining the same two places: it was simply considered by the authority to have disbenefits. </p>

Although the legal test under each limb of article 6(3) is a demanding one, requiring a strict precautionary approach to be followed, it also clearly requires evaluative judgments to be made, having regard to many varied factors and considerations.  As Advocate General Kokott explained in paragraph 107 of her Opinion in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Waddenzee</span> [i.e. <span style="text-decoration:underline">Landelijke Vereniging to Behoud van de Waddenzee v</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">Staatsecretaris van Landbouw, Natuurbeheer en Visserij</span> (2005) Case C-127/02; [2005] 2 CMLR 31] the conclusion to be reached under an ‘appropriate assessment’ under the second limb of article 6(3) cannot realistically require the attainment of absolute certainty that there will be no adverse effects; the assessment required ‘is, of necessity, subjective in nature’.  The same is equally true of the assessment at the screening stage under the first limb of article 6(3).

This involves the provision of capacity for more long-haul flights (paragraphs 1.2 and 1.3 of the ANPS).  The AC Final Report confirmed the economic importance of the “hub objective”, and the need to increase capacity in order to reverse the decline in the UK’s hub status.  Reference was made to the current inability of London to develop long-haul links to new destinations, including those in emerging markets.  Demand for such routes was being met by increased services at hub facilities in Europe and the Middle East.  Capacity constraints affect not only passenger services but also the economically important freight sector.  These points were included in Chapter 2 of the February 2017 draft ANPS, as well as in the finally designated version.

However, as Mr Maurici pointed out, there are no legal challenges to the assessments and conclusions reached in paragraphs 3.18-3.19 (or, we would add, paragraphs 3.20-3.24) of the ANPS.  One of those conclusions was that the Gatwick 2R Scheme would not maintain but rather would <span style="font-style:italic">threaten</span> the UK’s global aviation hub status (paragraph 3.19).  This was entirely consistent with the AC’s Final Report (see paragraph 55 above).  Therefore, on the conclusions reached by the Secretary of State, this is not an issue about the <span style="font-style:italic">extent</span> to which the Gatwick 2R Scheme would meet the “hub objective”, which would be a matter of degree or relative attainment of that aim.  Rather, the Secretary of State has concluded that the scheme would not meet that policy objective at all.  That conclusion is not open to challenge by way of judicial review.  The Secretary of State was entitled to decide that a proposal that would threaten the “hub objective” is not an “alternative solution” for the purposes of the Habitats Directive.

Even if proportionality were involved, for the reasons we have given the Secretary of State would have a significant margin of appreciation; and the evidence was firmly against the Gatwick 2R Scheme being able to maintain the UK’s hub status function.</p>

Mr Maurici accepted that this procedural requirement did not in itself prevent the Gatwick 2R Scheme from being treated as an “alternative solution”, not least because it did not amount to a pre-condition that the Commission’s approval be obtained.  But as Mr Morrison said (Morrison 2, paragraph 2.12), even if an opinion had been sought in connection with the ANPS, there is no reason to think that it would have been favourable, because any such opinion would normally be linked to detailed conditions regarding compensatory schemes.  Mr Maurici rightly pointed out that the level of detail needed for this purpose would not exist until the production of detailed designs at the project stage.  Thus, the reference to the obtaining of an opinion from the Commission did not detract from the essential judgment that, on the information available at the stage of preparing the ANPS, and applying the required precautionary approach, the adverse impacts of the Gatwick 2R Scheme could not be discounted. </p>

Article 3(2) requires SEA generally for any plan or programme which is prepared for (inter alia) transport, town and country planning or land use and which sets the framework for future development consent for projects listed in Annexes I and II to the EIA Directive.   SEA is also required for other plans and programmes which are likely to have significant environmental effects (article 3(4)).  By virtue of sections 104 and 106 of the PA 2008, the ANPS designated under section 5 sets out the framework for decisions on whether a DCO for the development of an additional runway at Heathrow under Part 6 of that Act should be granted.  That development would, in due course, require environmental impact assessment (“EIA”) under the EIA Directive and Regulations; and there is no dispute that the ANPS required SEA under the SEA Directive.  </p>

He held that articles 4, 6(2) and 8 of the Directive, along with their transposition in the SEA Regulations, are consistent with that conclusion; and that none of the previous authorities on the SEA Directive (which he reviewed) suggested otherwise.  He held that SEA is not a single document, still less is it the same thing as the “environmental report”.  Rather, it is a process, during the course of which an environmental report must be produced (see [112]).

The challenge in that case related to policies in the local planning authority’s Core Strategy for an extension to the North East of Newmarket involving the building of 1,200 new homes as part of a mixed-use development.  The judge accepted that the SEA process may be iterative; and so an authority is entitled to reject alternatives at an early stage and, provided that there is no material change in circumstance, to decide that it is unnecessary to revisit those alternatives (see [16]).  But the complaint was that reasons had not been given when alternatives were rejected at an early stage and that, when the proposed extension had subsequently been increased from 500 to 1,000 and then to 1,200 homes for delivery over a much longer period of time, the requirement to assess reasonable alternatives had not been revisited.

In <span style="text-decoration:underline">Blewett,</span> the complaint was that the environmental statement for a proposed extension to a landfill site contained no assessment of the effect of the scheme on groundwater protection.  Instead, the minerals planning authority decided that that matter could be left to be assessed following the grant of planning permission, by assuming that complex mitigation measures would be successful.  Sullivan J held that the starting point was that it was for the local planning authority to decide whether the information supplied by the applicant was sufficient to meet the definition of an environmental statement in the EIA Regulations, subject to review on normal <span style="text-decoration:underline">Wednesbury</span> principles (see [32]-[33]).  Information capable of meeting the requirements in schedule 4 to the EIA Regulations should be provided (see [34]), but a failure to describe a likely significant effect on the environment does not result in the document submitted failing to qualify as an environmental statement or in the local planning authority lacking jurisdiction to determine the planning application. Instead, deficiencies in the environmental information provided may lead to the authority deciding to refuse permission, in the exercise of its judgment (see [40]).  Thus, the statement in [41], that the deficiencies must be such that the document could not <span style="font-style:italic">reasonably</span> be described as an environmental statement in accordance with the EIA Regulations, was in line with the judge’s earlier observations in [32]-[33].

In essence, the complaint was that, in breach of paragraphs (c) and (f) of Annex I, the AoS failed to assess the environmental characteristics of a substantial area of the extension, in that it had assumed that development there would have no effect on stone curlews (a European protected species) simply because it lay beyond a 1500m buffer zone designed to protect the SPA supporting that species (see [5] and [79]), and consequently had failed to take into account and assess evidence of stone curlews within that area and elsewhere (see [66] and [70]).  Beatson J reviewed the case law which we have already summarised (see [73]-[78]).  Having described the claimant’s criticisms of the appraisal as “highly detailed”, the judge concluded that the authority had not been required to provide a comprehensive assessment of all of the evidence of stone curlew activity in the area, and that, in substance, it had provided an environmental report in substantial compliance with the SEA Directive and Regulations (see [80]-[81]).

The SEA had identified alternatives to the settlement boundary and options for extending the town in different directions.  It had given reasons for rejecting alternatives.  The examiner had concluded that the SEA addressed environmental impacts at a level of detail appropriate to the contents of the plan.  Nevertheless, the claimant argued that the requirements of the SEA Directive had not been met because the assessment of alternatives had been vague and lacking in precision.  In particular, it was said that there was a lack of reasons to explain the drawing of the settlement boundary in certain locations and the non-allocation for housing of certain sites outside that boundary.  Lewis J held that it sufficed that the report had explained why expansion had been based on the existing form of the town and why expansion in other directions would result in greater environmental impacts (see [89]-[92]).  Accordingly, he concluded that a greater level of detail was not required.  The report had indeed addressed the subject which the SEA Directive required to be tackled, and criticisms made about the manner in which that exercise had been carried out or the level of detail in the report did not amount to a public law ground of challenge. </p>

Large parts of the extensive witness statements filed on their behalf contain detailed criticism of the AoS.  The Secretary of State responded in kind, in about 250 pages of witness statements.  There then followed further exchanges of witness statements in reply.  By that stage, the process had already become reminiscent of a planning inquiry.  More was to follow at the hearing, including five pages of tables on behalf of the Secretary of State giving dozens of references to the evidence, a response of similar magnitude on behalf of the Hillingdon Claimants, and even detailed written notes in reply.  </p>

As we have said, the SEA process is itself iterative, and may also form part of a larger iterative process.  Ms Stevenson explains how the AoS and SEA for the ANPS drew upon the vast amount of work which had already been carried out by or on behalf of the AC (Stevenson 1, paragraphs 2.1-2.24).  That included a quality assurance review of that material, and “gap analysis” to identify any further work required in order to comply with the SEA Directive.  One of the gaps identified was “establishing the relationship with the other plans, programmes and environmental objectives” (paragraph 2.7).  WSP relied upon a large team of independent environmental and planning specialists (paragraph 1.6).  Throughout the SEA process, inputs were provided by the Cross-Government Steering Group, which included representatives of Natural England and the Environment Agency (paragraph 2.25).  The SEA team checked the approach taken in the ANPS against AoSs produced for other NPSs, including those dealing with the delivery of site-specific infrastructure, so as to ensure consistency with existing good practice (paragraph 1.26).  A scoping exercise was carried out, which included consultation with the bodies identified under article 6(3).  It identified the information that would be relied upon in the AoS, including assessments carried out by the AC (e.g. on noise effects) and the appraisal methodology (paragraphs 2.27-2.30).  WSP also engaged ClearLead Consulting, which has considerable experience in SEA, to provide independent peer reviews of the work undertaken for the AoS (Transcript, Day 4 pages 178-179). </p>

It already faces great challenges in accommodating previously identified needs for additional housing and employment development.  It also has a serious shortage of public open space.  The NWR Scheme would have both direct and consequential impacts.  It would result in (e.g.) the direct loss of about 1,000 homes and areas of open space.  It would also generate a substantial increase in employment both on-site and off-site, and a consequential increase in the number of homes needing to be provided (together with educational and community facilities), and would consequently exacerbate the existing deficiencies in the provision of open space.  Mr Pleming referred to estimates that in the order of 114,000 new jobs would be created and between 42,400 and 69,300 additional homes would be required in the period up to 2030.  He relies on the more detailed explanation of such matters in the witness statements of Ian Thynne, a Specialist Team Leader at Hillingdon responsible for (amongst other things) SEA work.

The policy and environmental effects raised by the Hillingdon Claimant Boroughs were taken into account in the AoS, but without attributing those effects to individual local authority areas.

For example, the AoS states that the NWR Scheme is likely to generate a demand for 300 to 500 additional homes per local authority per year as well as support from additional schools, two additional health centres and two primary care centres per local authority to 2030.  The AoS makes the judgment that overall impacts on housing demand will affect local authorities across London and the South East and that the demand will spread and be low in comparison to existing planned housing.

He summarised the basis upon which the indicative flight paths had been drawn up.  In Lotinga 1, paragraph 3.3.15, he explained that three different flight path strategies had been examined.  One strategy, “Minimise New” was aimed at minimising the number of people nearby affected by aircraft noise, by concentrating flight paths over areas currently overflown.  Another, “Minimise Total” aimed to minimise the total number of people affected by noise by avoiding the overflying of the most populous areas and concentrating flight paths into “noise preferential routes”.  The third strategy was based on the maximisation of “respite periods”.  A comparison was made between the noise effects of the three strategies.  The “Minimise Total” strategy, which was adopted for the purposes of the AoS was found to be neither worst case nor best case, but lying between the other two.  The “Minimise New” strategy produced more overall harm. </p>

The court was referred to paragraph 3.9 of the DfT’s Air Aviation Guidance issued to the CAA Authority in October 2017, which states that at and above 4,000 feet, aircraft are unlikely to result in noise exposure above 51dB L<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">Aeq16hour</span> (i.e. a level lower than the 54dB L<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">Aeq16hour</span> parameter used in the AoS). </p>

He did not accept that the requirement of the SEA Directive to assess “likely significant effects” required the adoption of a more pessimistic strategy than the one selected.  He also explained why the Directive did not require a more detailed assessment focusing on individual communities in affected areas or on areas (not yet identified) likely to be significantly affected by growth in development (paragraphs 3.29 to 3.30).  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Stanbury sought to illustrate this approach by relying upon plans produced by HAL showing, he said, the maximum extent of a “lowest observed adverse effects level” (“LOAEL”).  This was chosen by HAL for the purposes of defining an area within which to carry out “enhanced consultation” (Stanbury, paragraph 13).  Mr Pleming relied upon (amongst other things) a document issued in January 2019 by HAL for initial consultation on Airspace and Future Operations entitled “Heathrow’s Airspace Envelopes for Expansion”.  He pointed to the fact that the plans in these documents cover a wider area than that shown on the indicative flight path plans used by the Defendant for the AoS.   However, in our view, it is important to note the explanation given in the document.  It shows “design envelopes for potential flight paths at an expanded Heathrow”; and that “a design envelope is a geographical area within which <span style="font-style:italic">it is technically feasible</span> to position one or more flight paths”.   The document makes it plain that “we will not spread flight paths across an entire envelope.  Your feedback will help us to determine the position of one or more flight paths within an envelope”.  In other words, this was one of the tools being used in a design process.  HAL had previously issued consultation material of a similar nature.  As Mr Humphries for HAL emphasised, these plans should not be taken to imply that the whole of the areas shown would be overflown by aircraft using Heathrow.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Pleming also sought to place much reliance upon a submission from officials to the Secretary of State dated 16 November 2017.  In paragraphs 10 and 11, it was noted that HAL was intending to notify individuals within a 51dB noise contour and to notify communities within areas which could be overflown by an aircraft flying at altitudes between 4,000 and 7,000ft about proposals to amend “airspace design” in response to the NWR Scheme.  The submissions noted that this approach was based upon CAA guidance on airspace design.  In paragraph 12, officials expressed the view that HAL was going much further than was required by CAA both as to content and timing of the consultation.  It was pointed out that consultation over such a wide area would involve people who are, and will be, affected by aircraft from other airports (paragraph 13).  The view of officials was that the approach taken by HAL would cause unnecessary controversy and opposition to schemes under consideration, because many of the people notified would not be affected by overflights (paragraph 21).  Read properly, as a whole and in context, this document does not provide any support for the contention that the AoS failed to comply with the SEA Directive.  </p>

The AoS Noise Appendix explains why it would not be appropriate at this stage of the process to assess absolute noise levels and associated local population exposure below 54dB LAeq, 16hr.  For practical reasons it becomes more difficult to estimate noise exposure accurately, and therefore population numbers affected, below this noise level.  This is because it is difficult to measure aircraft noise levels at greater distances from an airport where aircraft noise levels are closer to those of other noise sources.  Also, due to variability in aircraft position in the air at these greater distances from the airport, the absolute noise levels have a lower level of certainty. </p>

Consequently, the statutory scheme expects the Secretary of State to be prepared to promote his proposed policy in Parliament, an exercise involving political judgment.

The issue was whether he had genuinely considered the objections and the report (page 103).  It was also held that the term “bias” should be confined to the exercise of judicial or quasi-judicial functions, whereas the Minister had exercised an administrative function.  Having referred to authorities which lay down the principle that judicial decision-making must not be tainted by actual or apparent bias, Lord Thankerton reiterated that in the context of the Minister’s decision, “the only question is what the [Minister] actually did, that is, whether in fact he did genuinely consider the report and the objections” (page 104). </p>

They were not inconsistent with the Minister having an intention to carry out his duties under the 1946 Act properly.  Accordingly, the claimant had failed to establish that the Minister “had forejudged any genuine consideration of the objections or that he had not genuinely considered the objections at the later stages when they were submitted to him.” (page 105). </p>

For example, they may take part in debates which may lead to the council making planning applications to itself.  They may have a predisposition in favour of granting permission.  Given their role within local government, “clear pointers” are required before the court may draw an inference from the circumstances that they held a closed, or apparently closed, mind at the time of the decision (see [63]).  The fact that elections were imminent and that there was a risk of the majority party losing power was insufficient to justify such inference (see [64-65]).  The councillors’ constitutional position bore some similarities with that of ministers taking decisions on planning issues on which they have political views and policies (see [66]).  Councillors are elected to provide and pursue policies (see [69]).  Pill LJ warned that care is needed when applying the fair-minded or notional observer test to allegations of <span style="font-style:italic">apparent</span> predetermination, because there is a danger that the constitutional role of councillors may not be fully taken into account.

Democratically accountable decision-makers are not expected to be independent or impartial just as if they were judges or quasijudges.  They have political allegiances and their politics will involve policies.

Even when the draft ANPS was published in February 2017, the NWR Scheme was identified as the “preferred” scheme.  Although the ANPS explained why the expansion of Gatwick would not meet “the hub objective”, and why the NWR Scheme was also preferred as against the ENR Scheme at Heathrow, these views were, as the press statement had indicated, subject to consultation.  However, as we have explained above (see paragraphs 318-319), the consultation process left open the possibility of consultees (e.g. GAL) persuading the Secretary of State that either less importance should be given to the “hub objective” or that Gatwick could meet that objective.  In our view, the press statement does not indicate a closed mind or a real risk of a closed mind, whether read by itself or in conjunction with all the other material relied upon in support of this challenge.

In Baker 1, he sets out extracts from a leaflet, equivalent to only two sides of A4 paper, issued by the DfT in February 2017 at the beginning of the February 2017 Consultation process, entitled “Have Your Say” (referred to at paragraph 67 above).  He criticises this for failing to refer to potential disadvantages of the NWR Scheme or to alternatives, which was also reflected in the questions posed to members of the public.  The Hillingdon Claimants also rely upon a criticism made by Sir Jeremy Sullivan, the Independent Consultation Adviser, that the leaflet was a “hard sell” for Heathrow.  But it should be noted that Sir Jeremy concluded that, taken overall (and disregarding two “exceptions” which are irrelevant to the present issue), the consultation had been well-planned, well-executed and carried out to a high standard.  Indeed, Mr Baker very fairly refers to key parts of the main consultation documents published by the DfT and accepts that they do not suffer from the criticism he levels at “Have Your Say” (Baker 1, paragraphs 8-18). </p>

Given the difference of approach between that leaflet with its headline points, and the more detailed consultation materials to which Mr Baker referred, it is impossible to say that the leaflet could be taken to indicate predetermination of either kind.  Instead, it is wholly consistent with a strong predisposition in favour of the NWR, something which is not open to legal challenge.

In our judgment, there is no merit whatsoever in this point.  As we have explained above (see paragraphs 318-319), the decision to amend the HRA reflected a policy objective of successive Governments, which had been referred to in the February 2017 draft ANPS, namely to maintain the UK’s hub status.  That objective formed part of the proposed ANPS upon which consultation took place in 2017, and was entirely consistent with the Secretary of State’s policy pre-disposition.  It does not indicate a closed mind during the process leading up to designation, or any real risk of there having been a closed mind. </p>

However, as data continued to be collected, it was considered that that would be inadequate to address the problem.  Further discussions led to the Kyoto Protocol, an international treaty adopted on 11 December 1997 and entering into force on 16 February 2005, by which a number of state parties (including the UK and the EU) were committed to reducing emissions of six identified GHGs (including CO<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">2</span>) from the 1990 benchmark in the initial reduction period of 2008-12, each by an identified percentage, that for the UK being 12.5%.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The UK appreciated the desirability of tackling climate change, and wished to take a more rigorous domestic line.  In the 2003 White Paper, “Our Energy Future – Creating a Low Carbon Economy”, the Government committed to reduce CO<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">2</span> emissions by 60% on 1990 levels by 2050; and to achieve “real progress” by 2020 (which equated to reductions of 26-32%).  The 60% figure emanated from the EU Council of Ministers’ “Community Strategy on Climate Change” in 1996, which determined to limit emissions to 550 parts per million (ppm) on the basis that to do so would restrict the rise in global temperatures to 2ºC above pre-industrial levels which, it was then considered, would avoid the serious consequences of global warming.  However, by 2005, there was scientific evidence that restricting emissions to 550ppm would be unlikely to be effective in keeping the rise to 2ºC; and only stabilising CO<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">2 </span>emissions at something below 450ppm would be likely to achieve that result.   </p>

The CCC has advised that, to meet the 2050 target on that basis, emissions from UK aviation (domestic and international) in 2050 should be no higher than 2005 levels, i.e. 37.5 megatons (million tonnes) of CO<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">2</span> (MtCO<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">2</span>).  This is referred to by the Claimants as “the Aviation Target”.  However, the APF explains that the Government decided not to take a decision on whether to include international aviation emissions in its carbon budgets, simply leaving sufficient headroom in those budgets consistent with meeting the 2050 target including such emissions, but otherwise deferring a decision for consideration as part of the emerging Aviation Strategy.  The Aviation Strategy is due to “re-examine how the aviation sector can best contribute its fair share to emissions reductions at both UK and global level” (paragraph 9 of the Climate Change Annex to the Agreed Statement).  It is due to be finalised and adopted later this year.  </p>

It expresses global objectives, and aspirations in respect of national contributions to meet those objectives; and it obliges each state party to “prepare, communicate and maintain successive nationally determined contributions that it intends to achieve”.  Parties are required to pursue domestic mitigation measures, with the aim of achieving the objectives; and ensure they meet the requirement for successive nationally determined contributions to be progressive (article 4).  But it clearly recognises that the action to be taken in terms of contributions to the global carbon reduction will be nationally determined “in the light of different national circumstances” (article 2(2)); and that, in that determination of national contributions, economic and social (as well as purely environmental) factors and the consideration of how other states are proposing to contribute will or may play a proper part.

As we have explained, the assessment of any change to the target – in terms of percentage and/or date – is a matter for political judgment, taking into consideration not only the evolving information and analysis in respect of climate change, but also the economic and social consequences of any change, and the position in other states with regard to proposals for their own, national actions to reduce the carbon burden.   </p>

The fact that it (and not the Paris temperature limit) was treated as policy and a relevant consideration is clear from (e.g.) Graham, paragraph 124, where it is said that the Aviation Target was not a constraint because “all emissions are assumed to be captured within a carbon market that allows total global carbon emissions consistent with a <span style="font-style:italic">2 degree climate stabilisation target</span>” (emphasis added).

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The UK policy in this regard, now and at all relevant times, is and has been based on a national carbon cap.  The cap is as set out the CCA 2008.  It is based upon the 2ºC temperature limit.  For the reasons we have given, that policy is “entrenched” and can only be changed through the statutory process.  Despite the fact that Government policy could of course be outside any statutory provisions – and despite Mr Crosland’s submissions that that, in some way, the CCA 2008 cap has to be read with the Paris Agreement (see, e.g., Transcript, day 7 pages 112 and 116) – neither policy nor international agreement can override a statute.  Neither Government policy (in whatever form) nor the Paris Agreement can override or undermine the policy as set out in the CCA 2008.  In our view, this way of putting the submission is inconsistent with Mr Crosland’s express and unequivocal concession that the carbon target in the CCA 2008 <span style="font-style:italic">is</span> Government policy and <span style="font-style:italic">was</span> a material consideration for the purposes of the ANPS.

The former of course inherently requires a national cap; but even under the latter the Government would have to come to a view on the level of UK carbon emissions that would be compatible with the carbon trading system in which it had engaged.  The terms of paragraph 5.82 of the ANPS (see paragraph 598 above) are wide enough to ensure that a DCO would be refused if the carbon emissions from the proposed specific development had a material impact on the ability of the Government to meet “carbon reduction targets” set in the context of a carbon trading scenario. </p>

However, we should say that it seems to us inherently unlikely that the UK would enter into a system of permits and credits that was more constraining for the UK than a carbon cap.  It has not been explained how a change in global aspirations changes the viability of a plan under a permits/credits system which is designed to give more (not less) flexibility than simple capping; but, in any event, it seems inconceivable that a plan which is viable under a simple national carbon capping system would not be viable under a carbon trading system.

The ANPS makes clear that, like the AC and the CCC, the Secretary of State has assessed that the scheme is compatible with that target in the sense that it is capable of being delivered (constructed and operated) within the UK’s climate change obligations.  That is all that a policy such as the ANPS could – and certainly, purported – to do.  It makes clear that it is for any DCO applicant to demonstrate that the scheme as brought forward can and will be delivered within those obligations; and that any increase in carbon emissions will have no material impact on the ability of the Government to meet its carbon reduction targets.  Whether a particular scheme will be so delivered is not a matter which could be considered at the ANPS stage: it is dependent upon design features including mitigation which can only be developed at the DCO stage.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.90in;margin-right:0.00in">Finally, Mr Wolfe submitted that the phrase “material impact on the ability of the Government to meet its carbon reduction targets” is ambiguous.  We have already considered the meaning of “carbon reduction targets”, and found that phrase to be clear.  This sub-ground focused on “material impact”.  Mr Wolfe submitted that, as a matter of law, “material” may mean “more than trivial” or “substantial” or may have some other shade of meaning; and paragraph 5.82 was unclear because it did not set out its precise meaning.  However, we are unpersuaded.  As we have explained, such close textual examination is inappropriate for policy documents such as the ANPS.  In our view, the phrase “material impact” is a good example of “fact and degree” language in a policy document which cannot be divorced from, or sensibly interpreted by the court in advance of, the factfinding exercise which (in this case) will have to be carried out by the Examining Panel and the Secretary of State on a DCO application.  The same formulation as used in paragraph 5.82 appears to have been used in closely similar contexts, such as paragraph 5.18 of the NPS for National Networks which applies to road schemes and which was designated under the PA 2008 in December 2014.  It appears to have been applied in that context since then, without difficulty.  We do not accept that paragraph 5.82 of the ANPS is unlawful for want of reasons under section 5(7) and (8) as a result of the use of that phrase. </p>

First, he submitted that, properly construed, the PA 2008 requires the Secretary of State to ignore international commitments except where they are expressly referred to in the Act, e.g. in section 104(4) which exonerates the Secretary of State from deciding a DCO application in accordance with a relevant NPS if he is satisfied that deciding it thus “would lead to the United Kingdom being in breach of any of its international obligations”.  Alternatively, he submitted that, even if he was not obliged to ignore such commitments, the Secretary of State had a discretion as to whether to do so and was not obliged to take them into account.

International obligations and evolving science may be reflected in those other policies, as well as in the CCA 2008.  Of course, policy cannot be inconsistent with legislation; but, as long as these other policies are not inconsistent with the statutory restrictions, they may equally be “Government policy”.

Hansard demonstrates that sections 5(8) and 10(3) were not in the version of the Planning Bill that was introduced into the House of Commons, but they were introduced at the same time by way of Government amendment in the House of Lords, in response to members of both Houses who wished to see a more specific requirement that climate change and reduction targets set in the CCA 2008 be considered when NPSs were drawn up.  The amendments were originally resisted because the Government thought that clauses 9(1)-(2) (now section 10(1)-(2)) would in any event encompass climate change issues, those issues being an integral part of the sustainability issue.  The amendments were made to “clarify” or make “explicit” that the section 5(7) and 10(1)(2) duties encompassed climate change issues.  In our view, Hansard merely confirms the obvious construction that we have placed on the provisions in any event. </p>

As we have described, if scientific circumstances change, it is open to him to review the ANPS; and, in any event, at the DCO stage this issue will be re-visited on the basis of the then up to date scientific position. </p>

Assuming for the purposes of this ground that the relevant provisions of the ECHR are engaged and there are potential identified “victims”, neither article 8 nor A1P1 confer absolute rights.  For example, article 8 allows interference with the right to respect for private life if that interference is “necessary in a democratic society in the interests of… the economic well-being of the country”.  A1P1 allows interference with the entitlement to the peaceful enjoyment of possessions “in the public interest”; and there is express provision that the entitlement “shall not… in any way impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest…”.   </p>

The ANPS involves, at a very high level, the weighing of the very substantial local, regional and national economic interest in the expansion of airport capacity by way of the NWR Scheme against (amongst other things) the rights and entitlements of the many residents around Heathrow who will potentially be adversely affected by the scheme.  Particularly given that the rights and interests of those residents will be at the forefront of the planning consideration of the scheme at the DCO stage – and given the scope of section 104 (see paragraph 37 above) – it is simply not arguable that, in designating the ANPS, the Secretary of State breached either article 8 or A1P1. </p>
