	    <p style="margin-left:0.58in;margin-right:0.05in">The RNW policy affects all persons liable to removal under the three main immigration statutes.  The main focus of the present challenge is the adequacy of the notice period which precedes the opening of the “removal window” – during which period the individual may not be removed.  This is 72 hours in detained cases (which includes at least 2 working days), 5 working days in ‘Dublin III’ transfer and non-suspensive appeal cases, and 7 calendar days in non-detained cases.  The Claimant argues that the 72-hour notice period, as well as the longer notice periods applicable in Dublin III transfer cases and in non-detained cases, are each inadequate on the basis that it is “<span style="font-style:italic">impossible</span>” for individuals and/or their advisors to carry out the necessary work to be able properly to challenge removal before the expiry of the relevant notice period. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.58in;margin-right:0.05in">The challenge to the adequacy of the notice periods is then set against the fact that (since 2015) the Policy operates by bringing forward the notice period to the time when the individual is notified of his or her liability to removal.  Upon the expiry of the notice period, the removal window (of 3 months or 21 days) is then opened during which time the individual may be removed without further notice.  This is contrasted with the “practical consequences” of the prior position when notice was given only once a decision to set removal directions had been taken: see Grounds of Claim, at [15].  A particular complaint is that the policy gives the SSHD a lengthy window in which, after the expiry of a short opportunity to identify any new ground for being able to stay here, such persons can be removed without any further warning at all. </p>

There was an intervention in that case, by PLP appearing as interveners, and not as solicitors, instructed by the applicants: the applicants were represented by Duncan Lewis Solicitors.  The challenge was both in respect of the alleged inadequacy of the 72hour and other notice periods and also as to a system that does not provide a notice of the actual removal, and is confined to notice of liability for removal.  It concentrated on what is Grounds 1 in the instant public interest challenge: it did not raise a Dublin III challenge.    It held that the immediate predecessor (version 15.0 which came into force on 21 May 2018) to the current RNW policy was, as a general matter, compatible with access to justice. An appeal against that decision is due to be heard by the Court of Appeal on 1516 October 2019, permission to appeal having been given by the Upper Tribunal.  It is submitted by SSHD that (a) the decision is correct; (b), in any event, it is a decision of a court of co-ordinate jurisdiction which should be followed by this Court unless there is a powerful reason for departing from it, and (c) there is no reason for departing from <span style="font-style:italic">FB</span>.   </p>

He quoted from a letter of Ms Lin Homer, the Chief Executive of UKBA in relation to the 72-hour time frame, that “<span style="font-style:italic">in setting the revised minimum time frames for notification of removal we have had to balance the need to ensure proper access to court with the public interest in establishing a robust removal process that makes sufficient use of limited detention facilities</span>”. Thus, the 72-hour period was considered to be the "<span style="font-style:italic">minimum time frame</span>" to preserve the right of access to justice and it was presumed that this would safeguard the right of those served with removal directions to have access to justice.  Nonetheless, the Court stated at [32] that the fact that there was no challenge to the 72-hour policy did not mean that its lawfulness was conceded, albeit that at [172] quoted below, it was stated that the judgment did not cast doubt on the minimum 72-hour frame.</p>

Unfortunately, the 2010 exceptions do not take account of “the need to ensure proper access to the courts” as they permit the Secretary of State to depart from the standard policy of giving a minimum of 72 hours' notice of removal including at least two working days with the last 24 hours being on a working day. The effect of the 2010 exceptions is that in practice in the limited time available between serving the removal directions and the actual removal, it is frequently almost impossible that somebody served with removal directions will be able to find a lawyer who would be ready, willing and able to provide legal advice within the time available prior to removal let alone in an appropriate case to challenge those removal directions. There is a very high risk if not an inevitability that the right of access to justice is being and will be infringed. Miss Rose suggested that the Secretary of State could have provided at her expense an independent lawyer to advise those served with abridged notice. </span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic"> There are instances which are set out in paragraphs 108 and 109 above and which show how the policy functions and how it could preclude those served with short notice from enjoying the basic right of access to justice. This means the policy in the 2010 exceptions and which is contained in Section 3 of the 2010 policy document, which was suspended as a result of an interim judgment by Cranston J, has to be quashed. I should record that I considered the possibility that I should not quash the policy but that instead should merely await challenges in individual cases but that is not appropriate because in many cases where access to justice is not available to those served with abridged notice pursuant to the 2010 exceptions, they will be deported and will be unable to pursue their claim from abroad. There are also, as I have explained other grounds for quashing parts of the policy in Section 3 of the 2010 document. Finally, I should stress that nothing in this judgment casts any doubt on the legality of the minimum 72-hour time frame and the effect of this quashing order is that those covered by the 2010 exceptions now fall within that time frame.” </span>

The current process for enforcing removal can be complex, with a series of decisions having to be made in order to end the migrant’s leave and make a separate removal decision, with a further decision to set removal directions at a later date. This complexity creates an unnecessarily bureaucratic process for caseworkers and enforcement officers and leads to delays in enforcing immigration laws as the three stages attract a separate right of appeal, an opportunity for legal challenge or both.  </span></p>

	      <span style="font-style:italic">To rectify this we propose to change the primary legislation so that there will only be one decision which covers a refusal of leave (or decision to curtail leave) and all aspects of the removal process. The decision will explain to the person that they cannot stay in the UK, are liable to removal if they do not leave voluntarily and will have no further notice before it happens.  </span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic">We recognise that a proportion of cases may have genuine reasons which mean that removal is not appropriate. The single decision will also advise the migrant that they must tell us immediately of any reasons why they should not be removed, e.g. on the grounds of an asylum or human rights claim. Reducing the process to a single decision and placing the onus on the individual to raise any human rights issues means that migrants will not be left in limbo and must take active steps to regularise their stay or depart. Bringing human rights challenges forward will help ensure that any issues are addressed before enforcement action commences.  </span>

The respondent had previously entered into an arrangement with the High Court – known as the “Concordat” – which was intended to avoid the need for last minute injunctions.  The respondent would agree to defer removal on threat of a judicial review, working on the assumption that such challenges were arguable ones that needed to be examined.  The result, however, was that it was necessary to release from detention those threatening judicial review, since their claims took so long to resolve.  It became apparent to the respondent that some detainees were threatening judicial review “simply to get out of detention, and in most instances the threatened JR was never lodged”.  </span>

Subsequently, further exceptions were added.  However, in 2010, the Medical Justice litigation concluded that “a reasonable period between arrest and removal was required for those subject to removal to access legal advice”.  Following subsequent discussions with the judiciary, the respondent amended the Operational Guidance “to say that 72 hours must always be provided between an individual being served immigration papers and the actual removal of the offender” and that the period started when “removal directions” were served.   </span>

If raised, the SSHD will then give consideration to any reasons as to why the person should not be removed.  Section 120 of the 2002 Act was amended by the 2014 Act to make the duty to raise any additional grounds an ongoing duty which subsisted for so long as the person remained in the UK, thereby requiring them to raise any grounds as soon as reasonably practicable after any change of circumstances giving rise to such grounds.  A failure to raise any such grounds as soon as reasonably practicable after they arose could give rise to certification under s.96 of the 2002 Act of any subsequent claim relying on those grounds.  One of the requirements before certification is that in the opinion of the SSHD or the Immigration Officer there must be no satisfactory reason for the ground not having been raised in a statement under s.120 of the Act. Such certification is subject to judicial review: see <span style="font-style:italic">J v SSHD</span> [2009] EWHC 705 at [138]. </p>

This is entirely theoretical: it is not explained how this could be done consistently with the exercise of powers in good faith and exercised for proper purposes under the policy.  </p>

The policy position underpinning the 72-hour policy was recognised by Silber J in the 2010 Medical Justice case<span style="font-style:italic">, </span>at [42], where he observed that <span style="font-style:italic">“the 72 period was considered to be “the minimum time frame” to preserve the right of access to justice and it was presumed that this would safeguard the right of those served with removal directions to have access to justice.” </span></p>

	      <span style="font-style:italic">   “Medical Justice continues to be concerned that Chapter 60 significantly limits access to justice in that “even though detainees receive notice of the start of their removal window, reminding them to submit any challenge to the decision to remove them from the UK in the time before the beginning of the removal window, in practice this was often not possible, particularly in the large number of cases when only 72 hours is given”.  Prioritising clients within removal windows is, she says, difficult: “We are simply not able to prioritise the most urgent cases and in most cases are unable to secure legal representation before the start of a removal window.  Many clients are not then removed during the early part of their removal window or at all.  But some are removed before they are able to access legal advice”.   </span>

Concerns are expressed that the 30-minute appointments of each detainee are too short for their cases to be fully investigated. Further, a maximum of 10 clients can attend the DDA surgery on any one day. Further, under the new contraction from September 2018, 74 firms have been on the DDA surgery rota thereby “<span style="font-style:italic">greatly restricting the ability of each individual firm to be able to assist.” </span></p>

He was seen at a legal advice surgery by a representative of Wilson LLP on 11 June 2018 (this being the first opportunity for the appointment to take place) and on 14 June 2018 a pre-action protocol letter was sent.

The SSHD subsequently assessed EAA as an “Adult at Risk” and therefore he was given a limited notice of removal window with a new notice perio.d.  Criticisms were also made about the Third Country Unit’s failure to disclose specific documents subsequently served, but Wilson LLP could and did obtain legal redress in respect of this before the opening of the second window for his removal.

It is said that it was a matter of luck that she was not removed.  In fact, this case study pre-dates the amendments made to JRI in May 2018 as a result of which it became possible individual cases such as this to extend the period up to the removal window, which would have ended this possibility pursuant to RED.0006.   </p>

For reasons which are unclear, it is said that his previous solicitors notified XY of their intention to cease to act for him on 26 April 2018, six days before his oral permission hearing.  By a judgment of 27 November 2017, the Court of Appeal had dismissed the appeals against certifications of the asylum claims as clearly unfounded in HK.  On 2 May 2018 the Upper Tribunal duly refused XY permission to proceed, the ground pursued having become unarguable.  </p>

It was relied on by the SSHD as providing a discretion of deferral, but the Claimant said that it could not rescue a fundamentally unlawful policy [22].  The Court did take it into account, but was critical of the terminology, since there was imprecision as to what was being deferred, the notice period or the commencement of the removal window.  It seemed to be the latter, but the heading did not say that, and it was important for this to be clarified so as to avoid confusion not least to applicants for deferral.  It would also not be clear whether the deferral would eat into the removal window [204].

	    <p style="margin-left:0.58in;margin-right:0.05in">The provision of this information has been in contrast to the refusal to answer the questions of the Law Society.  It has provided a considerable amount of information both as to the impact of the RNW policy and as to specific case information in addition to the specific case studies which were in the evidence before Walker J in March 2019.  Some of the force of the points about absence of monitoring has been reduced by the information which has been provided.  However, it is still regrettable that there was not an earlier engagement with the information sought by the Law Society.  The information which was provided in May 2019 was only shortly before the hearing, some just over a month before the hearing and some less than three weeks before the hearing.  The effect has been that the information has come before the Court through late evidence, annexes and skeleton arguments, some even after the hearing itself.  This has caused difficulties for the parties and for the Court.  It has included supplemental skeleton arguments with the Court’s permission even after the hearing.  It is probable that some of these difficulties would have been averted or alleviated if the monitoring referred to by Mr Pompa had started earlier and been shared, and if the SSHD had engaged earlier with the information sought.  It is also regrettable that the SSHD did not provide the information which it did provide in witness statement form and it would have been more helpful if it had considered more evidence in response to the evidence filed by the Claimant.  Nevertheless, entirely responsibly, the Court was not asked to exclude altogether the more informal way in which the SSHD adduced this information, but to give to it less weight than evidence.  This judgment now considers the information which has been provided.    </p>

The SSHD is unable to break down these figures by reason prior to December 2018. However, since December 2018, of 15 requests which related to access to legal advice, 10 were rejected.  This does not prove that deferrals are being refused thereby causing a denial of access to justice.  Further, it is apparent from the much fuller information since December 2018 provided through the further information of the end of May 2019 and the documents provided on disclosure that the Claimant is able to obtain information relating to deferral cases.  </p>

This person absconded until encountered on 12 June 2018 when served with a 72 hours’ notice of removal, not to take place before 19.30 hours on 15 June 2018. Submissions were only advanced on 16 June 2018 but no explanation is provided as to why this did not happen earlier. The submissions were refused on 17 June 2018. On that date, there was a request for the removal window to be reset but that was refused. Fresh representations were refused on the same date. Further submissions were advanced on 18 June 2018 but they were refused on the same date. This case is said by the Claimant to amount to a clear illustration of the inadequacy of the safeguard of the power in extension in practice.  However, this is a case where there is no explanation as to why the submission was not within the notice period, and where there have been repeated representations with no explanation as to why they could not have been made earlier.

The NRW was served on 5 June 2018. The removal window opened on 8 June 2018. A request for the removal window to be reset was sent on 17 June 2018. The request was refused, absent any explanation why the applicant had decided to change legal representatives at that stage, nor why the documentation requested could not be provided by his previous representatives. They were also rejected as not crossing the fresh claims threshold and appearing to be an attempt to frustrate removal at the last minute. Multiple further representations were made on 18 June 2018 and refused on the same day. The request for the deferral was not made until after the expiry of the notice period and there is no explanation why this is the case. Removal took place on 19 June 2018. On 1 September 2018 using a forged identity card from Cyprus this person sought entry at Edinburgh Airport but was refused and removed to Italy on 6 September 2018.

Further submissions were advanced on 28 July 2018 and rejected on the next day. Further representations were made on 30 July 2018 and rejected on the same day. The removal did not proceed on 31 July 2018 (apparently because of disruptive conduct). New solicitors were instructed on 4 August 2018 and further submissions were made on 13 August 2018 which were rejected for want of supporting evidence concerning family life on 14 August 2018.  By an email of 21.52 hours, the SSHD was advised that the applicant had instructed solicitors to initiate judicial review proceedings. It was not accepted that there was a good ground for not instituting these in the month since the rejection on 30 July 2018. The removal took place on 15 August 2018. The comment of the SSHD is that the interval between the NRW on 30 June 2018 and the removal on 15 August 2018 was over six weeks, during which time there was representation by two different sets of solicitors. There is no evidence of a denial of an opportunity to an access to justice.

That is the case of the highlighted cases, and in respect of the other cases too, no denial of access to justice has been established.  It has been informative to set out the cases in some detail showing a history often of appeal rights having been exhausted sometimes shortly before the notice being served of the RNW: in other cases, the persons have had previous legal representatives, where there is no information other than anecdotal to explain why they would not be able to assist.

It is a question of understanding what access to justice means.  It does not mean that the Courts can be accessed at any time and without any restriction.  Hence, the Upper Tribunal referred to the restriction of limitation periods and time limits, provided that they are reasonably necessary in the circumstances of each case: for a case where they were unduly restrictive, see <span style="font-style:italic">(Detention Action) v First-Tier Tribunal</span> [2015] EWCA Civ 840 [2015] 1 WLR 5341 at [27].  Similarly, the Upper Tribunal rightly referred to the ability to access the Courts diminishing progressively and eventually disappearing. Were it not so, removal could never be effected.

While a private solicitor acts in the interest of his client (subject to an overriding duty to the Court), the public interest in the present context requires striking a fair balance between giving migrants a fair opportunity to put forward their grounds for remaining in the UK, and the maintenance of immigration control.  The latter cannot be dismissed as an irrelevant consideration.  The Immigration Acts represent Parliament’s expression of will in this area, and that includes mechanisms for the maintenance and enforcement of immigration control.  Parliament has entrusted that control, and the setting of policy to support it, to the SSHD, who is accountable to Parliament.  Access to justice is not a one-sided matter of giving a “<span style="font-style:italic">guarantee</span>” to migrants, whatever the consequences for immigration control.

There are pragmatic reasons requiring that there should not be two challenges, that is to say reducing the scope for last minute applications, which can be so disruptive.  The RNW policy is not a bar to access to justice, but a rational attempt to bring forward the notice period to the section 10 decision so that in most cases where there is no subsequent fresh claim, any challenge takes place at that time and not when the removal is about to take place.</p>

The force of any challenge as to the period of notice is to be seen against the background of more than a decade of the 72-hour policy.  Since the 72-hour period was started in about 2007, there has not been any challenge about the same.  <span style="font-style:italic">The 2010 Medical Justice case</span> was by reference to exceptions to the 72-hour policy and not the 72-hour policy.  Whilst that was not an admission that the 72-hour policy was lawful, the combination of absence of challenge then or at any time prior to the <span style="font-style:italic">FB</span> case is, as was stated in <span style="font-style:italic">FB</span>, of some relevance [170]. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.58in;margin-right:0.05in">As regards the points made about legal aid that were before the Court in <span style="font-style:italic">FB</span>, it might be said that there is more detailed evidence in the statement of Ms Francis as well as evidence of solicitors about their experience in respect of legal aid.  However, in my judgment, the greater volume of evidence does not affect the fact that the substance of the points was made.  I agree with the points of the Upper Tribunal at [172-173] that to a very significant extent, the position regarding legal aid lie outside the remit of the proceedings in <span style="font-style:italic">FB</span>, as they do in respect of the current claim.  Navarette WS2 [12] makes a point about a very significant increase in the number of legal aid providers with effect from September 2019 (presumed to mean September 2018), thereby reducing the slots available to Wilson Solicitors LLP.  Whilst that affects the ability of a client to become a client of Wilsons, it does not affect the number of slots afforded to solicitors, and therefore does not affect access to justice overall.  Further, as noted in <span style="font-style:italic">FB</span>, the lack of availability has not meant that individuals facing removal are not able to engage a lawyer in that many have been able to secure legal advice.  The questions raised as to the level of competence of lawyers is not part of the right of access to justice as discussed at [173].</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.58in;margin-right:0.05in">This Court also echoes the point of the Upper Tribunal about the absence of co-relation between the evidence and a longer period than 3 days.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.58in;margin-right:0.05in">The reason for short periods of notice is, as recognised in <span style="font-style:italic">FB</span>, because of the context.  Many of the cases are of individuals whose appeal rights have been exhausted.  A striking deficiency in the evidence before this Court has been the absence of evidence, other than uncorroborated anecdotal evidence, of the representation which applicants have enjoyed before the NRW, and why previous representatives cannot be expected to assist: see the Upper Tribunal’s remarks at [176-178].  This is demonstrated in respect of NR (an applicant with <span style="font-style:italic">FB</span> in the <span style="font-style:italic">FB</span> case) where he had the benefit of legal assistance from a number of firms, but a move to Duncan Lewis was not explained, and allegations made about shoddy work were, according to the experience of the President and the Upper Tribunal judge at [184] <span style="font-style:italic">“easily and often made in this jurisdiction and there is no evidence that the firm in question has been given an opportunity to respond.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.58in;margin-right:0.05in">The Claimant says that caseworker error is not an answer because the action may be unlawful if the caseworker does not follow the policy.  A failure of a caseworker in  cases might have been capable of giving rise to a challenge of that case (which this case is not about), but not to the policy as a whole, unless they evidence a risk of unfairness which inheres in the system itself.  Within reason, there will always be caseworker errors.  Examples of such errors comprise failing to give adequate disclosure or in failing to give the requisite notice or in failing to extend time in answer to a request.  However, criticisms of caseworkers in a small number of cases do not show that there is something wrong about the policy as a whole.  This is established from caselaw, and recently in the case of <span style="font-style:italic">BF (Eritrea) v Home Secretary</span> [2019] EWCA 872 at [63] cited above that individual mistakes or misjudgements made in the pursuit of a proper policy do not render the policy unlawful, unless the terms of the policy themselves create a risk which could be avoided if they were better formulated.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.58in;margin-right:0.05in">The Claimant and the Intervener criticise the JRI for its giving caseworkers ‘discretion’ on a number of matters.  But it is difficult to imagine how there could be a policy which did not require caseworkers to exercise judgement in individual cases on a matter that is so inherently fact sensitive as the removal of a particular migrant.  The discretion is not to be exercised arbitrarily, and the JRI sets out a lawful framework for structured decision making. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.58in;margin-right:0.05in">It is of significance as to how the SSHD deals with caseworker error.  It is that errors sometimes form a part of the training process to reduce the risk of the repetition of such errors in the future.  In a particular case, there was a breach of a duty of candour in failing to own up to the error in the course of a judicial review, which is a very serious matter.  If that were a regular feature, then it might undermine much of the case of the SSHD, but there is no evidence of widespread breaches of that kind.  Further, there is no foundation for any assumption that if there had been a longer period, then there would have been a redress.  If there were too short a notice period given or there was no notice of removal given, then it would be the departure from the policy rather than the policy itself which caused the problem. </p>

First, the SSHD characterises the case studies as being the real foundation of the claim.  When the matter was before Walker J, it was especially the case studies which enabled the Court to give permission to bring this judicial review claim on the basis that this case was being decided on the basis of evidence not available to the Court in <span style="font-style:italic">FB</span>. A matter which makes this challenge different from the <span style="font-style:italic">FB</span> case is a much larger number of case studies than had been prepared in respect of the <span style="font-style:italic">FB</span> case (where there were four only).  Whilst  the Claimant says its case does not necessarily depend on the case studies, they provide the most tangible expression of access to justice issues in practice, and that is why they form an important and central feature of this case. </p>

It is not apparent that the cases selected form a randomized or representative selection.  If the cases showed a pattern of confirmation of the propositions of the case of the Claimants, the position would be far from satisfactory, and open to the suggestion that without appropriate methodology in selection, they should be given little weight.  If, as here, the cases do not provide that confirmation, even without a clear selection process, then the case studies weaken rather than strengthen the Claimant’s case.  This is not only to the extent that they are not supportive, but because it is to be inferred that if there were cases which were supportive, they would have been deployed by the Claimant, using the cases of the many people engaged in asylum and immigration cases who have given evidence and the firms and organisations for which they work. </p>

First, the incidence of tens of thousands of cases which have been subject to the instant policy.  Secondly, the fact that this is a public interest challenge rather than of a small number of individual applicants or appellants.  It is spearheaded, as the evidence shows, by representatives of some of the leading firms of solicitors in the field (in addition to like evidence in <span style="font-style:italic">FB</span>).  There has been concerted activity of various charities and the Law Society immediately before or coincident with the bringing of the claim.  That is criticised by the SSHD, but this Court is not to be critical about this: the pressure towards change of an evolving policy is valuable and it is in the public interest. It is nonetheless significant that despite the cooperation of professional advisers, charities and activists in the field, the case studies have not provided evidence to support substantially a case about repeated denials of access to justice or that the system is inherently unfair. </p>

Here the suggestion appears to be that by not conducting a large enquiry of the kind sought by the Law Society or in response to the evidence as to policy adduced by the Claimant, that there has been a breach of the duty of candour.  It would be an unusual case where the duty of candour requires an extensive inquiry into categories of cases, and more natural for the duty of candour to relate to how a failure to make reasonable enquiries in more specific and self-contained areas.  </p>

This has been set out in detail.  As to the replacement of notice of removal by notice of liability to remove, in my respectful judgment, the reasoning of the Upper Tribunal is correct.  It rejected the argument that the applicants had a legal right to be notified of the removal directions because the actual removal decision did not alter the individual’s status at [149].  Thus, it held that the policy did not infringe the individual’s right to access to justice, only the timing of that access.  As to the notice period, this is a matter which had been assumed to be in order at the time of the 2010 <span style="font-style:italic">Medical Justice</span> case, and had not been the subject of challenge.  The attempt to say that it was too short a time was against a background of years of operation of the policy without this challenge, apparently because it had been assumed to suffice.  Further, insofar as it was not sufficient time in some cases, there was the possibility of seeking an extension of time on a case by case basis.  In <span style="font-style:italic">FB</span>, the period of time was found not to be so inadequate as to amount to a bar to access to justice.  </p>

In particular, the various safeguards have been examined, and the criticisms of the safeguards considered.  The safeguards are not illusory or theoretical.  Especially, there has been consideration of the categories falling outside the removal notice windows and the guidance given to caseworkers to assist with access to justice.  The two prongs have been considered in this judgment, particularly in the sections above about (a) the RNW policy: only one opportunity to challenge removal, and (b) the RNW policy: the 72 hours’ notice period).  Consideration has been given as to whether the inevitable caseworker errors which occur from time to time show that the safeguards are illusory, and it has been found that they are not.  The various case studies have been examined: they have not taken forward the Claimant’s case and have not shown that there is an unfairness inherent in the system.  There has also been examined the statistical evidence now available, and particularly in recent months about the deferral of notices.   </p>

It is not about a specific narrow challenge of the kind which exists in a particular case or cases, but it is that there is something about the RNW policy which renders it unlawful.  This is not a case like at the end of <span style="font-style:italic">FB</span> where there was reliance an alternative case about aspects of the policy which could be improved, but it is a case where the policy in the respects referred to above is so defective in its current form as to be unlawful.   </p>

The argument is that since there are no safeguards or such safeguards are inadequate, the policy removes access to justice.

The analysis of the law in <span style="font-style:italic">FB</span> was appropriate and was consistent with the authorities of the higher courts.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.58in;margin-right:0.05in">The Claimant’s approach – which is to focus on the length of the notice period and the time it takes to carry out particular tasks – is artificial if only for the reason that this forms only part of the broader contextual analysis that is required – an analysis which necessarily will vary from case to case. The absence of evidence of the policy actually operating so as to deprive individuals of access to justice is informative.  It has been particularly telling that the case studies and the statistical information which have been provided have not assisted the Claimant to prove that the safeguards are per se inadequate.  The fact that there have been more than 40,000 enforced returns over the period examined since the commencement of the removal window policy with so few wrong deportations highly relevant to the examination about whether there has been a failure of access to justice.  It is inevitable that there will be mistakes due to caseworker errors, but they are not identified on a scale which make the safeguards illusory or theoretical.  Further, the rectification or mitigation of injustice includes bringing back people removed in error, which, as indicated above, has usually been effected. </p>

The approach that there is no balancing exercise between access to justice on the one hand and the need to be able to devise and operate an effective and lawful system of immigration on the other hand is wrong. The logical implication of the approach contended for by the Claimant would be that individuals should be entitled to provoke and then to challenge decisions indefinitely – thus undermining the ability of the SSHD to operate a reasonable and effective removal policy: see <span style="font-style:italic">FB</span> at [162-165]. </p>

Ms Navarette’s case-studies include cases where the removal of individuals in circumstances which unquestionably interfered with their rights under Article 27 was only averted by chance.

It is said in broad terms at Navarette WS2 [60] that in some cases clients sought to instruct them because of dissatisfaction with previous representatives.  As noted above, access to justice does not entitle an individual to a choice of representative, and this is addressed in JRI and in the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">FB</span> cited above at [184].  In those Dublin III cases where there was certification, there will have been a significant period of time prior to certification for the individual both to raise new asylum and human rights claims and to access legal advice.  It is not apparent from the failure of the SSHD to adduce evidence about Dublin III whether it would have availed itself of a longer opportunity, but the evidence in Navarette WS2 may have been too proximate to the hearing itself for it to have been practicable.  The responses to Navarette WS2 have come largely from a note prepared on behalf of SSHD, with the permission of the Court, on 25 June 2019, but the comments might have been more specific and more authoritative if they came through evidence.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.68in;margin-right:0.05in">There is a matter of concern which has emerged in the course of the preparation of this judgment.  In accordance with their duty of candour, the SSHD has revealed a matter which has just been discovered.  It is described in a witness statement of Hannah Honeyman dated 29 July 2019.  Ms Honeyman is the head of Asylum Operations South and Special Operations including having responsibility for the Dublin Cessation Team (“DCT”)(formerly the Third Country Unit).  In the course of preparing for a third country charter flight in the week commencing 8 July 2019, it became apparent that Immigration Enforcement and DCT in UK Visas Immigration were interpreting the provisions differently.  It is most clearly described in a letter of 24 July 2019 from the GLD to the Court in the following terms, namely “<span style="font-style:italic">If, following initial certification of the asylum claim on third country grounds and the provision of 5 days’ notice of removal, TCU [Third Country Unit] then received a fresh human rights or protection claim (for example raising a claim based on reception conditions in the EU state of removal or a medical condition), which it considered clearly unfounded, the TCU then proceeded to certify that claim under the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004.  It did not however, give a further 5-day notice period (or suspend removal so as to allow for the 5-day notice period) following that second certification decision.</span>”  By contrast, the Removals, Enforcement and Detention Policy team interpreted this part of the Policy to require the provision of 5 days’ notice in all cases where the appeal right is certified and applies any time a fresh certification decision is made prior to removal; the result being that they considered that a minimum 5 working days’ notice, between the decision and the removal, will apply regardless of whether it is a Third Country decision/certification or whether it is a separate decision/certification of an ECHR claim.  On this basis, there would be required a further 5 days’ notice in every certification case, so that it would not suffice to rely on the original 5 days’ notice in the event of a subsequent certification in respect of a human rights or protection claim.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.68in;margin-right:0.05in">The Claimant is very critical about this discovery.  It says that in the event that its case and evidence had been properly considered, and answered, the SSHD would have identified this difference of interpretation.  The difference of interpretation demonstrates that the policy is not written clearly, such that it admits of more than one interpretation.  It is also said to show a very limited understanding on the part of the Defendant whose case had been in the Grounds of Defence [68], the Skeleton Argument [95] and in oral submissions that <span style="font-style:italic">“a new notice of removal window is then required to be given, providing a notice period of at least five working days.”</span></p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.68in;margin-right:0.05in">The response of Ms Honeyman is that pending clarification, the further 5-days’ notice is being provided in every certification case.  A clarification is clearly required at the earliest stage, and then in the next version of the policy.  One would expect that that clarification would mirror the additional 5day notice period in every certification case.  This is either because it would mirror what has been submitted to the Court: alternatively, if there is really scope for two interpretations, one would expect that the interpretation most favourable to the individual would be preferred.  One would expect to have some proposed solution of this aspect from the SSHD before the order arising out of this judgment is entered. </p>

Nor does it follow that the people applying it have limited understanding. It does illustrate why it is important for the SSHD to continue to engage with the solicitors and charities and other interested persons, and to share information working at all times for improvements and as much clarity as possible in the policy.  It has added to the need for scrutiny of the case of the SSHD.  However, in the end, it does not lead to the challenges being successful.  In the meantime, the clarification is required.    </p>

This point is both theoretical and a bad point.  It is theoretical in that there is no instance of this extension having been used in this way.  It is a bad point because it would be obvious in such a case that the use of the power would be abused unless there were extraordinary reasons to rely upon such extensions and so the abuse would be subject to the availability of judicial review.

The answer to this point is that the policy is justified generally in that it forces claims to be made at an earlier stage rather than on the proximate to the removal.  In that sense, it enables that matters can be dealt with an orderly and nondisruptive way.  In many cases, that will operate in cases with histories of disruption or lack of success.

The suggestion that if there is no judicial review, there will be no scrutiny is not an answer.  It must in the first instance be for the SSHD to exercise their discretions properly; they are subject to judicial review, and the fact that claims are commonly brought for judicial review will keep the SSHD having to account for their actions.

It is not ruled out that if there was substantial evidence in respect of this such as to identify as a particular problem such that extensions were not an answer, but there were other possible answers that there might be a case to consider in respect of the foregoing.

They are safeguards properly so called.  As noted above, access to justice does not involve the process being risk free so long as risk is kept to an acceptable minimum.  Further, there appears to be a suggestion that it is not sufficient that an individual has to make a request for an extension or deferral of the notice period l rather than it being by the SSHD of her own motion.  There is no explanation as to how this would work in practice: it must be for the individual to have the rights and the ability to exercise those rights, and not for the SSHD to have to make enquiries with the many thousands of people with whom it deals each year and to make the enquiries for itself.

It suffices, in my judgment, to say that it “should normally be deferred”, because there is a problem about people changing or removing lawyers precisely to obtain further time, and so the judgment of the SSHD is required rather than making this an automatic reason for an extension.  In a community case, it is not up to the SSHD’s officers to procure a lawyer: an extended period of notice is allowed here, and extensions of time can be sought if there is a difficulty in obtaining the services of a lawyer or in making the representations in time.  As is apparent from the cases noted above, frequently there is a lawyer who has already provided services to the applicant because the notice of the removal is usually served at or towards the end of the process. </p>

It is likely that more could be provided, and Mr Pompa’s evidence acknowledges that this is an area which is actively being considered with a view to increasing the amount of monitoring.  It is an area where it does not suffice for the SSHD internally to take such steps as it thinks fit, but actively to engage as it did in the letter of 10 May 2019 in the concerns expressed to it, and to take such steps as it can to improve the monitoring.  If it unreasonably withheld some information which ought to be provided, then there could be consideration of what ought to be done.

It is to be borne in mind that under the JRI, limited notice should not be used “<span style="font-style:italic">where a medical or social work professional has advised that it may not be appropriate</span>”. Whilst there is no mechanism whereby this is routinely sought, it is a matter for caseworkers on a case by case basis to take steps as appropriate.  There are statements to the effect that this may not be happening effectively, but the evidence referred to above is limited.  The Immigration Factual Summary referred to above includes information relating to the medical history of the individual including any medical conditions, any medication or treatment currently being received and any evidence of risk of harm.  It is a matter of which the SSHD must be vigilant, working out if there is more that can be done to identify such cases.  It does not seem practicable for the SSHD to provide medical and social work professionals to each applicant, and therefore the burden is on the individual and solicitors to draw information to the attention of the SSHD and for caseworkers to be vigilant when they are given information to ensure that the policy of not giving limited notice of removal is used.  It may be that there is a possibility in the future of a specifically targeted criticism in this regard, with recommendations as to what could be done specifically to improve the system in this regard.  However, on the material before the Court, the Claimant has not established a systemic inherent unfairness in respect of vulnerable people such as to render the removal policy unlawful. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.58in;margin-right:0.05in">Despite these risks, the SSHD has not monitored the impact of its policy on these vulnerable groups; does not keep records of unlawful removals; and has not carried out a further equality impact assessment since 2015 in the light of experience or of the changes in the policy (which have, in particular, heightened the evidential threshold for a person to be accepted as vulnerable, and increased the categories of case in which an LNW may be used).  Reference is made to the comments on the submissions of EHRC at (skeleton paragraphs [26-31]) and how the scope for greater monitoring, which is actively being considered.  Such scope for greater monitoring which is currently being addressed does not establish that the RNW or the LNR policy is unlawful.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.58in;margin-right:0.05in">The Claimant points to the case of A referred to in Mr Singh’s statement [57-95] as a “<span style="font-style:italic">stark illustration</span>” of the risks of the policy in connection with a vulnerable individual with a severe mental health condition.  It is a case where the Home Office has admitted that the detention of A on 29 and 30 November 2017 involved a misuse of its powers.  It is a lamentable history of unlawful removal.  He was returned to the UK, and there was an agreed order to pay to him damages of £35,000 and costs of his application for judicial review.  This was a shocking case, but there is no evidence to show that this is a “stark illustration” of some broader malaise of deceit on vulnerable victims.  The consent order and the subsequent return of A to the UK show that it was an appalling deviation from the system rather than a symptom of a shortcoming of the system.   </p>

The evidence does not establish such widescale errors as to make the system inherently unfair.  The risk of human error is unavoidable.  The question is how the system then learns from those errors and applies them in practice so as to diminish the risk of repetition, and there is evidence that this is done, particularly by reference to training slides referred to above. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.58in;margin-right:0.05in">The skeleton of the EHRC identifies many cases about the procedural safeguards relating to Article 3 rights.  Useful though the reference to the numerous cases is, this does not indicate how these rights are more extensive than the rights at common law or establish any breach of Article 3 right in respect of the particular challenge.  The EHRC is right to say that cases turn on their facts, and therefore do not point to particular unlawfulness for the purpose of this case.  The principles operate at a high level of generality.  The matters relating to how the removal window operates and the treatment of fresh claims were properly considered in FB (e.g. [162-163] and have been considered above, and the matters in the skeleton of the EHRC [e.g.44] do not render these matters wrong.  </p>

Article 13 has no direct application, but does assist in interpretation.  Here too the analysis of EHRC does not demonstrate unlawfulness in the policy.  Further, the broad statements that EHRC views the terms and the operation of the policy are considered to give rise to an unacceptable risk of infringement of Articles 3 or 8 and Article 13 to accessible and effective remedies is not accepted in the light of the matters set out above, particularly in the context of the more detailed evaluation of access to justice referred to above.</p>

There are clearly many dedicated professionals in the field.  Whilst some progress may come from public interest challenges, there is an additional respect in which cooperation of the parties is of value to the public.  This judgment has been critical of the SSHD for its initial lack of cooperation when asked questions in January 2019.
