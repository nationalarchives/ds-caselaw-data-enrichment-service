She was then harassed by a series of unlawful acts and omissions whilst conducting two successive First-tier Tribunal (“FtT”) appeals and this judicial review. These three pieces of litigation were directly concerned with her unlawful detention and the other related unlawful decisions. She was unable to leave the United Kingdom (“UK”) for 5 months after the termination of her original leave to enter had expired due to that harassing conduct, to the need to remain in the UK whilst her FtT appeals and her application for permission to apply for judicial review were pending and to the impounding of her passport. </span>

An entry clearance would be subject to conditions of a kind authorised by section 3 of the IA and these should be endorsed on it. A condition that was required by IR 41, and the one which plays a central role in this case, was ordinarily expressed as “No Work” in the visa. This wording was shorthand for the restrictive condition contained in IR 41(iii) which stated that the holder of that type of visa did not intend to take employment in the UK.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt">   It can be seen that, as noted, Radha had stated that she “would help her sister sew curtains at home” and that she “will get paid; not sure how much but will be paid”. In doing so, she did not explain the nature of the help she was referring to or the payment she might receive or that there would be a direct link between the help to be given and the payment. Radha was not therefore reported to have said that she would be taking paid employment or paid work to sew curtains. If she was merely going to assist Hansha it was unlikely that she would be undertaking an employment relationship and if she was only going to help her, this was even more so given the family context involved, the fact that Hansha was intending to provide for her during her visit and the highly skilled nature of Hansha’s work. Moreover, there did not appear to be anything suspicious in her answers to the effect that she intended to stay for 5 months or that her ticket was bought by her father-in-law. Her visitor’s visa was for a maximum period of 6 months so that a change of plan involving a visit of 5 rather than 3 months was not of itself suspicious. It followed that, even if the notes provided a reliable guide as to what Radha had said, the admissions that she was reported to have made did not appear to have justified the conclusion that she was seeking to enter for a different purpose to that provided for in her visa or that she would be employed and would be unlikely to leave the UK when her visitor’s visa expired. </span>

However, the notes in stating “IS81@ 1845 S Reeves, C Norris” have been relied on by IO Newton to demonstrate that IO Reeves conducted the preliminary interview and, with CIO Norris, took the relevant decisions that led to Radha’s temporary detention at 18.45. Furthermore, both IO Newton and CIO Davies stated in their second witness statements without any further elaboration or explanation that the explanatory statement was subject to a “typographical error” in stating that IO Newton rather than IO Reeves had both conducted the preliminary interview and taken the relevant decisions to suspend and to detain.  </span>

In considering the authenticity and veracity of the explanatory statement, it is also necessary to consider the minute sheet dated 24 May 2011 that had been made and signed by IO Newton and the entry in the CID log that he had made in identical terms at the same time. These two documents purported to be a summary of all the events involving Radha’s interviews and temporary detention including her preliminary interview, the interim detention decision recorded on an IS 81 form, the subsequent investigations, the further interview and the cancelation, refusal, detention and removal decisions. This document, in both form and content, suggested that IO Newton had been involved in all these events since they were entered up by IO Newton as one entry. Had IO Reeves undertaken the preliminary check point interview and issued the IS 81 form, he would have made a separate entry recording that fact on his own separate minute sheet and in the CID log.  </span>

This note stated that the “case [was] handed to me at 22.30”. There was nothing else in these documents that identified any other IO as having handled Radha’s case prior to 22.30 and the logs or time sheets that would have shown who was initially handling her case, when IO Newton came on duty, what he was doing prior to 22.30 that evening and why he was chosen to take her case over after she had been in temporary detention for nearly four hours have never been disclosed if they had ever existed. </span>

This explanation as to the non-disclosure of Radha’s original landing card with the full text of the redacted passage is not credible since the original landing card, having been filed with the custodian of the holding room, would have remained in the possession of the SSHD and would therefore have been readily accessible and available to be disclosed and inspected.

Similarly, if the initials are compared with the initials on two other documents said by IO Newton and CIO Davies to have been initialled by IO Reeves, the signature on the explanatory statement appears to have been made by the same person as acknowledged these two further documents.

It was obviously crucial to ascertain which IO had interviewed Radha and since IO Newton had apparently helped draft the explanatory statement, he was in a good position to explain the mistake. He was, however, silent on that matter and provided no explanation as to why IO Reeves had not made a statement explaining that he was the interviewing officer or why there was no document showing that IO Reeves was on duty at a preliminary check point in the early evening of 23 May 2011.</span>

Finally, and very tellingly, she had not signed the acknowledgement box provided on the form. The lack of an explanation for these errors and omissions is very probably explained by IO Newton deciding that he wanted to hide the fact that he had conducted the preliminary interview and then issued Radha’s IS 91 form recording her temporary detention.

However, there is no other document that identifies either of these IOs as being involved in the preliminary interview or in writing up the notes or in Radha’s temporary detention prior to 22.30 and neither of them submitted a statement that explained their respective roles in these events.</span>

The copy of these notes in the hearing bundle was one that was faxed on 17 June 2011 to the Treasury Solicitor to enable the summary grounds of defence to be drafted. It is not clear who faxed the document but it was within a bundle of 30 pages of documents being faxed that included the further interview notes and IO Newton’s minute sheet recording the actions taken on 23 and 24 May 2011.

Equally, there is no evidence of the nature and extent of the help that Radha indicated she would provide Hansha with nor that any payment made by Hansha would be directly linked to that help. It is very possible, given her evidence in her witness statements, that she had stated that if Hansha was very busy sewing curtains, she would help Hansha out with the domestic work. It is also very possible that she stated that Hansha as her sponsor was intending to provide her with spending money in any event and that those payments would not be linked to any help she might provide to Hansha.</span>

In the log, he explained his reason for withdrawing the cancellation of Radha’s leave to enter as being that it would be difficult to sustain the cancellation decision since there was no employer to enter into an employment relationship with Radha and that whatever her arrangement was with Hansha, it would be likely to be seen as a family arrangement undertaken as part of her family visit</span>

The significance of this statement is that it did not state who signed the IS 81 form, when it was signed or who served it nor what explanation was given, how that explanation was interpreted since an explanation in English would not have been understood in any event or where it was given. The IS 81 was not signed but merely initialled and the signatory’s name was not written onto the document. It would seem that IO Newton decided to take the four actions recorded on the IS 81 without obtaining a CIO’s authorisation and without explaining anything to Radha. It was only in his second witness statement that he identified the initials as being those of IO Reeves but there is no independent corroborating evidence to verify this fact. </span>

Although both reasons would explain why a further interview was considered necessary, neither explained why it was necessary to detain her temporarily.

That evidence is corroborated by her not being asked to sign the acknowledgement box provided for on the IS 86 and 91R forms which are both blank on the disclosed copies of them.

	      <span style="font-size:10pt">At the conclusion of the short preliminary interview, the notes were said by the SSHD’s two witnesses to have recorded that IO Reeves and CIO Norris had decided to suspend Radha’s leave to enter and to detain her temporarily in order to question her further and that this decision was incorporated onto the appropriate IS 81 standard form at 18.45. However, this part of the notes is contradicted by the explanatory statement which attributed the decision to suspend to IO Newton. Moreover, the suspension decision was recorded in the explanatory statement as having been based on Radha’s admission that she was entering the UK in order to take employment sewing curtains and on her having stated that she intended to stay for three months although her return ticket was for a return flight to Mumbai five months later. This can be seen from this passage in the explanatory statement:</span>

Since that explanation was based on concocted evidence, the decision appears in fact to have been based on IO Newton’s determination to detain Radha on the basis of her change of purpose even though there was no available evidence to suggest that that was her intention. In other words, he decided to use his powers of suspension and temporary detention in order to force her to sign a document that would enable him to have her removed even though there did not appear to be any evidence that suggested that she was seeking to enter for an unlawful purpose.</span>

I finally conclude that the decision to detain he temporarily was taken solely because IO Newton was determined to refuse Radha leave to enter and wished to take her to a private interview room to force her to admit that she was unlawfully entering to take paid employment. </span>

In relation to timing, Radha’s evidence was that her first interview occurred at 22.30 and she was interviewed on and off at least 5 – 6 times thereafter. Those interviews included the formal further interview which it is clear from the disclosed documents was conducted by IO Newton. His evidence was that he came on duty and was assigned Radha’s case at 22.30, that he spoke to Laxman at 22.45 and that the further interview was timed as having occurred for 52 minutes between 23.00 and 23.52. His minute sheet and hence the CID timed the setting of removal directions as being at 00.25, IO Newton’s advising Laxman that Radha was to be returned to India and detained meanwhile at 00.30 and his signing off of the refusal decision at 01.11. Laxman’s evidence was that his first discussion with an unidentified IO, who IO Newton accepts was himself, ended at about midnight and that he was not informed that Radha’s temporary detention had been turned into immigration detention coupled with removal directions until 02.30 the following morning.  </span>

The further interview notes suggested that the further interview was the last interview to have occurred and that it occurred between 23.00 and 23.52. On that basis, the other interviews, if they occurred, took place prior to 22.30 and that, if they took place, they must have been conducted by IO Newton even though he recorded in the CID that Radha’s case was not handed to him until 22.30. On the other hand, the only evidence of the timing of the further interview and further actions is what CIO Newton recorded on the interview record and the CID so that it is possible that the further interview took place later. </span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt">  Thus, it is possible that Radha was incorrect in suggesting that the first of her interviews in detention only started at 22.30.  The only corroborated evidence is that she must have been informed of her detention and decision to remove her by 02.30 since Laxman states that that was when he received a telephone call to inform him of this fact. If Radha and Laxman are inaccurate in stating the times of the start of her interviewing and of his being informed of her detention, any such inaccuracy is neither surprising nor significant. Radha had no watch and was tired, confused and in an extremely agitated state. Her evidence is, therefore, entirely credible that she was unable to make accurate estimates of time or timescales. Similarly Laxman’s evidence that he finished his conversation or meeting with the IO who spoke with him at about midnight appears to be inaccurate. The evidence suggests that he was about one hour out in that estimate and that it actually ended one hour earlier than he remembered. This too is not surprising. He had been waiting with no doubt growing anxiety for Radha since about 18.00 without any information as to why she had still not emerged from the arrivals procedures so that he too had probably lost detailed sense of time even though he had a watch. </span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt">The explanatory statement states that IO Newton examined the CID to obtain details of Radha’s application for entry clearance and of her successful appeal following the ECO’s refusal of her application. However, the absence of any other evidence as to what happened in the period of in excess of 4 hours between Radha’s detention and IO Newton’s record of the time at the start of her further interview provides further and potentially reliable evidence of his having been either the sole or the principal IO involved with her throughout her time in temporary detention including interviewing her in such additional interviews as took place.    </span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt">The SSHD provided no other evidence or statement that addressed the question of whether these other interviews took place at all and why there was a four-hour gap between Radha’s temporary detention and IO Newton starting work on her further interview or who was involved in her case prior to 22.30 when IO Newton’s CID entry states that he took over her case. IO Newton’s witness statements made no reference to them and by implication deny that they took place since he stated that he took over her case at 22.30. This is a significant statement since he did not state that that was when he came on duty. It would appear therefore that he was already on duty but he gave no evidence of when he came on duty or what he had been doing between coming on duty and 22.30. Equally, neither the explanatory statement nor the summary or detailed grounds of defence referred to these interviews so that, by inference, the allegations that they occurred at all and that Radha was bullied and harassed during them were also denied. </span>

Finally, there was no disclosure of any relevant documents such as timesheets and detention records for the period between 18.45 and 22.30 relating to Radha and all those involved in her detention in this period and no statement was provided explaining why no relevant documents relating to this period were disclosed and why no witness had served a statement about it. </span>

Her evidence was that she was repeatedly interviewed in a bullying and demeaning manner by an IO with a Gujarati interpreter. This IO must have been IO Newton who had detained her, had undertaken the further enquiries that had led to her temporary detention and who appeared to be in charge of that detention. If that inference is incorrect, the interviewing IO in charge of her temporary detention between 19.45 and 22.30 must have been some other unidentified IO. According to IO Newton, he took over Radha’s case at 22.30 on the instructions of a CIO whose identity he had forgotten. </span>

It seems unlikely that he could not remember which CIO had handed Radha’s case to him and even less likely that he could not have ascertained from internal documents which CIO had handed it over to him. It is to be expected that he would have attempted to ascertain from internal records, or have asked others to have ascertained for him, which CIO had handed him her case. He gave no evidence of what briefing he was given or what documents and notes he was provided with when being handed her case, if that is what occurred. Had the case been handed over to him at that stage, it is likely that it was handed to him by CIO Davies and it is unlikely that he would not have been able to check the contemporaneous documents to find out who it was who handed him her case if he genuinely could not remember who it was. It is clear from the questions he recorded as having asked her that he had a good knowledge of what had occurred with Radha prior to the suggested hand over and had seen and was very familiar with the contents of the notes that had been made on the back of Radha’s landing card and her passport. </span>

Furthermore, if IO Reeves or another IO had questioned Radha during the four hours that she had already been detained, it is inconceivable that that IO would not have discussed Radha’s case with him or would not have provided him with the gist of her answers and that IO’s views as to what the purpose of her visit was. IO Newton would have remembered such briefings and would, indeed, have recorded them on the CID had they occurred. The absence of any evidence from him and from any other source about what he was provided with at the hand over strongly suggests that no such hand over occurred and that IO Newton had been involved in her case throughout her time in detention.</span>

His record on the CID log was that this contact occurred at about 22.45 whereas Laxman put it at about midnight. IO Newton arranged to meet him face to face there and then, probably in the arrivals area in Terminal 4. The explanatory statement asserts that this was a telephone interview, an assertion based on IO Newton’s minute that stated that IO Newton questioned Laxman and that he contacted him on his mobile number which was identified in the minute. However, this note and Laxman’s statement read together are more consistent with Laxman’s evidence that he was initially contacted by mobile and then met his interviewing IO face to face than with the whole interview taking place over the telephone. There is further uncertainty arising from IO Newton’s note in his minute sheet that he had two conversations with Laxman, the first immediately before the further interview of Radha and the second immediately after it was concluded.</span>

Laxman provided all details that he was asked for and explained that her purpose in visiting the UK was solely to see her family. He explained why Radha’s husband had not come to the UK, who was looking after her two children and how it came about that their parents and Hansha had acquired UK citizenship and he had acquired ILR. His evidence was that he had particularly stressed in answer to questions about Hansha and Radha’s intentions that Hansha worked in a curtain factory, that she did not and was not permitted to bring sewing work home and that Radha would not be sewing curtains or helping Hansha to sew curtains.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt">The interview was conducted in the designated interview rooms in Terminal Four. There is no presumption of what the outcome might be. In the case of Ms Patel, the main point that needed to be explored was her statement upon arrival that she would help her sister sew curtains for which she would receive payment. I did this by asking her what she would do whilst in the United Kingdom and asked her to clarify what she meant be sewing curtains and receiving payment from her sister. I asked each question myself and wrote each one down on the interview sheets. It was then translated into Guajarati (sic) by the interpreter. Ms Patel would answer and the interpreter would translate this into English. I would then write the answer as it was said to me by the interviewer on the interview sheet next to my question as is standard practice. At the end of the interview, all the questions and answers were read back to Ms Patel via the translator. She agreed to them being an accurate record of what was said and she signed each page including the bottom section of the interview front cover. I also signed the interview pages. She was again offered refreshment, which she declined. I asked her again if she was fit and well. She replied that she was. …</span>

Would your help be less directly involved than sewing by, for example providing assistance to Hansha in pinning, measuring out, holding down, sizing, piecing or other related tasks? What was your previous experience in sewing curtains? Was the house large enough to enable both of them to sew curtains together or even for one of them to sew curtains there? Were there appropriate machines in the house to enable the materials to be cut and pieced? Would you be sewing on your own during times when Hansha was away from the house? What help was Hansha given by your parents, your brother and your sister-in-law? If your other family members did not help in sewing curtains, why were you going to help Hansha? Would your help be direct or indirect? Would your help be confined to, or include, helping with the domestic chores or other activities which Hansha might otherwise have been undertaking but which she would be spared so that she could concentrate on the sewing?</span>

That relationship had to be in the nature of an employment relationship even if there was not to be any or only a small amount of payment. Thus, it was not any work that was prohibited and such work as housework, domestic work or work arising out of a family arrangement would not count as employment. An employment relationship involved, at the very least, some element of control and responsibility by an employer – in this case Hansha - which was not a domestic or private arrangement and which had at least a nominal structure, rules, boundaries and regularity and was being undertaken under a defined programme. </span>

Radha was not asked when these discussions took place and to describe their number, length and content in a little more detail. Thus, the discussions could have been anything from a throwaway remark to detailed and regular conversations.

Thus, it was not asked whether the payment was to be a reward for the help that was given, whether it was to be payment in cash or in kind or as part of Hansha’s sponsorship and whether it was to assist her with spending money and as money to help her maintain herself whilst in the UK. Answer 27 is particularly ambivalent: “It is not just my sister. Everyone from my family will give me money”. This answer suggested that the money Radha would receive was not directly related to her help or “employment” at all but was instead pocket or spending money provided by her parents and siblings to assist her in her extended family visit. Moreover, “this is my first time” (answer 26) suggests that this was Radha’s first visit to the UK so she would not have seen her family for many years. In those circumstances, it would not be surprising if her sponsor and other family members collectively helped her out and that she would “become part of the family” whilst staying with them. Finally, she was not asked what she would do with such money as she received: spend it in the UK? Remit it to her parents-in-law? Bank it as savings for her return to India? Or what?</span>

If so, his answers were significant and the failure to put them to Radha was particularly striking. Similarly, Radha’s answers were not put to Laxman which was a serious oversight since he would have been able to provide detailed answers that would have shown up these apparent answers as being seriously incorrect.</span>

The SSHD has since led no evidence, particularly from IO Newton, that sought to show that that finding was incorrect or to explain why Radha’s evidence to the FtT was incorrect or why no evidence was adduced by the SSHD during the FtT third appeal. Equally, the SSHD made no attempt to obtain from the FtT judge who heard the third appeal that judge’s notes of the oral evidence given by Radha to the judge. No transcript or recording of that evidence would have been made but it would have been possible for the SSHD, through the Treasury Solicitor, to apply to the judge for a typed-up version of the notes made by the judge in his notebook. Given the circumstances of this case, an attempt should have been made by or on behalf of the SSHD to obtain a typed-up version of the immigration judge’s notes of Radha’s oral examination. </span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt">My summary of the available evidence shows that the SSHD’s case has no foundation. This is particularly so insofar as it is based on the submission the admissions recorded as having been made by Radha were either made by her or could reasonably be read as having been made by her. This is also so in relation to its further case, which only arises from inference, that Radha was not questioned in any other interviews at all and was never questioned at all in a bullying manner with the aim of forcing an admission from her that her purpose in entering the UK was to take employment sewing curtains.  There are four strands of evidence that need to be considered in the round when this presumed defence or denial case is evaluated.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt">    Firstly, it is necessary to take as the starting point, the FtT’s conclusion that Radha was a credible and patently honest witness. This finding was made after Radha had given detailed evidence that verified her full witness statement and she had been questioned at length by her counsel in chief and by the immigration judge. The SSHD made no attempt to obtain the immigration judge’s notes of that oral evidence and did not attempt to challenge it in the hearing of this judicial review. It is also necessary to take account of the immigration judge’s conclusions that Radha did not admit any intention of undertaking paid work in contravention of the terms of her visa and that no weight could be placed on her signing the notes. These findings were reached after the SSHD had decided not to be represented at the hearing nor to adduce any evidence at the FtT despite it being fully aware of the nature and extent of Radha’s case and having been given unusually clear warning of the need to adduce rebutting evidence by the immigration judge when adjourning the first hearing. The SSHD has since provided no explanation for taking these decisions and did not contend that the evidence it has now adduced could not reasonably have been adduced to the FtT earlier</span>

However, this was erroneous, if it had been stated to her, because she had a human rights appeal arising from her claims under articles 5, 8 and 14 of the ECHR. This was an in-country right of appeal. These claims potentially arose in four separate ways. Firstly, the stated purpose of her visit, which she stated in her evidence that she had repeatedly stated to the IO during the various interviews she was given, was an extended visit to her English-based family that included her parents, her two siblings, her brother’s infant and her sister-in-law. She therefore had an obviously potential article 8 claim for disproportionate interference with her family life. Moreover, she was being detained and the stated policy of the SSHD was that there was a presumption against detention in circumstances similar to Radha’s. There was, therefore, a possible claim under article 5 for unlawful detention since her detention appeared to engage article 5. Finally, it was, or arguably should have been, known to IO Newton that Radha had potential complaints about the way she was interviewed which, if her complaints had any foundation, engaged or potentially could have engaged articles 5 and 14.  </span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt">   Radha’s rights of appeal in-country arose in two related ways. If she could establish a breach or breaches of her human rights arising from the decisions to cancel her leave to enter and to detain and remove her, she had grounds for appeal under the IRs since, even if the decision otherwise conformed to the IRs, the decision would be incompatible with the ECHR and would therefore be “not in accordance with the law” and was unlawful which are two of the stated grounds of appeal permitted and arising from the NIAA</span>

Since IO Newton was speaking to her directly in English, it seems likely that he only gave her limited information. There is no internal evidence in the disclosed documents that this notice was served on her. The copy of the decision in the hearing bundle shows that the decision was recorded on an IS 82A form. This is a copy of the document faxed to Radha’s legal representative on 25 May 2011 by Colnbrook Serco. This copy appears to have a page missing from it, the pages of the decision that were sent – or received – did not contain any notification of Radha’s rights of appeal on human rights grounds.  </span>

In doing so, IO Newton was deciding and CIO Davies was authorising the confirmation of the decisions taken immediately following Radha’s further interview and the basis of those decisions. These IOs were therefore, in reality, authorising the cancellation of Radha’s entry permission, the refusal of her leave to enter, her immigration detention in the form of a 24-hour detention review and the issue of removal directions for her removal to Mumbai as soon as possible.

Moreover, Radha was not asked how much work she brought home or to describe the work that was brought home. This is significant since the house was a four-bedroom house that was occupied by five adults and a baby. There would therefore have been very little room to sew curtains so that the amount of sewing undertaken at home could not have been extensive.</span>

Ms Patel was interviewed by Immigration Officer Newton following which he referred the case to me. He explained that the passenger had sought entry as a visitor for which she held a valid visa. However, at the initial desk interview conducted by another officer, Ms Patel had said that she would be sewing curtains for her sister for payment (4). Mr Newton told me that a further interview which he conducted with the aid of a Home Office qualified interpreter, Ms Patel stated that she was unaware that she was unable to work in the United Kingdom.

Laxman’s evidence was that he explained at some length to IO Newton that Hansha was not permitted to bring sewing work home and that Radha would not be sewing curtains or helping Hansha to sew curtains. Moreover, there would have been on Radha’s file a copy of her solicitor’s PAP letter dated 25 May 2011 which included a copy of Hansha’s contract of employment which contained a prohibition on her bringing work home or undertaking similar work for other clients at home. Thus, whatever CIO Davies was told by IO Newton, it does not appear to have been a full and accurate account of what he was told. It follows that this is a further passage on which little reliance can be placed.</span>

It suggests that CIO Davies was considering a change of purpose case and not, as stated at the beginning of the statement, a change of circumstances case. At no stage did he explain why what Radha said – that she would help or work sewing curtains – amounted to employment or why he disagreed with CIO Khan’s view as reflected in his notes placed on the CID log that the decision to refuse Radha leave to enter had been withdrawn because it was not possible to show that Radha intended to be employed.</span>

Clearly, it was open to the IO investigating her purpose in coming to the UK to take a different view but only after all the evidence had been weighed up and a conscious decision taken that the immigration judge’s decision was either mistaken or that he had been misled. However, there appeared to be no basis or evidence for either view to be taken of the immigration judge’s decision.</span>

The IO that the legal representative spoke to informed her that Radha had no appeal rights. Given that the stated purpose of Radha’s visit was a family visit, it was or arguably should have been known to the IO that Radha had a potential in-country right of appeal on human rights grounds. The decision was faxed to the legal representative. As a result of this intervention, Radha’s removal directions were varied so that her removal was postponed until 21.00 on 26 May 2011.</span>

The name of that IO was not revealed by the illegible signature on the letter sent in reply to the PAP letter although an internal minute sheet signed by IO Ghudial suggests that he is the signatory. The CID entry for 25 May 2011 and Duty Officer Ghudial’s minute sheet stated that the PAP letter was referred to CIO Norris but there is no other independent evidence that it was. Duty Officer Ghudial stated laconically that “It was decided that the decision would stand as the passenger sought entry for employment”. As a result, Duty Officer Ghudial informed Urvi Shah the same day that the refusal decision would stand, TA would not be granted and the removal directions for 26 May 2011 would be proceeded with. Whichever IO, if any, considered the PAP letter, there is no disclosed record of the decision itself and no evidence of what if any material was considered. At best, Duty Officer Ghudial, on instructions from CIO Norris or some other IO or on his own initiative, merely read the terms of the decision and perfunctorily dismissed the application. No, or no adequate consideration appears to have been given to the terms of the PAP letter which set out in detail why the refusal and detention decisions were unlawful in terms that have never substantially altered.        </span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt">  I have been in the UK since 23 May 2011 and my intention was to visit my parents and my siblings for a period of three months and thereafter go back to India to my family and specially my two minor children. Now due to the injustice done to me I have been away from my two minor children for over 9 months. It is submitted that as my appeal in the tribunal was pending I could not leave the country or else my appeal would be considered as withdrawn. During this time, my family especially my two young children have suffered a lot without their mother. It is highly unfair on the part of the home office not to have allowed me to enter as a visitor and meet my parents and siblings. I feel as if I am in a prison and not allowed to go back home. I had come to spend time with my parents, brother and sister, however this visit has ended in a nightmare. Now I wish to return back to India as also my sister, who is also my sponsor, is getting married in April 2012 and my whole family is going to India, however due to this ongoing litigation I may not be able to go back to India on time to attend my younger sister’s wedding. Moreover, my passport is still with the UKBA.</span>

The central tenet of the refusal is that the passenger’s [Radha’s] leave as a visitor has been cancelled on the basis that she had stated that she would undertake paid employment in the United Kingdom.  … Her representatives argue that she did not make the admissions as stated on the refusal wording and are now contesting the veracity of the transcripts. This contention is not so much my concern as in my mind the interview transcript clearly documents her responses attesting to these admissions. </span>
	      <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:10pt">The question is over the employment itself. She has stated that her sister would be her employer and would give her payment for working at home helping her ‘sewing curtains’. I imagine that given the family connection, the passenger’s sister will also contend that there was confusion over the issue of employment and indeed this has already been intimated in the claim form. There is no formal employer as such to contact, which I foresee to undermine our position. Furthermore, during the interview she also states that she has primarily come to the United Kingdom to visit her family members.</span>

It can be seen that his reasoning was in summary that the evidence in the notes of the preliminary and further interviews did not show that Radha intended to take employment sewing curtains but instead showed that she merely intended to help Hansha out as a family arrangement. However, he considered that it was possible that, on seeing the immigration judge’s determination allowing her appeal against the ECO’s refusal of her visa, he would conclude that there would be sufficient to justify the issuing of a fresh decision refusing her entry in a way that would enable her to appeal that refusal in-country. He would only issue a fresh decision if it appeared from reading that determination that there was some basis for taking that course.  </span>

A decision in those terms should have been promulgated and served on her, her passport should have been returned to her with the reissued visa stamped in it and she should have been discharged from immigration detention and temporary admission on that basis and granted leave to enter for six months. Instead, following CIO Khan’s decision to withdraw the cancellation of her leave to enter and to grant her temporary admission, Radha was discharged from immigration detention during the morning of 29 May 2011 on temporary admission subject to a condition of weekly reporting and the SSHD retained her passport. Since the withdrawal decision was not itself withdrawn, there was no legal basis for only granting her temporary admission or to impose a weekly reporting condition and she should have been granted 6 months permission to enter as a visitor, her passport should have been returned to her stamped appropriately to make it clear that her visa had been reinstated and it should have expired after entry had been granted by the withdrawal decision of 28 May 2011 and her temporary admission and reporting obligation should have been cancelled. </span>

It would appear that CIO Khan had no intention of reviewing his decision to withdraw the cancellation decision or of issuing a new decision and was offering the suggested “pragmatic and sensible way forward” as a smokescreen in the hope that Radha’s solicitors would withdraw the judicial review and thereby prevent the errors and serious misconduct that occurred when the withdrawal decision was made coming to light.  </span>

The decision was either sustainable and therefore carried no rights of appeal or, as he had decided, it was not sustainable and should be withdrawn. There was no halfway house save for him to have admitted that it was not sustainable that Radha had changed the purpose of her visit but that, having been granted entry clearance, there had subsequently been a change of circumstances which warranted the cancellation of her leave to enter. That change of circumstances would have had to have been something other than a change of purpose since if there had been a change of purpose, there was no reason to grant her a right of appeal – she already had one.</span>

Moreover, it was not his business to become involved in the judicial review – unless for ulterior purposes he wished to have it withdrawn. The on-going judicial review was the concern of the SSHD’s legal representative, as an IO he was solely concerned with immigration matters including immigration detention which he had dealt with by granting Radha temporary admission and releasing her from detention.</span>

Urvi Shah had reasonably concluded on the basis of CIO Khan’s letter that the decision dated 24 May 2011 remained in place and that the letter was offering Radha nothing except the right to an in-country appeal of that decision which was a right that she already had. Neither Urvi Shah nor Radha was informed or was aware that the decision had been withdrawn until informed of this by the case presenter during the hearing of her second appeal. </span>

This unlawfulness arose because the claimant was interviewed on several occasions maliciously and in an intimidating, hostile, humiliating, degrading and offensive manner. Although it was alleged by the notice of refusal of her leave to enter that she had admitted that she was not a genuine visitor and was seeking entry as a visitor but with the intention of working in interview, she had never stated in the various interviews that she had that she would assist her sister in sewing curtains. These denials were supported by the terms of her sister’s contract of employment which had already been communicated to the SSHD which forbade her from working at home. </span>

The explanatory statement suggested that CIO Khan reviewed the file in great detail.

There is no evidence to support the suggestion in the explanatory statement that this review took place and the suggestion appears to have been made in an attempt to provide support for the conclusion that the original decision was lawful.

The relevant IOs involved in Radha’s investigation, refusal decisions and detention were well aware that Radha was disputing these decisions and her detention on the grounds that they relied on admissions she had allegedly made which she vehemently denied making. From the outset, Radha and her solicitor were alleging that the statements attributed to her were falsely attributed to her and had been made up. Her defence was, therefore, that the evidence of her alleged admissions was fabricated. She had challenged her detention in this judicial review and CIO Khan had reviewed that detention decision and the other  underlying decisions and had decided to withdraw them and release her on temporary admission. It is clear that he hoped and expected that that would be the end of the matter. No doubt to his surprise and consternation, he found within a day or two that Radha had intensified her attack by serving an appeal notice against the decisions, of course being unaware of their withdrawal since CIO Khan’s withdrawal decision was never served. </span>

The presenting officer telephoned a Senior Case Worker who reviewed CIO Khan’s entry on the electronic CID log and then informed him that the valid decision had been withdrawn. When the immigration judge was informed that there were no pending decisions, Radha’s counsel, the presenting officer and the immigration judge agreed that there was no pending appeal and an order was promulgated dated 5 July 2011 that there was no relevant decision so that the notice of appeal was not accepted. In short, the FtT judge decided that because the decisions under appeal had been withdrawn, the leave to enter was reinstated and Radha was entitled to be granted leave to enter unless the original decision cancelling her leave to enter was reinstated. </span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt">   This was an erroneous way of describing the decision of the FtT dated 5 July 2011. Firstly, it was the appeal in its entirety and not just the appeal hearing that was not struck out. The FtT judge ordered that the appeal should be treated as being withdrawn and the decision as promulgated directed that the appeal was invalid. Secondly, the basis of the decision was not as described by CIO Khan. The actual basis was that, following the unpublicised withdrawal by CIO Khan of the decisions dated 24 and 25 May 2011, Radha’s leave to enter had already been reinstated and there was nothing left to appeal against.  . </span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt">   The third significant error was the suggestion that the FtT had authorised or granted permission to the SSHD to issue a fresh decision in the form originally offered in CIO Khan’s letter to Radha’s solicitors dated 28 May 2011. This suggestion was erroneous on two counts. Firstly, the letter was written after CIO Khan had withdrawn the decision dated 24 May 2011. Despite that withdrawal, the letter was written on the basis that that original decision was still in place. The letter suggested that he was prepared to strike a deal with the solicitors that, if he withdrew the decision and examined her case afresh, Radha would withdraw her judicial review claim. However, the letter made it clear that it was likely that, following that re-examination, Radha would “still be refused entry but now afforded a right of appeal”.  As already explained, CIO Khan did not have the power to provide a right of appeal for that changed purpose decision since such decisions did not carry one. </span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt">   The second inaccuracy was the suggestion that the FtT had offered a fresh decision. In fact, the FtT had directed the SSHD to give effect to CIO Khan’s withdrawal decision by regularising Radha’s status which could only be done by granting her leave to remain being a grant that she was entitled to following the withdrawal of the 24 May 2011 decision. The FtT decision went on to direct that if the 24 May 2011 decision was reinstated or stood, the original appeal would still stand. This was not offering anything nor was it stating that the SSHD had the power to reinstate or confirm that earlier decision, but was merely confirming that if the 24 May 2011 decision was somehow brought back to life, Radha could appeal against it using the present appeal. </span>

However, the FtT’s direction was that the SSHD should forthwith regularise Radha’s status with a grant of leave to remain and not to issue a fresh decision. That decision was made without any prior warning solely on the initiative of CIO Khan and had nothing to do with the FtT’s decision.</span>

In a further apparent attempt to forestall the judicial review scrutinising the detention decision-making process, CIO Khan issued a fresh decision on 8 August 2011 that was both unexpected and unexplained. It was served on Radha’s solicitors without warning on 9 August 2011 under cover of a letter from CIO Khan which stated that Radha’s case had “been reconsidered” and that “the previous decision has now been overtaken by the new decision attached.” The letter also drew attention to Radha’s right of a full in-country right of appeal and it enclosed a copy of the relevant appeal form.</span>

These grounds contended the judicial review claim had become academic because the SSHD had conducted a reconsideration of Radha’s case and had issued the decision to give effect to that reconsideration. The outcome was that Radha now had an alternative right of appeal so that permission should be refused since the claim was now academic. No explanation was given in the defence as to why the reconsideration had taken place, why it was considered appropriate to issue what was in effect the same decision but in a form granting a right of appeal when no right of appeal had previously existed or that the decision should lead to the withdrawal of the judicial review claim even though no relief was sought with regard to the original decision dated 24 May 2011which had in any event been withdrawn and was incapable of being resurrected.  </span>

The decision is not concerned with any relief claimed in this judicial review relates which is seeking relief relating to Radha’s allegedly false and unlawful detention and damages for breaches of her human rights and the UKBA’s misfeasance. The decision of 8 August 2011 was concerned with her leave to enter which could only be challenged pursuant to a right of appeal in the FtT and which, since the decision had been withdrawn, was no longer capable of being challenged. Furthermore, it was not correct that Radha had admitted to “assisting her sister sewing curtains.” Her admission – if that is what it was – was recorded as being to “help her sister sew curtains at home”. It is the case that this extract from the landing card was quoted in the pleading in addition to the inaccurate paraphrase quoted above although there is no quote from the further interview notes. </span>

His only motive in sending a copy of it to the Treasury Solicitor can have been to provide a smoke screen in the hope that the judicial review claim would fail so that there would be no investigation of this allegation. The pleader on receipt of these instructions was clearly entitled to assume from them, as well as from a copy of his letter dated 28 May 2011, that that the judicial review was seeking relief against the decision that had refused her entry and that that relief was now academic because Radha had received the so-called reconsidered decision that had granted her an in-country right of appeal. </span>

There is no other explanation, and certainly none has been advanced, to explain why CIO Khan had first issued the decision and then immediately forwarded it to the draftsman of the SSHD’s defence with instructions that this decision had rendered the judicial review academic.</span>

It also alleged that the notice was defective. Finally, and most relevantly for the purposes of this claim, it “profusely denied” that Radha had stated that she would assist Hansha in her employment as a seamstress and receive monetary reward in return (as had been stated in the notice).

In relation to the claims for damages, the decision merely stated that these “appear to be unarguable”. There was no consideration of Radha’s case that the interview notes had been concocted insofar as they recorded admissions that she intended to help or assist her sister sew curtains for reward or to work or obtain employment to undertake such sewing. </span>

The only reason given by the judge for refusing permission was that that claim had become academic as a result of the right of appeal granted by that decision. That basis of decision was clearly in error. In the revised explanatory statement, CIO Khan set out that part of the reasoning of the decision in a way that suggested that the refusal decision was correct. He had been the author of the decision dated 8 August and the instructions to the Treasury Solicitor sent on the same day so that he would have known that the refusal of permission was fortuitous and based on erroneous grounds.</span>

The explanatory statement was therefore incorrect to assert that the third notice of appeal was largely identical to the previous grounds or that no new information had been offered and no explanation was given as to how it was legally possible to reconsider the previous decision and re-issue it after it had been withdrawn and the FtT had in consequence ruled that there was no subsisting appeal – that is that the original decision stood and could not be re-opened or reconsidered. </span>

She verified the contents of her witness statement, was asked further questions in chief by her counsel and was then questioned at length by the immigration judge who, of course, took a careful note of all of her oral evidence. Having heard her evidence, he raised with counsel the unsatisfactory situation that had arisen. Grave allegations of dishonesty and abuse of process were being placed before the Tribunal as a result of Radha’s evidence to the effect that the summaries of two of her interviews were false in referring to admissions that she was said to have made and that she was interviewed on a number of other occasions in a malicious and bullying manner in an attempt to force her to admit that she had intended to take employment sewing curtains following her arrival in the UK. The SSHD had had full and sufficient notice of this evidence and of Radha’s case yet had chosen to be unrepresented at the hearing, had served no witness statements from the IOs involved and relied solely on the terms of an anonymous explanatory statement which had only just been served and which included statements about matters that had occurred after it was dated. </span>

It was anticipated that the SSHD would not only serve a signed explanatory statement identifying the officers responsible for drafting it and its revised version but would also serve witness statements which confirmed the accuracy of the interview summaries and which responded to Radha’s evidence about the number and nature of her various interviews.</span>

In fact and reality, the original decision had already been cancelled and withdrawn albeit that Radha was not notified of that until the presenting officer informed her of that fact during the course of the hearing of the second appeal on 30 June 2011. Since there was no earlier decision still in force, the effect of the immigration judge’s decision was that Radha was in the country lawfully and was entitled to leave to remain pursuant to her entry clearance since that remained in force never having been cancelled.  That is what, eventually on 14 March 2012 she was granted since, on that date she was granted 6 months leave to remain expiring on 14 September 2012.</span>

This application was given short shrift and was dismissed. The reasons for dismissal referred to the SSHD’s decision not to call the interviewing officer to give evidence and be cross-examined despite the well-rehearsed conflicts of evidence and issues of credibility. The refusal decision concluded that the immigration judge had heard Radha’s evidence and was manifestly justified in accepting it. The grounds of appeal were unarguable. </span>

The challenge to both types of detention failed because it had not been shown that the detaining officers did not have reasonable grounds to suspect that Radha was someone in respect of whom detention and removal directions could be imposed since she had said on two occasions that she would be helping her sister to sew curtains at home for payment. It was irrelevant what the FtT had found in January 2012, the critical question was what it was reasonable for the detaining officer to conclude in May 2011 on the basis of the information then available to him. The findings of an inquisitorial tribunal eight months later on the basis of much fuller evidence and information were irrelevant. Similarly, the </span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt"> principles were not breached during her detention since, until CIO Khan’s review of the case on 28 May 2011, it was reasonably anticipated that Radha would be removed in the near future.</span>

However, although Ms Lean also contended that the Article 8 claim was not advanced as a substantive head of claim and the conduct relied on to support the claims based on the three causes of action no longer pursued was no longer relevant, Ms Jegarajah contended that Article 8 and the totality of the conduct referred to in the evidence was relevant and relied on. It was contended that the criticisms and allegations put forward on Radha’s behalf were still relevant to the question of both credibility and damages and were therefore part of her case. In particular, their relevance went to the appropriate award of damages given that I had to have regard to the conduct of the SSHD and any behaviour which might have exacerbated her distress.</span>

That reasonable conclusion was based on admissions she had made in her further interview to that effect.

He had, therefore, deliberately falsified the notes. Furthermore, Radha did not intend to obtain employment. It followed that IO Newton did not believe that Radha was going to be employed or that she had admitted that she would be employed. His cancellation of her leave to enter was unlawful because it had no statutory authority and had been made for an unlawful ulterior purpose.

The right can also extend to conditions of detention where those conditions intrude disproportionately on a person’s physical and moral integrity or their privacy. The right to family life includes the right to enjoy, participate in, maintain and develop family relationships with close family members. This is particularly so in relationships involving children or, to a lesser extent, parents.

Radha’s claim as originally pleaded relied on Radha’s alleged treatment as amounting to discrimination on grounds of sex, race, colour or national or social origins and on her having been targeted in relation to the detention decisions and interviewing techniques on these grounds. The claim on those grounds was withdrawn at the hearing, no doubt on account of the exemption from the Equality legislation provided for IO interviews</span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt">. On the facts of this case, the allegations on which a discrimination case might have been based amount equally to claims under articles 5 and 8. However, although not pleaded specifically, the facts put forward in relation to the nature of Radha’s interviews and the concoction of interview notes gives rise to a possible claim for discrimination on the grounds of status, being the status of someone who is detained or imprisoned. The basis of that claim would be that because there is no comparable legislation for those detained under the IA to the PACE provisions applicable to those being questioned and imprisoned in the Criminal Justice System, particularly with regard to the tape recording of interviews and the conditions under which a person is questioned, Radha’s rights to be protected from inhuman and degrading questioning and investigations, to be detained lawfully and to respect for a private life could not be secured due to discriminatory treatment compared to those imprisoned under the PACE regime. </span>

It follows that the word “employment” must be given a common-sense interpretation. Since the word connotes a contractual relationship involving an employer and an employee, the relationship that constitutes the changed purpose in a case such as this one must have a rudimentary quasi-employment basis even if there is no payment involved. Thus, there would need to be a hierarchical relationship between two people where defined work or activities were carried out for the employer by the employee pursuant to a minimal framework of rules and with a duty of care, however minimal, owed by employer to employee. </span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt">     Regrettably, although the IR refers to employment as the prohibited relationship, Radha’s visa, in common with visa conditions generally, refers to “work” as the prohibited activity. The IOs who are responsible for enforcing this prohibition are clearly aware of the difference, albeit overlapping similarity, between employment and work. CIO Khan refers explicitly to the differences in his internal note explaining why the SSHD had difficulty maintaining its refusal decision in Radha’s case</span>

		<p class="FootnoteText">      See paragraph 148 above.</p>
	      </authorialNote>
	      <span style="font-size:10pt">. Moreover, the subtle shift from “help” as the concept referred to in the interview notes to “work” and then to “employment” in the internal documents and the relevant decisions speaks volumes about the IOs’ wish to transform what at best was a doubtful change of purpose into a clear-cut one. Further indications of the difference between work and employment can be gleaned from a consideration of those work relationships that are not also employment relationships. These include voluntary work, domestic work, homework, family arrangements and work when used to describe chores (as when a person states “I’ve got work to do”). </span>

Accordingly, leave to enter to take up employment may have been undermined by withdrawal of the offer of employment; [other examples of change were given] … . Consideration of cancellation on the ground of change of circumstances required an assessment from the immigration officer of all the circumstances including, for example, whether there remained a legitimate purpose for the visa holder’s visits which the visa holder could and should be entrusted for the remainder of the period of validity. The purpose of the power of cancellation is to ensure proper immigration control, and the use of a visa by a visa national for a visit whose purpose is unauthorised is, on the face of it, a serious matter.”</span>

Clearly, her claim for detention is based on that 5-day period. However, she is claiming general, aggravated and exemplary damages and has pleaded and put in issue the entire period from 23 May 2011 until her discharge from temporary admission when granted leave to enter on 14 March 2012. She is also claiming damages for breaches of her articles 5 and 8 rights for the entire period or, by way of a gloss of that claim, for the consequences of her detention arising from the SSHD’s unlawful conduct in covering up the unlawful nature of that detention and in harassing her in two subsequent FtT appeals and this judicial review that were concerned with it by pursing those legal processes unlawfully, maliciously, dishonestly and in abuse of process.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt">This submission is not correct for two reasons. Firstly, these two doctrines do not strictly speaking apply because the first piece of litigation was a hearing in a tribunal and the second is a hearing in the High Court. Secondly, the issues are not exactly the same. In the FtT, the relevant issue was whether Radha had stated that she intended to take employment. The FtT decided that she did not. In the judicial review, Radha is stating that the decision-makers concocted the evidence that she had stated this by deliberately making mendacious notes that that is what she had said on two occasions and that their motive for taking that course of action was to try and force her by bullying her to make that admission but she refused to do so. </span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt">      It is therefore necessary for this further issue to be litigated. However, it was incumbent on the SSHD to explain why the FtT’s finding was wrong since, on the basis of that finding, the SSHD was not entitled to detain Radha or to cancel her leave to enter. No such explanation was attempted. Thus, even without analysing the evidence in detail, Radha starts the trial knowing that she has already established that she did not say what was attributed to her. Her task in this trial was to establish that the decision-maker or makers had an ulterior motive in trying to mislead the court into thinking that Radha had stated that she intended to take employment sewing curtains even though the same decision-makers knew that she had not said that. In short, Radha seeks to establish that the decision-makers were lying and did so for an ulterior purpose.  </span>

This signed copy was not provided to the FtT or to Radha’s legal representatives but it was served unsigned with the intention of being used as an explanatory statement and it was open to the FtT to make use of it for that purpose even though it was unsigned. In fact, the FtT did not need to consider its contents since it decided that the appeal should be struck out since the SSHD had previously cancelled all decisions including the decisions under appeal. The explanatory statement was reserved following a direction from the FtT hearing the third appeal that it should be legibly signed  by the CIO and IO who had prepared it. The reserved explanatory statement had been amended by adding further details but it remained unsigned. An official from the UKBA subsequently wrote to Radha’s solicitors to inform them that “the Immigration Officer reviewed the case and updated the explanatory statement”. It is to be presumed that that is a reference to CIO Khan and IO Newton. However, neither was identified and the amended explanatory statement remained unsigned. It was, however, considered at the subsequent hearing at which the SSHD were not represented and its contents were not accepted since the FtT allowed Radha’s appeal. </span>

This was an unlawful inaction since it left Radha with temporary admission in a situation in which she was not liable to be removed and was entitled to be issued with leave to remain.</span>

	      <marker name="tab"/>
	      <span style="font-size:10pt">The evidence shows that Radha lived in respectable but modest circumstances in Gujarat in a close family unit comprising her husband, two children and her parents-in-law. She was also close to her own family members, particularly her parents and her sister Hansha and brother Laxman who had emigrated from Gujarat to the UK in March 2003. She had seen little of them in the intervening years and had, with the encouragement of Hansha, decided to pay what was probably her first trip outside India to visit them on an extended family visit. She could not afford the trip and in any case did not wish to leave her children for any length of time although they would be well looked after by her parents-in-law who lived close by. Her UK family lived together in respectable and modest circumstances and their wish to see and have a visit from Radha was such that Hansha sponsored her visit by paying for all her travel and living expenses for what was intended to be a visit of approximately 3 months. Radha left all the arrangements for the appeal against the ECO’s refusal of her visa application to Laxman, payment to Hansha and travel arrangements to her father-in-law. She had lived as a housewife since her marriage and had no previous experience of sewing anything elaborate, particularly curtains. In short, she planned to make the family visit of a lifetime.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt">The ECO refused her application for a visitor’s visa on the erroneously narrow basis that she had failed to prove that she had sufficient resources to pay for her visit. On appeal, the FtT judge found that finding was correct but that the ECO had totally failed to consider the alternative basis for a grant of a visitor’s visa, namely that her sponsor could and would fully provide for her. The immigration judge also found that she was trustworthy and would leave the UK and return to Gujarat when or before her visa expired.  These findings were readily available to the IOs who examined her on arrival in the UK, were considered by them but were not given any weight or significance. Indeed, they were inaccurately summarised in an unduly adverse manner by the IOs as is reflected in the summary of them in the explanatory statement. Moreover, insufficient weight was placed on them and on the telephone interview summary of the interview conducted of Hansha by a member of the ECO’s team prior to the initial refusal. The evidence submitted by Radha and Hansha’s sponsor’s statement as supplemented by the telephone interview clearly pointed to an applicant who appeared reliable and fully entitled to a visitor’s visa.</span>

Although was permitted to pick her out randomly in order to interview her, he was required to interview her in a fair and reasonable way and in a way that enabled her fully to understand the questions being asked and to answer them properly and in a way that fairly expressed her meaning and intentions. Regrettably, the preliminary interview was neither fairly conducted nor reliably noted down on the landing card. The interpreter was not an official Home Office interpreter, the language in which the interview was conducted was Hindi which she barely spoke, no attempt appears to have been made to ensure that she and the WIO providing interpretative facilities understood each other, she had no opportunity to check what had been noted and, in any event, the noted answers did not suggest, if carefully considered, that she intended to undertake employment sewing curtains and, in any event, the notes were probably written up long after the interview had been completed. In short, there were no grounds for IO Newton to conclude that Radha had admitted that she intended to take employment or that it was necessary to conduct further interviews and inquiries in temporary detention.</span>

There is no evidence that he had any factual or evidential basis for this hunch or of there being any other reason for him to have decided to further interview Radha in temporary detention. IO Newton also appears to have decided that he would be unlikely to justify cancelling her leave to enter or refusing her leave to enter even if he undertook a further interview. The evidence suggests that he was determined to cause her removal forthwith and that this could only be achieved if she was temporarily detained in order to give him an opportunity to cajole or bully her into admitting a change of purpose so that she could then be instantly removed without further difficulty or trouble. </span>

This was unreasonable and irrational given the findings of the FtT determination that was readily available to him on the UKBA information retrieval system. He was aware of this determination and consulted it as can be seen from what is stated in the landing card notes and the explanatory statement. The immigration judge’s findings were to the effect that she was a genuine visitor whose proposed family visit was sponsored by her sister and who could be relied upon to leave the UK before the end of her lawful visit in order to return to her two young children who would remain in Gujarat whilst she was in the UK. </span>

There is no evidence that he filled our or caused other IOs to fill out the relevant forms giving effect to this decision at that stage or that Radha was informed of why she was being detained. The only obvious inference of what occurred was that he subsequently invented the involvement of IO Reeves and CIO Norris, illegibly initialled the relevant forms after Radha’s further interview without identifying who had initialled them and added the names of these two IOs to the notes on the landing card to make it appear that other IOs had been involved in the decision temporarily to detain her. There is no other reasonable conclusion given the complete absence of a statement from IO Reeves and CIO Norris and of any internal documents that established that those two officers were involved in Radha’s case or were on duty attending to her case between 18.30 and 22.30.</span>

The SSHD even continued to impound her passport for a period after the third appeal decision of the FtT which confirmed unequivocally that Radha had never admitted to a change of purpose and that her original leave to enter remained in place. Radha was unable to leave the UK until her passport was finally restored to her 14 March 2012 following which she flew home to India as soon as she was able to arrange for her return.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt">     A further consequence of the irrational and unreasonable conclusion that Radha had entered the UK unlawfully and with an unlawful intention to seek paid employment was that IO Newton decided to exercise his power temporarily to detain her. There were a number of reasons why Radha’s temporary detention was unlawful. Firstly, the power to detain was being exercised for an unlawful purpose, namely in order to attempt to bully Radha into turning her denials that she intended to take employment into an admission that that was her real purpose in seeking entry despite the apparent reasonableness of her denials. Secondly, there was no evidence that she would either abscond if asked to remain for a further interview or that she would not co-operate with any further inquiries that IO Newton intended. Thirdly, there was no evidence that she would breach any of the terms of her visa save for IO Newton’s unreasonable predetermined and unshakable belief that Radha was lying. Fourthly, the final decision as to whether or not to cancel her leave to enter could be taken very quickly given that Radha’s brother was outside and available for immediate questioning as to her purpose, the computerised records of the FtT determination relating to her visa were readily accessible, a Home Office interpreter could be arranged within minutes for a telephone further examination which would inevitably be short since the range of possible questions was very limited. </span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt">The period between 18.45 and 22.30 remains a complete blank so far as the SSHD is concerned. No document has been disclosed which relates to this period. Temporary detention over a period of six hours would inevitably accumulate much relevant documentation and an explanation of why the detention lasted for such a lengthy period. That period might be explained by a lack of resources to deal with the passengers waiting to be further interviewed but, if so, that difficulty, the available Border Force manpower and interviewing facilities and the number of those awaiting a further interview would all have been documented. Furthermore, it would have been inevitable that relevant Border Force officials within Terminal 4 maintained a detention log, timesheets and personal logs of all officials concerned with Radha’s detention whether as interrogators, investigators, security or administrative staff or staff attending to those detained in interview rooms in Terminal 4 for sustenance, medical reasons or general welfare. Border Force would also have maintained standing instructions, guidance and policies concerning the conditions under which passengers should be temporarily detained. Finally, IOs investigating or interviewing Radha would have kept personal notes of their inquiries or interviews and there would have been records made that related to the booking and invoicing of interpreters providing telephone interpretation that included their names and the timing of the bookings and telephone interviews.  No such documentation has ever been disclosed and it seems likely that it never existed or has since been disposed of. Whatever the explanation for this non-disclosure is, it suggests that there has been a deliberate policy of withholding relevant documentation that would be supportive of Radha’s case that she was repeatedly bullied in this period in order to force her into admitting that she intended to obtain employment, a case that the SSHD was well aware of almost from soon after her initial detention.</span>

This silence is all the more remarkable given that IO Newton has provided two witness statements neither of which attempts to deal with this lengthy period – if only by way of hearsay evidence of what had occurred before he took over with and an explanation as to why the other relevant witnesses had not made a statement and what briefing he was given and by whom on taking over Radha’s case. </span>

The further interview was, therefore, unlawful from the start but it is clear that Radha maintained her denials of any intention to seek paid employment or to stay unlawfully in the UK once her visitor’s visa had expired and that her answers that are relied on as showing that she had made appropriate admissions were concocted so that the unlawful nature of the further interview and the absence of any evidence obtained from Radha to support the refusal of her leave to enter was compounded and exacerbated by the interview process that she was subjected to.</span>

Thus, the relevant decisions to cancel her leave to enter, to refuse her leave to enter, to detain her in immigration detention, to continue to impound her passport and to remove her as soon as possible from the UK were all ultra vires, unlawful, irrational, unreasonable, based on extraneous considerations and in breach of the SSHD’s policies concerning administrative detention. </span>

It should have been undertaken 24 hours after Radha’s detention which occurred at about 00.25 on 24 May 2011in Colnbrook IDC by a different CIO unconnected with Terminal 4. It would appear that IO Newton and CIO Davies decided to implement a premature 24-hour review at the same time as taking the decision to detain Radha to preclude an independent 24-hour review in Colnbrook IDC and ensure that Radha would be removed before any further review was required. It is noteworthy that a further review was required and, at that review on 28 May 2011, CIO Khan concluded that Radha’s detention and the related decisions were unsustainable.  </span>

The first is that he purported to reconsider the decisions “in an effort to avoid the matter going to the TSols and the ensuing public costs this will entail (even in the preliminary stages)”. This is an obvious reference to Radha’s judicial review claim that had by then been issued. However, it was no business of CIO Khan to tailor his decision to withdraw to the unrelated judicial review claim. If the refusal decision was unsustainable, CIO Khan’s duty was to withdraw it and the detention decision. Since he gave no reason, internally or in correspondence with Radha’s solicitors, that it was arguable that there had been a change of circumstances even though there had been no change of purpose thereby justifying the substitution of the original decision with a change of circumstances decision, the fresh decision would have been issued for an ulterior purpose and would have been unlawful. </span>

Firstly, CIO Khan released Radha on temporary admission despite her having leave to enter and by not withdrawing that temporary admission with a grant of leave to enter immediately after the 24-hour period within which to reissue a decision had passed</span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt">      Secondly the explanatory statement which CIO Khan prepared and signed with IO Newton erroneously suggested that CIO Khan did not withdraw the decisions but instead had offered to do so in a letter to Radha’s solicitors who had never responded. This course of action was justified by the assertion that the failure to withdraw the original decision was the result of Radha’s solicitors’ decision to lodge a notice of appeal on 1 April 2011 against the decisions to the FtT. In consequence, so it was alleged, CIO Khan undertook a further and detailed review of IO Newton’s original decisions that culminated in his deciding that the original decisions were correct. During that review, it was stated that he considered Radha’s ECHR grounds of appeal because insufficient detail was available to conclude whether the claims under articles 3 and 14 were well-founded although he was able to conclude that the claim under article 8 was unsustainable in view of the proportionate decision that had been made.</span>

In particular, he spelt out the details of a further review which never took place, at least there is no other evidence of it taking place, he maintained that he had not withdrawn the earlier decisions when he in fact had done so and he concluded that the earlier decisions were correct even though he had a few days earlier concluded that they were unsustainable. </span>

This attempt failed only because of the astute intervention of Radha’s counsel at the hearing who had discerned that there appeared to be no surviving decisions despite the failure to notify Radha of that withdrawal decision. This was coupled with the integrity of the presenting officer and the officer who examined Radha’s file who combined to provide the immigration judge with the correct information that the relevant decisions had been withdrawn and had not been reinstated or replaced. </span>

Furthermore, the temporary admission should have been withdrawn immediately  unless a fresh decision had been issued immediately. CIO Khan and the SSHD did none of these things, evidently as a result of a conscious decision that it would ignore the FtT decision since the only way it could comply with it would have been to issue Radha with leave to enter.</span>

His instructions were clearly misleading since they consisted of the terms of the explanatory statement coupled with a fresh decision also dated 8 August 2011. No explanation was given for the fresh decision and it was clearly prompted by the realisation that the SSHD had to provide a summary defence to Radha’s judicial review claim. The gist of this defence was to ignore the withdrawal decision dated 28 May 2011, to ignore the second FtT appeal decision, to appear to make a lawful fresh decision which granted Radha a right of appeal without relying on any fresh evidence and to assert that the judicial review had, in consequence become academic. Unsurprisingly, the summary defence drafted by the Treasury Solicitors in a great hurry due to the final order imposed by the Administrative Court, adopted this erroneous line of instructions with the consequence that Radha’s application for permission to appeal was dismissed on the papers by the Administrative Court. </span>

In summary, the two IOs decided that they and the SSHD would not participate in the FtT appeal, would reserve the anonymous explanatory statement with all its misleading statements intact and would instruct that no presenting officer should attend the hearing. When the FtT immigration judge adjourned the hearing with a direction that the SSHD should serve an up-to-date explanatory statement with the names of the CIO and IO who had prepared and were authenticating its contents should be clearly and legibly stated on a copy which also contained their signatures, on receipt of those directions – after the directions had been served on the SSHD after an initial delay caused by an initial failure by the FtT to serve the directions – CIO Khan and IO Newton re-issued the original explanatory statement with a further misleading passage to cover events since the first statement had been issued. Despite the directions of the FtT, both CIO Khan and IO Newton chose to remain anonymous and an unsigned re-issued explanatory statement was then issued. The decision not to participate in the hearing and not to instruct a presenting officer to attend was again taken and the FtT proceeded to a conclusion which accepted Radha’s case and found, in effect, that the preliminary and further interviews misleadingly suggested that Radha had made adverse admissions during these two interviews when she was to be believed in denying that she ever made those admissions. Remarkably, the SSHD, again presumably on CIO Khan’s instructions, applied to the FtT for permission to appeal on the grounds that the decision was against the weight of the evidence.</span>

This pretence was finally abandoned when Radha obtained permission for a substantive hearing of her judicial review claim. </span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt">It is first important to determine what it is that Radha is claiming for and is entitled to claim for. Her claim is based on the remarkable history of her case. She was detained in particularly extreme and unlawful circumstances in that the detaining officer from the outset was clearly determined to detain and remove her without the slightest evidence available to him to support that course of action. Throughout, he was determined to create grounds for removal and detention where none existed and he resorted to a series of unlawful stratagems to achieve his ends. He arranged for her to be interviewed in her preliminary interview in a language she was barely familiar with, she was detained without explanation and with no decision being served upon her, she was a single, obviously vulnerable and easily frightened woman in her early 30s who had rarely travelled, was tired and anxious and was known to have a brother waiting for her to whom she could turn for assistance had that been allowed. </span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt">She was bullied and harassed without explanation for several hours in an attempt to get her to admit that she was intending to act in an unlawful manner although she had no such intentions and made her lack of intentions clear repeatedly and to the obvious anger of her interrogator. She appears to have been kept in the company of a male interrogator and was not provided with a female IO who could have ensured that her treatment was kept within reasonable bounds, who could have brought a realistic and common-sense understanding of the likelihood of her sewing curtains in a private home for paid employment with no experience and limited available resources in a cramped private house. She was terrified throughout, she was provided with no access to outside assistance, she was formally interviewed in significant breach of the relevant guidance, admissions were invented and then attributed to her and the relevant documents were created after she her leave had been terminated and she had been detained. </span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt">She continued to be aggressively bullied throughout her time in firstly Colnbrook IDC and then Yarl’s Wood IDC, she was transferred without warning from one to the other, kept on permanent fright and without any sufficient means to contact her family save for an inadequate number of telephone calls. The obvious and overriding intention of the IOs who dealt with her case was to remove her as soon as possible from the UK having first bullied her into admitting that she had unlawful intentions, who concocted evidence against her and who left her at the end of her ordeal in a state from which she would take a very long time to recover from. Her reputation must have suffered, at least with the UKBA since she would undoubtedly wish to return to visit her aged parents, siblings and other close family members with her children but who might no longer obtain appropriate visitor’s visas and who would find it very difficult to fly to the UK for fear of receiving similar treatment all over again.  </span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt">In addition, she suffered considerable emotional stress and financial loss as a result of her wish to obtain appropriate redress for her false imprisonment and unlawful detention allied to the other decisions which were intimately bound up with the decision to detain her. For 10 months she faced a series of deliberate ploys which were unjustified and unlawful attempts to prevent her succeeding in showing that the refusal of entry and the consequent detention had been unlawful, that her treatment in detention had been scandalously and maliciously unlawful and that she had been the victim of a serious miscarriage of justice based on concocted evidence, untruthful statements, unlawful decisions and actions calculated to mislead the FtT and the Administrative Court into finding against her and keeping the unlawful behaviour that she had suffered under wraps.</span>

She was unable to return to her two young children and she and they must have suffered particular anguish given the circumstances in which she could not return, the uncertain length of her forced separation and the continuing uncertainty as to whether or not she would vindicate herself and her family from what she rightly regarded as a monstrous series of miscarriages of justice.</span>

Neither of those claims are justified given the lengthy and repeated identification of her case through the PAP letter, the particulars of claim, the two notices of appeal in the second and third FtT appeals, the renewed application notice for permission to initiate judicial review proceedings, the witness statements served in the third FtT appeal and the judicial review, the detailed request for particulars served at a late stage of the judicial review and the skeleton arguments prepared by her counsel in the renewed application for permission and the opening of the substantive hearing in the judicial review. Given this wealth of material, it was either wilful blindness or deliberate obfuscation for the SSHD to contend that it was unaware of the nature and extent of Radha’s claim. </span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt"> Each of these contentions is unsustainable. It is true that the claim as pleaded in the claim form is limited to a claim based on her unlawful detention. That claim was initiated whilst she was still in detention at great speed and it had only been made possible because Laxman had arranged with great perspicacity and determination for Radha to be represented by an immigration solicitor and experienced immigration counsel within hours of her detention. From the outset, her claim for damages included claims based on the bullying and unlawful conduct of the IO who is now known to have been IO Newton. However, her claim developed as the unlawful events and decisions unfolded. The first focus of her attention was the continuing threat to her of what she understood was the continuing decisions cancelling her leave to enter and refusing her leave to enter. Unless those decisions were set aside, she would have no claim for damages for unlawful detention and she would be redetained and removed without further ado. She also had to pursue her judicial review claim through its stages involving her application and renewed application for permission to bring the claim at a substantive hearing. Her case developed through these various stages and involved her in not only presenting her claims for her treatment unto the point of her release from detention but also in relation to the SSHD’s attempts to cover up its unlawful actions as part of its response to her appeals and claim. </span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt">It is clear therefore that her claims are now based on all unlawful conduct that the SSHD through CIO Khan and IO Newton subjected Radha to. That conduct is directly related to her unlawful detention because that was based on the other unlawful decisions that she was subjected to and to the unlawful conduct that occurred after her release from detention. Her case is fully explained if all the relevant documents and statements that have been produced on her behalf are considered. The SSHD has declined to engage with her case at any stage until the substantive hearing and then only to a limited extent. Any failure of it to appreciate and address the full extent of Radha’s case arose from its refusal to engage with it or to address the remarkable, extensive and inexcusable series of unlawful acts and omissions and their attempted cover up. </span>

This outrageous behaviour was assisted by the unusual exemption granted for particular types of immigration control from the provisions of the Race Relations Act then in force that have been reproduced in the Equality Act since enacted and from a continuing failure to provide recording facilities for schedule 2 interviews. It was also assisted by lax implementation of measures designed to control unlawful behaviour by IOs and CIOs in implementing schedule 2 investigations and interviews. </span>

	      <span style="font-size:10pt">It is to be deeply regretted that this behaviour was meted out to a wholly blameless family visitor who was an adult, female, vulnerable lone traveller whose sole purpose in entering the UK was to pay an extended family visit to her parents and other close members of her family who were permanently resident in the UK and three of whom were British nationals who she had not previously visited in the UK. For her, it was intended to be a family visit of a lifetime that turned into a nightmare of unimagined proportions. That nightmare was only rescued and brought to an end by her courage and determination and that of her family members with the assistance of the professional expertise of her counsel and legal representative. It is to be hoped that Radha and her family can now put these events behind them and resume a happy and contented family life albeit split between two continents.</span>
