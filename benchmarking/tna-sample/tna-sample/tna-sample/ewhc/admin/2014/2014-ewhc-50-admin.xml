He had lawfully entered the UK on a 6-month visitor’s visa and a valid passport. He remained as an unlawful overstayer and in the nearly 7 years he had overstayed, he is not recorded as having worked, drawn any benefits or committed any crime. He was arrested by the police in Corby where he was living in accommodation provided for free by his Church on 3 December 2011 having been brought to their attention on 2 December 2011 behaving in a strange fashion in the street. His unlawful status came to light when one of the officers who had observed him in the street checked his details against the UKBA computerised details and ascertained that he was an unlawful overstayer. </p>

There were four separate stages in his detention: his arrest and acceptance into police custody in Corby Police Station (“CPS”) between 3 and the early hours of 5 December 2011- a total of  about 34 hours whilst enquiries were made and the decision was being taken to detain him by officers of the Cambridgeshire &amp; Northamptonshire Local Immigration Team (“CNLIT”) and then arrangements were being made to transfer him to an Immigration Removal Centre (“IRC”); between 5 and the early hours of 14 December 2011 in Colnbrook IRC when he was transferred to Harmondsworth IRC; between 14 December 2011 and 10 February 2012 when he was detained in Harmondsworth whilst CNLIT was responsible for his case and between 10 February and 21 March 2012 when he was detained in Harmondsworth in the Detained Fast Track whilst the Harmondsworth DFT team was responsible for his case. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">  S’s behaviour immediately prior to his arrest and behaviour whilst in detention are now known to have been symptoms of florid and largely untreated psychosis which has been diagnosed as paranoid Schizophrenia with symptoms of cognitive impairment, perplexity, suspiciousness and severe depressive symptoms requiring stabilisation with the use of antipsychotic and mood stabilisation medication and other appropriate treatment following a lengthy period of assessment in a hospital setting. This illness had, it can now been seen, started to develop some months earlier but was, until his arrest, wholly untreated and its florid and fluctuating state had become active just before, or as a result of, his arrest. The illness was only finally brought under control after S had been released from detention and had been treated by a community-based psychiatric team between March and October 2012.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">   S’s claim is based on a series of allegations to the effect that his detention from the outset and throughout was unlawful because it infringed the SSHD’s related and intertwined policies of detention and detention of those suffering from mental illness. In short, S was suffering from a serious mental illness which could not be managed satisfactorily or at all by either Colnbrook or Harmondsworth IRCs and which clearly precluded his being removed from the UK in the foreseeable future. In order to consider this case, it has been necessary to examine in considerable detail the entire periods of detention – which lasted for 110 days counting the day of arrest and of release from detention. In essence, S’s case was that he was never properly assessed save on two occasions by an independently instructed psychiatrist who attended at Harmondsworth IRC on 21 December 2011 and 6 March 2012 but whose reports were completely ignored by those responsible for his detention until the Immigration Judge who considered his second report which had been included in the hearing bundle for his appeal hearing on 21 March 2012. He was considered from the outset to be fit for detention, for participation in his – as it turned out – lengthy immigration and asylum claims and proceedings, for removal and for flying and, although unfit for all of those activities, was left virtually untreated throughout the period of detention. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in"> The overall conclusion is that the claimant’s detention was throughout unlawful and that each of the decisions taken to detain and to confirm his detention were also unlawful as being Wednesbury unreasonable, and unlawful as having failed to take into account highly significant facts related to the claimant’s mental health. Particular failings arose from the failure by Immigration Officers to visit or interview the claimant whilst he was in CPS; by Colnbrook Healthcare Centre to report, and to ensure that its locum psychiatrist, who correctly assessed the claimant but whose assessment was never reported to anyone or acted upon, issued or caused to be issued a revised IS91 and a Rule 35 report (these were never issued); by Harmondsworth Healthcare Centre who failed to treat or manage the mental illness of the claimant throughout his time in Harmondsworth; and by the various Immigration Officers who failed to pick up and give effect to the evidence of S’s serious mental illness and to obtain further details from all three detention locations which would have highlighted it. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The claimant is entitled to substantial damages for his unlawful detention, since he would not have been held in detention for any part of the claimed period had the SSHD operated its policies lawfully, and if necessary additional damages for the sustained breaches of articles 3 and 8 of the ECHR. The damages for unlawful detention will need to reflect not only the period of unlawful detention but also the conditions under which the claimant was detained and an additional award to provide just satisfaction will be needed for the breaches of articles 3 and 8 if and to the extent that the claimant’s damages for unlawful detention do not fully and fairly reflect satisfaction for the matters giving rise to those breaches.</p>

Given the complexity of that assessment process, I will myself undertake that assessment – either by a paper assessment following the receipt of further evidence and submissions or at an oral hearing if that is sought and granted. I will give directions for this assessment at the handing down hearing of this judgment which will have built into them an initial period during which the parties are to attempt to reach agreement on the award figure and thereby avoid a further hearing altogether.</p>

He also claims damages for alleged breaches of his rights protected by section 3 of the Human Rights Act and articles 3 and 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights arising from the adverse way that he was treated whilst in detention. This is another case that raises the question of whether the Secretary of State for the Home Department (“SSHD”) has lawfully applied her policy relating to the immigration detention of those suffering from mental illness<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="1">

His psychotic symptoms can now be seen to have manifested themselves in 2010 but his mental illness only became actively psychotic a short time before he was arrested on 3 December 2011 in Corby by the police for being an illegal overstayer. This illness developed during his period in immigration detention and it was only fully treated and stabilised in the latter part of 2012 when S was under the care of a community-based mental health team in Birmingham following his release from immigration detention.</p>

S is Ghanaian. He was born on 9 April 1973 in Accra and was brought up and lived there until he came to the United Kingdom in 2004. His father was a teacher and his mother a market trader and he is one of five siblings of whom only he and a sister are still alive. His parents died within six months of each other in 2005 and his three deceased siblings had died before 2004. His surviving sister had come to England before 2004 and lived in the Birmingham area but at some stage before 2010 she returned to Ghana and S reported that she had then been admitted to a mental hospital there. He appeared to have been in touch with her at the time of his arrest because he was reported by the custody officer to have made two mobile telephone calls to her whilst in the custody of the police in CPS. S also had a surviving uncle in Accra since that relative submitted an affidavit dated 20 May 2009 for use by S at his immigration appeal hearing in the First-tier Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) (“FtT”) in 2012.</p>

He had a short marriage that ended not long before he came to the UK and he has not referred to any children that he has fathered. He flew to England on a pre-booked flight in August 2004 and travelled lawfully on a valid Ghanaian passport which contained a 6-months visitor’s visa that expired on 18 February 2005. The purpose of his visit was to see his sister and friends in the UK but when his visa expired he remained in England unlawfully as an overstayer. He stated that he had subsequently lost this passport and no valid or invalid passport was found in his possession after his arrest. Throughout his time in the UK, he never worked, save possibly casually as a cleaner. He spent much of his time writing unpublished books and poems. He was supported financially and emotionally by his sister, his friends and by the two churches he attended in Birmingham and Corby. Since his arrival in the UK, he does not appear to have had any other resources or to have made any claim on public funds of any kind. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.58in">S explained to Professor Katona, who was the psychiatrist that his detention solicitors instructed to undertake psychiatric assessments of him in Harmondsworth IRC (“Harmondsworth”) on 21 December 2011 and 8 March 2012, that he left Ghana due to his fear of a pagan fetish group, whom he always referred to as ‘The Fetish Tradition’, that his grandfather had been involved with. On S’s account, his parents and he and his siblings refused to have anything to do with this group. He was convinced that members of The Fetish Tradition had killed his parents and his deceased siblings by spiritualistic means as a punishment for refusing to participate in their activities. His own fear of the group arose because he was convinced that it was also out to kill him by the same means because he had refused their request that he should become the head of one of their shrines. He gave similar accounts of these fears to each of the psychiatrists who assessed him whilst he was in immigration detention and to others that he spoke to about his paranoid delusions. These accounts have provided the assessing and treating psychiatrists who have been involved with him with detailed and clear evidence of the paranoid and delusional nature of his on-going psychotic illness that, in its active phases, left him terrified and with evident cognitive impairment.  </p>

He became involved with the Birmingham branch of the Christ Faith Tabernacle International Church. He informed Professor Katona that in 2005 he had started to suffer from what Professor Katona considered from S’s description to have been recurrent symbolic nightmares with a choking sensation coupled with a low mood on waking. These symptoms lasted for about a year. There was no available documentary report of this first depressive episode or of any treatment that S might have had.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.58in">In late 2009 or early 2010, S moved to Corby at the suggestion of a friend. It seems likely that this move was triggered by his sister returning to Ghana. The origins of his detectable mental illness can be traced back to that time. Professor Katona, in his first assessment report dated 23 December 2011, stated that S reported that his problems started in 2010 or early 2011 “after his parents died and his sister was admitted to a psychiatric hospital in Ghana”. He started to suffer from depressive moods and in August 2010, he visited a walk-in Health Centre who prescribed him with citalopram, an antidepressant, which he took for about 6 days.  He started to attend the People for Christ Ministries Church in Corby whose pastor befriended him, provided him with emotional support and tried to help him to look to the future. He initially lived at his friend Bruno Edorh’s house but he was asked to leave because he disturbed the occupants at night by his restlessness, agitation and unusual behaviour. He then moved into accommodation on his own provided free of charge by The People for Christ Ministries Church. </p>

A triage nurse in A &amp; E referred S to BCLPS where he was interviewed by a liaison psychiatric nurse. S informed the nurse that he had not eaten, drunk or slept for one to two months, that he was experiencing recurrent symbolic nightmares and was depressed. The nurse’s notes recorded that he appeared to be low in mood with a flattened effect and that he had struggled to answer simple questions. He also noted S’s poor sleep patterns and appetite and his feelings of anxiety. S screened negative for paranoia, formal thought disorder, perceptual abnormalities, hallucinations and suicide risk. The nurse diagnosed that S was suffering from a “mild to moderate depressive episode” and he advised S to register with a GP as a matter of urgency and to attend his GP’s community mental health trust as soon as possible. S’s pastor was noted as having expressed disappointment with this diagnosis since he remained concerned at S’s suicide risk and mental state. S, on the other hand, was noted as not accepting that he was depressed and as believing that it was culturally unacceptable for a man of his culture and faith to have depression.</p>

The liaison nurse, the third to have seen him at BCLPS within a month, noted that S stated that he had increasing suicidal ideation, no energy, poor sleep and diet and negative thoughts. The nurse considered that he appeared to be deteriorating and that there was possible evidence of his responding to unheard stimuli. He wanted help but, either through cultural or religious reasons or through lack of insight, he did not want to discuss his mental health. The notes identified his risk to be his increasing suicidal thoughts, his worsening presentation and his lack of resources and support due to his illegal immigration status. The notes concluded: “Refer to duty doctor for further assessment as presentation appears to be worsening”.</p>

DEPMU contacted the duty officer at Cambridgeshire &amp; Northampton (East) Local Immigration Team (“CNLIT”), the local enforcement team covering the Corby area. As a result, at 15.29, a CNLIT Immigration Officer (“IO”), IO Neil Lawford, telephoned the custody officer who informed him that S had been arrested and was in custody at CPS as an illegal overstayer, that he had acted strangely when he was arrested and was continuing to act strangely and that his behaviour was such that an FME had been asked to attend the police station to assess him.  IO Lawford contacted his Chief Immigration Officer (“CIO”) at CNLIT who agreed that CNLIT would decide whether to serve detention papers on S and how to proceed once the FME’s report was available.  </p>

The police log stated that S’s nominated person, Pastor Emeka, when contacted by the custody officer, informed him that he did not know S very well and that he only knew S because he attended his church. The custody officer did not, at that stage, ask Pastor Emeka to attend CPS and visit S.  When contacted again later in the day with a request to attend a planned interview of S as his appropriate adult the following morning, a Sunday, Pastor Emeka stated that he was unable to attend at that time due to his church commitments. There is no record of the pastor being asked subsequently to attend CPS to visit S during his period in police custody. </p>

The note is timed as having been made with all other entries for 3 December 2011, at 19.30 hours at the end of a long day and after the decisions to detain and to remove S administratively had been taken so that little weight can be placed on the accuracy of the second-hand hearsay report of the FME’s reported off-the-record comments. Furthermore, the police station detention log contained many entries that suggested that S was not feigning his symptoms of possible mental ill-health. It follows that the custody officer is unlikely to have passed on such a comment to the support officer in the first place.</p>

The FME’s report did not record that S had referred to the possibility that he was an HIV sufferer and there is no reference to S mentioning this possibility in BCLPS’s notes of the three assessments that were made of his mental and physical health in September and October 2010. However, it is likely that the FME mentioned this possibility in an informal comment to the custody officer since it was subsequently raised as a possible organic cause of S’s psychosis by Professor Katona following his first assessment of S on 21 December 2011 and S also is noted to have referred to this possibility in his medical assessments. </p>

The IO’s note was, however, accurate in stating that the FME had advised the custody officer that S was suitable for detention, that he had not prescribed any medication for S, that he was apparently suffering from Schizophrenia and, by necessary inference, that he should have a full psychiatric assessment to determine whether his reported symptoms were active psychotic symptoms of Schizophrenia. The note concluded with a reminder that the IO who was to interview S in custody the following day had to collect a copy of the FME’s report from CPS.

The first item logged on the GCID system that both CNLIT and BEO logged into for 4 December 2011 was a note that BEO had received the detention pro-forma from CNLIT, that S had been accepted into the Midland Enforcement allocation system and that CNLIT had been notified of this by fax.

It is also possible that the cancellation decision was triggered by DEPMU accepting S for detention in an IRC or by CNLIT becoming aware that Pastor Emeka was not available to attend as an appropriate adult at the time arranged for the interview. Neither the detention log nor CNLIT’s disclosed documents record the decision that CNLIT must by then have taken that S would not, after all, be interviewed in CPS.</p>

This type of bed was requested by CNLIT as part of its original request for detention in an IRC but that request was worded by CNLIT and accepted by DEPMU as a “ring-fenced detention bed”. It seems, despite the confusing terminology, that the ultimate acceptance for a “ring-fenced bed” was an acceptance for a “healthcare bed”, which is a bed in one of the small number of small hospital-type wards within the healthcare unit and is the nearest equivalent to a hospital bed that is available in an IRC. Such a bed is to be contrasted with a “normal location bed” which Colnbrook reserved for S or a “single occupancy bed” which is a single room in normal location within the IRC which Colnbrook finally allocated to S. IO Dann understood that DEPMU had allocated S a healthcare bed because he, or someone on his behalf, later telephoned the CPS custody officer and informed him that “immigration” had arranged for a bed for S at a healthcare unit and that S would hopefully be collected “tonight” (i.e. during the evening of 4 December 2011). However, because the requirement for a healthcare bed was not set out in the IS91, DEPMU booked S into a normal location bed at Colnbrook IRC.</p>

At 04.00, CH carried out a reception admission assessment and the assessment report recorded that S had arrived with a note on his IS91 which stated that he had a mental illness and might be of HIV status, that he had consented to a full assessment by a nurse and that he didn’t know whether he had mental health concerns or if he had ever been on suicide watch. He was recorded as being very distant and vague and as displaying very odd and strange behaviour with poor concentration and a lack of response to external stimuli. The assessment advised that he should be assessed by both a GP and a psychiatrist. </p>

He had only recently, in April 2011, started to work as a locum with detained people in an Immigration Removal Centre (“IRC”). Since starting such work in CH, he had worked one and a half days a week there.  His notes recorded that S had difficulty with memory and blurred vision. He felt weak all the time with something in his throat. He had difficulty sleeping and was not rested. Food was a big problem and he had breathing difficulties. On examination, S appeared to be thought blocking and guarded. S explained to Dr Allen that spiritual beings wanted to take him over and harm him. Dr Allen’s overall impression was that S was suffering from a psychotic illness, possibly Schizophrenia, that UKBA should be informed of this impression “in his best interests” and that he appeared to lack capacity to consent. He prescribed a normal treatment dose of Olanzapine which is an antipsychotic medication. </p>

One reason for the adjournment of the hearing was to allow the SSHD’s solicitor to obtain Dr Allen’s explanation of his assessment which had never previously been written up. He was sent a questionnaire by the SSHD’s solicitor which he responded to in writing. The questionnaire merely informed Dr Allen that S was involved in immigration proceedings and he was merely sent a copy of his notes made during his assessment and his one follow-up meeting with S. It follows that his answers were not influenced by the views of others.</p>

His working diagnosis of S was that he was suffering from a psychotic illness. He was unable to be more definite on the basis of one assessment which had been conducted without any historical information. This was the normal type of psychiatric assessment carried out at Colnbrook. Dr Allen stated that he had based his assessment on his clinical acumen which was the normal diagnostic method used by a psychiatrist when undertaking a psychiatric diagnosis. He prescribed and signed for in the Prescriptions not in Possession or Supervised Prescriptions Register (“prescriptions register”) a 10mg nocte dose of the antipsychotic medication Olanzapine and had entered in the appropriate place in the prescriptions register: “Diagnoses - Psychosis” and “No. of Days - ongoing” thereby showing that this medication was to continue until stopped by a registered medical practitioner. Dr Allen stated that he had prescribed Olanzapine because he had diagnosed S as suffering from a psychotic illness. He also asked the CH team to move S to a single-occupancy room in the CH inpatient unit for further care, assessment and observation. </p>

CH should have sent a revised IS91 form in these or similar terms to CNLIT and DEPMU. In other words, CH should have sent out immediately after Dr Allen’s assessment an IS91 that fully and accurately summarised S’s risk in the light of the results of the assessments that had been carried out, which included Dr Allen’s noted and signed IS91 comments and which updated the IS91 that Harmondsworth had sent to CNLIT and DEPMU on 5 December 2011.</p>

Furthermore, his condition needed to be kept under close review and he planned to see him on each occasion that he visited the CH. He had it in mind that treatment in a hospital might prove to be necessary but he also knew that realistically such transfers took around two months so that doing nothing in the interim was not an ethical option. Moreover, S was able to take medication informally (that is non-capacitously but not objecting) so he might well have improved whilst still in immigration detention.  </p>

Dr Allen should have been informed of the Rule 35 report procedure by CH when he started to work there and he should have volunteered, and the assessing nurse or CH manager should have obtained from him, a signed Rule 35 report that fully summarised his assessment, diagnosis and risk assessment to enable all those directly responsible for authorising, maintaining and reviewing S’s detention to decide what if any action should be taken including whether he could be satisfactorily managed in CH, whether he should be transferred elsewhere, released from detention or sent to a mental health ward of a hospital and what further assessments or treatments should be arranged for him. The CH manager should have passed this report onto CNLIT for immediate attention and all necessary action including immediate consideration by an IO at an appropriate level could take place. These considerations would have been necessary because the principle purpose of a Rule 35 report is to ensure that particularly vulnerable detainees, including those whose vulnerability arises from mental illness, are brought to the attention of those with direct responsibility for authorising, maintaining and reviewing their continuing detention so as to decide whether continued detention is appropriate and to take all appropriate action as a matter of urgency. </p>

By piecing together the contents of his notes in the CH mental health records, the Part C entry he drafted and signed, his elaboration of his notes in June 2013 and his other evidence in reply to the questionnaire he was sent to answer, it is possible to identify the contents of the Rule 35 report that he would have made had he made one. That report would have been along these lines:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.38in">My assessment is that S is suffering from a psychotic illness that might be Schizophrenia. His illness needs to be fully assessed over a 6-month period by an appropriate psychiatric team. He currently needs appropriate antipsychotic medication and I have started him on Olanzapine with a 10mg dose nightly pending the results of a full psychiatric assessment. He should be located in a single-occupancy healthcare bed. He is not well enough to be moved at the moment from his present single occupancy room on normal location and currently needs to be kept under close review where he is currently located. It is unlikely that Colnbrook Healthcare has the resources and available accommodation to enable the necessary full assessment over an appropriate timescale to take place. I will visit him on each of my twice-weekly visits to Colnbrook. His health might deteriorate rapidly so as to need urgent hospital attention. Provision should be made to enable that to happen if necessary. He is currently unfit for removal to Ghana and is lacking capacity to consent.</p>

The email referred to the IS91 previously sent and to the intention to assess S psychiatrically and asked CH to arrange for this assessment. The only response was noted in handwriting on CNLIT’s copy of the email that was presumably written by someone at CNLIT in response to a telephone call. The note read: “All done already”.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.58in">On 8 December 2011, the GCID recorded that S’s induction interview had been completed within Colnbrook. No appropriate adult was present as was confirmed by a telephone call from “Jaz” at Colnbrook to CNLIT when informing CNLIT that the induction interview had been completed and the ETD was to be sent to HEO. No notes or other information of what transpired at this interview are available or, it would seem, were sent by Harmondsworth to CNLIT. No appropriate adult or legal representative was present despite the FME’s diagnosed lack of capacity by S to be interviewed. It is likely, given the absence of any detail of the interview, that it was confined to obtaining S’s signature on his application form requesting the Ghanaian High Commission for an ETD. Later that day, DEPMU faxed a request to CH asking whether S had had his mental assessment done and CH faxed back by return: </p>

A note on the CNLIT file dated 9 December 2011 indicated that the ETD application had been sent to the Ghanaian High Commission on 9 December 2011 by recorded delivery by RGDU following its being sent by CNLIT to “HEO” which was another way of referring to “RGDU”.

No reason was given for this decision and it can only have been taken for administrative reasons and without taking S’s mental illness or its management into account. There can be no other reason save an administrative one to have moved S at that time since both Colnbrook and Harmondsworth are located in the South of England and both are IRCs which accommodate those subject to administrative removal as well as those detained in the Fast Track. Furthermore, the decision appears to have been taken without consulting CNLIT and without obtaining from either CNLIT or CH a copy of the psychiatric assessment which it had been informally told had now been undertaken. Had CNLIT asked CH for a written assessment, CH would have had to have arranged for Dr Allen to provide a copy, he would have had to draft one and, once it had been drafted and sent to CNLIT and DEPMU, both would have become aware of the extent and severity of S’s mental illness. </p>

S’s failure to take his medication does not appear to have been brought to anyone’s attention by CH but this incident provided clear evidence of S’s non-compliance with his prescribed medication – a frequent occurrence from those suffering from mental illness - and of CH’s failure to monitor his mental illness. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.60in">S was prescribed 10mg of Olanzapine nocte for a period of 28 days on 19 December 2011. No note was made in the mental or physical health records to explain why this prescription had been issued, nothing was written in the box labelled “complaint/diagnosis” in the prescriptions register and the prescribing HH GP was not identified. Since this was a repeat prescription of the antipsychotic prescription that Dr Allen had prescribed on 5 December 2011 in CH, the fact that it was given provided clear evidence that the RMN had considered that S was still presenting with psychotic symptoms on 19 December 2011 and had referred his CH prescription to one of the HH GPs who considered that these symptoms should be addressed in the same way as Dr Allen had addressed them two weeks earlier. HH also made an appointment for S to see a GP the following day.</p>

There is no entry in the physical or mental health care records recording that this appointment had been made. However, it was recorded in the GP’s appointments rota that S attended and the obvious inference is that this appointment had been made to enable the GP to explain why a GP had re-prescribed Olanzapine the previous day and to stress to S the importance of his regularly taking that medication. The advice that S was given should have been noted in the mental health records and monitored by HH who should have ensured that S took this prescribed medication.</p>

However, the IS91 was inaccurate in several significant respects. Firstly, S had not been compliant with his medication in Colnbroook and had not been administered any medication since his arrival in Harmondsworth. Secondly, his condition was not stable since he had been re-prescribed with anti-psychotic medication the previous day and he had also seen a GP that morning about “meds” both of which suggested that his mental health remained unstable. Thirdly, he had not been medically or psychiatrically examined in HH in order to ascertain whether he was mentally and physically stable and fit to fly despite the outstanding and noted need for him to be re-assessed by a psychiatrist. Fourthly, the IS91form was signed by the Senior Medical Nurse who had not examined him and in circumstances in which there was no record in the mental health or physical care records that anyone else had carried out the necessary examination to enable that assessment to be signed off. It is therefore clear that HH’s assessment that S was fit both to be detained and to fly had been made in a hurry by a medical nurse with no knowledge and an erroneous understanding of the current state of S’s mental health and without reference to the HH mental health team or their locum psychiatrist. </p>

It had not been possible to arrange for Professor Katona’s assessment prior to it taking place on 21 December 2011 in HH. Professor Katona has an international reputation as a practising and academic psychiatrist with an extensive experience of assessing asylum seekers and others detained in IRCs who are suffering from mental health problems. His report, in the form of an assessment letter “to whom it may concern”, was based on an extensive structured interview with S, on various relevant mental state tests that Professor Katona carried out and on his examination of S’s healthcare notes. He concluded clearly and starkly that S required urgent transfer to a psychiatric hospital for full assessment and treatment. </p>

It recorded that S appeared withdrawn and distant most of the time and was preoccupied in thought. He seemed confused as to why he had been prescribed Olanzapine two days earlier. It was difficult to engage him. The lack of spontaneity in his speech raised questions. He kept repeating the phrase “there is something happening, but you won’t see it” but was unable to tell him what this “thing” was although he acknowledged that he could see “it”. The RMN’s note concluded that S’s bizarre presentation required further assessment by a psychiatrist. RMN Dube made no reference to Professor Katona’s notes although his meeting with S took place during the afternoon of the same day as Professor Katona had previously carried out his assessment. However, RMN Dube’s conclusions were consistent with Professor Katona’s conclusions and the two may well have spoken to each other whilst Professor Katona was in HH.  Furthermore, in the letter he subsequently wrote to CNLIT dated 16 January 2012, RMN Dube stated that his findings, that he referred to as the findings of the mental health in-reach team, were in material respects similar to those of Professor Katona in that both had found that S appeared perplexed and frightened with a significantly low mood. </p>

Medical Justice also emailed a copy of the report to the UKBA General Enforcement Office (“GEO”) with a covering letter that raised concerns about its contents and a request that the GEO should instigate urgent action with Harmondsworth and HH to arrange for S’s transfer to hospital as recommended in Professor Katona’s report.</p>

This does not refer to that report or its contents.

It is to be presumed that he had had no time to do anything more than scan Professor Katona’s note in the mental health records and S’s entries on the prescriptions register and, possibly, to have had a brief word with RMN Dube. He was clearly unaware of Dr Allen’s assessment or diagnosis or his notes of his two meetings with S in Colnbrook and, indeed, he appears to have thought that Professor Katona’s assessment had taken place in Colnbrook and to have been the assessment carried out by Dr Allen there since he stated in his report dated 20 March 2012 that Professor Katona had seen S on the 5 December 2011 which was the date of Dr Allen’s assessment.

He therefore, must have started his assessment with it in mind that S had been reported as having acted bizarrely, as having been psychiatrically diagnosed recently as suffering from an active psychosis which was possibly Schizophrenia and as someone who had recently been prescribed Olanzapine by HH but whose apparent psychosis might have an organic cause which it had been recommended should be tested for, if only to rule it out as a cause of his psychosis. His assessment note, written immediately following his assessment and his prescription of Mirtazapine written at the same time as that note were, therefore, building upon that presumed starting point rather than being the product of a psychiatric assessment of someone who had had no access to any previous knowledge of any of S’s previous psychiatric assessments, treatments or prescriptions.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.60in">The record of Dr Burrun’s assessment of S is, nonetheless, very unsatisfactory. The only contemporaneous record was contained in his virtually illegible handwritten note in the mental health records that he made immediately after the assessment. No-one appears to have read – or at least to have understood – the contents of this note since its recommendations were not followed up or reported to anyone.  He provided a brief summary of his conclusions in his assessment report dated 20 March 2012 that he produced following the second assessment of S that he carried out on 13 March 2012. He also produced an intelligible transcript of his 24 December 2011 note at the SSHD’s solicitor’s request in June 2013. It can be seen, however, that he has elaborated on his manuscript note when producing the word processed version of it rather than producing an accurate transcription of it. Finally, he also provided answers to two questions relating to his 24 December 2011 assessment which he prepared at the same time as making the transcript of his note. Regrettably, these four separate documents are not entirely consistent but it is possible to ascertain Dr Burrun’s overall conclusions that he reached on 24 December 2011 from a detailed collective analysis of all of these documents read with and taking into account the knowledge he appears to have started with of the psychiatric background to his own assessment of S. </p>

That diagnosis was to the effect that S was eating well and had a stable body weight. He had recurrent anxiety attacks and was worried about being deported. He had not provided any past history of community-based psychiatric problems and denied being prescribed any medication. He was calm and co-operative when examined. He was fairly well orientated in time, place and person. His mood was low and anxious and his affect was reactive. He denied any visual or auditory hallucinations or feelings of self-harm or ill-harm to others. His cognition was grossly intact. Dr Burrun’s overall diagnosis was that S was suffering from mixed anxiety and depressive disorder and that it should be ascertained whether organic causes for this could be eliminated. S should be started on Mirtazapine, an anti-depressive medication, HH should continue to monitor his mental state coupled with the RMN giving him 1:1 support.</p>

The GP saw S on 20 December 2011. The stated purpose of that meeting was “meds” and this meeting must have been arranged to enable the GP to discuss with S the need for him to be provided with and to take Olanzapine. Although S was subsequently stated by HH to have missed this appointment, there is no record of his non-attendance in the GP appointments log so that it is likely that he did attend it and the continuation of this prescription was apparently agreed since no record of S’s objection to this prescription was entered into the mental or physical health records.</p>

This statement is ambiguous and is consistent with Mirtazapine being added to S’s prescribed Olanzapine rather than replacing it. Given the history of S’s prescribed Olanzapine, the obvious meaning of these statements is that there had been an addition to the then current prescribed Olanzapine and not a replacement of that medication with Mirtazapine.</p>

HH’s interim manager sought to explain that error, without reference to any contemporaneous document or note, by suggesting that Dr Burrun had changed S’s prescribed Olanzapine medication by discontinuing Olanzapine by replacing it with Mirtazapine on 24 December 2011. That prescription, had it been intended and had it occurred, would not have been a change but a discontinuation and replacement of medication. Moreover, there is no evidence that that was what Dr Burrun intended and there is also significant evidence that he intended there to be an addition to the prescribed medication by way of Mirtazapine and not a discontinuation of Olanzapine and its replacement with Mirtazapine.</p>

The nurse and the HH manager were in error in drawing, and had no authority to draw, that conclusion or to suggest that Dr Burrun had decided to discontinue Olanzapine on 24 December 2011. </p>

The true position was that S was subject to prescribed Olanzapine continuously throughout the period from 5 December 2011 to 14 January 2012 but HH failed to administered it and failed to arrange for its continuation when the prescription for it expired on 14 January 2012. </p>

However, the contradiction is explained when it is appreciated that his assessment was, in his mind, a second psychiatric assessment which was intended to confirm or disagree with the first assessment of Professor Katona which he had not seen. Dr Burrun’s assessment, as it turned out, only contained one significant disagreement with his understanding of the first assessment of Professor Katona, namely his view that S did not currently need to be transferred to hospital since his diagnosed symptoms and the investigations as to their cause could currently be carried out in HH.  </p>

All three psychiatrists agreed that S appeared to be suffering from a psychosis which might be organic in origin and which had showed itself in his recurrent anxiety attacks and by his mixed anxiety and depressive disorder. He was perplexed and frightened and of significantly low mood. Professor Katona and Dr Allen both considered that S’s current illness was far more severe than Dr Burrun considered it to be and had the appearance of Schizophrenia but they, unlike Dr Burrun, had had the opportunity to delve into S’s psychiatric history in some detail, to observe his paranoid and frightened mental state at first hand and, in Professor Katona’s case, to test and assess his cognitive impairment. Had Dr Burrun been afforded sight of Professor Katona’s report and an accurate and full report from Dr Allen, he would have been alerted to these further manifestations of a significantly more extensive psychosis and mental illness and would no doubt have taken them into account in formulating his own treatment plan. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.60in">Both psychiatrists, however, agreed that the symptoms each had observed required basic investigations and blood tests to be carried out to determine whether the psychosis had an organic cause and, if so, whether it was either HIV or Viral Hepatitis. Dr Burrun recommended that S should be started on Mirtazapine 15mg Nocte antidepressant medication and, by inference, agreed with Professor Katona and Dr Allen that his pre-existing prescribed Olanzapine should be maintained. As he first explained 18 months later, he considered that a more limited range of investigations and treatments were required than either Professor Katona or Dr Allen considered to be necessary. These less extensive interventions could be undertaken within HH and S did not require hospital referral at that stage. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.60in">It follows that Dr Burrun’s only significant difference of opinion with Professor Katona and Dr Allen was that both Professor Katona and Dr Allen considered that an immediate transfer to hospital was necessary whereas he considered that S’s ill-health could be managed in HH without a transfer to hospital. There is no evidence that anyone else saw or read Dr Burrun’s notes or discussed S’s mental health with him given that his prescription records note is handwritten and virtually illegible, his assessment took place during the morning of 24 December 2011 and he was not consulted before HH finally responded to Professor Katona’s concerns in a brief response prepared by the RMN on 16 January 2012. Had Dr Burrun had the opportunity denied to him by both time pressures and circumstances outside his control to read and consider a full and accurate account of both Professor Katona’s and Dr Allen’s respective assessments and to have them in mind when giving S a more extensive mental state examination than that he had time for on 24 December 2011, he too would, on the balance of probabilities, have agreed with both his predecessors in recommending extensive assessments and possible treatment in a hospital setting.</p>

What is likely is that the nurse consulted the IS91 dated 19 December 2011 and the prescriptions chart.

S was also served with a monthly progress report to detainees which stated that one of the reasons for deciding that he was required to remain in detention was that his mental health gave serious cause for concern for his own wellbeing and/or for public health and safety. This reason had not previously been given as a ground for detaining him.</p>

She confirmed that S’s mental health was currently stable, that he was complying with his medical treatment and that he would only give cause for concern if he stopped being compliant with his medication and his condition then deteriorated. Furthermore, HH was not on antipsychotic medication and HH was not aware of any underlying medical conditions that S was suffering from. Thus, S was receiving adequate medical treatment from HH. If he was released, the level of care that he would receive would depend on the treatment that he had had before he was released and he would not necessarily be either hospitalised or have daily contact with mental health services. Finally, the recommendations, presumably those of Professor Katona, had been passed onto S’s doctor at HH to consider if further action was required.</p>

Moreover, S had only been supplied with his antidepressant medication between 3 and 5 January 2011 and had not been supplied with any medication on any of the other days since 24 December 2011.  Finally, HH had made no attempt to provide S with any of Professor Katona’s recommended tests or treatment. In short, HH had not provided S with any treatment or medication since 24 December 2011 save for antidepressant medication between 3 and 5 January 2012.

He explained the differences between Professor Katona’s assessment and that of what he described as the mental health in-reach team – a somewhat grandiloquent way of describing himself and 3 hours once a fortnight from Dr Burrun - on the basis that HH had been able to monitor S over a longer period of time than Professor Katona had monitored him and in consequence had gathered more information than he had done. As a result, he was able to say that, currently, the view was that S would not require any post-removal treatment. This reassuring diagnosis was, however, built on very slender foundations since the only documented monitoring of S’s mental health that HH had undertaken consisted of the RMN’s two meetings with S on 21 December 2011 and 12 January 2012. In truth, the RMN’s observation of S amounted to one meeting on 12 January 2012 and his assessment was based on that snap shot of S without addressing any of the points made by Professor Katona that followed his structured assessment. It is likely that Professor Katona’s one meeting had lasted longer than both of RMN Dube’s meetings. It had incorporated various mental state tests and it took account of S’s history of mental health symptoms. It was also consistent with Dr Allen and Dr Burrun’s assessments, with RMN Dube’s assessment following his meeting with S on 21 December 2011 and with the subsequent psychiatrists’ assessments. It follows that the optimistic conclusions reached by RMN Dube carry little weight in comparison to the remaining extensive body of psychiatric evidence.</p>

It appears that it was still in his possession on 24 December 2011 since Dr Burrun noted that during his session with S on that day, S had “clearly remembered that he had to go back to his room in order to fill up some urgent forms regarding his immigration issues”. Since potentially invalid notices of appeal are dealt with by the FtT duty judge soon after they have been served on the FtT, it is likely that S did not in fact send it off to the FtT by fax until a day or two prior to 18 January 2012. This is further evidence of S’s cognitive impairment and further support for Professor Katona’s diagnosis on 21 December 2011 that his cognition was impaired and was not fit to participate in his immigration appeal.</p>

Instead, S only had an out-of-country appeal against the SSHD’s decision dated 3 December 2011 that he was subject to administrative removal since that ground of appeal did not amount to a human rights appeal. S had in fact, albeit sketchily, served a notice of appeal that incorporated an appeal on human rights grounds which he had not particularised and that appeal was therefore understandably ruled out by the Immigration judge as not conforming to the procedural rules governing appeals to the FtT that required a prospective appellant to give full and sufficient particulars of the claimed appeal on human rights grounds. Such a requirement would have been almost impossible of fulfilment by an unrepresented detainee suffering from psychosis and cognitive impairment who was not fit to participate in the immigration appeal process.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.60in"> One obvious ground for S’s intimated appeal on human rights grounds, which was at least arguable at that time, was that the attempt to remove him whilst he was actively psychotic and without appropriate treatment to stabilise his mental state amounted to a failure to afford him protection under articles 3 and 8 of the ECHR. S’s failure to provide sufficient particulars of this claim or to make arrangements to be legally represented by a solicitor would appear to have resulted from his cognitive, depressive and general mental health difficulties. Such an appeal could have been pursued in-country as an immigration appeal and, had his notice of appeal been accepted, it is likely that he would have then been released on temporary admission to await the hearing of the appeal.</p>

His condition remained stable and he was complying with his medication. This response therefore repeated the verbal information that had been provided by the HH manager on 13 January 2012 and the information contained in the RMN’s letter dated 16 January 2012. Also on 20 January 2012, Pierce Glynn chased HH for a response to its letter dated 9 January 2012 that had requested details about the treatment that it had provided in response to Professor Katona’s report.</p>

This letter was passed to the Asylum and Immigration Unit (“AIU”) to progress the asylum claim and to decide on the basis of the asylum screening interview whether it would be pursued through the Detained Fast Track (“DFT”) with S remaining in detention or in the normal manner following his release on temporary admission.</p>

He had not been taking the prescribed Olanzapine at all since his arrival in Harmondsworth. Between 25 December 2011 and 20 January 2012, he had only taken Mirtazapine on 6 of those 26 days and, between 21 January and 2 February 2012, was not subject to any prescription since the Mirtazapine prescription expired on 20 January 2012 and was only renewed on 2 February 2012 when the GP in HH discovered fortuitously that it had expired when seeing S about his back pain. Hence, S had resumed taking Mirtazapine on 3 February 2012 having only taken it on a very occasional basis prior to that date and only taking it on a very occasional basis after 8 February 2012 and not having taken the prescribed Olanzapine at all</span>

This statement suggested that the mental health team at HH had reached a considered opinion following its monitoring of S’s progress since Dr Burrun’s assessment that Professor Katona’s diagnosis that a hospital reference was an immediate necessity had been shown to be unduly pessimistic. However, no weight can be placed on this expression of opinion. The HH mental health team had only seen S on one occasion between 24 December 2011 and 8 February 2012, being the meeting between S and RMN Dube on 12 January 2012. It had not monitored S’s mental health, it had only succeeded in providing him with his prescribed anti-depressant medication on 14 of the 49 days in this period, it had not provided him with any therapy or 1:1 interventions, it had allowed him to remain on A-Wing away from the healthcare centre and had made no contact with him there, it had incorrectly understood that S’s Olanzapine medication had been stopped on 24 December 2011 and it appeared to be unaware of the contents of Professor Katona’s and Dr Burrun’s assessments and, at the very least, was not applying itself to the recommendations and diagnoses of either of these psychiatrists. </span>

In relation to what was described as the main ground for the application, being S’s mental disorder, the Immigration judge considered that Professor Katona’s report was no more than a report of an initial observation of S which recommended assessment, HIV testing and a CT or MRI scan and which noted that S had been prescribed Olanzapine at Harmondsworth. However, there was nothing in the initial report that showed that S could not continue to be treated satisfactorily in the short-term in detention.

S informed the IO who saw him that he was being represented by another firm. The asylum interview record states that an IO then contacted Fadiga &amp; Co who S had stated was representing him and “on fuller enquiry found that it was evident that the other firm was not representing him”. An HDFT note stated that it did not appear that S fully understood whether or not Fadiga &amp; Co would be representing him and that he continued to state that he wanted that firm to represent him. It is relevant to note that S was assessed by Professor Katona a few days later on 6 March 2012 to lack capacity to instruct solicitors. It seems likely therefore that S lacked capacity to decide whether to represent himself or who should represent him and it is clear that HDFT did not undertake a capacity assessment to determine whether S had capacity to take decisions about his legal representation or to represent himself at his asylum interview.</p>

It is clear that the interim manager here is perpetuating the error that that change was a substitution of Mirtazapine for Olanzapine but there is no direct evidence that that is what Dr Burrun did on 24 December 2011 – the direct and indirect evidence is that he added Mirtazapine to and did not substitute it for the then current prescription for Olanzapine.</p>

Thus, HH had only managed to provide Mirtazapine on 20 of the 62 days that it had been prescribed when the letter had been written. Moreover, the 20 days that it was supplied were intermittent and in 5 separate runs of 3, 4, 6, 4 and 3 days. </p>

The HDFT interviewing officer noted that S’s medical (not mental health) notes on file stated that S was on medication but it did not state that he was unfit for detention due to medical problems and concluded that the “N threshold” would not be breached, presumably a reference to the fact that the interview could take place without S being accompanied by a legal representative or an appropriate adult whilst in DFT detention and despite his medical and mental health problems.</p>

He had stated that these were impacting on his mental health and that evil spirits were making him experience visual hallucinations.

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">The statement relating to S’s current compliance with his prescribed Mirtazapine was, apparently, accepted as accurate by Nurse Dube and he does not appear to have challenged S’s complaint that that medication was not effective. This reaction highlighted HH’s inadequate management of S’s mental illness. The prescriptions register showed that the factual position was rather different to that portrayed by this statement and reported complaint. As shown there, S had not taken any Mirtazapine in the period 27 February to 29 February 2012 (3 days) because it was either not supplied or not called for and in the period 1 March to 5 March 2012 (5 days) because his then current prescription for Mirtazapine had expired on 29 February 2012 and had not been renewed until 6 March 2012. It followed that the statement that: “He was currently compliant with his prescribed psychotropic medication (Mirtazapine) but he complained that it was not effective” was incorrect on two counts. Firstly, S had not been compliant for any of the previous 8 days since on 5 of these his prescription had expired and had not been renewed and 3 of these were because he had been non-compliant. Secondly, Mirtazapine had not been effective because it had not been taken and not because it or its dosage were inappropriate. In the 8 weeks prior to that 8-day period, his compliance had been so infrequent and irregular that any ineffectiveness was likely to have resulted from non-compliance. These facts appeared to be unknown to Nurse Dube.</span>

RMN Dube’s comments to Professor Katona suggest that his conclusion expressed in his handwritten note in the HH mental health records that he had written up immediately following his own meeting with S should be read with some care and as being qualified by his statement to Professor Katona that S “continued to show evidence of severe mental illness”. Similarly, Dr Oza’s “to whom it may concern” letter was written on the same day as, but without knowledge of, Professor Katona’s structured psychiatric assessment. In the light of Professor Katona’s detailed reasoned diagnosis that S was unfit to participate in his immigration proceedings and was in urgent need of hospital treatment, little weight can be given to Dr Oza’s hastily expressed opinion in his open letter.</p>

HDFT also emailed an urgent request to HH to read Professor Katona’s report and to respond in writing to the concerns raised by S’s solicitors.

Dr Burrun did not initially prepare a report. HH did not instruct him to prepare one immediately following his assessment and did not initially agree to pay for this report. However, under pressure from HH which was itself under equivalent pressure from HDFT given the imminent FtT DFT hearing and an interim relief application in this judicial review, Dr Burrun prepared a report dated 20 March 2012. </p>

His cognitive functions were grossly intact and he clearly remembered that one of his friends is waiting for him to help him complete a form that he had to submit to UKBA regarding his detention. Objectively, there was no evidence of him responding to any kind of internal stimuli or perceptual disturbances during both interviews. It has also been reported by members of staff that [S] has been functioning well on the residential unit where he is currently detained. He currently does a paid cleaning job on the unit and also enjoys attending the church on a regular basis. His compliance with medication appears to have been erratic but our mental health nurse has been seeing [S] on a regular basis and encourages him to take his medication on a regular basis.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.60in">Dr Burrun had not seen S since his first assessment on 24 December 2011 some 10 weeks earlier. His assessment interview lasted about 30 minutes compared to that of Professor Katona 7 days earlier which had lasted about 2 hours. He noted that S was presenting with anxiety and depression and possible psychotic symptoms and considered that it was desirable for him to be investigated for any underlying organic cause for his presentation, a recommendation he had first agreed following his previous assessment but which HH had failed to carry out in the intervening period. Dr Burrun considered it necessary to prescribe S with Olanzapine on 14 March 2012 and to repeat that prescription on 18 March 2012, on both occasions combining his prescription with one for Mirtazapine at double the previous prescribed dosage. He also advised HH on 13 March 2012 that S should be moved from A-Wing on general location, where he had been since his arrival in Harmondsworth nearly 10 weeks previously, to the in-patient unit. Finally, he advised on 19 March 2012 that he would come to HH on 20 March 2012 to access S’s notes and write his reports. These matters, whether considered individually or collectively, suggest that Dr Burrun considered that S was significantly ill and was suffering from a psychotic illness overlaid by both anxiety and depression.</p>

Dr Burrun did not explain why he had put S back on Olanzapine nor why he had increased his dosage of Mirtazapine save that his report refers to “possible psychotic symptoms” and the prescriptions register describes the diagnosis of Olanzapine as being for “psychosis” and of Mirtazapine as being for “mixed anxiety and depression”.</p>

The note continued that S had mental health issues and that Dr Burrun’s report had just been received that stated that he was fit for detention and was receiving regular care. The note also recorded that the London Area Routing Team had been emailed and requested to route the case to another LIT team and that HH had been emailed and requested to advise if S required a care plan and informed that the routing team, being the UKBA Asylum Routing &amp; Initial Accommodation Team, was to be advised if accommodation had to be arranged for S. It would seem that, at that stage, HDFT had contemplated taking S’s case out of the DFT, that his appeal would be adjourned and that his case would be transferred to another LIT who would decide whether to maintain detention or grant him temporary admission.  HH responded to HDFT’s request for information by stating that S at that point in time posed no danger to either himself or anyone else and that, on his release, he would be provided with a copy of his medical record including his blood test results to enable him to continue with all of his investigations.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.60in">On 21 March 2012, S’s appeal against the refusal of his asylum claim came before the DFT FtT immigration judge sitting in Harmondsworth despite HDFT having given consideration on the previous day to taking the case out of the DFT. S was unrepresented. His detention solicitors were not instructed to act in his immigration appeal because they did not have an immigration public funding contract and his immigration solicitors were not acting for him in his asylum claim. S therefore represented himself and the SSHD was represented by a presenting officer. The immigration judge had been provided with both Professor Katona’s and Dr Burrun’s reports that were dated, respectively, 8 and 20 March 2012. Dr Burrun’s report was only served on S and on the FtT at the outset of the hearing since he had only  provided it to HDFT the previous day. S gave his detention solicitor a full account of what had happened soon after the hearing and she set this information out in a witness statement which was included in the hearing bundle. The statement summarises what S informed her had happened at the hearing. </p>

The immigration judge then ordered that the case should be taken out of the DFT as S was not well enough for a DFT hearing or to represent himself. The immigration judge recommended that S should be given temporary admission and should be allowed to go and live with the members of his church who had supported him previously. The SSHD’s representative argued that the hearing should not be adjourned, that it should not be transferred out of the DFT and that S should not be released from detention on temporary admission but the immigration judge firmly rejected all of these submissions, did not alter her proposed directions in relation to the adjournment and the transfer out of the DFT nor her recommendation as to temporary admission to live with members of S’s church. The SSHD did not challenge this account of what had happened and, remarkably, the SSHD’s papers concerned with the hearing have since been mislaid so that they were not disclosed. Moreover, there was no additional evidence from the presenting officer or from his file as to what had been said by him or by the immigration judge during the hearing.</p>

It would seem that this decision was taken by HDFT after the hearing as a result of the immigration judge’s decision to remove the appeal from the DFT and that it then passed ownership of S’s case to the Solihull asylum team. No consideration was given to the possibility of granting S temporary admission and releasing him into Pastor Emeka’s care as recommended by the immigration judge. Instead, pursuant to arrangements made by the UKBA Routing Team, S was released from immigration detention by being granted temporary admission by HDFT with a condition that he should reside in UPM accommodation in Edgbaston. The named accommodation was a hostel maintained for UKBA by UPM and he was also instructed that he had to report to the Midlands Enforcement Office on dates to be advised. He was taken from Harmondsworth by an UKBA contracted carrier to overnight hostel accommodation provided by an UKBA service provider in East Dulwich and was then transferred from there to the UPM accommodation the next day by another UKBA contracted carrier.</p>

He did so by attending its walk-in centre and it is likely that this contact occurred following advice S had been given on arrival at his hostel. S did not bring any papers with him when he registered with the Bellevue. However, the Bellevue obtained a copy of Professor Katona’s report dated 8 March 2012 and arranged for S to attend a GP member of the Bellevue on 2 April 2011. At that consultation, the GP noted that S had a diagnosis of Schizophrenia and referred him with his consent to Yewcroft for psychiatric assessment and mental healthcare and told him to obtain copies of his medical records, prescribed him with the Olanzapine and Mirtazapine medication in the dosage he had been prescribed in HH on 18 March 2012 and made him return to the practice with that medication as confirmation that he had obtained it. Thus, S’s post-detention assessment, treatment and support were in the hands of the Bellevue in Edgbaston and Yewcroft which was part of the Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health NHS Trust. </p>

The representative from that firm who attended the hearing had only recently been instructed and he took instructions from S and Yewcroft by telephone from the hearing venue about S’s state of mental health and as to the reason for his non-attendance. As a result of those instructions, his representative sought an adjournment on the grounds that S had indicated that he was too unwell to attend and that a representative of Yewcroft had stated that a review meeting was to take place the following week to consider his condition and prepare a care plan. The immigration judge refused the adjournment application on the grounds that the further contemplated HIV test was not likely to be a determinative factor in S’s appeal and because the psychiatric reports suggested that there was little likelihood of S’s mental health condition being so extreme that his appeal could succeed on mental health grounds. The upshot was that S’s appeal was dismissed in a decision promulgated on 11 June 2012. </p>

These recorded that S had, inaccurately, informed the psychiatrist that he had been on his current Olanzapine and Mirtazapine medication since 11 December 2011. S had also reported that his sleep and appetite were satisfactory. He was noted to be preoccupied with religion and was still awaiting his HIV screening test results. He did not want to remember the death of his parents which he described as a “spiritual death”. He repeated much of his experience of and fears about the Fetish Tradition that he had recounted to Professor Katona. The psychiatrist concluded that S was experiencing auditory hallucinations in which Fetish People informed him that they could hurt him and was also experiencing visual hallucinations. The psychiatrist concluded that S was also worried about both his auditory and visual hallucinations and that he lacked cognition about time but not about place. The overall diagnosis confirmed that he was suffering from Schizophrenia. Belleview renewed his Olanzapine and Mirtazapine prescription for a further 28 days on 31 May 2012.</p>

However, he was not expressing any intention to deliberately self-harm or any suicidal ideation or intent. On 21 August 2012, a Yewcroft psychiatrist recorded that S continued to take his medication, which still included his Olanzapine antipsychotic medication, that he had some residual symptoms of paranoia but that he had no suicidal intention or intention to harm himself or others. On 5 October 2011, it was noted that S was still getting hallucinations and spiritual messages that he could not ignore. His mental health situation appeared stable.

Professor Katona gave coherent reasons why Dr Burrun’s clinical observations of S’s mental health symptoms and signs were, in reality, compatible with his own. Moreover, in relation to the apparent disagreement as to whether S was cognitively impaired, Dr Burrun did not undertake a detailed cognitive assessment whereas Professor Katona had undertaken one so that his assessment was much more reliable than, and was to be preferred to Dr Burrun’s assessment. Professor Katona concluded that S’s persistent delusions and hallucinations over a prolonged period of time from sometime in the autumn of 2011 until well after his release from immigration detention could not be explained or passed off as a psychological reaction to the stress caused by S’s detention. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.60in"> Based on this tangled and complex factual background, the following claims are now made on S’s behalf. He claims a judicial review of each of the decisions that led to his being detained pursuant to the SSHD’s power to detain in immigration detention and to his remaining in immigration detention. His basis of challenge was that that detention was unlawful throughout as being contrary to the SSHD’s policies relating to immigration detention in general and to the immigration detention of those suffering from a mental illness in particular. In short, it is contended on S’s behalf that he was suffering throughout his detention from a serious mental illness so that it was unsafe to detain him and which could not be satisfactorily managed within immigration detention. Moreover, the nature of his illness was such that it was, or should have, been apparent throughout his detention that it would not be possible to effect his deportation within a reasonable period. Furthermore, the relevant detention decisions were taken without all material relevant considerations being taken into account. This was principally because this information had not been available to the decision-makers because of a series of failures by the SSHD and her officials and medical teams that she was responsible for to follow statutory requirements and ministerial guidelines. Finally, the nature of S’s detention was unduly severe and it had had significant adverse consequences on his mental health, medical treatment and immigration claims. The relief claimed is now confined to a claim for damages for unlawful detention and for various breaches of his articles 3 and 8 rights for the whole period of his detention from 3 December 2011 until 21 March 2012, a total of 109 days. Overall, general, aggravated and exemplary damages are claimed.</p>

Moreover, even though Dr Allen’s diagnosis was not fully known to CNLIT, it had taken reasonable steps to ascertain what his views were and what S’s mental health was and had taken an informed decision that S should be detained, being a decision which was within the ambit of its decision-making authority. In any event, S’s mental health condition was manageable by both CH and HH and he therefore remained fit for detention. The SSHD also maintains that Professor Katona’s views were taken into account but it reasonably preferred the contrary views of Dr Burrun that S’s illness was such that he was fit to be detained in immigration detention.</p>

Principle (ii) is that the Secretary of State may not lawfully detain a person “pending removal” for longer than a reasonable period. Once a reasonable period has expired, the detained person must be released. But there may be circumstances where, although a reasonable period has not yet expired, it becomes clear that the Secretary of State will not be able to deport the detained person within a reasonable period. In that event, principle (iii) applies. Thus, once it becomes apparent that the Secretary of State will not be able to effect the deportation within a reasonable period, the detention becomes unlawful even if the reasonable period has not yet expired.”</span>

It did not directly address the situation of a person who is detained under administrative powers conferred by immigration legislation but this is cross-referred to in the next provision in the 1983 Act.</span>

In many cases, the medical advice as to the appropriateness of a transfer will serve as the reports required by section 47 [of the MHA].

Inappropriate retention of a prisoner in a prison or YOI [Young Offenders Institution] may infringe his rights under Article 8.

Where treatment humiliates or debases an individual showing a lack of respect for, or diminishing, his or her human dignity or arouses feelings of fear, anguish or inferiority capable of breaking an individual's moral and physical resistance, it may be characterised as degrading and also fall within the prohibition of Article 3. The suffering which flows from naturally occurring illness, physical or mental, may be covered by Article 3, where it is, or risks being, exacerbated by treatment, whether flowing from conditions of detention, expulsion or other measures, for which the authorities can be held responsible.’</span>

It is relevant in the context of the present application to recall also that the authorities are under an obligation to protect the health of persons deprived of liberty. The lack of appropriate medical treatment may amount to treatment contrary to Article 3. In particular, the assessment of whether the treatment or punishment concerned is incompatible with the standard of Article 3 has, in the case of mentally ill persons, to take into consideration their vulnerability and their inability, in some cases, to complain coherently or at all about how they are being affected by any particular treatment.</span>

The Court considers however that this difficulty is not determinative of the issue as to whether the authorities fulfilled their obligation under Article 3 to protect Mark Keenan from treatment or punishment contrary to this provision. While it is true that the severity of suffering, physical or mental, attributable to a particular measure has been a significant consideration in many of the cases decided by the Court under Article 3, there are circumstances where proof of the actual effect on the person may not be a major factor. For example, in respect of a person deprived of his liberty, recourse to physical force which has not been made strictly necessary by his own conduct diminishes human dignity and is in principle an infringement of the right set forth in Article 3. Similarly, treatment of a mentally-ill person may be incompatible with the standards imposed by Article 3 in the protection of fundamental human dignity, even though that person may not be capable of pointing to any specific ill-effects.’</span>

After the amendment had taken effect, such persons were redefined to be “those suffering serious mental illness which cannot be satisfactorily managed within detention”.  This amendment, whether or not it amounted to a change of policy, required the SSHD, as part of its public sector equality duty, to undertake an Equality Impact Assessment of the proposed reformulation of the policy to ascertain whether the reformulated policy increased the risk that its implementation would give rise to discrimination against those suffering from mental illness or whether the policy could or should be reformulated so as to reduce that risk. The risk in question was whether those immigration detainees who were suffering from serious mental illness could not or would not be satisfactorily managed in an IRC. </p>

At para. 39 Mr Barrett explains the concern that led to the change in the EIG as follows: "the words (of the pre-August policy) led the Court to attribute a meaning to the guidance which did not reflect the actual policy. The Secretary of State was concerned that there was a disjuncture between the guidance as interpreted and the policy, so the terms of the guidance were updated by the addition of a few words to say explicitly what had always been understood as the policy".</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">In my judgement there was a change in at least the stated policy. There was obviously a change of wording, in other words a reformulation of it. Even if the Defendant did not intend that to be a substantive change in her own policy, there are two reasons why the public sector equality duties were triggered by that reformulation. The first is that the meaning of a policy is an objective matter: whatever the subjective intentions of its authors, the formulation matters because the words which express a policy affect the public, not just officials within a department, for example individuals who are liable to detention and those who advise them. The reason why public law has in recent years come to recognise the importance of adherence (in general) to policy statements is that they serve an important function in maintaining the rule of law, which is of particular importance when fundamental rights such as the right to personal liberty are at stake.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">The second reason is that, even on the Defendant's own evidence, she was seeking to reformulate the policy to re-align it to what had been thought within the department to be its practice all along. The courts had given an interpretation to the policy which did not accord with the practice of the Defendant's department. But that is implicitly to acknowledge that in fact there was a change of policy if not of practice. It was common ground before me that, in the present context at least, the meaning of a policy is ultimately a question for the courts, not one for the executive. If that is right, then when the words of a policy are altered, that is a change in policy. It was clearly intended to have some effect, otherwise it would have been a pointless exercise.</span>

Although I see force in that submission, it is unnecessary to consider it further since the Defendant accepts in these proceedings that, if there was a change of policy in August 2010, the usual practice under the public sector equality duties was not followed. For example, there was no equality impact assessment. In my judgement, there was a breach of the duties in section 71 of the 1976 Act and section 49A of the 2005 Act.</span>

Secondly, they must normally be followed before a relevant decision is taken, not afterwards. This is in accordance with normal principles of administrative law: whenever a relevant consideration is not taken into account, the normal remedy will be for the Court to quash the resulting decision, or at least declare it to be unlawful: see e.g. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">. It is not normally for the Court to anticipate or pre-empt what a lawful decision would be if the correct process had been followed. This is precisely because the function of the court in judicial review cases is to assess the legality of the executive's actions and not to substitute its own view of the merits of a decision or policy. Thirdly, it seems to me that the context of personal liberty is important. It may well be that individuals have been detained under the new formulation of the policy who would not have been detained under the old one. Fourthly, although section 71 of the 1976 Act and section 49A of the 2005 Act have been repealed, they have been replaced by similar provisions in section 149 of the Equality Act 2010. As Mr Kittle's witness statement makes clear in the passages I have already quoted, the Defendant takes those duties seriously and is committed to undertaking a full EIA in the present context. The issue is on any view far from academic.</span>

However, it seems to me to be unnecessary to address that submission in the light of my decision that the policy was unlawful because it failed to comply with the public sector equality duties. There will have to be a reconsideration of the policy in the light of this judgment. Furthermore, the Defendant is committed to a consultation exercise, as Mr Kittle says in the passages I have quoted, in which the views of interested organisations will be taken into account. The policy may well end up in a form which is satisfactory to those organisations or which, on any view, does not carry the risks of which the Claimant complains.”</span>

In short, it was now clear that some mentally ill detainees would have been detained before August 2010 since they were suffering from a mental illness but it was not sufficiently serious and/or was manageable in detention.</span>

On the SSHD’s case, S falls into the latter category and, if that was so, would be someone who would still be subject to release from detention – absent exceptional circumstances – under the policy as previously applied since he was undoubtedly “mentally ill” even though he would not on this hypothesis have been suffering from a “serious mental illness” and/or was one whose illness however serious could be managed in detention.  </span>

However, the same symptoms can also have organic causes and it is often necessary, as in S’s case, to screen out or confirm possible organic causes such as HIV since the necessary treatment will be different and possibly more extensive. Similarly, there will often be a complex inter-relationship between a mental disability and physical ill-health so that the diagnosis, treatment, prevention and cure of a sufferer’s physical ill-health must go hand-in-hand with treatment for any mental disorder. A yet further difficulty is that mental disability is not neatly packaged into watertight compartments or clutches of symptoms so that the necessary assessment and treatment must be tailored to the full range of symptoms and disabilities that the sufferer presents with.  </p>

These could have included any of the following possible events which his remarks have on occasion alluded to: S’s possible ill-treatment when he was a child, the untimely death of both his parents in rapid succession, the deaths of  four of his siblings at relatively young ages, his and his family’s experiences of the activities of pagan spiritualists whom he referred to as the “Fetish Tradition”, his self-reported unhappy marriage and its termination, his possibly ambivalent relationship with his sister who he lived with or close by to for a time in England and, as reported by him, her mental health difficulties, his isolation and his penurious and chaotic lifestyle whilst living in England, his terror of being returned to Ghana and his uncertainty as to whether he was an HIV sufferer. What is clear from the totality of the diagnoses is that Dr Burrun’s attribution of the trigger of S’s psychosis to his situational stress due to his immigration difficulties in his report dated 20 March 2012 was unduly limited albeit that his situational stress could have contributed to the enhancement of his symptoms whilst he was in immigration detention. </p>

Its initial manifestation can occur at any age, its intensity can vary over time and it can be subject to variable periods of remission and relapse often as a result of a patient’s failure to maintain his prescribed medication. Its ill-effects can usually be controlled by antipsychotic medication but its underlying symptoms are usually never eliminated. Diagnosis is often a long and difficult process. Many sufferers are and remain in denial of their mental disorder and of the need to take and maintain their prescribed medication particularly since there is still wide-spread cultural, historic and ill-informed aversion to mental ill-health. In an acute form and if untreated, its effects on the mental and physical health of a sufferer can be devastating. The purpose of medication is to control a patient’s psychotic, depressive, anxiety and other symptoms and to ameliorate their ill-effects. These ill-effects can include the impairment of a patient’s mental capacity, general health and ability to function. Many patients will be at risk of causing themselves or others harm. </p>

The identification of the appropriate medications and their dosage is often a long process of trial and error and many patients suffer seriously debilitating and painful side effects from the antipsychotic medication that they are prescribed with which they must learn how to accept and live with.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.60in">The MHA provides a complex statutory structure to underpin the compulsory treatment of mental disorder. Treatment will always be voluntary if a sufferer will accept and participate fully in it. However, many sufferers will not acknowledge or even appreciate that they are ill, that they are a danger to themselves and to others or that they must accept and participate in long-term treatment in a confined environment involving medication which can be unpleasant in both its administration and its side effects. For that reason, many patients must be detained and treated compulsorily, albeit for as short a time as possible, a process which is often described as “sectioning”. Such compulsory action is only permitted if the sufferer is suffering from a mental disability which in its nature or degree requires treatment. If, but only if, that treatment can only be provided in a hospital setting, the sufferer may be detained subject to stringent statutory safeguards. The process of assessment, treatment, detention and discharge is administered by mental health teams, both in mental health units or wards in hospitals and in the community. These teams and the treatment and support that they provide, are led by psychiatrists with the assistance of psychologists, nurses, social workers, therapists and other professionals all of whom have had appropriate training to enable them to work with sufferers of mental disorders. </p>

The application of immigration detention in such circumstances is made more difficult still by the lack of any clear overall and comprehensive guidance for those involved in the immigration detention process and as to the training that they should receive about mental impairments and disabilities of all kinds. Unfortunately, there are many misconceptions and much mistaken thinking about the nature and treatment of mental illness. This is particularly unfortunate because of almost irreconcilable objectives of immigration control enforcement and the diagnosis and treatment of those who are suffering from a mental disability whose immigration status is being enforced.   </p>

This diagnosis therefore involved a mental state assessment and treatment prognosis based on all available historic evidence of the patient’s previous involvements with mental health services and of his relevant past history. In other words, the assessment was not merely a snapshot of the patient’s health at the time of the assessment but a diagnosis, a risk assessment and a prognosis of the treatment required based on the patient’s historic, present and predicted symptoms. </span>

CNLIT remained responsible for the enforcement of S’s unlawful immigration status until his case was passed onto HDFT on 10 February 2012 after the decision had been taken to place S’s asylum appeal in the DFT. These two teams liaised with DEPMU who were responsible for arranging for appropriate placement for S whilst he was in immigration detention and for arranging his movement from police custody into immigration detention and between IRCs. However, during their respective periods of involvement, CNLIT and then HDFT were responsible for the management of S’s detention and removal and, in UKBA jargon, owned S’s case.</p>

This statement was served as part of the additional evidence served after the oral hearing and before closing submissions were prepared. Mr Humphreys had only been appointed to this post in April 2012 after S had been released from detention and he had no personal knowledge of S’s case. He had, however, read and carefully reviewed S’s detention files and GCID records but had not been provided with a copy of the hearing bundle. He had also spoken to individual decision makers to clarify relevant points. He did not identify these decision-makers nor the relevant points that they had clarified for him.  He reached the conclusion that CNLIT decision-makers paid due attention to the requirements of EIG 55.10 and the advice received from CH and HH professionals, that the same decisions would have been taken had any shortcoming in that advice not occurred and that S was correctly detained since he would not have complied with the conditions that he would have been subject to had he been granted temporary admission.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.60in">This evidence was very unsatisfactory. CNLIT had been responsible for all 8 detention decisions taken between 3 December 2011 and 14 January 2012. It had also had overall responsibility for the decisions leading to S not being interviewed yet spending 34 hours in immigration detention in CPS, in being transferred from Colnbrook to Harmondsworth 9 days after arriving in Colnbrook without seeking and obtaining sight of a psychiatric assessment report on S, in not insisting that HH produced a psychiatric assessment report that answered all points raised by Professor Katona’s letter, in pressing ahead with S’s ETD application, in resisting his bail application and in supporting his transfer to the DFT on 10 February 2011. It was also responsible for ensuring that HH could manage S and his mental illness and in monitoring that management. Despite all those points of involvement in S’s detention and the wide-ranging challenge made by this claim, CNLIT did not put forward any witness who had been directly involved in his detention or seek to answer the specific complaints about each of the decisions being challenged. Instead, the manager of CNLIT’s compliance team with no personal knowledge of the history of S’s detention provided vague and unsubstantiated general denials which did not address any specific complaint, which did not identify the evidence he had obtained from other sources, none of whom he identified and was not even based on a detailed perusal of HH files relating to S’s healthcare. This generalised evidence concluded with the wholly unsubstantiated assertion that CNLIT had no responsibility for any failures by HH to provide it with evidence which, had it been provided, would have made no difference to the decisions that were taken. I can therefore place no weight on this evidence.  </p>

The intended provision for a counsellor remained unfilled. It is clear from the correspondence and other documents emanating from HH that were in the hearing bundle that this evidence was neither complete nor wholly accurate. HH had no manager in post for at least most, if not all of the time that S was located in Harmondsworth and the documentary evidence suggests that throughout that time there was only one full-time mental health nurse, Nurse Dube, working there. Thus, the mental health team was, in reality, one full-time nurse and visit from a locum psychiatrist for a three-hour visit once a fortnight working within a Healthcare Centre which was also stretched in terms of its physical health team and which was being run by an interim manager.  </p>

The induction and departure unit was overstretched. The provision for mental health was criticised, and said to require "urgent attention". The report made 60 recommendations which were accepted by UKBA, but by the end of 2010, only 22 had been fully put into effect.

Mr Crook applied what he stated to be the appropriate criteria to determine whether S should continue to be detained in the DFT process, namely “whether S was presenting with acute psychosis, e.g. Schizophrenia, who [was someone who] required hospitalisation”. These criteria were stated to have been agreed between the parties to be the only arguable criteria. However, they were not the only applicable criteria since the decision-maker was also required to check that the conditions of detention under both the <span style="font-style:italic">Hardial Singh </span> and EIG 55.10 guidelines applied and that their application resulted in a conclusion that S should be detained. Mr Crook does not mention these guidelines in his witness statement and there is no reference to them in the HDFT Detention Record as the criteria that had been applied by him in reaching his decision confirming S’s detention. Moreover, the Detention Record that he signed does not appear to have been counter-signed by a CIO or HMI as required by the SSHD’s detention policy. </p>

If S was suffering from an active and florid psychosis for all or most of his time in detention, his illness involved a serious mental illness and its management involved assessment, observation, medication, therapy and psychological, occupational and other therapeutic interventions. All these consequences of his illness had to be satisfactorily managed by the Healthcare Centres located in Colnbrook and Harmondsworth. In other words, on the facts of this case, once mental illness had been diagnosed as a possible explanation for S’s bizarre behaviour and his other related symptoms, the self-evident seriousness of his illness was such that it was possible for a decision-maker to move straight to the question of its suitable manageability without dwelling upon the somewhat casuistical question of the difference between a mental illness and a serious mental illness and then to conclude that, on any objective view, neither CH nor HH could be regarded as being capable of managing that illness. If the facts showed that S’s illness was both serious and unmanageable by CH or HH, his detention was unlawful as it would have been had the appropriate test been one of suffering from a mental illness. </p>

However, what had to be managed in this case was a psychotic illness that was developing and which was, in its early stages, florid, unstable, untreated by medication and becoming increasingly debilitating in relation to S’s cognitive functions. These difficulties were intensified by S being non-compliant, lacking in cognitive ability and in capacity and in denial. Thus, what had to be managed, certainly in the early stages of S’s illness, was an intensive and consistent regime involving a combination of assessment, monitoring and treatment. The purpose of this regime was to stabilise and control S’s symptoms and to identify a type, dose and method of administration of the relevant medication or medications, to establish a consistently and reliable method of administering that medication and to motivate and educate S to follow that regime, to take control of his fears, delusions and paranoia and to regain his cognitive abilities. As was subsequently shown to be the case, this regime required a lengthy period in which assessment and its associated treatments would be carried out in unison. S was, as it turned out, remarkably fortunate that the failure to provide this regime did not have very serious long-term consequences for him.  It was, nonetheless, the case that neither CH nor HH had the capability of satisfactorily managing S’s mental illness nor, as they both proved, were they in fact able to so manage it. </p>

This potentially gave rise to difficulties since Code C’s provisions were drafted so that provisions relevant to, say, those suffering from a mental disability, were spread across many of its paragraphs and annexes, not all of which were expressly referred to in EIG Chapter 38. Furthermore, Code C was applicable to those temporarily held in custody pending a decision by a CIO whether they should be served with immigration detention papers. Thus, S was subject to Code C for the first 3½ hours of his time in police custody in CPS but not for the remaining 30½ hours.   </p>

This was because it would not have been clear to the custody officer in such a situation whether he should summon an appropriate adult to the police station to see the detainee or a psychiatrist or an AMHP to assess the patient’s mental health or whether he should arrange for a transfer to hospital for mental health assessment and treatment.  This was because paragraphs directly relevant to that situation were not directly referred to in EIG Chapter 38. These paragraphs included those concerned with undertaking risk assessments to determine whether a detainee was likely to present a risk to himself, with the need to arrange a visit from the appropriate adult if the detainee was mentally disordered, with the need to ensure that a detainee who appeared to be suffering from a mental disorder received appropriate clinical attention from a health care professional in the police station or a hospital and with whether an appropriate adult should be arranged to attend an interview<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="96">

Given the considerations that I have referred to, these further provisions of Code C should be considered to have been incorporated into the EIG Chapter 38 policy governing the treatment of mentally disordered immigration detainees by necessary implication. Furthermore, it was necessary for them to be given effect to in appropriate cases so as to avoid possible unlawful discrimination arising from possible differences of treatment of those in immigration detention suffering from a mental disability and those in ordinary police custody with a similar disability.  </p>

S’s behaviour was such that the custody officer considered that in addition to his being vacant and not understanding what was being said, he was at risk of harming himself and might be suffering from a mental illness so that he should be kept under CCTV surveillance and visited in his cell every 30 minutes.

This was particularly so since CIO Evans, an IO at the appropriate level to authorise S’s immigration detention, had accepted during the early afternoon that S’s apparently poor mental state might preclude his being detained and had informed the custody officer  at 15.15 that CNLIT would await the outcome of the FME’s examination before deciding whether or not to serve S with immigration detention papers. </span>

However, the decision was in reality only a contingent decision since he gave instructions that S should be visited and given a so-called mitigating circumstances interview the following morning by an IO from CNLIT who should collect a copy of the FME’s report at the same time.  CIO Evans also made it clear to his colleagues in CNLIT that his decision was subject to the condition that </span>S should be detained in an IRC healthcare bed. Thus, S would only be detained, and then only in a healthcare bed, if the interviewing officer reached the conclusion that it was safe to detain him in immigration detention. In other words, S was not be taken into immigration detention unless and until he had been interviewed and there remained no concerns about his mental health in the light of that interview, the contents of the FME’s assessment report and anything else that was learnt about S’s behaviour and presentation from CPS. </p>

He merely noted without comment that the FME felt that S might be suffering from Schizophrenia and might also be suffering from HIV although there was no confirmation of this possibility. He therefore discounted these risks and applied the conventional test that S should be detained because he was an unlawful overstayer who would be administratively removed reasonably quickly without taking account of the possibility that S might be undergoing a serious psychotic attack requiring immediate hospital attention. </span>

This had concluded that S was probably suffering from Schizophrenia, was displaying several of the symptoms of Schizophrenia and that his cognitive functioning was sufficiently impaired that he was not fit to be interviewed. Although it recommended that S was fit to be detained, that was a limited assessment since it only related to S’s detention in police custody which was inevitably time limited. Moreover, until S had been assessed by a psychiatrist, he was, or was potentially, unsafe to be released from detention so that detention in police custody could be regarded as being a safer option than releasing him. The appropriate conclusion that should have been drawn from that assessment was that until S had been assessed by a psychiatrist, it was not possible to conclude that it was safe to detain S in an IRC.</span>

He had no more than the CNLIT duty officer’s minute of a second-hand account of the FME’s assessment which had come from a support officer in the custody suite. That account was seriously misleading in four respects. Firstly, it referred to the possibility, attributed to the FME, that S might be feigning his symptoms that had led to a possible diagnosis of Schizophrenia. There is no other evidence that this was the FME’s advice and all the other evidence in fact pointed to the improbability of the FME expressing this opinion or that this opinion was rational even if it had been expressed.

Although the FME’s advice did not preclude the custody officer from, nonetheless, permitting S to be interviewed by the police so long as he was accompanied by an appropriate adult, such a decision could only properly have been made if there was a good reason to depart from the FME’s advice. </span>

The tick in the tick box merely stated that S was fit to be transferred without stating whether that transfer was to the community, to a hospital or to an IRC. A fourth error was to word the advice that S might be an HIV sufferer in such a way as to suggest that the FME considered that S was making up that suggestion.

No reason was given why the decision was taken on Saturday evening without the mitigating circumstances interview having taken place rather than leaving it to be taken until after S’s interview the following morning. A deferred decision would have been able to take into account the contents of that interview, the submissions of the immigration duty solicitor, the observations of the appropriate adult, the full details of the FME’s assessment report and the details of the police officers’ observations of S’s behaviour including his detention behaviour over a 20-hour period. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">This decision was therefore flawed in four significant respects. Firstly, it was taken without waiting for sight of the FME’s report and on the basis of what was in fact a significantly erroneous summary of that report. Secondly, it failed to take full or sufficient account of the evidence of S’s psychiatric illness that was available to him but which would only be fully known once the CNLIT IO who was to visit CPS had attended and spoken to relevant officers and had examined the detention log and other relevant documents. Thirdly, it was taken before the forthcoming mitigating circumstances interview of S had taken place so that any such circumstances were not taken into account. Since the interview was to investigate whether S had any mitigating circumstances, including his mental health, this interview was, or certainly should have been, a vital part of the decision-making process.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">The fourth reason that the decision was flawed was that it was taken without the decision-maker considering the SSHD’s mental health detention policy enshrined in EIG 55.10. No consideration was given to the possibility that S was suffering from a serious mental illness which could not be satisfactorily managed within detention. Assuming that that policy was lawful, it was incumbent on the decision-maker to consider whether the currently available evidence showed that S was or might be suffering from an active psychosis of a schizophrenic-type which constituted a serious mental illness and, if he was, whether that illness could be managed by an IRC. There was already sufficient evidence of S’s active psychosis to necessitate further investigation as to whether it amounted to a serious mental illness so that consideration should also have been given to whether it was appropriate to transfer S to a healthcare bed in an IRC at that time or whether instead his illness and its on-going assessment and treatment should be addressed in a hospital setting or in the community by a mental healthcare team. </span>

They did not take account of the full significance of the FME’s report and his additional advice that had also been reported to CNLIT that S was possibly suffering from Schizophrenia and needed a full psychiatric assessment. CNLIT should have ensured that S was provided with the same standards of healthcare as would have been provided by the NHS or the police to someone presenting with S’s psychotic symptoms or to a person detained in police custody. In particular, S should have been provided with access to a properly trained appropriate adult – whether or not he was interviewed - and a psychiatric assessment as a matter of priority.</span>

The advice was, therefore, severely constrained in both the period of time it related to and its scope since the FME had merely conducted a PACE assessment that was accompanied by advice that S’s cognitive functions were sufficiently impaired that he was unfit to be interviewed and that he should be fully assessed by a psychiatrist. Moreover, when the removal decision was taken, S had already been in custody for at least 26 hours, he had not been seen by anyone from CNLIT, the CIO approving his initial detention had previously made that decision conditional upon a mitigating circumstances interview being carried out as soon as possible in the police station, the FME’s advice was now 24 hours old and S’s detention behaviour had become increasingly more bizarre.</span>

This duty arose both by virtue of EIG Chapter 38 and because the SSHD had an Equality Act duty to ensure that S as someone with a protected characteristic was not discriminated against compared with others suffering from a similar disability. The SSHD was therefore obliged to provide equivalent standards of care to S whilst being detained in immigration police custody as would have been provided to those detained in police custody that were subject to PACE Code C or to section 136 of the MHA. Moreover, the SSHD accepted as a matter of practice that the provisions of Code C relating to vulnerable and mentally ill detainees would be given effect to for immigration detainees detained in police custody. It followed that CNLIT had a duty to ensure that S received appropriate clinical attention in CPS in the form of an appropriate psychiatric assessment, was considered for sectioning and was visited in custody by an appropriate adult who had been trained in the care of the mentally disordered</span>

In this context, the decision-makers in both DEPMU and CNLIT should have considered whether Colnbrook healthcare unit could have provided S with healthcare management that would include a full psychiatric assessment in the near future, round the clock monitoring and the means of stabilising his mental condition and identifying and ensuring the consistent application of appropriate medication for his diagnosed symptoms. It can now be seen that S would not have been moved to Colnbrook or any other IRC from CPS had an appropriate detention or removal decision been taken in the first 24 hours of his police custody. </span>

	      <marker name="tab"/>
	      <span style="color:#000000">The police were aware that S was mentally ill, or was apparently, suffering from a mental illness from the moment that he was stopped in the street on 2 December 2011 and that awareness rapidly increased during his arrest, custody reception and custody behaviour during his 34 hours in police custody. The police were acting as detention agents for the SSHD from the moment S was received into custody so that PACE Code C did not fully apply to his custody once he had been formally detained in immigration detention but its relevant provisions relating to the monitoring, treatment, assessment, access to an appropriate adult and legal advice, interviewing and continued detention of S as someone who was or who appeared to be mentally ill applied by virtue of SSHD’s policy throughout his time in police custody. The custody officers on duty throughout this period were authorised to apply these Code C provisions under the overall control of CNLIT. The evidence show that those officers were fully aware of those provisions and applied them as instructed by CNLIT, liaised promptly, regularly and appropriately with DEPMU initially and then with CNLIT and monitored S continuously by keeping his health and safety under constant review and otherwise following CNLIT’s instructions. </span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">Had S been in police custody instead of immigration custody, it is likely that the custody officer would have arranged for an appropriate adult with appropriate mental health training to attend the police station during the afternoon or evening of 3 December 2011 and either such an appropriate adult, or the custody officer on his own initiative, would have arranged for S to be visited by an AMHP or to be moved forthwith to hospital and would not have permitted S to leave the police station save under escort and compulsorily to hospital under sections 2, 4 or 136 of the MHA. However, such decisions were for CNLIT given that S was in immigration detention throughout, albeit in holding detention until 17.30 on 3 December 2011.</span>

It would appear that no guidance had been given to IOs in relation to the SSHD’s duty to avoid the discriminatory treatment of S as someone suffering from a mental illness compared to those suffering from such an illness who were detained in police custody or not detained at all. The risk that that might occur was apparently heightened by the change in wording of the relevant part of EIG paragraph 55.10 and it ought to have been, and should have been, mitigated had that change been subjected to an Equality Impact Assessment that the SSHD had previously been found to be under a statutory duty to perform but which does not appear to have been completed subsequently</span>

Unfortunately, the interview did not take place and the IOs in CNLIT who dealt with his custody do not appear to have considered that S was genuinely mentally ill, possibly because they mistakenly misunderstood and failed to obtain the relevant details of his apparent illness.</span>

	      <span style="color:#000000">The result was that S never saw an appropriate adult, an AMHP, a psychiatrist, a duty solicitor or an IO whilst in CPS. He was also detained there for up to 28 hours longer than he should have been and was not transferred to hospital under any of the available means of compulsorily detaining him available under the MHA. Instead, he was moved to Colnbrook without any thought being given as to whether Colnbrook could monitor and treat his psychosis appropriately. These decisions were taken despite CNLIT receiving full, clear and written representations at about 11.30 on 4 December 2011 from S’s solicitor that sought his immediate release from detention to a place of safety at his friend’s house and appropriate medical, psychiatric assessment and treatment. There is no evidence that these submissions were considered or acted upon and no reasons were given as to why they were rejected in favour of his removal to Colnbrook. Taken cumulatively, these failings amounted to significant breaches of the SSHD’s relevant policies relating to detention and to S being unlawfully detained at 17.30 and maintained in detention from then onwards.  </span>

The nurse must also have notified CH to arrange for an urgent psychiatric assessment since Dr Allen’s assessment took place later on during the day of arrival.

Once his health permitted, he should be moved to a healthcare single occupancy bed. In the longer term, he also required a full psychiatric assessment and health monitoring over an appropriately lengthy period. </span>

It had to be prepared by reference to the risk concerns specified in form IS91RA part A. If further information became available which impacted upon and altered the risk that a detainee posed to himself, to others or to his security in detention, a new risk assessment should have been undertaken and its results and the new information should then have been recorded in a revised Part C in a new IS91 which should then have been issued and forwarded to DEPMU and CNLT. These steps were not taken even though Dr Allen had drafted and signed a revised Part C which CH neither noted nor passed on nor gave effect to by issuing a new IS91. Part of that draft Part C stated that S should be moved to CH and treated with antipsychotic medication but was not well enough to be moved at present and his note in the mental health records stated that UKBA should be informed immediately of S’s seriously ill mental state and limited mental capacity.</span>

That was an unsustainable conclusion. Mr Humphris had no personal knowledge of S’s case and, given the contents of the note and the further details of Dr Allen’s diagnosis that are now available, his conclusion appears to be both unreasonable and based on wholly inadequate information. However, Mr Humphris’s view is irrelevant since the relevant question is what CNLIT’s reaction would have been had it been provided, as it should have been, with a Rule 35 report and a revised IS91 in appropriately drafted terms.

As occurred when he was transferred to Colnbrook, S was transferred to Harmondsworth by the movement contractor in the middle of the night and arrived at that IRC at 02.21. On arrival and throughout his stay in Harmondsworth, S was located on A-wing on general location. He was not considered for location in a single occupancy room on general location nor until a few days before his release, in a healthcare bed in HH notwithstanding his active psychosis and the need for his condition and medication to be continuously assessed and monitored. This failure arose from a failure of those previously concerned with his mental health to bring S’s serious mental illness to the attention of HH and from HH’s failure to give S a Rule 34 examination within 24 hours of his arrival at Harmondsworth, to give him a psychiatric assessment as soon as possible after his arrival, to give effect to the information it received in his movement order and his healthcare introductory assessment that he was suffering from Schizophrenia or other active psychosis and to keep him under observation or to take appropriate action to treat his mental illness and to administer the live prescription for Olanzapine that had travelled with him from Colnbrook.</span>

Rule 34 of the DCR required a detainee to be given a physical and mental examination by each IRC that he was detained at which was to take place within 24 hours of his admission to that detention centre. HH sought to excuse this failure on the grounds that S had already had a Rule 34 examination on his arrival at Colnbrook 9 days earlier.

It is clear that had a Rule 34 examination of S’s mental health been undertaken on arrival at Harmondsworth, HH would have discovered the existence and severity of S’s mental illness and he would have been released, albeit that that release would have been to a hospital for appropriate assessment and treatment.</span>

It was not surprising that this decision was taken because CNLIT had not received any up to date information about S’s mental health due to HH’s failure to carry out any assessment of S since his arrival in Harmondsworth. HH should have provided CNLIT with a report of S’s mental health for the 14-day detention review and it is likely that, had an assessment report been provided to CNLIT in time for that review, S would have been released forthwith.</span>

HH was, or should have been, aware of this instruction and should have responded immediately by arranging for S to have a psychiatric assessment forthwith. However, it did not immediately do so and it never reported to CNLIT as required although it should have been aware, and belatedly became acutely aware on receipt of Professor Katona’s report, that S was seriously mentally ill. </span>

This was followed up by the same nurse faxing a revised IS91 to CNLIT on 20 December 2011 which stated that S was fit to fly, was complying with his prescribed medication and appeared to be in a stable mental state. These statements were seriously erroneous and highly misleading and they had been made without any consultation with the mental health team at HH and, it would seem, without any proper consideration of S’s healthcare records. </span>

Moreover, S was actively psychotic on 19 December 2011 as can be seen from the fact that, two days later on 21 December 2011, Professor Katona noted during his assessment of S that he was actively psychotic, cognitively impaired, perplexed and suspicious and describing episodes of intense panic during which he started to shake and was feeling things that, in S’s words, “I can’t describe”. Also on 21 December 2011, Nurse Dube noted in the mental health records following his meeting with S that he had a bizarre presentation and needed further assessment by a psychiatrist. </span>

In fact, S had never been compliant with his prescribed medication since he had first been detained on 3 December 2011 even though he had been prescribed Olanzapine on 5 December 2011. Instead, he had secreted and had not taken his prescribed medication on 6 of the 7 days he was subject to that prescription in Colnbrook and had probably not taken it on the seventh day since that was the day that he was transported to Harmondsworth. Moreover he had neither taken nor been provided with that prescription on any day between his arrival in Harmondsworth and 20 December 2011 when the revised IS91was issued.</span>

In particular, CNLIT took these responses to be a clear indication that S’s claimed mental illness was not serious and that his behaviour that suggested otherwise was to be disregarded. This information also re-affirmed CNLIT’s view that S was fit to be interviewed, to remain in detention rather than being considered for release on bail, to be transferred to the DFT, to engage fully in his asylum claim and the immigration appeals process, to be safely removed by air to Ghana in the near future and to have no arguable case for being released from detention and for his removal to be deferred until his mental health had been fully assessed, treated and stabilised.  </span>

Moreover, it contended that there was nothing in Dr Allen’s recommendations to suggest that S was not fit for detention, that had his recommendations been made known to CNLIT, it would have continued to detain S because his illness was not sufficiently serious to engage EIG 55.10 and could have been satisfactorily managed by HH, that Dr Burrun correctly and reasonably concluded that S was fit to be detained in the light of his being aware of Professor Katona’s assessment and that it was entitled to rely on his assessment in preference to that of Professor Katona.</p>

The most notable failings were CNLIT’s failure to visit S in CPS and to appreciate and give proper effect to the contents of the FME report and its diagnosis that S was actively psychotic and probably actively schizophrenic. Following his transfer to Colnbrook, Dr Allen’s assessment was neither properly expressed nor acted upon, neither a Rule 35 report nor a revised IS91 were produced and CH did not provide S with a healthcare bed, monitor his mental illness or ensure that he was compliant with his prescribed medication. Following his second transfer to Harmondsworth, no Rule 34 assessment was carried out by HH, HH did not provide S with his prescribed Olanzapine despite it being prescribed for him on both 5 December 2011 by CH and 19 December 2011 by itself, S was not provided with a healthcare bed, HH did not monitor his mental illness or provide him with any, let alone any sufficient management of his mental illness and Dr Burrun did not prepare a legible, reliable or intelligible assessment report about S’s mental illness. </p>

This shortcoming is compounded by a complete absence at any stage subsequently to respond to it or to explain why it was ignored. Instead, the SSHD instructed its counsel to contend that it had preferred Dr Burrun’s assessment to that of Professor Katona even though no-one connected with S’s detention was aware of its contents. Finally, Dr Burrun’s conclusions broadly agreed with those of Professor Katona save that he concluded that S did not require a full psychiatric assessment in a hospital setting. However, Dr Burrun reached that conclusion on the basis of inadequate information and without being requested to or having had the time to carry out a full structured mental state assessment or appropriate cognitive testing so that that element of his assessment, which was only revealed when Dr Burrun was asked for clarification of his assessment in 2013, was not considered by CNLIT and cannot now carry any weight. </p>

Having repeatedly failed to answer CNLIT’s calls seeking an answer to its query as to whether S was fit to be detained and to fly, it provided CNLIT re-assuring but wholly erroneous answers from a medical nurse which were misleading and which were answers that the nurse was neither qualified nor sufficiently knowledgeable about S’s mental health to give at all.</p>

Dr Burrun was the only psychiatrist visiting HH and his locum contract provided for one half day surgery visit a fortnight during which he would attend to as many patients as he had time to see and his time with each patient was inevitably limited. He was able to carry out initial assessments but he did not have the time to undertake a full mental state assessment and could only do so if specially instructed to undertake one, presumably during an additional visit or at the expense of other patients attending his regular surgery. Moreover, he only prepared and produced a written assessment report if instructed to do so as an extra service.

In addition, S saw a GP on 31 January and 2 February 2012 at his request in relation to back pain, on the second occasion the GP took the opportunity to re-prescribe Mirtazapine but not Olanzapine. Throughout this period, S was located on A-wing and since HH was not monitoring his mental health, there is no record of the state of his psychosis, mental capacity, cognition or schizophrenic symptoms in that period. S’s intermittent attendance in HH to take his Mirtazapine suggests that his psychosis and cognitive state were fluctuating and that he only attended HH for his mood stabiliser  when he could no longer put up with his hallucinations, depression and low moods. </span>

These failures were highlighted by the fact that the only assessment and report that Dr Burrun had previously provided on S was the hurried and incomplete assessment undertaken on Christmas Eve and the brief and barely legible handwritten notes in the healthcare records that he made immediately after completing that assessment. These inadequacies were compounded by Dr Burrun’s assessment being undertaken without his having been provided with a copy of Professor Katona’s assessment report that HH had by then received and by the confusing instructions that he left with regard to the continued prescription of Olanzapine. </span>

HH was asked repeatedly by CNLIT and Pierce Glynn to provide current details of S’s mental health, for a detailed psychiatric response to Professor Katona’s first report and for details of the assessments and treatment it was providing S with. Such limited responses as were given were delayed, misleading and wholly uninformative. It is now clear that Professor Katona’s report was never shown to or considered by Dr Burrun or RMN Dube or by any GP member of HH’s health team. The failures to consider and make use of Professor Katona’s report and its summary that he wrote into HH’s mental health records were particularly serious and were explained, although not excused, by the sparse nature of its mental healthcare team at that time which appeared to have consisted of one resident mental health nurse, RMN Dube and one fortnightly 3-hour visit to attend to a pre-arranged appointments list by a locum psychiatrist, Dr Burrun.</span>

This information was incorrect since S was in fact subject to a current antipsychotic prescription administered by HH, had not been taken off that prescription by Dr Burrun, had been assessed as being unfit and as needing urgent hospital attention by Professor Katona and Dr Allen, had not been given a mental state assessment by Dr Burrun who nonetheless had not disagreed with Professor Katona’s assessment of his mental state and had been seen by RMN Dube whose assessment coincided with that of Dr Burrun. </span>

Mr Hundt of Pierce Glynn helpfully at our request provided an explanation for the court after the conclusion of the hearing. His firm, Pierce Glyn held a public law franchise, but not an immigration franchise. Under the legal aid arrangements, it was generally the practice that only firms with public law contracts could bring a publicly funded claim for damages for immigration detention. Those firms without that franchise, but with a franchise in relation to immigration and asylum law, could generally only bring proceedings to challenge the removal directions. Fadiga &amp; Co had therefore referred the claim for damages for detention to Pierce Glynn who held a public law franchise. Such a reference was quite common.</span>

It is deeply regrettable that this consequence is not recognised by those who devise the arrangements at the Legal Services Commission. No doubt they have an eye on their own considerations for the operation of an efficient legal system without thinking properly about considerations of justice. Although it is plainly necessary for the Legal Services Commission and the Home Office to examine the rationality of the arrangements made by the Legal Services Commission for franchising its immigration claims, while they subsist the arrangements are an important factor in assessing whether the bringing of separate proceedings for damages for detention is an abuse of process. It cannot be just to penalise a litigant when the lawyers cannot by reason of funding arrangements made by the State through the Legal Services Commission give a full range of the advice and litigation services necessary for the fair and proper bringing of appropriate remedies. This factor counts very strongly against these proceedings being an abuse of process.”</span>

It was also aware that there were very considerable grounds for concern about S’s mental health and its potential causes of that ill-health. CNLIT could not reasonably have relied on the assurances of HH in those circumstances. This was particularly so since no IO from CNLIT had, remarkably, ever visited, seen or interviewed S and the first time that an IO from the UKBA undertook a detailed assessment or a detailed interview was when S was given his screening and asylum interviews on respectively 8 and 29 February 2012 and his DFT induction interview on 12 February 2012. By then, the received UKBA wisdom that S was not suffering from a mental illness, was fit to be removed and was acting strategically and not from the effects of a mental illness had become firmly and irretrievably entrenched.</span>

This decision should not have been taken, given S’s then poor state of mental health. However, given the wholly inadequate information that CNLIT had been provided with by HH and CH and its own inadequate dealings with S’s case, it is not surprising that the officer handling S’s case decided to refer it to HDFT on 10 February 2012. </span>

Mr Crook could, and indeed should, have called for copies of Dr Allen’s, Professor Katona’s and Dr Burrun’s assessment reports, for an up to date assessment report from Dr Burrun and for a written report from HH of his fitness to fly and to be returned to Ghana that included a summary of its assessment and monitoring of S and of the on-going treatment that he was receiving. Without these reports, Mr Crook was not able properly to assess, as he professed in his witness statement that he had assessed, “whether S was presenting with acute psychosis e.g. Schizophrenia who was someone who required hospitalisation”. Equally, he was not entitled to conclude, as he apparently had concluded, that S’s claims to be suffering from active psychosis, probably Schizophrenia, should be disregarded and his mental health could be properly and safely managed in detention since he had already spent 69 days in detention without any report from HH that he was unfit to be detained without first obtaining and then taking into account the reports of the assessments that had taken place. Had he done so, he would have discovered that only Professor Katona had reported and that this report required answering since it revealed that S was seriously mentally ill and in urgent need of hospital treatment. In short, he should have concluded that no decision on a transfer to HDFT could be taken unless and until he received full and up to date assessment reports from Dr Burrun and HH.  </span>

Given the terms of S’s application and the contents of Professor Katona’s report, it is inexcusable that the UKBA made no reference to the principal basis for S’s application for bail or to the mental state assessment from a practising psychiatrist submitted with those submissions which indicated how ill S was at the time of the assessment and which had not been answered directly or indirectly by any other available assessment. It is no answer to this finding that S was represented by counsel at the bail hearing.

It is clear from the text of that report that it was a report of a full mental state assessment with a diagnosis of severe symptoms of acute psychosis which recommended, as is usual in such cases, continuing assessment and treatment in a hospital setting. In short, it was a psychiatric diagnosis of an on-going serious psychotic illness. It follows that both the UKBA bail assessment and the immigration judge’s reasons for refusing bail were seriously defective and that the consequence of these deficiencies was that S was refused bail when he should have been granted it. </span>

The interviewer did not record that S was feigning mental ill-health so that he should have checked with HH and CNLIT before reaching any conclusion as to S’s fitness to be transferred into the HFTD process and, had he done so, he would, or should, have received sufficient information, particularly from Professor Katona’s report, to satisfy him that it was inappropriate to transfer him at that time.  </span>

A further deficiency was that the interviewers for both his asylum interviews should have had available to them a Rule 35 report but this was not available due to previous shortcomings by CH and HH.</span>

The decision was heavily reliant on the contents of the asylum interview. Its summary of the available psychiatric evidence was brief and the summary was inevitably inaccurate as a summary of S’s actual psychiatric condition given the inadequacies relating to its assessment, diagnosis and reporting that had previously occurred. The decision concluded erroneously that S remained suitable for detention, had understood the questions he had been asked in his interview and had engaged with solicitors in relation to his asylum claim. None of these conclusions was correct.

It failed to identify the serious nature of his mental illness disclosed by Professor Katona. It wrongly asserted that S had understood the questions he had been asked, notwithstanding the interviewer’s report to the contrary. It also wrongly asserted that S had engaged with solicitors in relation to his asylum claim when, as the interviewers and HDFT were aware, he had not been legally represented for his claim or the subsequent interviews about it. Finally, the decision erroneously concluded that S was fit to be detained and it did not consider whether he was fit to fly or whether his illness was so severe that he should be removed from the DFT and his asylum claim re-processed in the normal way once he had been released from detention and had recovered his full cognitive function and been appropriately treated.</span>

Dr Oza stated that S seemed fit for detention and had expressed some hallucinatory thoughts which would need to be reviewed with HH’s mental health team. This letter, although partially reassuring in its content, was not based on any assessment that Dr Oza had undertaken or of any review by him of the somewhat inadequate and scanty mental health records held by HH. Dr Oza should not have sent any response, save a holding response, until he had obtained from Dr Burrun an up to date assessment which would have required HH to arrange for Dr Burrun to make a special and urgent visit to HH for that purpose.  Furthermore, since it must have been known by Dr Oza, and certainly should have been known to him, that S had already been re-assessed by Professor Katona earlier that in the day that he wrote his letter to HDFT and that Dr Burrun had been asked to re-assess him on his next scheduled visit to HH on Friday 9 March 2012, Dr Oza’s response should have referred to these forthcoming assessment reports and have given no further opinion as to S’s fitness for detention.</span>

The principal complaint about Dr Burrun’s assessment is the unduly lengthy time it took to arrange and to be reported on, the illegibility of his notes in the HH records of his assessment and his failure to engage with Professor Katona’s report. Although HH first arranged for Dr Burrun to see S on about 2 March 2012 soon after S’s FtT hearing date had been fixed for 21 March 2012, he did not actually see him until 13 March 2012 and his report was not received until 20 March 2012.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">The lowest common denominator shared by both reports was that S was seriously ill and was suffering from a psychotic illness overlaid by both anxiety and depression. Professor Katona agreed with this summary of the lowest common denominator identified by these two assessments so far as it went but, based on more detailed diagnostic criteria and a more rigorous assessment technique, he considered that S’s illness was even more serious than Dr Burrun’s assessment suggested it was. However, given the lowest common denominator to be gleaned from both reports, it was or should have been clear as soon as they were both available that S was unfit to remain in detention, to participate in his asylum appeal, to travel or fly to Ghana or to give reliable instructions to his legal team if and when he obtained one. It is a matter of further criticism that HH had not obtained an assessment report from Dr Burrun at least 21 days prior to the date of its receipt since, if it had, S could, and certainly should, have been released from detention before he was transferred to HDFT or the processing of his asylum claim had started. He would certainly have been spared the agony of his unrepresented appearance at what he would have anticipated to have been the hearing of his asylum appeal. </span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">HH has the principle responsibility for the almost complete lack of any care, assessment, treatment or illness management that S was subjected to. This inattention can be seen by considering the annex which charts these inadequacies on a day by day basis. However, CNLIT, HDFT, the AIU, Dr Burrun and the GPs, nurses, RMN nurse, HH’s interim director and UKBA in its handling of both S’s bail application and his FtT hearing all share some of the responsibility for those shortcomings. The overall result was that S’s detention from about 4.00pm on Saturday 3 December 2011 until his release on 21 March 2012 was unlawful.   </span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">HDFT decided after the hearing to grant S temporary admission and to release him from detention. This decision was taken as a direct result of the immigration judge’s reasons that he or she gave to explain why he or she had decided to adjourn the hearing, direct S’s release from detention, his removal from the HDFT process and his release into the care of his pastor and church. The judge’s reasons for these decisions were, as reported, clear and trenchant. S was clearly seriously unwell, was wholly incapable of representing himself, lacked capacity to participate in the hearing and required legal representation to assist him in the presentation of his case. Moreover, it was clear from the psychiatric evidence, which in the case of Dr Burrun’s report had only been made available at the hearing, that S was suffering from serious mental impairment and his case could not proceed until his health had improved. </span>

The Treasury Solicitor declined to disclose these notes on the grounds that the SSHD’s legal privilege in them had not been waived. This refusal was clearly erroneous since in law privilege had been waived in full by the partial waiver provided by the Treasury Solicitor’s comments about their contents. Once there is partial waiver of legal privilege in the contents of a document, the entire contents of that document become disclosable. The decision to withhold full disclosure suggests that an inference adverse to the SSHD’s interests should be drawn about those undisclosed contents. </span>

Despite HH’s admitted shortcomings in these letters and in its earlier letter dated 29 February 2012, neither HH nor the SSHD has accepted that it was incapable of managing S’s mental illness, that the standard of healthcare he was provided with was in breach of the SSHD’s relevant policies, that those shortcomings contributed in any way to any period of unlawful detention or that S should be recompensed for what, on analysis, amounted to serious and prolonged failures to provide S with the minimum standards of healthcare required by the SSHD’s relevant healthcare and detention policies, the common law and by articles 3 and 8 of the ECHR.</span>

	      </authorialNote>, his treatment amounted to significant breaches of both articles 3 and 8 of the ECHR in each of the ways summarised above. There were extensive failures to apply and comply with the various applicable policies, some of which can only be described as wilful or grossly negligent. It is particularly clear that many of the shortcomings that occurred were the result of HH’s inability to manage S’s mental illness or to rectify any of the faults identified in the judgment of Ms Laing QC in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">BA</span><authorialNote class="footnote" marker="122">

	      </authorialNote>, indeed those faults appear to have intensified following the handing down of judgment earlier in 2011. It is also clear that many involved with S had little understanding of mental illness or of the assessment process needed to provide adequate assessments of the nature, extent, treatment and after-care of psychotic illness and no inclination to treat S, albeit an overstayer who should be removed to Ghana, with dignity or respect or to provide him with the minimum standards of care, assessment and treatment that he was entitled to. These failings were exacerbated by the lack of any clear, comprehensive and readily intelligible guidance produced by the SSHD that is concerned with the care and treatment of mentally ill people whilst their cases are being considered by the immigration and asylum authorities and its appeal processes and whilst they are detained in immigration custody, are on bail or temporary release or awaiting the processing of their immigration or asylum cases and applications. This shortcoming is further exacerbated by the continuing absence of an EIA relating to EIG55.10 promised by the SSHD in court and endorsed by the judge in his judgment in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">HA</span><authorialNote class="footnote" marker="123">

He was also fortunate that those representing the SSHD did so with similarly high standards of professionalism. It is to be hoped that the SSHD will ensure that the difficulties that this case has been bedevilled with are eradicated so that unlawful detention claims involving healthcare issues can be processed and conducted fairly, expeditiously and with appropriately qualified and resourced representation<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="124">
