	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Firstly, the six month delay in issuing proceedings following V’s disclosures. She was placed in foster care immediately following her disclosures, returned home on the day of her ABE interview and remained in the family home. The child protection plan, such as it was, following the initial Child Protection Conference on 10 February 2015 was wholly inadequate. I can see no reference to any follow up meetings and apart from some social work visits there appeared to be no structure to the social work intervention. The LA have provided no explanation for the failure to issue proceedings, other than on re-allocation of the case to a new solicitor the LA issued proceedings on 16 July 2015. I strongly suspect this was only brought about by CI being charged with sexual offences relating to V’s allegations. There needs to be an urgent review of LA procedures for protecting children in this type of situation, to avoid any other children being left at such risk in the future. </span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Secondly, having issued proceedings there were then significant further delays in seeking and managing disclosure from the police. The LA took an inordinate amount of time to secure essential disclosure, with orders being repeatedly breached. The internal procedures within the LA appear to have totally broken down. It now appears the DVDs of the ABE interviews of V and the police interview of CI were sent to the LA on 11 December 2015, the parties and the court were not told they had been received until 6 months later on 12 May 2016. Such mismanagement of a case involving serious child protection allegations is wholly unacceptable. Again I would expect there to be an urgent review of the systems in place to ensure these delays and failures are not repeated. As a consequence of the LA delays and failures this hearing is taking place 12 months after the issue of proceedings and 18 months after the main event that caused the proceedings to be issued. </span>

She described occasions when this happened in the flat in London and the other children would be present in another room, watching television. When she hit puberty (at the age of about 9) she said he touched her boobs, after removing her towel when she came out of the shower, on another occasion he licked her vagina and on one occasion he attempted to have intercourse with her. She said the last time he did these things was two months previously, she thought in September. She described him making her suck his penis taking place in Country A, their flats in London; she described this taking place at varying frequency, including daily, twice daily to ‘once in a while’. He started touching her boobs at the address in London and she described the escalation to attempting to have sexual intercourse taking place there. She was able to describe his penis being stiff on occasions and times when it wasn’t. She acknowledged that he was not at these addresses all the time. The one occasion when she said he licked her down below she said took place at the address in Kent, after they moved there in August 2013.</span>

This report was submitted as part of her immigration application. I have read it but place no weight on it for the obvious reason that issues of credibility are a matter for the court. In the light of the fast pace of events leading up to QI giving evidence the LA sensibly took steps to ensure that QI did not need any particular support whilst giving evidence. With QI’s consent she was assessed over the telephone by Alan Finer, Consultant Psychologist. His assessment concluded that she demonstrated a satisfactory level of understanding and providing the language used and questions where kept relatively simple and short he did not consider she needed any specific assistance. What the LA were able to arrange was for someone to sit in the witness box with her to support her being able to find the relevant documents in the bundle, which worked well.</span>

She said in 2008 PJ informed her of CI’s relationship with MI, CI admitted the relationship and according to IE he assaulted her before they separated. CI and MI moved in together, CI would see M and C but they remained living with her until December 2011. In December 2011 he took them for CI and MI’s wedding and she expected them to be returned back in early 2012 to start back at school.</span>

She accepted CI had given her a car when C was born and she sold it but denied SI cared for the children as a nanny, although accepted she lived with her some of the time. She agreed she was in CI’s house until 2013 and there had been text communication between her and CI in 2015, she said this was to get her children back. She agreed some of the exchanges were affectionate, she said that was because she wanted to get her children back. She accepted she was with the children when they got their passports in 2011 but said it was with CI as well.

He said she didn’t come and he was arrested at the police station regarding the allegations made by V and remanded in custody. At his first court appearance he asked MI to go to the hotel to collect his passport, he said he called her from prison, she said she had the passport and would give it to his legal representatives which, according to him, never happened.

He says he feels duped by MI and that this was part of a plan by her, in October 2014 they started to have problems in their marriage and he suspected she was having affairs.

She begged me not to say anything to my family or her family about what I had seen on her phone. Even while I was in Country A in May 2015 MI called to inform me that V has confessed to her that she had lied against me…she then begged me not to let any of our families know what QI, HI, V and MI herself had done as she was concerned that they would be seen in a bad light particularly because of all the good things I had done for her and her family.

He said he went straight to the property and met Joe and his wife. He said MI knelt before him and asked for his forgiveness as she told him about the sham marriage. She said she was being defrauded by the people who set up the marriage who were demanding more money from her. CI said he assisted her by transferring money into her NatWest account and also gave her cash, he said he remained in the UK for about two weeks and pleaded with Joe to assist MI to dissolve the marriage. He said he did speak to the man who she had married, he threatened him and he accepted papers to dissolve the marriage. According to CI, MI informed him it was QI who had encouraged her to do this. He said he doesn’t know OJ, was not involved in the sham marriage and did not say she needed to do this to secure a place for the children at school. He said he was here in September 2012 when he came with a letter from the Catholic school in Country A to help gain a place in a Catholic school here. He said he and MI went to see the local priest with the letter and explained their situation, after that they were able to secure places for the children at school.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> I have carefully considered the cultural context of this case. CI repeatedly said in his oral evidence that in Country A family difficulties are usually resolved in the family or the community. I factor in what he said about the culture of taking on children from a previous relationship, he frequently referred to the right to ‘adopt’ such children by either the non-biological mother or father in a new relationship. He said this custom went further in the case of PI. Although CI gave inconsistent accounts of his relationship and knowledge of PI’s mother and step-father, his final position, despite saying in his statement her mother was his partner and they were engaged, was he said he knew the mother and the step father was a friend of the family. Even in those circumstances he said he was entitled to ‘adopt’ PI. Whilst acknowledging the cultural differences I am clear CI used this to mask or deflect attention from his repeated deception of the authorities to secure passports and visas, despite his protestations to the contrary I am entirely satisfied CI knew precisely what was happening.</span>

He has run his trading businesses for a number of years, he told me in his oral evidence his current annual turnover is between 150 – 400 million Country A currency (on an exchange rate  this is between £300 – 800,000) and he has property with a total value of 1 billion Country A currency (about £2m). The property is mostly in Country A, but he has 3 properties in Country B worth about 6 – 700,000 Country B dollars each (approx. £350-400,000 each). He travels regularly and extensively to Country C, Country B, Country A, UK and, on occasion, to the Far East. During the time under scrutiny in this case he travelled in and out of this country over 12 times between January 2012 and July 2015. In addition he has travelled extensively between Countries A, B and C. On any view he is a sophisticated and experienced traveller.

Another example was the renewal of M and C’s passports here in 2014. He accepted he attended the embassy, paid for the applications but says he chose to stay in the waiting room as the room they were invited into was too small. I reject that explanation. He was involved in the application, he knew they were being made on false information, namely the July 2012 birth certificates that showed MI as their mother.

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> In my judgment MI also has a role to play in the deception involving the visa and passport applications. Whilst I consider, for the reasons set out above, CI would have taken the lead in arranging the passports and visas I am equally satisfied she knew the basis upon which the applications were being made. Whilst I accept in 2011 she lacked the expertise regarding immigration procedures that CI had, she was fully aware that the documentation she was required to sign in support of the applications contained false information, in particular relating to hers and CI’s relationship with the children. MI is an intelligent woman, she had been educated in Country A up to University level and was seeking to secure a place on a further education course in the UK. She knew in 2011 the five children were being presented to the British Embassy as hers and CI’s children, which was clearly untrue. The same applies to the position regarding the surnames of QI and HI, she knew they were being presented to the British Embassy with the surname I to give the immigration authorities the impression they were all members of the I family in order to secure the visas, which again was untrue. I am satisfied she knowingly repeated that deception regarding hers and CI’s relationship with the children when she renewed M and C’s passports in this country in 2014. She admits in her statements filed in these proceedings she wrongly represented to the headmistress of the school here in September 2013 that the children were full siblings and she also admits she forged the Pastor’s signature on an indemnity document to enable her to access money from CI’s bank account. The ease with which both CI and MI felt able to change and distort the children’s identity is deeply concerning and raises real concerns about their ability to safeguard the children’s long term welfare.</span>

What is clear is apart from CI they all came on six month visas. According to CI they came for a holiday to enable MI to view the college she was booked to attend and with tickets to return back on 15 January in order for the five children to return to school in Country A. Mr Tughan, on behalf of CI, recognises the force of the point that they would be unlikely to gain entry on a six month visa without a return ticket. In support of his position CI relies on the inadequate accommodation in London as being too small to accommodate the family. MI and SI state the trip was for a much longer term, there were no plans for the children to return to Country A to school and the plan was for them to be educated here, certainly during the currency of MI’s two year course. The position is complicated by the fact that MI did not have a student visa, although CI had paid around £8,000 for her course at the end of 2011, and secured the accommodation for a period of time with sums of about £5,000 being paid for rent and deposit. It is further complicated by difficulties in Country A in early 2012, which CI said made it unsafe for the children to return, although he and MI returned to enable her to make a student visa application.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">I do not accept CI’s account that they only came here for a two week holiday in January 2012. Apart from the return tickets (which were probably needed in any event to gain entry) there is no evidence to support that. The evidence points to the plans being for a longer stay, for example by bringing QI and HI who would be able to care for the children. MI’s position is she would not have agreed to be separated from her children for such a long time if she studied here for 2 years without the children. There is no evidence of any settled arrangements, other than schooling, that were in place for the children to be cared for in Country A without MI being there. This position is further supported by the failure of CI to take steps to take the children back to Country A from 1 March 2012. His only justification from doing so is his assertion that he felt unable to because of MI. I reject that suggestion as another example of him distancing himself from actions he could easily have taken. Whilst it is clear MI is able to hold her position, as was demonstrated in the way she gave her oral evidence in court, I have no doubt CI remained the dominant partner in this relationship. He was the head of the family, was older, had more experience and controlled the finances and all other aspects of the family life. He missed no opportunity in his oral evidence to set out the status he had, which was not limited to Country A. There is no real suggestion the children’s passports were not available to him, MI was at college during the day when he was there, he could easily have taken the children back to Country A after their visas ran out and they would not have been able to return. He simply chose not to do that and, on the contrary, in fact supported the family remaining here.  </span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">I am satisfied that both CI and MI prevented IE from having contact with the children. MI was, at the very least, reckless about whether IE consented or even knew about M and C coming or remaining in the UK. The length of time in her not having contact with the children is supported by a number of sources of corroborative evidence. For example, the observations of SB during the telephone contact she observed in November 2015. That had all the hallmarks of a contact between M and C and their mother following a significant gap in time. M had some memory of her mother (she had last seen her when she was 6 years) and C had no memory (he had last seen her when he was 4 years). This is supported by the social work file notes in April 2015 when M and C report they had limited memory of their mother and had not had recent contact with her. This is further supported by the whatsapp exchanges between E and SI that MI had stopped contact. I reject SI’s account of her witnessing phone calls between IE and the children from about 2013 and her own regular contact with the children. She is financially reliant on CI and it was apparent from the way she gave her evidence she was clearly willing to say things that put him in a good light. CI relies on his communications with IE by text and the payments he made to her to show they remained in contact, she knew the position about the children and she was not interested in them. I accept IE’s account that she remained in contact with CI in the hope that she may be able through him to secure her children’s return to Country A. That is why she went to CI’s father’s funeral in July 2015, she hoped her children would be returned that summer. </span>

This view about his unreliability is supported by the detailed allegations he made in his oral evidence regarding MI assaulting the children.

The evidence in this court (as compared to that in the Crown Court) demonstrates that the visibility through the glass door in the London property from the sitting room is limited by the layout of the flat and the nature of the glass in the door. It was not possible to see the corridor by the bathroom and toilet from within the living room, and I reject CI’s account that the glass was clear. I have carefully considered the evidence given by V in the Crown Court (in particular at CP 45 between E and H), what she describes there is not the layout of the rooms in the corridor described by all parties, including CI, in this hearing. The evidence is the living room door and the bathroom door are along the same wall, with the toilet door opposite. It was therefore possible for the assaults to take place as described without being seen by others in the living room.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Third, I have anxiously considered the immigration context of these allegations. With the background of this case and the concerns regarding MI’s credibility it is not without foundation to suggest they were prompted by MI and V’s wish to remain here, however I reject that. Whilst I have no doubt MI was aware of the impact of such allegations on her immigration application, there is no evidence to support the allegations being driven by that. MI had been consulting her solicitors since March 2014 in relation to immigration matters and whilst the allegations are referred to in the January letter, they are not the sole basis of the application. I have to consider the inherent improbability of MI being able to ‘script’ her 12 year old daughter to make these allegations, for V to maintain them over an extended period of time (including 10 days in January when there was no or very limited contact between V and her mother and on two occasions V giving oral evidence by video link). This is particularly so when on CI’s case he had forgiven MI on 30 December, purchased her jewellery, was continuing with the planned move to Country B (as confirmed by MI in her discussions with social workers) and providing funds in her bank account which she considered would demonstrate her financial independence for her immigration application. He harboured a secret plan to trick MI to Country A by funding a lavish wedding for her brother, but there is no suggestion MI was aware of his plans to trick her in returning to Country A. I reject CI’s evidence that the large sums were paid in to MI’s bank account as a matter of convenience for him, he had his own bank accounts and the suggestion that only she had internet banking was not suggested to her. It is another example of him lying to distance himself from what is going on. From MI’s perspective there was arguably no need to orchestrate these allegations, as she was making an in time immigration application with financial support and the benefit of legal advice funded by CI.  </span>

I accept V’s explanations about them in oral evidence as relating to particular circumstances she described; a whole class disruption and forgetting to attend to see a teacher to discuss late homework. She recalled her father confiscating her phone for a period of time, but that would have been after 30 December and if that event did prompt the allegations there was very limited time for V to either make up the allegations and/or be scripted by her mother, bearing in mind she initially disclosed them to her friends two weeks prior to 20 January.</span>

It is more likely, as MI says, she was not initially informed who the allegations were made against as the police were on their way to arrest CI who was at home. When she was informed she said she believed V. If she had orchestrated the allegations it is more likely she would have wanted more contact with V to ensure she was sticking to any script. The reference to her saying ‘that’s good’ when she briefly spoke to V is no more than as MI suggests that she was saying it was good V had spoken out.   The fact that MI is reported on 20 January as not agreeing to section 20, felt her daughter was lying and that she may have been at physical risk if she returned home are more consistent with the allegations being credible, rather than planned through a false script by MI.

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">IE’s allegation of physical assault of her by CI in 2008 when they separated is a somewhat generalised account that she was beaten black and blue. There is no record of the allegation having been made at the time to anyone else and despite this alleged serious assault they remained in contact over matters concerning the children. </span>

It is clear in relation to CI IE has felt able to remain in some communication with him, albeit she says to ensure her children are returned to Country A. If the threats had been made as she suggests, she may not have felt able to maintain that level of communication.</span>

	      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">As regards the suggestion that CI was financially and emotionally abusive towards IE. Having had the opportunity to observe both IE and CI give oral evidence I consider it more likely than not CI was controlling of IE about money. He is undoubtedly in the stronger financial positon and provided financial support to IE when it suited him. It is more likely than not he wanted IE to be removed from his home and as a result took steps to have the electricity and water supplies disconnected. The evidence from SI does not assist me as I consider her evidence to be unreliable due to her dependence on CI.</span>

All I can say is that when considering the evidence as a whole it lacks credibility that CI knew nothing about this until he received the phone call. There is nothing to corroborate the police being there at the time. It is unlikely MI would have done this on her own, she is likely to have had the assistance of EK and I consider it very unlikely EK would have done any step like this without the knowledge of CI. The fact that CI comes in on the day of the ceremony is more than a co-incidence and it is more likely than not that both MI and CI were involved in this arrangement and only in the context of these proceedings have they both sought to distance themselves from it.</span>
