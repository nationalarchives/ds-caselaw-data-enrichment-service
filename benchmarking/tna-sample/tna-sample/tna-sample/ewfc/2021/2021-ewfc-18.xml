It is beyond doubt that all three children have been caused persistent and significant harm as a direct result of the actions of both parents, separately and jointly, arising from the discord between the parents. Whether the harm caused to the children is irreparable remains to be seen. It is also an extraordinary and highly unusual case in which a father who has been found to have significantly alienated his children from their mother over several years, suddenly and completely unexpectedly changed position part way through the final hearing and now agrees to the children transferring to live with their mother. Dr Mark Berelowitz, the expert child and adolescent psychiatrist jointly instructed in the case, described this as one of the most intriguing and difficult changes he has come across. I agree. </p>

At that stage M’s last contact with the children had been in August 2018, almost two years previously. The guardian had consistently made it clear to the parents that the video calls were entirely voluntary, were not directed by the court and could be stopped at any time should either parent wish. The guardian noted that at times the calls were extremely difficult and progress had often been slow due to the very evident levels of hostility and suspicion that both parents continued to exhibit towards one another. Both parents told the guardian at various times that they felt bullied and intimidated by the other parent, and each regarded themselves as a victim of domestic abuse by the other. However, the guardian reported to the hearing on 4 August 2020 that notwithstanding these concerns, both parents had continued to engage with him over the past few months with a view to progressing the issue of contact. </p>

The reasons for her position are set out in her statement dated 8 February 2021. In essence, her case is that the children have suffered and are suffering emotional harm as a result of F’s ongoing inability to allow them to have a full relationship with her and the maternal family.

He thought a shared care arrangement would help the children to settle into the contact pattern with both parents more quickly. He also thought that this was already happening with Y and Z and that they are doing well with this pattern. He said he thought that if X could see Y and Z settled into this routine and coming and going happily between the parents, then that would assist her in moving to that pattern. He confirmed he agreed with M’s proposals for the shared care arrangement. F said he was committed to doing his best to make a shared parenting arrangement work as it would cause the children least disruption and they stand to gain the most from it in the long term.

It is a fundamentally important reflection of the realities of the human condition, of the very essence of the relationship of parent and child. Parental responsibility exists outsider and anterior to the law. Parental responsibility involves duties owed by the parent not just to the court. First and foremost, and even more importantly, parental responsibility involves duties owed by each parent to the child. </span>

There are many things which they ought to do that children may not want to do or even refuse to do: going to the dentist, going to visit some ‘boring’ elderly relative, going to school, doing homework or sitting an examination, the list is endless. The parent’s job, exercising all their parental skills, techniques and stratagems – which may include use of both the carrot and the stick and, in the case of the older child, reason and argument –, is to get the child to do what it does not want to do. That the child’s refusal cannot as such be a justification for parental failure is clear: after all, children whose education or health is prejudiced by parental shortcomings may be taken away from their parents and put into public care.  </span>

In summary, in a situation of parental alienation the obligation on the court is to respond with exceptional diligence and take whatever effective measures are available. The situation calls for judicial resolve because the line of least resistance is likely to be less stressful for the child and for the court in the short term. But it does not represent a solution to the problem. Inaction will probably reinforce the position of the stronger party at the expense of the weaker party and the bar will be raised for the next attempt at intervention. Above all, the obligation on the court is to keep the child’s medium to long term welfare at the forefront of its mind and wherever possible to uphold the child and parent’s right to respect for family life before it is breached. In making its overall welfare decision the court must therefore be alert to early signs of alienation. What will amount to effective action will be a matter of judgement, but it is emphatically not necessary to wait for serious, worse still irreparable, harm to be done before appropriate action is taken. It is easier to conclude that decisive action was needed after it has become too late to take it. </span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic"> as purporting to do that. The test is, and must always be, based on a comprehensive analysis of the child’s welfare and a determination of where the welfare balance points in terms of outcome. It is important to note that the welfare provisions in CA 1989 s1 are precisely the same as those applying in public law children cases where a local authority may seek the court’s authorisation to remove a child from parental care either to place them with another relative or in alternative care arrangements. Where, in private law proceedings, the choice, as here, is between care by one parent and care by another parent against whom there are no significant findings, one might anticipate that the threshold triggering a change of residence would, if anything, be lower than that justifying the permanent removal of a child from a family into foster care. Use of phrases such as ‘last resort’ or ‘draconian’ cannot and should not indicate a different or enhanced welfare test. What is required is for the judge to consider all the circumstances in the case that are relevant to the issue of welfare, consider those elements in the s1(3) welfare checklist which apply on the facts of the case and then, taking all those matters into account, determine which of the various options best meets the child’s welfare needs. </span>

Where there is more than one proposal before the court, a welfare analysis of each proposal will be necessary. That is neither a new approach nor is it an option. A welfare analysis is a requirement in any decision about a child’s upbringing. The sophistication of that analysis will depend on the facts of the case. Each realistic option for the welfare of a child should be validly considered on its own internal merits (i.e. an analysis of the welfare factors relating to each option should be undertaken). That prevents one option (often in a relocation case the proposals from the absent or 'left behind' parent) from being side-lined in a linear analysis. Not only is it necessary to consider both parents' proposals on their own merits and by reference to what the child has to say but it is also necessary to consider the options side by side in a comparative evaluation. A proposal that may have some but no particular merit on its own may still be better than the only other alternative which is worse.  </span>

I have read a detailed email sent by F to Dr Berelowitz about what happened on that day (“the Town B Centre incident”), and I have also read a shorter account in his recent statement. While I make no findings about what actually happened or did not happen on this occasion, the importance of this issue for present purposes is the fact that an incident of some sort took place which had a distressing effect, whether intentional or not, on all the family.  </p>

Within 15 minutes of us being there he threatened to phone the police as he said I was breaching a court order and his ‘legal adviser’ had told him to do this. He then changed this to say he would phone the police as I had two children in a locked car. These threats to call the police were made in front of the children (including Y who had by this point returned). Given the history of police involvement with the children I found this disappointing and incredibly stressful for all and made the handover far more difficult than it could have been.

He said that as part of his discussion with Dr D the suggestion of calling the NSPCC arose and that F resolved the best thing he could do would be to obtain advice on what had happened and how best to move forward. F says in his statement that he was not aware that the NSPCC is a safeguarding charity and was not aware that they may have referred this issue as a safeguarding concern. He said he was not aware they have this remit and he said all he wanted was advice after a very stressful morning.

The issue is rather that he did nothing to deescalate the situation, and why, even when this inevitably highly distressing episode was more or less over, he then called the NSPCC. It is difficult to think of any truly reasonable explanation for F to have called the NSPCC on that morning. There is also no indication in Dr D’s report that it was <span style="text-decoration:underline">he</span> who suggested that F contact the NSPCC. Dr Berelowitz considers that it is not easy for him to reconcile F’s declaration that in relation to the Town B Centre incident all he wanted was not to lose the momentum of contact, with him then calling the NSPCC and talking about actual bodily harm.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">F is a highly intelligent adult who is well supported by his own family. There is no reason why he could not have sought to take advice from the guardian later or from his own parents, and of course even to discuss the matter with them. It is difficult to understand why Y was sent into the centre first, it being reasonably foreseeable that leaving X and Z in the car alone might well have resulted in them playing up. This is another good example of F’s passivity in the situation as described so clearly by Dr Berelowitz. While it is encouraging that F now sees he should have played a more active role, this incident happened just two months ago. The Town B Centre incident is strong support for why it is difficult to feel confident that F will suddenly be able to progress or change at a sufficiently fast rate to make M feel confident that there will not be a repetition of such an incident in the future.   </p>

There was a deterioration in the children’s skin during the extended stay of 6 nights. This could have been caused by many factors (such as Z’s refusal to allow his mother to help him).

There is absolutely no evidence before the court to support any proposition that M is unable to manage the children’s skin condition properly. M is clear that she can look after the children’s skin condition and has done so since they were young. The guardian has previously spoken to hospital staff who confirmed that both parents were competent to manage their children’s skin and could train others. In evidence at the fact-finding F confirmed that he had no concerns about M’s ability to care appropriately for the children’s skin. </p>

	      <span style="font-style:italic">4. X is significantly more complex currently and I am working really hard with her on several fronts. She is worried by her perception of her mother’s behaviour at the Town B Centre on the 19th December. I wish it to be noted that I did get her to go for overnight stays following that on the 24th Dec and 31st Dec and 9th Jan. </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">X felt that the things that happened on those stays justified her in stepping back from further stays.</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic"> She was uneasy about staying and having done it, she became more so. Her worries appear well known. One issue that particularly unnerved her was being cut off from any ability to contact anyone while at her mother’s. She also did not enjoy not being allowed out into the garden except under supervision. </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">She found Mr M made her uneasy and uncomfortable and was worried about getting undressed there.</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic"> She seemed to find the entire experience very stressful, she stated due to her mother’s behaviour. I tried to find things that had happened that might be considered fun – her time with K the dog for example and focus her on the positives. The 6 night stay that began on the 19th Jan was too much for X and confirmed her often stated view that if she says yes to seeing her mother for one night it always turns into more which she does not want. It is difficult for me to know exactly what to do to help her in the best way because on the one hand I know she would benefit from seeing her mother more but on the other hand she gets incredibly upset at the prospect of this and it is hard to know how to manage this. The guardian gave her an assurance that contact would not go against her own wishes but she stated that many previous social workers have said this and they’ve all been wrong. The 6 night stay on the 19th confirmed her view that the goalposts keep moving. I continue to work on this but </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">there have been issues between X and the Guardian at several points previously and this has not helped. I have explained that situations change and the Guardian is doing a difficult job. </span>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Dr Berelowitz was particularly concerned about the passages highlighted in bold above. He described the passage relating to Mr M as having a whiff of sexual discomfort and impropriety and being the sort of ‘hanging remark’ that is really undermining and pushes him towards concluding that a transfer for all three children is warranted. He said he was concerned that F is not really recognising or acknowledging – to himself or to the court – that this is exactly an indication of how strong X’s alienation is. He said that, while he does not expect F to cover himself in ‘sackcloth’, there <span style="text-decoration:underline">is</span> a need for F to convey that he understands the impact of him having filmed the handovers and having constantly texted and phoned the children during contact will have had the effect of making them unhappy. He said F could simply decline messages from X. He said that F’s very difficult job now is to help X understand where her feelings might have come from, and he said he recognises this is a very difficult job that he hopes Dr D is helping him with. He said F needs help to understand that <span style="text-decoration:underline">he</span> has got a part to play in that history for the children. He said that the first thing F needs to do is stop any kind of ‘case building’ and stop accumulating evidence about how hard things are for X.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Dr Berelowitz was concerned that F does not appear to recognise that statements made by X are from the perspective of being an alienated child. In short, Dr Berelowitz considered that this lack of understanding and awareness by F lies at the nub of the problem and he remains worried about how much F has actually changed. He said that what really matters is whether F accepts for <span style="text-decoration:underline">himself</span> that he has been insufficiently supportive to the children in resuming their relationship with M. </p>

That I had drunk alcohol and I was violent and a horrible person like her Great Grandfather. The bizarre thing about this was that she showed no visible distress, no fear and was almost robotic in repeating it, it was as if what she was saying she had heard and was repeating it. When I tried to dig down into the detail, she is unable to give detail…Then the next sentence she was talking about her friends at school, this swift move to a totally different subject is worrying, her ability to be so switched off to the emotional content of what she is saying deeply concerns me.

As a result of this, U made a safeguarding referral about X. The guardian later spoke to MGM and X about these allegations, and did not consider that any physical or emotional abuse had taken place, but that what was clear was that X had not wanted to spend any time with the maternal family and was unhappy with MGM.

The court was clear that F has alienated the children and F has been clear that he did not do nearly enough to promote their relationship with their mother. But here we have a record of X disagreeing not only with the court but also with her father, so powerfully that a professional agency wishes for her to have independent representation on a point that, on the face of it, puts her at odds not only with her mother but also with her father. To put it differently, U wishes for her to be better heard on a set of thoughts and feelings that are consequent upon the alienation, rather than getting help with the consequences of the alienation. I make absolutely no criticism of U – this is what happens in these situations.  </span>

He was quite clear that it would be unethical and inappropriate to place X into therapy that seeks to pull her in a direction in which she does not want to go. He said – <span style="font-style:italic">‘that’s why the U counselling got people into deep water’</span>. He said X has a more vulnerable profile than the other children, describing her as having been <span style="font-style:italic">‘filled up more’</span> with the alienation, and said she does get involved in the family conflict – with catastrophic effect.</p>

Thus, the more the child is alienated, the less their ascertainable wishes and feelings should be taken at face value, and the more need there is for a comprehensive and holistic approach to helping them with their alienation. Put simply, in this case, that would mean that I should pay less regard to X’s wishes and feelings about contact with M than I should to those of the other children.

Of the three children, she has always been the strongest in resisting spending time with M and saying that she does not want to live with her. She has persistently and consistently said that she did not want to see M and the maternal family. She feels frustrated that the guardian is not listening to her as she is clear about her wishes. She is very rigid in her thinking, according to the guardian, and would not accept anything negative being said about F, whereas by contrast she is very negative about M, describing her as a bully, and says she does not deserve the title ‘mum’. The guardian’s conclusion is that X appears to be aligned to F as a way of protecting herself from the trauma of what happened in the past, and her fears are then compounded by the alienation she has experienced. X does not accept that F contributed to the harm that the children suffered by alienating them against M and her family. Dr Berelowitz advises that it is important to recognise that she is the most alienated, and that it will be hardest of all for her to move on from the feelings of alienation. He describes her having ended up with entrenched negative views about her mother and an idealised view of her father. He says she is very persuasive about this, to herself and also to other people, hence his concern about the work with U. He considers that she may also have become quite dependent upon F.  </p>

Thirdly, she doesn't want to see M because she knows the days will expand and go for longer until she has to live with her. She says she is not comfortable staying overnight with M. Fourthly she feels she is being treated exactly the same as Y and Z but they're not the same they are different people with different thoughts. She said she does not want to see M but her brother and sister do. Finally, she says she really does not like Mr M and she does not feel safe around him. She said he scares her. She said she feels that Mr M and VM are just people who live with M and have no relation to her. She says that she should not be forced to see M as she feels worried and scared, but that if she had a choice about seeing her now, maybe she will want to see her in the future.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Dr Berelowitz has considered the Cafcass guidance on parental alienation and advises that it is vital to look at the whole picture and also the severity of the alienation. He describes X as being the child who was most strongly affected at the time by M’s health issues and who is the child who is most alienated. He describes her as challenging and aggressive to M and seems to believe that she needs one parent only. She has also at times set herself up as the protector of the younger children and/or F. Furthermore, Dr Berelowitz notes the unfortunate consequence for X of taking such an entrenched position; in other words she pays a price for taking that position which means she has less time with her siblings, but she still cannot readily change.  </p>

However she was the first to take significant steps to resuming contact with M, including writing letters, recording videos, and talking on video. The guardian describes Y as appearing to be ‘the shining light’ in leading the way to resuming contact with M. She has always been the most amenable to resuming contact, and the guardian was not surprised that she was the first one of the children to engage in a video call with M and was the first of the children to see her at the first Town B Centre session.  </p>

In March 2020 Dr Berelowitz observed that she was the child who was perhaps most open to contact. </p>

When the guardian talked to Z about his views about his living arrangements, he expressed – as he always has done – that he wants to live with F and doesn't want to see M. He alleged that M was bargaining by allowing the children their screens and phones and threatening to take them away if they did not do what she wants. He was very negative about M stating that if there was one irritating person who had ruined his life, it was her. Yet at the same time, he has said that while he does not want to see M, he also said that he wants to help her. </p>

However, his behaviour when he is with her seems different to what he tells professionals.

All three children also need to feel safe when in the care of their parents. For the period they have been in the care of F there have not been any substantiated concerns about their physical safety.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In considering the children’s needs, the guardian relies on the professional definition of resilience as being the ability to persevere and thrive in the face of exposure to adverse situations. They are a sibling group who very much love each other, but they are also individuals with different personalities. And although by and large they were exposed to the same to the same or similar traumatic events in 2016 and 2018, their levels of resilience are different. Dr Berelowitz explained that in this situation where there are three children who have been alienated from their mother, they will tend not to follow the same paths. He said that each makes their own adjustments, and for each of them a different narrative exists. That can continue even if their relationship with the alienated parent, in this case M, improves. He advised strongly that it is therefore important to look at the children as individuals, and said it would be a mistake to treat them as a ‘job lot’. He cautioned against assuming that they are all the same.   </p>

He said the discord in the parents causes contact to hang by a thread. He advised that if the discord persists and there remains an ‘open psychological wound’ for the children, then the situation will continue to remain very fragile. While Y is relatively settled, the situation with Z fluctuates and is fragile, and with X, it is exceptionally fragile and also worrying. Dr Berelowitz’s opinion is that this is to be expected given the finding of alienation. </p>

It might be that the passage of time with increasingly successful contact with M, including staying contact, could provide sufficient positive experiences such that X’s uncertainty would diminish over time. F might be able, with the help of a suitable therapist, to give X a more comprehensive message about how his own behaviour impacted upon the evolution of her feelings about M. The same could apply to M. So there may be scope for X and the parents to have a modified form of systemic therapy, in which X and F, and X and M, have joint sessions with the same therapist.  </p>

He also advised that for any shared care arrangement to work, F needs to convey to X that he knows she is apprehensive <span style="text-decoration:underline">because</span> of him for which he is sorry and that he wants to do whatever he can to help her.

It is also reasonable to assume that such separation is likely to have a lasting effect on their relationships in the future. However, Dr Berelowitz advised that it is impossible to predict what the effect on X would be of X and Y beginning to improve their relationships with M in those circumstances, and of cleaving more to M. He advised that there is likely to be no obviously positive outcome for X in the short-term. He explained she might dig her heels in and become even more obdurate in her resistance to contact with M. Alternatively, she might have her eyes opened. Dr Berewolitz explained it would be very unwise for him to predict a specific outcome, because not all children have the same opinions about the qualities of their parents. His concern for these children is that if the situation remains polarised, then X’s own life story will become mutually incompatible with her siblings. This could lead to a ‘wedge’ between the children, and he was quite frank that he cannot explain how he, as a psychiatrist, would deal with that situation. </p>

He advised that, in the short term it is reasonable to assume that, in light of their expressed wishes and feelings, they will experience trauma and distress. They will also inevitably miss F to whom they are very closely attached. For X, it is likely that this will be very acute indeed, and things are likely to be very hard for her and M.

Due to concerns regarding X’s alleged vomiting and nightmares that F was reporting, the guardian was by then very concerned about X’s mental health, although no expert recommendation was made for her to undertake therapeutic work at that time. It was therefore in that context that the guardian suggested a befriending service for X with U where she could talk to someone who was not a family member about issues that were affecting her and also lessen her anxieties about seeing M and the maternal family. Both parents agreed with his suggestion and agreed to pay for the service, although F was initially opposed as he did not think that X had any mental health issues. The guardian made it clear to the parents that he was not making any diagnosis of mental health problems because he was not qualified to do so, but did feel that X needed support in one way or another. Although U helped X to have someone to talk to, however it clearly did not help to move contact forward. </p>

He said that unfortunately the level of mistrust in this case is so great that he does not think that the family can see any professional person with whom one of them has already had privileged conversations. It is for that reason he does not think Dr D is an option for providing systemic family therapy. Dr Berelowitz also commented that the state of play between the parents is such that it seems unlikely that mediation or therapy for the parents together, with or without the children, is currently possible. That echoes the view that I expressed at an earlier stage in these proceedings. Dr Berelowitz says he would very much like to be wrong about this and that it would be wonderful if a suggestion of systemic therapy could be taken up. He says that the great thing about systemic therapy is that it is a blame-free approach which looks at ways of nudging people out of entrenched patterns. He says however that he just does not think these parents are there yet. I agree.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">X appears to have been severely affected by alienation, in that she is rejecting of M and the maternal family. The guardian agrees with Dr Berelowitz that there is a risk of being diverted from the most significant factor that is causing X to reject M, namely the alienation caused by F, towards too great a focus on presenting ‘symptoms’ such as vomiting and the emotional distress that she is displaying. It is well documented that the children suffered previous harm in M’s care, including neglect of their basic needs and being physically hurt when she was intoxicated with alcohol and suffering from poor mental health in 2016 and 2018. That was confirmed in the local authority assessment completed in 2018. However, the guardian evaluates M’s alcohol use as a static risk factor and observes that she accepted she is an alcoholic during the factfinding hearing. She knows she must abstain from alcohol and there is no evidence to suggest that she has relapsed since these proceedings have been underway.  </p>

The guardian questions whether F has been doing enough to correct some distortions held by X. The guardian is concerned about the type of language that X uses; for example, accusing M of emotional blackmail and bargaining by wanting sympathy for events of the past. She appears to justify her rejection of M by saying that forcing her to spend time with them will cause her mental health problems and means that she will require therapy when she is older. The guardian describes her language as being very adult like for her age. She has talked of ‘child abuse’ at the Town B Centre, which in the guardian’s view is very much aligned to F’s narrative and raises questions about whether X is being exposed to inappropriate adult conversations.  </p>

While F does seem to accept that he needed to have done more in the past to promote and safeguard the children's relationship with M, and thinks he is indeed now trying significantly harder, Dr Berelowitz does not think that F fully accepts the consequences of the court finding that he made it hard for the children to be in a relationship with M in the first place.

As the guardian says, there have been countless other matters raised during these proceedings that have taken up considerable amounts of time and correspondence. One vivid example of this relates to X’s medical records which M previously tried to obtain, but was prevented from doing so by the GP surgery due to them being under the impression that she was not entitled to see them. Last year a Caldecott Guardian assessed X as being Gillick competent to decide who should see her records. X then instructed the GP surgery that she did not consent to M seeing the records. I subsequently directed that the guardian should view those records and that copies should be sent to the children’s solicitor in order for him to do so. Those records have not been shared with anyone else and I have not seen them. The guardian confirms that he does not believe the notes contain a great deal of information that is not already known about, although he cannot say for certain. What is important, however, is that it is clear from the notes that the surgery was indeed told previously not to disclose information to M. In the guardian’s view it is also clear from the notes that M was again excluded from exercising her parental responsibility as F is the only parent listed on the form. This is a reflection of the previous findings made by the court in relation to F excluding M from decisions about the children’s schooling and represents yet a further example of him seeking to restrict M’s exercise of her parental responsibility.  </p>

Dr Berelowitz essentially answers in the negative, by saying although there has been considerable progress latterly, X’s and Z’s relationships with M are far from being well enough established. Secondly he asks if F is indisputably moving in one direction only. Again, he answers in the negative, saying that in his view F is not and that he is still sometimes pulled in the opposite direction with consequences. Thirdly, he asks if F’s progress will be sustained. He says unequivocally that in his own view this is too early to tell and the discord between the parents does not help.  </p>

He is also refreshingly frank when he says it is important to be clear that within his wider professional field there is little research and little agreement about what would constitute the best way forward at such a time.

At this point having listened to F in evidence in August 2020 very carefully and having considered all the evidence available at this time, I do not consider that it is possible to find that F could be relied upon unequivocally and wholeheartedly to support such work.

She appears to be doing well in school and has made friends with her peers. It is with these factors in mind that the guardian therefore proposes a cautious and measured approach is needed when dealing with X’s situation.  </p>

When he was asked about the impact of the change in F’s position to agreeing to the transfer of all three children to M’s care, he said the history of constructiveness is so recent in this case, that it is very difficult to predict the success of shared care in this case at this stage. </p>

This represented a very significant and unprecedented change in F’s case. It was acknowledged by all involved, including Dr Berelowitz and the guardian, that his decision has involved considerable fortitude and courage. Through counsel, F has given his commitment to making the transfer of residence work.

He described this as <span style="font-style:italic">‘exquisitely difficult territory’</span>. In light of F’s changed position, he was quite clear that, while there should be a period of ‘protective separation’, this should not be a punitive experience for F. He said that F needs to explain to X that he will not be responding to her texts or phone calls, and said that there must be no secret or back channels of communication to the children. He also said that any evidence that F later reneges on his commitment to making this arrangement work could be seen as a form of emotional abuse. He said that secrets between pairs of family members should be avoided, and that secrets should not be used to create intimacy between family members. </p>

The following morning, Dr Berelowitz and the guardian discussed and slightly revised the plan, and Dr Berelowitz then resumed his evidence for a third day to explain the thinking behind the revised proposal. Both he and the guardian agreed that the children should not be told about the plan until they were in M’s care. He agreed that the children could feel ‘tricked’  and that it could make things worse, at least in the short term for M; however, he was clear that this was the best option in an imperfect situation. He did say that in fact the words used with the children were less critically important than the actions afterwards. He advised that M should tell the children together, followed by a remote meeting with F and the guardian. He advised there should be no contact for at least three weeks with F, but that M should contact F by email once or twice a week in that period to update him on how the children were doing. He was clear that he could not set out a roadmap for resuming contact at this stage but said that because the guardian has such a good feel for the issues in this case, the parents should be guided by his judgment. However, he was clear that there should be no direct contact until the matter has been reviewed by the court after three months. He advised that X and M will need immediate therapeutic support during the transition period and has considered names suggested to him and advised M on recommended family therapists who can carry out that work. </p>

It is only since September 2020 that they resumed contact with M, and only since November 2020 that they began to have overnight staying contact with her.

There is a high risk, based on the history, that F will be unable to promote contact consistently and predictably. Dr Berelowitz reminded the court that the best predictor of future behaviour is past behaviour. He cautioned that of course this must be viewed through the prism of a belief within the family justice system that people can change. But the fact remains that the children’s journey to resuming contact with their mother has been tortuously slow and beset with difficulty, even as recently as this month. It is right to say that F’s progress is still very much in its infancy. The combination of F’s inability and/or unwillingness (whichever it is matters not) with the obvious impact of the alienation on all three children, albeit to different degrees in each child, vastly increases the likelihood that the continued path of contact will not be smooth. If the children remain living with F, it is likely they will be deprived of the optimum opportunity to enjoy a full and rich relationship with M also. </p>

All parties are agreed, and Dr Berelowitz and the guardian advise, that it is in the children’s best interests to enjoy a full and rich relationship with both parents. The likely detrimental effect on the children of this option is that it will prevent them having such a relationship with M. That cannot be in their best interests and so this option cannot be said to be realistic for that reason. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The benefit of a shared care arrangement would be that it removes the burden of responsibility from the children. It places the locus of control firmly and equally in the hands of the parents. That in turn is likely to reinforce to the children that both parents have equal status in terms of their parental powers and responsibilities. This option would also enable all three children to stay together. Finally a shared care arrangement would enable all three children to have equal contact with both parents in a predictable and stable routine. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">M's case is that if the court makes a shared care arrangement F will very quickly find an excuse to stop contact and reinforcing the children that she is a risk to them. Her concern is that F will continue to create false memories in the children that she did something wrong. For example, he has told the children that the reason they have not seen her for two years was because she left to concentrate upon her career and did not love them. She describes sending the children many, many letters over that period, almost all of which they did not receive. She greatly fears that the children will grow up with no contact with her or the maternal family which will cause them emotional harm in the long term. In short, she says they will learn from F how to cause chaos and destruction and harm to other people which will make them unhappy and unpopular individuals. These are bold submissions on her part but indicate the very great strength of her feeling. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">She firmly believes that if the court now orders that there should be a shared care arrangement it will breakdown very quickly. She says F does not trust her and has demonstrated since 1 October 2020 through his behaviour that he will do anything to undermine her relationship with the children. She says he has convinced himself that she will relapse and start to abuse alcohol and will put the children at risk. M's case is that there is no cogent evidence to support F’s concerns. The reality is she has now not drunk alcohol for two years and five months. She is also now in a very different emotional place and is happily married to a loving and caring husband.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The risk of a shared care arrangement is that it will involve yet more chaos and upheaval for the children. The previous two shared care arrangements, ordered by the court, have failed in the past. The shared care arrangement to which both parents subscribe would involve also a fair amount of weekly upheaval and is likely to be unsettling for all three children. The proposed shared care arrangement would require the children to move between the houses every three or four days. A further detriment of this option is that it is contrary to the expressed wishes and feelings of all three children, particularly X.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Again I find that the likely detriments of this option far outweigh any likely positives. In the context of such a long protracted history of acrimony and discord between the parents, it seems highly unlikely, if not impossible, that these parents could make such an arrangement work successfully, at least in the medium to long-term. Such regular transition between the households provide simply too many opportunities for things to go wrong in what remains an incredibly fragile, finely balanced and delicate situation. F needs to demonstrate needs to demonstrate significant and sustained shift in his actions and behaviour, not just his words and language. That cannot be done quickly, and needs to be tested and proven over time. I therefore do not consider this option to be realistic at this stage of these children’s lives. </p>

If this option is combined with a period of protective separation from F, there is also the risk that their relationship with F could deteriorate. As Dr Berelowitz said, there is no point in replacing one alienating relationship with another. There is also a possibility that at least for X she could run away which is harmful to her, and risks destabilising Y and Z. </p>

Another benefit of this option would be that Y and Z could resume good quality relationships with their extended maternal family which have, as I have already found, been fractured and damaged by F.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The obvious detriment of this option is that the children would be separated from each other, and in all likelihood the impact of this on their sibling relationship would be damaged in the medium to longer term. This option also risks polarising the alliances within the family which is not in the children’s best interests. It is highly likely that X’s relationships with M and the maternal extended family will remain damaged and fractured, if not indeed non-existent. There is a real risk that X never re-establishes her relationship with M. And there is a very real and significant risk that this option would cause significant harm to all three children. All the concerns I have previously highlighted about F’s inability to promote contact would apply to X here. There is also a very real risk of the concern already expressed by the guardian and Dr Berelowitz of the enmeshed and intense relationship between F and X continuing. This cannot be in X’s best interests because she needs to separate emotionally, as all children do, from her parents. The chance of this happening for X if she remains living with F, particularly without her siblings, seems highly likely. </p>

I agree. <span style="text-decoration:underline">Option 3</span> is not without its risks as already identified, particularly in the short term. However, I must also consider the medium and long-term situation for these children. Dr Berelowitz reiterated that F’s attitude is an important factor; the more F supports the plan the more likely a move to a more shared care arrangement in the future will be. However the less supportive F is, the more artificial the plan will be. He thinks F understands this. He said that in summary Y and Z are likely to settle with M. He said he expects they will be sad from time to time but they will settle, but they need to be protected from the undermining that could happen. However, he said one possible outcome which is challenging and sad is that Y and Z settle well, but that X becomes ever dependent on F and evermore isolated. He has considered whether it would be possible to transfer residence for Y and Z, but leave X in F’s care. He thinks this would leave X vulnerable.  </p>

If she moves and one says to her that if it doesn't work then she can go back to F, then we are setting up a ‘hostage to fortune’ situation where she may undermine the plan in order to go back to F. At the time of meeting the guardian, Dr Berelowitz’s mind was not made up. However, he thought that splitting the children as a proposal would certainly safeguard Y and Z. He said in his opinion a lot still depends on F’s capacity to change. If this works well and he manages to change, this will be a magnet that draws X into a relationship with him and her siblings. However if it does not work F and X could become more isolated, she could move away and have nothing to do with M and the siblings. Dr Berelowitz cannot predict whether it will be one or the other. In his opinion a lot will also depend on how M proposes that it would work and would be managed if X was to move as well. </p>
