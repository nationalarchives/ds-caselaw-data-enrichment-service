The other parties to the application are her husband, HX, and their two adult daughters, NX and LX. They were joined as intervenors in the litigation as a result of their status as beneficiaries of family trusts which have been the vehicle for holding a substantial element of the wealth which has been generated during the course of this long marriage.  I propose to refer to the parties respectively as “the wife” (W), “the husband” (H) and “the children” notwithstanding that decree nisi was pronounced in December 2020.  It is a convenient shorthand and I intend no disrespect to any of these family members in so doing.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.53in">This was a long marriage of some 33 years.  H and W met in the early eighties and were engaged within six months of meeting.  They married in 1985 when W was 24 and H 30 years old.  Over the course of the next decade, they had four children.  In what must have been a tragedy for the entire family, their second child, C, died as a result of a brain tumour when she was very young.  That defining family event has left its legacy for each of her parents and her siblings.  Those three children have grown into remarkable young adults.  Two have already forged, or are forging, brilliant careers of their own in the world of finance and law.  E, their only son, is now in his 30s.  He has followed in the footsteps of his father and has enjoyed notable success in the world of banking and investment and is now independently wealthy in his own right.  N, in her 20s, has qualified as a solicitor and is now working in one of the major City firms in central London.  L, also in her 20s, graduated from one of the top US universities.  These are the children of their parents who are rightly proud of all they have achieved, as they should be. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.53in">This divorce and its repercussions for the family have been described during the course of these proceedings as ‘a tragedy’.  It is a description which is apt for a number of reasons principal amongst which is the complete breakdown in the family dynamic.  W is now all but estranged from her two daughters who appear to have aligned themselves with their father.  It is not for this court to seek to understand why this has come about.  From the evidence which has </p>

None of that detracts from the very full contribution which W clearly made whilst these children were growing into adulthood.  She described her role as their mother as the central achievement of her life.  The current rift with her children has been a matter of much sadness to her and it is one which she hopes and intends to repair.  However, the current estrangement between these adult daughters and their mother finds some resonance or reflection in the financial repercussions which now flow from the dissolution of this marriage and it is for that reason alone that I mention it at the outset of the narrative which underpins W’s current claims. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.53in">There are several issues which separate the parties in terms of computation.  I shall turn to these shortly.  However, the headline figures are not in dispute.  Depending upon how certain categories of assets and liabilities are treated, the wealth available for distribution at the end of this long marriage is, in broad terms, somewhere between £50 million (on H’s case) and £60 million (on W’s case).  In fact, H has generated significantly greater wealth over the course of the last 30 years.  There is a sum of c. US$50 million held in an offshore trust (the S Trust) in respect of which the children are now the principal beneficiaries.  For a significant period during this litigation, those trust assets had been within the scope of W’s financial claims.  For reasons to which I shall come, she now accepts, on advice, that these funds are no longer ‘resources’ to which H should be treated as having access.  This aspect of matrimonial computation was to have been one of the key live issues in the case since it is accepted by each of H and W that the wealth held within the S Trust has been generated entirely during the course of the marriage.  Thus, whilst there remains wealth in the order of tens of millions of pounds which is available for division, a very significant element of what was historically treated as ‘family’ wealth is now agreed to be excluded from the dispositive powers of the court. </p>

Whilst the marriage has not been without its difficulties over the years, most notably in 1991 and 2013 when W issued earlier divorce petitions, this has been a long marriage to which both parties have made a full contribution.  As she accepts, W has suffered periods of ill health at points in the marriage.  She was diagnosed with a bipolar / anxiety disorder and was at one point early on in the marriage hospitalised as a result of her illness.  From the evidence which I heard, it appears that she remained relatively well throughout many years whilst the children were growing up.  She looked after the family without help from a full-time nanny and I accept that, whatever nuance might have been expressed in H’s written evidence, she played a full role as mother and homemaker to these children and to H.  He was, and is, a wholly committed father to each of his children and the bond between them about which I heard and read was almost tangible. </p>

Whilst North American by birth, he has lived and worked in England for over forty years.  He began his career with a major city bank and was asked by the bank to move to London in 1977 when he was 22 years old.  Six years later, he became a partner and an equity participant.   </p>

Over more recent years, that industrial past and the wealth it generated provided the bedrock of a successful transition to investment management.  W grew up in a financially privileged environment.  Whilst still a young child, she had become a beneficiary of an offshore trust set up by her father.  As a young woman, she received an income from that trust fund as the life tenant.  A further trust fund was set up for her benefit when her father died some six years into the marriage.  These are the two trusts which are now worth just under £9 million net.  Over the years they have produced for her an independent income which, in the later years of the marriage, has been as high as c.£350,000 gross per annum (some £235,000 net).  Whilst there is a power in the trustees to advance capital, she has always regarded these funds as “family money” which is to be preserved and passed down through the generations of Y family members.  Over the years, she has been the beneficiary of some limited capital distributions which were used to discharge tax bills in years when she had spent the entire gross income generated by the underlying trust funds.  </p>

W herself would not claim to be financially sophisticated or to have any particular acumen in dealing with matters of a financial nature.  Mr Marks QC has described her upbringing as something of an anachronism and it is a description with which I would not disagree.  In her own written evidence, W describes how, in financial terms, she “moved from [her] father’s care and control into [H’s] care and control”.

That family connection was in due course to provide him with a platform of independent wealth as he acquired shares in the family company.  W was aware that she was a beneficiary of family trusts which provided her with an independent income.  Over and above that basic level of understanding, she accepts that her knowledge of the specifics of their financial affairs was very limited.  Having listened carefully to her evidence, I do not believe that her lack of knowledge or understanding was in any way the result of any wish on H’s part to exclude her from financial discussions about their family position.  It is clear to me that W simply had no interest in acquiring an understanding.  She grew up as a young woman who had not been exposed to many of the educational and other influences which have rightly shaped her children’s life experiences.  She recognised and acknowledged very generously whilst she was giving her evidence that H was extremely good at his job and had provided for them handsomely as a family.  She regarded herself as having a different role to play and, whilst I do not underestimate the task which presented itself to her advisers as they started to develop a presentation of her (and the family’s) financial affairs when these proceedings commenced, I do not accept that there was any intention on the part of this husband during their marriage to keep her in the dark or deliberately side-line his wife over matters of a financial nature. </p>

Both were living in homes in central London (SW3 and SW7) when they met and married.  In 1986, some two years into the marriage, they pooled the sale proceeds from those properties to acquire their first jointly owned matrimonial home in M Street, South West London.  Together with the sums they spent on refurbishing that property, they spent close to £1 million.  That set the standard for an increasingly comfortable standard of living as the years went by.  In 1991, some six years into the marriage, they acquired what was to become a much-loved family home in the country.  In that year, H and W acquired a substantial country house in Oxfordshire (“the Oxfordshire property”).  That property was bought for just over £1.1 million.  It has been </p>

It is where H still chooses to spend most of his time when he is not in London during the working week.  Whilst W has not set foot in the property since she and H separated more than two years ago, it is the place which N and L regard as their ‘family home’.  As is clear from their written evidence, it occupies a very special place in their affections and they wish their own children to enjoy it as they did.  Their brother, who is independently wealthy as a result of his own career in finance, has not filed any evidence in these proceedings and I am told that he now rents his own country home outside London.  Whilst W now seeks to distance her affections for this property, I am satisfied that the family treated the Oxfordshire property as an important part of the fabric of their family life over many years. </p>

When it came to the acquisition of the Oxfordshire property, he arranged for it to be purchased through the vehicle of an offshore trust.  In March 1991, to coincide with the family’s intended purchase, he set up the H Trust which was based in Jersey.  Under its terms, he was, and is, both settlor and life tenant.  W enjoys a successive life tenancy in the event of his death.  The primary beneficiaries are their children and grandchildren.  There is in place a professional corporate trustee which is based offshore in Barbados.  SZ, H’s cousin is a qualified lawyer, lifelong friend and financial adviser.

He analyses this trust as a bespoke vehicle which was created some 30 years ago to put the three children at the heart of future financial and tax planning whilst allowing H and W to enjoy all the benefits of the trust asset which became a much-loved family home.  He concedes that this was a prudent and fiscally sensible means of acquiring the property.

It is agreed that it provided an idyllic backdrop to life away from the London lifestyle which absorbed them during the week whilst the children attended school.  It was where they chose to entertain friends and family.  It appears to be the property into which they invested time and love to make it a family home.  From his days as a young bachelor, H had developed a passion for art.  Whilst the precise value is a matter of some dispute, I am satisfied that he had acquired some valuable pieces by the time of the marriage in the mid-1980s.  Over the years, his collection increased as he purchased further works using both his personal and trust funds to finance acquisitions.  Much of his art collection is displayed in the Oxfordshire property.  He incurs a substantial cost on an annual basis to ensure it is kept safely and securely.   As will be apparent given the size of the property and its environs, it is expensive to run and maintain.  I am told that the annual cost to H is in the region of £350,000 per annum. </p>

In 1999, two further trusts were set up by H or at his instigation.  This step was part of a much wider and forward-looking tax and planning strategy.  At this juncture in his life, H had left employment with the bank to work full-time in his family’s international business.  Leaving the bank’s employment produced a significant cash injection for the family.  In his written evidence he stated that, in addition to a bonus of c. US$ 5 million, he was able to sell a block of shares he had acquired (including his partnership shares) for c. US$19 million.  He used this capital to expand his shareholding in the family business and took on a senior executive role on both the board and the executive committee.  Given that these events occurred over 20 years ago, there is no clear financial trace of each of these transactions.

To complete the structure, N Ltd then sold the shares it had acquired to the S Trust.  In turn, it received a further promissory note for an equivalent value which reflected in US dollars the full value of the consideration it had paid by way of its earlier promissory note drawn in H’s favour.  N Ltd had already issued a special class of voting shares to H which enabled him to continue to control the voting rights attached to his original shares rather than having to relinquish these rights to the trustee. </p>

This structure thereby provided the “churn” which enabled H to extract value from his family shares when he needed access to funds guaranteed by the existence of the promissory note.    The original intention had been to preserve the capital value of the family shares.  Any funds paid out under the terms of the promissory note would be generated through the substantial accumulated dividend income which the shares produced.  The manner in which the three entities had been set up allowed for the possibility of H being able to access capital in the future although the primary intention had been to place the increase in the value of the family shares outside the taxable parameters of H’s estate thereby avoiding a charge to inheritance tax.  The trust / loan scheme proved to be a very successful vehicle in terms of both its flexibility and tax efficiency. H retained full control of his voting rights in the North American shares and received full consideration for the value of his shares on a tax-free basis.  Those repayments would ‘wash through’ the structure from the S Trust which was now the legal owner of the shares. </p>

The significance for the purposes of this litigation is this: whilst there was an element of inherited wealth in the underlying value of the shares, it seems that the greater value in the price reflected in the promissory note for £10.5 million was consideration for blocks of shares acquired separately by H over the course of the marriage.  </p>

He did not need the funds and the significant dividend income generated by the shares was rolled up as an accretion to the S Trust assets.  With greater liquidity within the trust and the loss of the salary he had been drawing from the company following the 2005 takeover, H took the view that he could trigger a request for payment of the loan note without compromising the trajectory of capital growth. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.53in">Mr Bishop QC relies on the events of the next three years as evidence of the matrimonial nature and provenance of the funds flowing from N Ltd into the family’s coffers.  There is no issue between the parties in relation to the facts and figures underpinning the distributive process from the trust structure which followed or the application, in general terms, of the funds which were paid to H.  Initially, a repayment schedule of £30,000 per month (£360,000 per annum) was agreed.  However, in the early part of 2006, H and W took the decision to move from their London family home in M Street to a much larger property.  They viewed the present family home in South West London and decided to make an offer.  In the absence of a purchaser for their home in M Street, H approached Mr SZ with a request to accelerate the promissory loan note repayments.  With the agreement of the trustee, a sum of £6.65 million was advanced from the S Trust through N Ltd for these purposes.  The purchase was competed on a mortgage free basis in October 2006.  Over the course of the next two years, the parties spent very significant sums improving and refurbishing their new London home to their taste and requirements.  By this stage, the family’s annual expenditure was increasing exponentially.  With regular holidays to Mustique and the rest of the world and flights on private jets, H was obliged to request several further advances in respect of the agreed schedule of loan note repayments.  By early 2008, the promissory note had been repaid in full.  The final payment of just under £1.15 million was paid to H in mid-February 2008. The proceeds of the M Street property, when it finally sold later that year, were ploughed into meeting the family’s general expenditure requirements and the ongoing renovations being undertaken at the London property. </p>

B House was strategically placed to enhance security at the main house and it offered the opportunity to provide accommodation for one of the employees who looked after the property.  The trustee of the S Trust agreed to advance funds of c.£573,700 to enable the acquisition to proceed.  The property is now an asset of the S Trust along with some of the valuable art which it acquired at the suggestion of H and which is now hanging on the walls of the Oxfordshire property.   </p>

This was also a payment which was designed to utilise what H has described as the “one off opportunity” to benefit from the rapidly closing window imposed by the UK Government in terms of the previous tax breaks afforded to non-domiciled UK residents.

Having received from N Ltd a payment of US$23.3 million in March 2017 just prior to the implementation of the tax changes, H loaned a sum of c.£9.285 million to M Inc in return for a five-year interest-bearing promissory note.

That order, and its terms relating to the timetable for producing and agreeing an asset schedule, was specifically designed to avoid last minute alterations to the figures driven by volatility in the markets.  I accept that the court must work on the basis of the valuation of the assets as at the date of trial.   The valuation date which was agreed for these purposes was intended to reflect contemporaneous value whilst eliminating all the problems caused by constantly evolving asset schedules in the run-up to a final hearing.  To the extent that H seeks to rely upon updated valuations beyond the valuation date, fairness dictates that W should not be prejudiced by these late changes.  Just as there will have been fluctuations in the underlying trust assets on H’s side of the asset schedule, so too will the value of W’s trust assets have moved up or down.  It was for precisely this reason that there was consensus in relation to the valuation date which was selected. </p>

He included the full value of the property as his asset in his initial financial presentation in Form E together with a corresponding liability for CGT.  At a directions hearing in July 2019, Mr Marks QC accepted openly on his client’s behalf that the property was “fully nuptial”:  <span style="font-style:italic">“He accepts the entire value is in the pot”</span> and that <span style="font-style:italic">“the assets of [the H Trust] … are resources … falling within the court’s power”</span>.

The open offer which H made in August 2020 in the weeks leading up to the final hearing was predicated on the basis that each of the parties would leave the marriage with a share of the matrimonial assets of broadly equal value.  For these purposes, H included the full value of the Oxfordshire property on his side of the net effect table he produced, albeit under the heading “Trust assets”. </p>

In this case Mr Marks QC agrees that this figure is no more than one way of approaching a discounted value which, depending on the circumstances of any particular case, could be anywhere on the spectrum from 0% to 100%.  He argues that the figure cannot be 100% of market value on the facts in this case because H will not have the financial flexibility afforded to W through her unfettered ownership of the London property.  Mr Marks QC is nevertheless realistic enough to include in his presentation on H’s side of the asset schedule his client’s interest in the trust assets of the H Trust – i.e. the balance of the value of the Oxfordshire property over and above the hypothetical value of the life interest attributed to H by the SJE.    </p>

That is so regardless of whether such deployment has been achieved for legitimate or illegitimate purposes.  As I have said, I am quite satisfied that, in this case, the husband’s motives in establishing the trust structures which have been deployed throughout most of this marriage were legitimate and in line with the wider interests of the family.  He had generated, and was responsible for the management of, considerable wealth.  He had taken on that role with the blessing of W who I suspect would be the first to acknowledge that she did not have the financial skills or acumen which he brought to the role.  Over the course of a number of years, this family had the very considerable tax benefits which flowed from this structure.  In its component elements, it may have been expensive to set up and administer but it is clear to me, as it was to H, that these expenses were a small price to pay for the savings in tax which were achieved.  Until 2017, there was no apparent restriction on H’s ability to operate his financial affairs in this manner and these tax savings went a considerable way to enhancing the value of the funds available to this family in terms of its lifestyle choices.  Those were valuable benefits but with those benefits came the burden of relinquishing formal ownership of (and thus a significant degree of control over) the underlying trust assets.  It is clear from the unchallenged evidence of both H and Mr SZ that he was given a clear warning about the legal implications of alienating assets into the trust structures. </p>

H’s concern is that to treat it as “cash” in his hands when he cannot realise that cash value without the cooperation of trustee, protector and his children would lead to an unfair result.

H was transparent and, I find, honest in his oral evidence when he told me that he had been on a “significant learning curve” through the current divorce process.  Until these arrangements became the subject of intense forensic scrutiny through the disclosure process, I am sure that H regarded himself as retaining a significant element of control over the structure of his family finances.  Until the proceedings commenced, and for some time thereafter, these adult daughters apparently knew very little about the scale of the wealth which was sheltered for their benefit within the trust structures which H had set up.  On one view, they were independently wealthy young women in their own right having received substantial benefits from the maternal and paternal sides of the family.  They have, or anticipate acquiring, their own mortgage-free properties in central London and both can look forward to successful careers of their own.  Neither H nor W had yet engaged in family discussions about estate planning and, but for the divorce, there is nothing to suggest that either of these parents would have commenced those discussions with their children at this stage of their lives.  I had the impression that this is part of the ‘tragedy’ which H described to me when he was speaking about the family breakdown which flowed from the divorce.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.53in">During the course of his oral evidence H was taken to the terms of a memorandum which was prepared in 2003 for the purposes of providing W with some reassurance about her financial situation in the event of H’s death.  She told me that he was a very frequent flyer back and forth across the Atlantic and, with Mr SZ based many thousands of miles away in North America, she wanted reassurance that, if anything were to happen to H, she would have financial support and the flexibility to manage life going forward for herself and the children.  Mr SZ prepared the 2003 memorandum which was provided to W and a close family friend who had volunteered to support her for these purposes.  The memorandum provides a clear and comprehensive account of all H’s assets and the structures within which they were held.  As a ‘road map’ it is a very helpful document.  Whether or not W absorbed its contents at the time, she retained the copy of the document she was given and has produced it for the purposes of these proceedings.  That memorandum confirms that, under the terms of H’s Will, she would become the outright owner of their London home.  She would also own the contents of the Oxfordshire property.  The balance of H’s estate, including his interest as the life tenant of the H Trust, would pass to her.  The memorandum contained a specific assurance that, if W wished to sell the property, the trustees would follow her wishes and she would receive both the income from the sale proceeds and, if she needed it, the capital as well.  Subject to that, the capital value of the H Trust would pass to the three children. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.53in">On behalf of W, Mr Bishop QC points to this document as clear evidence that the arrangement in relation to the Oxfordshire property is one which is susceptible to variation in circumstances where a consensus exists between H, Mr SZ and the trustee.  He points to the clear lines of communication between all three in the past and the pattern of dialogue and discussion which has been opened and concluded whenever H has previously wished to utilise trust assets.  He submits that the concessions which H has consistently made in the past in relation to the Oxfordshire property reflect the true underlying reality of the position.  These were concessions which were made in the full knowledge of his daughters’ views about the property.  H was asked specifically about the unlikelihood of his daughters standing in the way of a sale if that should prove necessary or desirable at some point in the future. </p>

He accepted that the position had changed from 2003 in that the trustee would no longer be looking at a situation where W had been left to run a substantial country property with very young children who needed her full-time care.  He had told her in these circumstances she should just take a year before she made any important decisions about her future.  He was confident that his close friend and trusted adviser, Mr SZ, would have been there to support whatever her wishes might have been.  Turning to the current situation, H told me that he did not know how the trustee and Mr SZ would adjudicate as between the various interests of the beneficiaries.  He wanted to believe that, if as a family, he and the children were to agree on a course of action, he could “try very hard for us to go forward together and any such decision would be a shared and mutually agreed decision”.    He recognised that he had a duty to do things properly and legally.  He told me he was aware that Mr SZ and the trustee would be astute to balance and protect the interests of the beneficiaries were he to act wilfully or capriciously.  He stressed that he was not saying to me that he believed that his daughters would prevent him from selling the property should he need to </p>

This evidence was supported in terms by Mr SZ who confirmed that he and the trustee would be unlikely to stand in the way of a family decision were there to be a consensus that the property should be sold and capital advanced to H.  As he said to me, if confronted in 2003 with a situation where the family wanted to sell the property, he would not regard these trusts as “locking the family in”.   In my judgment, the trustee and Mr SZ would not be likely to oppose a similar request were it to come in future from H and the children. </p>

Equally, I acknowledge the very close bond which exists between this father and his daughters.  Whilst W holds to the view that he has sought to influence their daughters’ views, the reality of the situation is that their interests are very much aligned in these proceedings with those of their father.  They have a common aspiration to continue to enjoy their family home in Oxfordshire and they have clearly determined to join cause with their father in supporting his position that he does not have an unfettered right to do as he wishes with the property.  He, in his turn, has been both honest and fair in his evidence to this court that, were he and they to act together to present Mr SZ and the trustee with a plan which involved some different arrangement in relation to the Oxfordshire property, he had reason to hope that approach might be considered and acted upon.  He was quite clear that his current aspiration was to continue to enjoy the property and all its amenities for the rest of his life. </p>

They are now beneficiaries of a trust which holds assets worth in excess of US$50 million.  All of that wealth was generated in one way or another by their father during the subsistence of his marriage to their mother.  Neither of their parents has any future claim on those funds.  These are relevant circumstances which any professional trustee exercising fiduciary responsibilities would need to take into account in the context of some future approach on behalf of its life tenant and primary beneficiaries. </p>

The deed contains clauses which enable him to replace both the trustee and the protector.  It makes specific provision which enables the trustee to ignore the interests of potential beneficiaries and release capital to the settlor.   Mr Cumming QC makes the point that neither H nor W required either of their daughters to submit themselves for cross-examination in relation to the content of their written statements.  He reminds me that, whilst H as settlor has reserved the power to appoint new or additional trustees, he does not have the power to remove the trustee and that the power of appointing new trustees is fiduciary in its nature: see <span style="font-style:italic">In re Skeats’ Settlement </span>[1889] Ch 522.      </p>

First, the trustee would need to be persuaded that it was in the best interests of all the trust beneficiaries for capital to be appointed out to H.  Second, the trustee would need to secure the agreement of the protector.  Third, and finally, the children would need to come on board with the arrangement and elect not to challenge the proposed course of action through the courts.

Whilst H can expect to enjoy the resource of living in the property for the rest of his life surrounded by all the beautiful contents with which it has been filled over the years, the likelihood is that the property will remain a trust asset until his death.  Save in circumstances where the court makes an order in these proceedings which leaves him in a position of having insufficient liquid resources to meet his ongoing needs, he is unlikely to see any direct financial benefit from the underlying trust asset which is represented by the Oxfordshire property.  In this context, he submits that it cannot be seen as an asset which is likely to be available to H as a future resource pursuant to <span style="font-style:italic">Thomas v Thomas </span>[1995] 2 FLR 668.

As far as the children are concerned, that provision has been made on an inter vivos basis and all three surviving children are now the beneficiaries of trusts which together hold assets worth many tens of millions of pounds.  As I have said, that factor is something which the trustee and protector would be bound to take into account were they required in future to weigh and balance any combined approach by H and the children, or H alone, for some form of financial assistance.  What this comes down to as a matter of practical application and fairness is the extent to which a division or sharing of the matrimonial property in this case which includes on H’s side of the balance sheet the full value of the Oxfordshire property meets overall fairness in terms of financial value and flexibility.  There is no issue that W will be free to do whatever she chooses with the London property.

That power is undoubtedly available to the court given its nuptial character.  The exercise of that power would enable the court, if satisfied that the order would be implemented offshore, to extract the Oxfordshire property from the trust and make outright provision in H’s favour.  I recognise that there are a number of fiscal and other reasons which make that an unattractive option.  The court should not interfere with existing trust arrangements unless it is necessary to achieve an outcome which is fair to both sides and caution is required where the rights of innocent third parties (such as beneficiaries) will be adversely affected:  see <span style="font-style:italic">Ben </span></p>

There is no immediate or reasonably proximate threat to H’s continued occupation of this property as a family home.  The only crunch point which might come is at a time further down the road when his resources are such that he might need access to further capital to run and maintain his lifestyle.  He acknowledges that the Oxfordshire property in terms of its age and size is expensive to run.  The amenity which he enjoys of having his (and the S Trust’s) art within the property represents a significant cost to him in terms of ongoing security.  He will need to make a number of decisions, as will W, once my judgment is made available at the conclusion of these proceedings and each party knows where he or she stands.

The order which I intend to make will leave each of H and W with a fair share of the available assets and I would not expect H to <span style="font-style:italic">need</span> to make such an approach to the trustee.  Ultimately it will be a matter for him what he chooses to spend over and above meeting his ordinary day to day expenditure.  These will be discretionary lifestyle choices and they will be made against the background of the standard of living which the parties enjoyed during the many years of their marriage, which I accept to be high.  I bear in mind that H was able to access the funds held within the S Trust over a significant number of years as a result of the tripartite structure which was set up in 1999.  He may or may not have anticipated that the very substantial distribution made to him in March 2017 was indeed the final benefit he was likely to see from this source.  There were no divorce proceedings ongoing (or even contemplated) at that stage.  He conceded in his replies to questionnaire that <span style="font-style:italic">“in extremis the trustee might theoretically consider him for further distributions”</span>.

H has consistently accepted and acknowledged that “the entire value” of the H Trust falls into the pot for the purposes of the section 25 exercise which the court is enjoined to undertake.  In his recent written statement, specifically prepared to address the s 25 factors which are engaged in the case, he accepted openly that the trust was wholly nuptial <span style="font-style:italic">“and its value can be attributed to me”</span>.  The entire value of the trust is represented by the value of the Oxfordshire property: there is nothing else.  H’s open offer made in August 2020 properly reflected the full value of the property as an asset of his for the purposes of its net effect on their respective financial positions.  It was a concession which was, in my view, properly made notwithstanding his formal status as the life tenant of the trust.

It seems to me that, absent any form of reliable evidence or agreed methodology, it would be both arbitrary and unfair were I to attempt to adjust the value of the Oxfordshire property by imposing some equally notional form of discount of my own.  In my judgment the facts speak for themselves.  There is little or no likelihood of a sale of this property in circumstances where H and the children wish to preserve it as a home for themselves and future grandchildren.  Those children (and their children) are now the only beneficiaries of the S Trust which has assets of over US$50 million under active management.  That trust already owns B House and much of the art which hangs on the walls in the Oxfordshire property.  Given that each of the individual beneficiaries has independent wealth outside their interests in the trust as well as what is likely to be a substantial earning capacity going forward, I do not believe that their interest in retaining the property is likely to be appreciably damaged by attributing its value to H for the purposes of the computation exercise in these matrimonial proceedings.  It reflects the entirely realistic stance which H has taken throughout these proceedings as well as what I find to be the underlying reality of the situation.  These two family trusts now share the same trustee and protector.  I find it difficult to conceive of circumstances in the future where these children would seek to stand in the way of a reasonable request from their father to join with him in an approach to the trustee/protector were he to find himself in a position where he needed additional funds to maintain himself or one of the trust assets (i.e. the Oxfordshire property).  Mr Bishop QC has made the point that there are sufficient assets in the S Trust to enable the children at some point in the future to extract the Oxfordshire property from the H Trust through an arm’s length purchase of the asset.  Since H is now excluded from all and any benefit flowing from the S Trust funds, I can see that there may be an issue for the trustee and/or protector in applying funds from the S Trust for that specific purpose but I do not need to speculate about that.  They have been ready in the past to harness expert professional advice in order to find legitimate and tax efficient solutions when situations affecting the family and/or the operation of the trusts have arisen in the past.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.53in">The fact of the matter is that this H has always accepted for the purposes of this litigation until very recently that, in terms of any sharing claims he may have, he should be credited with the full value of the underlying equity in the Oxfordshire property.  Whether that value is reflected in presentational terms as an outright entitlement or as the combined value of a life interest enhanced by his concession that any residual value is matrimonial in its provenance, it seems to me that it would be wrong to proceed on the basis that he will not be retaining the benefit of the full value of what has been his family home for the last thirty years.  I accept that he may not have the same degree of flexibility as W in terms of his ability to borrow against the property were he to approach a commercial lender.  I am nevertheless satisfied that the structures he has set up, operated as they are, and have been, through the professional trustee and the protector, will afford him the opportunity with the cooperation of his children to enjoy the occupation of that property without the need to contemplate a sale.  In my judgment it would be unfair to W at this late stage to proceed from the foot of a completely different case such as that which is now being advanced by H.    It is clear to me that he regards the main threat to his ability to remain in the property to be W’s claim for a lump sum of £10 million over and above the transfer of his interest in the London property.  He regards such a claim as impacting very significantly on his remaining liquid resources and thus his ability to run his own domestic economy over future years in this jurisdiction. To the extent that there needs to be some adjustment to reflect these matters, I take the view that can better be done at the discretionary stage of distribution. </p>

In a similar way, whilst he has no doubt guided the trustee’s purchases in relation to the art from the foot of his personal preferences as well as their investment value, he cannot sell the art and, other than through a wholesale rearrangement of the family trust structure, there is no prospect of him realising value for his personal benefit.  Of course there is a benefit (and no doubt great pleasure) in having the art in his home.  But to the extent that it is part of that home, it is equally a benefit which is available to the children (and, in due course, their children) who are also beneficiaries of the trust. </p>

There was a divergence between them as to the value of the general contents which each will retain in the homes they will occupy at the conclusion of these proceedings. This is no longer an issue.  H will retain general contents worth just over £630,000 in the Oxfordshire property and W will retain contents worth c.£327,000 in London.  On W’s behalf, Mr Bishop QC submits that these values should be included in order that allowance can be made in his client’s favour for the imbalance.  He points to the fact that general household contents have been included before in the parties’ presentations and W had a legitimate expectation when she agreed the <span style="font-style:italic">in specie</span> division of the other contents that values would be equalised.  He reminds me of his client’s oral evidence about the contents at the Oxfordshire property.

Aside from the value to H of the M Inc loan notes, there is some small residual value in the A Trust through both N Ltd and M Inc.  I have explained earlier in this judgment the basis upon which H was able to extract funds representing the crystallised value of his shares in the family business on a tax-free basis when those shares were transferred into the S Trust.  The loan notes issued by N Ltd were fully redeemed by the early part of 2008.  Using the same structure (albeit with a different SPV), H is currently owed £9,285,770 by M Inc.  Since M Inc is an offshore entity which is wholly owned by the A Trust (itself registered in Bermuda), H will not pay any tax on realising these funds unless they are remitted to this jurisdiction.    The main asset of the A Trust is an investment portfolio worth £10,318,326 (the Scotia portfolio).  The funds invested in the portfolio derive from part of the distribution of US$23.3 million which H received in March 2017 from the S Trust.

During the marriage H was able to remit the loan note repayments to this jurisdiction when he required funds since these were treated by HMRC as “clean” capital from the sale of his shares in the family business.  Most of these funds were invested in the acquisition of the London property. On behalf of W, Mr Bishop QC contends that H will adopt a similar strategy with the funds which he is owed by M Inc.  He submits that no allowance should be made for tax for three reasons.  First, the funds will not be remitted so as to create a taxable event.  If H finds himself in a position of needing funds in this jurisdiction, he will deploy a similar mechanism of interest free loans as he has done in the past.  Secondly, on the basis of W’s claim for £10 million over and above the transfer of H’s interest in the London property, these funds will be absorbed almost entirely in meeting that lump sum claim.  Since value can be delivered to W without incurring any tax liability if the funds are transferred to her offshore and then remitted by her to the jurisdiction, he submits on behalf of W that H should not be treated as having a potential liability in respect of tax on these funds when no such liability is likely to arise in practice.   </p>

No allowance was made in those calculations for the patriation tax which he now relies on in part to reduce his presentation of the global assets to £51.6 million.

If these funds or any remaining part of them are repatriated, they will be taxed as income on an arising basis.  We know that a significant part of this distribution has funded the value now represented by the value in the loan note.  Dixon Wilson confirm in their letter that the same tax treatment will be afforded to any funds which are brought onshore to the UK during any period whilst H remains resident in this jurisdiction.  Tax will be paid at H’s marginal rate of income tax and there is no time limit on the Revenue’s ability to trace back into the provenance of the funds.  A loan repayment received outside the UK will not attract any tax sanctions provided that the funds remain outside the UK.  In terms of tax mitigation, Dixon Wilson has suggested that there may be a means of avoiding UK tax if H were to make a gift of funds to any one or more of his adult children.  A subsequent transfer of those funds to the UK would not result in a UK tax liability for H provided that the gift recipient rules did not apply although there would be inheritance tax consequences were he to die within 7 years of making such gift or gifts. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.53in;text-indent:0.5in">Turning to H’s approach to tax matters generally, in his first statement dated 18 September 2019, H accepted that one of the purposes of the trust structure which had been set up was to enable him to remit on the basis of a tax free income stream the value of the shares in his family business (see para 24(e)).  That some of this income would be required in this jurisdiction to defray ongoing family expenses is evident from his reference later in that statement to the fact that he needed this income to replace the substantial salary which he had lost when he resigned as a board director.  Initially it had been anticipated that the loan note payments would have been made over a 30 year period at the rate of £30,000 per month.  There is no suggestion in H’s evidence that those payments would have attracted a liability to tax.  In a similar way, the substantial payments which H received until 2017 from the S Trust (through </p>

He accepts that these payments were also made onshore and used in the main to meet family living expenses although that route is now closed.  The substantial distribution which he received in 2017 was similarly extracted on a tax-free basis.  H has confirmed in his written evidence that he anticipated at the time that the 2017 promissory note (which is now worth in excess of £9.28 million to him) would be used to meet the ongoing needs of the family without the need for any further calls on the assets of the A Trust in future. </p>

It is implicit in my finding in relation to the Oxfordshire property that this is where he intends to spend most of his time and the base which he considers to be his permanent home.  Intentions can, and do, change but I have to act upon the best information which is available to me.  I regard H as a fundamentally honest and fair witness and I accept what he told me about the importance which he attaches to preserving this property as his home.  Whilst it was not a particularly fertile area of cross-examination during the hearing, it was tolerably clear that his wish to purchase a base in central London for the purposes of his work in London was just that:  a pied à terre rather than a second London home. </p>

Whilst neither of these parties is going to be anything other than wealthy individuals at the conclusion of these proceedings, each may well need to review the level of their discretionary spending in future.  The ‘lavish’ lifestyle which each describes may well require some fine-tuning.  These are not decisions for this court but it seems to me that it would be to ignore the facts if I were to assume that H will not in future need recourse to these offshore funds, or some part of them, to run his own domestic economy at the </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.53in;text-indent:0.5in">I accept that there is no reliable evidence before the court that the trust structure set up by H has created any tax consequences over the previous years of its operation.  The evidence which I do have from Dixon Wilson in relation to his future tax exposure is reasonably clear.  Given that the M Inc revenue stream may be a resource to which he will need to look to meet his future income needs in this jurisdiction, it seems to me to be wrong in principle and unfair in practice to proceed on the basis that the entirety of his trust assets should be brought into account without any eye to future, as yet unknown, tax implications.  In the final analysis I accept that he may decide to relocate his tax situs for residence purposes.  That, in my judgment, is not something which is likely to happen in the foreseeable future.  I do not know how H will choose to structure his financial arrangements going forwards.  I am satisfied that he will take what steps he can to minimise his exposure to UK tax but he will be living in this jurisdiction and running his life here.  I can only make a broad-based assumption as to what might be a fair allowance in the circumstances.  I propose to make an allowance of 50% of Mr Marks QC’s global tax calculation, i.e. a figure of £2,429,176<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="3">
		<p class="footnotedescription" style="margin-right:0.00in"> [£4,178,597 + £679,755] = £4,858,352 x 50% = £2,429,176 </p>
	      </authorialNote>.  In my judgment this makes an appropriate allowance for any contingent tax which he is unable to avoid.  All the evidence suggests that he will take all the steps available to him to minimise tax exposure and I do not consider it appropriate to make any greater allowance on the facts as I find them to be.  In my judgment that allowance provides a fair reflection of his potential tax exposure whilst giving appropriate weight to the very fair submissions made by Mr Bishop QC which look to the past to inform what is likely to happen in the future.  In circumstances where he relies on a complete ‘indemnity’ in terms of W’s potential exposure to tax in relation to her separate trust assets, it would not be </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.53in;text-indent:0.5in">As to W’s position, it is a fundamental aspect of her case to this court that she regards her Y-generated trust wealth to be dynastic in nature and of principal benefit to her only in terms of the income which it generates.  Such capital as has been advanced to her over the years is minimal and has been used to meet tax on the income received where she has failed to make an allowance for the same.  Because it is part of W’s case that the court should ignore these funds entirely in its approach to the division of the available assets, the impact of tax does not have quite the same traction on net effect as it does for H.  As I have stressed, the court is here dealing with the underlying realities in this case.  The tax in respect of W’s trust interests has been calculated, and agreed in terms of quantum, on the basis that it will be payable in respect of gains regardless of whether or not distributions are made.  Whilst there was a disagreement between the parties as to the applicable rate of tax in relation to one of the Jersey settlements, that issue is not being pursued.  Subject to H’s arguments in relation to the ‘matrimonialisation’ of W’s trust funds, it is accepted that this is non-matrimonial property in terms of its provenance.   I accept that the trustees have a power to advance capital and I do not rule out the possibility that W may choose at some stage in the future to approach them on this basis. Nevertheless I accept what W told me about her intentions in relation to these funds.  She regards them as being principally the vehicle for generating income after her death for the benefit of her own children and grandchildren.  On the basis that these funds are likely to be used during W’s lifetime to provide her with an income, I propose to proceed on the basis that the Y funds are primarily an income resource in her hands rather than a liquid capital asset which she is likely to realise as cash in the foreseeable future.  For the purposes of computing an overall figure for the total assets which are available to these parties, I have included W’s trust assets ‘below the line’ as non-matrimonial property.  I will consider shortly the extent to which the existence of these funds in W’s hands has any impact at all on overall distribution of the available liquid assets.  For the purposes of <span style="font-style:italic">overall</span> computation I have included the Y-derived assets which W owns personally </p>

Perhaps not surprisingly, neither can say with complete precision what these were worth although it is not difficult to categorise what they were.  In W’s case, she brought the equity in her flat in C Gardens which she contributed towards the purchase of their first matrimonial home in M Street.  In addition she had some shares in her Y family investment structure which appear to have been worth approximately £1.8 million.  She was the beneficiary of a bespoke sub-trust set up by her father in 1972 which had been carved out of a wider discretionary family trust.  She was, and is, the life tenant of that fund; the trustees have power to advance capital.  When her father died in 1990 some five years into the marriage, she became a beneficiary under the terms of his Will. That inheritance, worth some £1.9 million at the point of receipt, is held within a UK based trust carved out of the main Will trust. W is the income beneficiary during her life and there is also a power in the trustees to advance capital.    In terms of the issues to be determined in this litigation, part of that inheritance included some land on the W Estate, her late father’s country estate.

He also owned shares in his family’s business which he had inherited from his grandfather which he claims had a value of c. CAD$1.5 million when he married.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.53in">Mr Bishop QC has challenged this figure.  In terms of the shares which he claims to have inherited from his grandfather prior to the marriage, he points to the absence of any documentation and an inconsistent representation made earlier in the proceedings on H’s behalf that these shares were acquired through purchase and not through gift or inheritance.  That seems to be supported by the instructions which were given to the lawyer who advised H and Mr SZ in connection with the tripartite trust structure in 1999.  It seems to me that if some of these shares were acquired before his marriage to W, it matters not whether they were inherited or purchased from other family members in terms of their description as pre-marital assets.  In any event they formed only a small percentage of the shareholding he was subsequently to accumulate over the course of the marriage.  What has been established is that H’s accumulated shareholding in the family business was worth $25 million (£10.446 million) at the time the shares were transferred into the S Trust in 1999, some fourteen years into the marriage.  The full value of those shares at that time was extracted through the N Ltd loan note by 2008.  The residual value achieved by the sale of the shares in 2005 (some US$52 million) </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.53in">The conundrum in this case as this very long marriage now ends is how the court should fairly reflect in its award the different ways in which the parties managed their wealth from the outset.  It is accepted that W’s inherited wealth has always been kept separate and outside the financial arrangements which were put in place to manage the family’s domestic economy.  Whilst she used the income which she received from the family trusts to meet some of the children’s and her own personal needs (supplemented by an allowance she received from H), the underlying capital has never been mixed or blended with the family finances generally.  For all intents and purposes her funds were ring-fenced.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.53in">In contrast, virtually all of H’s premarital wealth, together with the wealth he went on to generate through the long years of this marriage, has been applied towards the support of his family and the acquisition of assets from which they have had the benefit.  Even the wealth held within the S Trust which is now beyond the reach of the court was for many years available to the family through the trust structure which H set up with Mr SZ.  Aside from those items for which W paid out of her trust income, H has met all this family’s financial needs including the majority of the funds deployed in the purchase of their two homes.  He paid for the extensive renovations which were undertaken at their London home.  He has underwritten their increasingly opulent standard of living and continues to do so.  Whilst he has no doubt seen this as his role in the marriage just as W regarded her role as wife, mother and homemaker, Mr Marks QC asks now on his behalf how W’s proposals for settlement can be seen as a fair outcome.  In terms, he submits, W is asking for half of everything generated during the marriage without any acknowledgement or recognition that she is already a wealthy woman in her own right.  That she has been able to conserve those separate funds is no more than a reflection of the financial arrangements which were put in place whereby H agreed to fund everything (in part through the effective donation of his non-matrimonial assets) whilst leaving untouched his wife’s inherited wealth. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.53in">At the time of the marriage W’s wealth was held within a privately-owned family trust company whose shareholders were members of the Y family. The assets of the trust company consisted of substantial cash sums and a minority shareholding in a publicly quoted company called ZZ plc.  This was an investment company which held a wide range of investments in quoted and unquoted securities and other assets mainly in the banking and financial sectors.  Because the family trust company was a private corporate entity with no external non-family members, there was a limited market for the shares.  Share value from time to time was fixed by the board on the basis of an income or dividend yield.  Since ZZ plc was a quoted company, the shares in the private family company were subject to a substantial discount in terms of the value available to an investor on the open market.  In his written evidence, H has put that discount at some 60% to 70%.  I have no way of knowing whether or not that is an accurate estimate and it matters not for the purpose of the exercise in hand although Mr CY supported those figures in his evidence to the court. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.53in">H became involved in the management of W’s funds in 2000. At that stage there were moves afoot within the family towards a restructuring of the company with a view to eliminating that discount.  He advised W that she would see a greater return on her underlying wealth if she were to diversify and reinvest her funds on the basis of a wider investment strategy.  To this end, he represented her interests in what appears to have been an acrimonious and very public split amongst the Y family members and shareholders.  As sides within the family were taken by those members wishing to leave and those wishing to stay within the family structure, significant sums were spent on hiring professional tax and legal advisers.  After three years of what H has described as long and difficult negotiations, an agreement was reached with the “exiting” shareholders, including W.  H’s evidence is that the share value for those ‘leavers’ was more than three times what they had originally been offered when the dispute began.  HMRC agreed that the ‘leavers’ would not have to pay tax when they cashed in their shares provided that the proceeds were invested in the new Cell Corporation which H had set up as an alternative investment vehicle for their funds.  Those family members who remained within the original Y scheme took the benefit of a separate deal which was struck with the Revenue which enabled them to leave with a zero cost base for CGT purposes. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.53in">H accepts that, in steering through this exit strategy, he acted as part of a small team with another family member and several professional advisers.  Once out of the original family structure, each ‘leaver’ was thereafter able to take a much greater level of control over how his or her funds were deployed within the new structure which was put in place to manage their family wealth.  This was achieved by incorporating an offshore vehicle which acted as a cell company.  Thereafter, whilst subject to UK income tax, the individual cell owners were able to buy and sell assets within the confines of the corporate structure without paying tax on any capital gains made.  H describes this undertaking as a huge commitment in terms of his time and effort over nearly four years.  It was a commitment which he claims to have made not only for W but also for her fellow family ‘leavers’, each of whom benefitted financially to the same extent as W.  H became a director of the new cell company overseeing its administration and running.  Whilst he received a modest fee for doing so, he has undertaken this work over the last two or three years for no financial reward at all.  It is accepted by W that since her funds were moved into the cell structure, H has been responsible for all investment decisions. </p>

That said, he relies on his client’s efforts as having produced greater flexibility and increased value for W as she leaves this marriage.  Whilst he accepts that the wealth deriving originally from the Y family has been kept separate and apart from their own family funds, he maintains that it is impressed with a significant and valuable contribution made by H.

I heard evidence on this aspect of the case from two Y family members.  Mr NY filed a statement in support of H’s case.  He described H’s role in the corporate restructuring as “pivotal”.

In his written evidence he confirmed that since W and the others left, there have been no further family sales although shares had changed hands internally between family members on the basis of what he called “legacy disposals”.  He, too, provides a great deal of background to the circumstances surrounding the “departure” of the six family members and describes the significant level of acrimony which it produced amongst the wider family.  He makes the point, which does not appear to be in issue as a fact, that the HMRC clearance which was secured in respect of the retention of the low base cost for the remaining family members was negotiated and agreed by professional advisers employed by the ‘remainers’ without input from H.  Whilst there appears to be an issue in relation to whether or not the ‘leavers’ were required to dispose of all their shares in ZZ as the price for the Revenue’s agreement that the price paid to the ‘leavers’ for their YTC shares would not reset the base value for the ‘remainers’, each of these two witnesses has recognised the extent of H’s involvement in the extraction process. </p>

As H accepts, these are funds which have at all times over the last 35 years remained separate and segregated from the wider family finances.  H accepted during the course of Mr Bishop QC’s cross-examination that there had never been an understanding, far less an agreement, that the funds should be shared or that H should acquire any interest in them as a result of his management role.  That was an honest concession on H’s part and it was a realistic one.  As I have found, W’s genuine intention is that these assets should remain available for the purposes of providing an income for the future benefit of family members, her children, grandchildren and their issue.  H confirmed in his written evidence that he had not thought it necessary to include W as a member of the class of beneficiaries when he set up the trust structure in 1999 because she had her own independent wealth.  He did not ask her for any contribution towards the purchase or substantial renovation costs of the London property or the earlier acquisition of the Oxfordshire property.  When, later in the marriage, there was some discussion about the possibility of acquiring property in Mustique, an aspiration with which they did not proceed, there was no suggestion that W would be required to use her own funds towards any purchase.  W’s evidence, which I accept, was that he produced some figures for her to show that they had sufficient family wealth available to make this possible.  I accept his evidence that he believed that the trustees would have been unlikely to sanction a purchase in the Caribbean using trust funds to acquire a property costing in excess of $20 million.  However, at no stage during these discussions was it suggested that W should make a contribution from her personal wealth.  In this context I accept what W told me that at one stage H had suggested to her that their family wealth amounted to c. £100 million.  Given that his exclusion as a potential beneficiary of the S Trust was not in place until last year, this was probably a fairly accurate assessment of the position at the time. </p>

There is no suggestion that, when the property was subsequently sold some 18 months later, the trust’s investment was merged with the matrimonial assets.   </p>

Were this the outcome, says Mr Marks QC, he would be unable to enjoy a similar lifestyle to hers over future years when his ability to retrench financially will be restricted.

That figure does not include the equity in her London flat which was used towards the purchase of M Street.  He acknowledges that the significant increase in the value of those nonmatrimonial funds over the years has a passive element of growth which falls outside any entitlement which H may have to share in the product of his contribution to the growth in value.

Looking to the available evidence in this case in relation to the value of W’s non-matrimonial assets, it is reasonably clear from the historic documentation which is available that she brought in c.£1.8 million at the outset and thereafter inherited a further £1.9 million when her father died in 1990.  A formal valuation statement dated 22 October 1991 shows that her assets within the two trusts as at that date were worth £2,348,640.  That was not a comprehensive statement of her net wealth at the time because it did not reflect the value of a number of other interests which she had inherited including her interest in the W estate and the retained land which has since become the subject of the option agreement with the provider of the service facilities.  She maintains that, in the absence of any material capital distributions over the years, the assets she brought in as non-matrimonial property are now represented by her cash and her investment portfolio together with the underlying value of the two original Y family trusts. </p>

By a table which he has produced in paragraph 64 of his opening note, he has calculated that the value of the YTC shares within the old family investment structure was increased threefold at the point of departure from £1.8 million to £5.4 million<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="5">

Mr Marks QC accepts for these purposes that there is no way of telling whether the dividends she could have expected to receive had she left her shares within the old structure would have been more or less than the income generated by the investments which replaced her YTC shares.  That, in my judgment, is a fair concession.  There is no evidential basis on which the court can reliably assess or measure the impact of H’s management of those funds in terms of income generation.  It seems to me that what H relies on in this context is the benefit which his scheme produced for W in terms of unlocking the full capital value in the shares. </p>

In terms of passive growth alone, he points to the <span style="font-style:italic">Jones </span>approach as entirely principled and well-recognised as a means to determine what value inherited assets should be assumed to have as a consequence of the fact they would always have grown in value in line with the time value of money.<span style="font-style:italic">  </span>This, he submits, is especially so in this case where the underlying value of these assets has been preserved intact in the absence of material capital distributions.  He has produced tables which show that a value of £2 million invested in the FTSE 250 in the year of the marriage would have increased to somewhere in the region of £25.2 million.  A similar exercise in relation to the £1.9 million inherited in 1990 on her father’s death would produce a value today of £13.9 million.  In other words, a fair assumption for overall value if one were to rely on passive growth alone would suggest that the value of her separate nonmatrimonial property might have increased to just under £40 million.  It is clear from the face of the asset schedule that the underlying assets deriving from her non-matrimonial property are worth nothing like that sum.  Whilst one could deliberate as to what difference it might have made had W been extracting and spending net income as opposed to gross income on an annual basis, this calculation would not have produced the sort of figures for passive growth which underpin the hypothetical exercise performed by Mr Bishop QC. That exercise in any event assumes that all the income generated on the funds has been taken out annually without any allowance for capital accretion by way of rolled-up income receipts. </p>

I recognise that the extraction of the shares and the loss of the discount to underlying value produced an immediate uplift in the paper value of the funds.  This does not, in my judgment, amount to a conversion of these funds from non-matrimonial to matrimonial property.  This is not in any way to diminish H’s contribution as the steward over many years of W’s separate wealth.  Whilst I accept that he went into ‘battle’ with other family members on her account so as to extract her from the disadvantages of the discounted valuation straightjacket of the internal family ‘market’ for the YTC shares, I cannot on the evidence available conduct a reliable trace which produces significant uplift into the present value of W’s non-matrimonial funds on that basis alone. </p>

Following her father’s death in 1990, some five years into the marriage, there was a difference of opinion between family members as to the value of the main property.  W told me that there were many family discussions at the time but I accept that H took the lead in identifying and instructing the valuers and selling agents.  A solution was reached whereby it was agreed that W and her sister would take their share of the value of the estate in the form of shares in Y whilst her other sister and stepmother would acquire sole ownership of the estate.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.53in">I regard it as essential that a clean break is achieved between these parties and a solution to this litigation which sees them locked in what could be contentious satellite litigation is an outcome I would wish to avoid.  Furthermore, as I shall explain, I intend to achieve for each of them an outcome which is fair given all the circumstances of this case.  I recognise the efforts which H made in order to look after the financial interests of his wife in the context of the wider family disputes which I have identified.  In acknowledging those contributions, I take the view that he was acting as any loving husband and committed partner would do.  He was aware that W needed him to support and advise her in respect to these matters.  He stepped willingly into that role and she was fortunate in having a partner who brought to the many years of this long marriage the financial acumen and skill sets which he needed to perform that role. The court has frequently stressed in this context that it is a futile exercise to ‘rummage through the attic’ in order to identify which party’s contributions were more valuable than the other’s.  That is the whole basis of the non-discriminatory approach of the Family Courts to sharing.  For these purposes I accept that each made an equal and significant contribution to their marriage but I reject the notion that particular aspects of H’s contribution has somehow operated to ‘matrimonialise’ what remains essentially W’s separate property.  Thus, unless it can be said to be required to address any element of H’s future ‘needs’ claim, I do not regard it as either necessary or appropriate to award him a share of the non-matrimonial property reflected in W’s potential share of the option. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.53in">In the light of what I have said above, the matrimonial assets can be summarised as they appear below.  For these purposes I have discounted the full value of the balance of H’s inheritance from his stepfather by the sum of the gifts which he made from matrimonial funds.  W does not seek to run an argument that the significant sums paid out to the two children and to his brothers should be reattributed to the balance sheet.  She does submit, with some justification in my judgment, that his unilateral decision to deploy joint matrimonial funds in this way without any prior consultation with her was inappropriate.  In relation to the decision to advance $6 million to the girls, I agree with Mr Bishop QC that this was a parental decision as well as a financial decision.  They were, as I have explained, already wealthy young women in their own right.  I understand H’s wish to utilise what he regarded as a last ‘mega-dividend’ from the trust structure before the tax loophole was closed for the wider benefit of the family members and for the children in particular.  W might well have agreed, although she was not given that opportunity.  These were plainly matrimonial funds which came out of the A Trust, a wholly nuptial settlement.  In similar terms, I do not criticise H for taking a wholly understandable stance in relation to ensuring that his brothers were not disadvantaged by the testamentary intentions of his late step-father.  It was an entirely honourable course which he took.  But he took it without any attempt to explain to W what he was proposing to do.  I recognised the very real anguish he felt at the end of his oral evidence when he attempted to communicate to me the full extent of the difficulties he had in communicating with W about matters of a financial nature.  I accept that he had long since abandoned any attempt to involve her in discussions about money. However, she was fully invested in her role as the girls’ mother and she was entitled to be consulted in that capacity.  In the same way, the disposition to his brothers using matrimonial funds was clearly affordable given the wealth which the family then held but it brought no corresponding benefit for W.  That said, these inherited funds are plainly non-matrimonial in terms of their provenance.  They fell in towards the end of this long marriage.  It seems to me that I would be discriminating against H in an unjustifiable way were I to include the balance of these funds as matrimonial assets in which W was entitled to share without making that adjustment. </p>

Mr Bishop QC accepts that I cannot be required in the current circumstances to make any finding as to whether or not the funds held within the S Trust were resources which would have been attributed to H prior to their alienation. I need say no more about the ownership of these assets because W has conceded that they are not assets which are captured as specific ‘resources’ which are available to H for the purposes of the s 25 exercise in hand.  </p>

Leaving aside his chattels and art, having paid that lump sum, he will be left with cash/investments of just less than £8 million including the residual value can be extracted from the A Trust and the two SPVs (c£2.28 million) and his inherited non-matrimonial property (the £1.7 million which I have determined to be non-matrimonial).  If I deduct his inherited funds from that figure, it reduces to c.£6.28.  Whilst I appreciate that there may be arguments that he will be in a position to liquidate some of his art through a sale to the trustee or an arm’s length third party purchaser, his position in terms of his future financial security and likely standard of living over the coming years of his retirement stands in sharp contrast to W’s.  In the absence of pension funds from this case, he is likely to be dependent upon what he retains after these proceedings (matrimonial and non-matrimonial) to fund his living costs into retirement.  W’s trust income will not be sufficient to meet her income needs in full and I accept that she will need to supplement that income from her own capital resources.  H will be entirely dependent on the resources he retains at the end of these proceedings together with whatever he is able to earn over the next few years. </p>

Of course human nature dictates that these children are not going to see <span style="font-style:italic">either</span> of their parents in a position of real financial difficulty when they are themselves the beneficiaries of trusts funded by their parents worth many millions.  But that, without more, does not make the underlying trust funds a <span style="font-style:italic">Thomas</span> resource nor does it provide any legal basis for some form of ‘back door’ entry which entitles me to conclude that H will benefit from those funds in the future.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.53in;text-indent:0.00in">put at £435,000 per annum.  Those figures have to be seen against the background of what appears to be a common acceptance that it was costing in the region of £1 million per annum to run their lifestyle between London and the country.  W’s current budget would be difficult to justify on any basis unless that was a more or less accurate figure.  Because economies of sorts are likely to have to be made (although ‘economies’ is probably not the right word in a case where the asset base is in excess of £50 million), it is reasonably safe to assume that both (future) budgets are likely to be inaccurate to a degree.  Mr Bishop QC points to the fact that H currently has a gross annual salary of £253,000 for a directorship.  He asks me to consider his needs on the basis that he will be “a single man of 65 in one home”.  He suggests that he may be in a position to draw income from his management of one of the equity funds owned by the S Trust.  In my judgment neither is likely to provide an income stream in the foreseeable future given the scale of the past losses.  Mr Bishop seeks to meet H’s future income needs from the foot of a <span style="font-style:italic">Duxbury </span>calculation which assumes that H’s director’s salary will remain available to him throughout the remainder of his actuarial life expectancy.  That is plainly a flawed approach.  If that income were to cease in the next two or three years, as it well might, H may be dependent upon his remaining capital to meet all his future needs.  Whilst capitalised maintenance calculations will vary depending upon the underlying assumptions which are made, a simple amortised calculation reveals that H would need in excess of £5.3 million to fund an income for life of £350,000.  Even Mr Bishop does not seek to suggest that is an overgenerous allowance as a base line and, realistically, how could he in the circumstances of this case ?  An income requirement of £500,000 per annum for life would require a capital fund of just under £7.8 million. </p>

Each has made a very significant contribution to this marriage over the course of more than three decades.  No one in this case pleads a ‘special contribution’.  I agree that the term, as it is recognised in the field of financial remedy claims, has no application in this case. Notwithstanding that I have not been able to find that H augmented W’s separate resources to the extent of over £8 million as he has suggested, there is no doubt in my mind that his contributions, as hers, have been of a magnitude and value which require reflection in outcome.  In this context I can see no possible basis in this case which would justify either being left in a position where their reasonable needs going forward, informed to the extent possible by the standard of living they enjoyed over a very long marriage, were not met in full.  There are sufficient resources in this case to ensure that outcome. </p>

If W believes that she requires a budget of over £780,000 per annum to meet her ongoing needs, it is difficult to see why H should not be entitled to the security of wealth which will enable him to spend at least £500,000 per annum (i.e. 50% of their previous joint expenses). </p>

It was plainly funded almost entirely with matrimonial assets. The parties enjoyed considerable benefits from that source through the tripartite structure set up during the marriage.  Does what Mr Bishop QC has referred to as “the loss of an opportunity to seek a share of $50 million of matrimonial money” come into play in this final distribution stage as part of “all the circumstances of the case” ?  Whilst I have found that these arrangements were put in place in 1999 for entirely legitimate reasons (albeit unknown to W until 2003), the trust which was designed to promote capital growth and trust efficiency for the wider family’s benefit now stands between W and what might have been a significantly greater award in these proceedings.  H’s actions were not, in my judgment, ‘conduct’ for the purposes of s. 25(2)(g) of the 1973 Act and, to be fair to Mr Bishop QC, he does not seek to say that they were.   </p>

That disparity has arisen in part because of the financial landscape which the alienation of the funds in the S Trust has produced.  Each of H and W will be free to deploy their assets as they see fit.  In my judgment each will have sufficient capital to decide in future whether second homes are an appropriate use of those resources.

He would clearly need to pay a commercial rent for any use which he made of that property and the trustee/protector would need to be persuaded that it was a sound investment.  There is sufficient flexibility in the notional budget which I have factored into a calculation of his ongoing needs to allow for this expense and, in addition, for so long as he is in remunerative employment of one sort or another, he will have additional income which could be used to cover all or part of this cost.  I am persuaded that each of these parties will retain a degree of flexibility in terms of the manner in which they reorganise their lives going forward.  Mr Bishop QC accepts that W cannot be said to <span style="font-style:italic">need</span> a second property when she has nearly £13.5 million tied up in her principal home.
