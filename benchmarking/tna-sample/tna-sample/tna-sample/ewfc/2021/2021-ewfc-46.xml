It is unconscionable that it has taken the best part of 2 years, the whole of this young girl’s life, to bring this matter to court for a final decision as to her future. </p>

In 2011, she was admitted to NN Hospital with symptoms of vomiting and dizziness. Testing established an issue around cortisol levels and suspected adrenal insufficiency. According to M, she was told that she was suffering from Addison’s disease, and believed that she was formally diagnosed with Addison’s. She cannot recall exactly who told her so, although she was being treated at the time by Dr G and Dr H. As a result, she was prescribed with medication and trained in injection of hydrocortisone. She was told to look out for signs of Addison’s crisis including light-headedness, dizziness, fatigue, reduced consciousness, headaches, and nausea (which I shall refer to hereafter as “Addisonian symptoms”). Thereafter, M told A&amp;E, treating clinicians and GPs that she had been diagnosed with Addison’s, and she received treatment accordingly. Medical records show multiple crises and admissions to hospital at which M complained of Addisonian symptoms.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">It is clear from the extensive medical records that treating clinicians (whether specialists in the field or not) told M repeatedly that she had Addison’s. I was told by Dr I (a SJE consultant endocrinologist) that the term “Addison’s” appears to have been used as shorthand for adrenal insufficiency.  Dr I told me that in fact there was never a formal Addison’s diagnosis and described the references in the records to Addison’s as a process by which a word or phrase from the early days came to be misinterpreted to provide what appeared to be an accepted diagnosis. I am satisfied that from about 2011 to early 2021, M authentically believed that she had Addison’s.  She was told as much by clinicians. Her medical records suggested she had Addison’s, or at the very least indicated partial adrenal insufficiency, which was loosely, and inaccurately, described as Addison’s; inaccurately because Addison’s is a condition where the adrenal glands are damaged and unable to produce the necessary cortisol, whereas adrenal insufficiency more commonly involves under-stimulation of the adrenal glands.   </p>

Over a number of years, she had been wrongly told by treating clinicians that she had Addison’s. It was, so Dr I told me, reasonable for her to have accepted what she was told, and I am satisfied that she genuinely believed she had this condition. One of the consequences of this development is that it is now clear M presented with Addisonian symptoms over many years, including during multiple crisis admissions to A&amp;E, when she in fact did not have Addison’s, or any adrenal insufficiency, and there was no other organic explanation for such symptoms. I will need to consider this aspect of the case in more detail.  </p>

The hearing proceeded relatively smoothly, with occasional frustrating technical hitches; I am very grateful to the almost herculean efforts of the staff at the local Family Court who managed, and resolved, all technical issues. The bundles totalled about 15,000 pages, which included voluminous medical records.  Counsel were of invaluable assistance and no stone was left unturned. Helpfully, they prepared an agreed Note on the law, which is well-established and uncontroversial, and which I have largely replicated in this judgment. </p>

Although neither A nor B is a subject of these proceedings, the information was of potential relevance given that it was understood A intends shortly to move in and live with M, although M in her evidence said that A was in two minds about this.  That in turn raised concerns on the part of the LA about the consequences for X were she to be returned to the care of M, and possibly find herself in the same household as an alleged abuser from her own family. Given that the incident purportedly took place while both older children were living with M, it also raised question marks about M’s ability to protect X. At the IRH, there was no documentation in relation to the allegation and I made directions for further disclosure including against the police.  The possibility of having to adjourn the trial was mentioned, in order to allow for a proper investigation of the allegation.   </p>

The LA expressly disavows any reliance upon this matter, seeking no findings, nor inviting me to take it into account.

M obtained a non-molestation order against X in November 2018, although the allegations made in those proceedings were disputed in court and never made the subject of findings; the order appears to have been made consensually after an initial without notice hearing.

The first social work statement dated 21 May 2019 (2 days after birth) said “M has some significant health issues including Addison’s disease” and that “she accepts the majority of the concerns that were raised regarding her parenting by children’s services”. M seemed reflective, acknowledging past mistakes, and believed that her young age when having children had been a negative factor, as had been the abusive relationship with her husband. 5 years had passed. She had separated from F, her home conditions were well maintained, and she felt able to cope. This improving picture set the tone for a number of months. </p>

This process started during pregnancy. She showed signs of progress. I consider that was partly because of having exited a string of abusive relationships, partly because of the sheer joy of having a new baby and partly because of a real desire to try and find a way to keep her baby.  In addition, she obtained a job at a pub which clearly increased her sense of worth and self-esteem. There is no doubt in my mind that M’s intentions were genuine. Upon birth, the hospital praised her care of X. She underwent therapy and completed parenting and domestic violence programmes.  I note that on 23 October 2019 a hair strand test showed no excessive levels of alcohol between April 2019 and October 2019.  She was far more open with social services and other professionals. I was told by the Health Visitor, Ms U, that both before and after birth M was positive about the birth, eager to learn, and engaged with X’s needs. Ms U observed M with X in a supervised context on 9 occasions between birth and March 2020 and found the interaction to be good.  In February 2020, a referral was made to Ms V, an Early Years Practitioner, particularly in respect of feeding. She told me that M engaged with her and was eager to learn, albeit such learning had to take place online because of the pandemic. The then social worker, Ms W, praised M’s attitude, willingness to cooperate, receptiveness to advice and generally open demeanour.  The current social worker, Ms Y, spoke in similar terms. It was clear to me that the LA formed a more favourable impression of M during the year than perhaps anybody had expected, although it has to be recalled that all M’s undoubtedly warm and loving interaction with X took place with a high degree of support and assistance.

Sadly the aunt’s husband suffered a stroke and they were no longer able to care for X. As a result, she moved into foster care in July 2019 and has remained with the same foster carer ever since. She is unquestionably happy and settled, and her principal secure attachment is with the foster carer. As another example of M’s changed approach, she established a good relationship with the foster carer. </p>

That reduced in duration to 2-hour sessions (still supervised) after the move into foster care, a function of resources rather than any particular concern about M’s behaviour. As a result of the onset of the Covid pandemic, and consequent lockdowns and tier restrictions, it altered to remote contact only from March 2020 to July 2020, during which time M was able to connect only by mobile phone; it seems to me that, for reasons beyond anyone’s control, this must have been unsatisfactory and greatly dispiriting for M, as well as stressful. In July 2020, restrictions were eased sufficiently to permit supervised face to face contact once more, albeit for short periods of time (about 1 ½ hours) and only once per week. I have great sympathy for M, whose contact is now a pale imitation of how it started through no fault of her own. Notwithstanding all these challenges, M has been fully committed to contact throughout, never missing a session. </p>

The aspect to which I will return is the need, commented on by the LA’s witnesses, for M to be advised repeatedly about basic care elements such as feeding, playing, and sleeping.  M, I was told, was receptive to advice and wanted to engage with it, but she was unable to implement it, or to appreciate X’s cues, and as a result she would have to be prompted time and time again with the same advice. Ms K told me that M would have genuinely wanted to act on the advice, but her deep-rooted anxiety disorder “gets in the way”.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">Accordingly, the LA considered that M and X should be placed for 6 weeks in a mother and baby unit. That contemplated residential assessment was opposed by the then Guardian, given the strong findings made in the previous set of proceedings. The Guardian considered the proposal to be premature and over optimistic, and that updated expert evidence from Ms K, who had reported in the first set of proceedings, should be sought. It also seems that not all the previous papers were available. At a case management hearing on 30 September 2019, the court agreed, noting the complexities of the case. The Recorder refused to sanction a plan involving a residential assessment at that stage, and approved the Guardian’s Part 25 application.  As time passed, and the scope of expert evidence (initially positive about a residential unit) broadened, the recommendation of the LA for a residential assessment was put on ice, until unfolding events in 2020 meant that it was abandoned altogether. M herself did not make a s38(6) application after the September 2019 hearing, and no such residential assessment has ever taken place.  On M’s behalf it is said that there was a missed opportunity at the end of 2019, a window within which round the clock supervision and assessment might have provided the necessary level of observation and support enabling the court to identify needs and contemplate a bespoke rehabilitation plan. I understand M’s frustration, but I am not at all surprised by the Recorder’s decision given the very high level of poor, even cruel, conduct perpetrated by M as found by HHJ Richardson QC previously; an assessment of the sort contemplated needed the firm foundations of expert evidence. As it happens, and with hindsight, a residential assessment would have proceeded on a false basis, namely that M had Addison’s, and would therefore not have explored all the issues which have been canvassed before me arising out of the nondiagnosis and consequential impact on an analysis of her mental health.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">It is, at this point, right to record from M’s perspective how initial optimism gradually declined.  She had done much right, working meaningfully to re-establish her parenting abilities with X.  But events thwarted her.  The initial placement of X with her sister changed, through force of circumstances, to foster care. Contact reduced.  The LA’s plan for a residential assessment was rejected by the court. Further expert evidence was commissioned.  The onset of the pandemic brought a total cessation of face-to-face contact which impacted M’s ability to nurture her bonds with X, and her attempts to prove her parenting skills. Work with professionals did not cease but was conducted largely remotely which no doubt diminished its scope and effectiveness. M herself was required to shield. As I will refer to below, her contact with her older daughter, B, was suspended, again for reasons outside her control. I consider that these misfortunes, not of her doing, will undoubtedly have generated great anxiety and uncertainty in her, and it seems to me that they must have contributed to the re-emergence of M’s previous chaotic behavioural patterns from early 2020 onwards. </p>

Even by the time of my first involvement in the case, one week before the final hearing, it was touch and go whether it would be ready for trial.  Fortunately, and in no small part due to the considerable efforts of all counsel in the case, the case was ready to, and did, proceed.  </p>

On or about 16 November 2019, M posted on B’s Facebook page a message (which she swiftly removed) that she (M) was not in a good place and nobody cared for her, which must have been deeply upsetting for B. From 18 November 2019, it was intended that B should receive therapeutic trauma intervention from Barnardo’s. The view of Barnardo’s, supported by social services, was that contact between M and B should cease so as to allow therapy the best possible chance of success. I heard from B’s social worker, Ms Z, and, although the chronology was a little confused, it became clear that on a number of occasions between late 2019 and June 2020 (but not thereafter), and contrary to express advice from social services, M regularly contacted B directly or via her father, MGF. I acknowledge (i) that for M suspension of contact with B was distressing and (ii) since June 2020 she has not contacted B, but by ignoring social work advice she did not act in an appropriately child centred way, particularly given the gravity of the findings made in 2013/2014.  </p>

That is objectively verifiable from the blood tests in the medical records.

Poor adherence to thyroxin might lead to gradual, chronic symptoms including weight change, loss of body hair and skin coarsening but would not trigger a crisis such as those apparently experienced by M and which is consistent with Addison’s. He told me that since M became pregnant in 2018, she has complied with her thyroxin tablet taking requirements.

Of particular note, I felt, was her description of how M would be advised about aspects of basis care (feeding, putting X down to sleep, playing with her), welcome that advice and yet be unable to implement it regularly.  Nobody suggests she ignored the advice.  It had to be given to her on repeated occasions because she was simply unable to absorb and act on it.  Repeated advice was given by way of prompts on the same issues. This particular aspect struck me as a very concrete example of how M’s behavioural patterns affect her.  </p>

M, to her credit, has developed a good relationship with the foster carer. The problems started in 2020 with the incidents which I have outlined above. Previous patterns came to the fore once again. During the course of the year, the view of the LA evolved until, by September 2020, adoption was thought to be the preferred option.

Her reservations were that she felt M was not particularly proactive, and required repeated parenting prompts from supervising staff; this echoed what I had been told by others. She said that M was repeatedly given advice, including at regular meetings, and by the foster carer and contact supervisors, but was unable to do so.  The repetitious nature of advice, despite all the support, has continued throughout and M has been unable to put it into practice spontaneously. She told me that notwithstanding the LA’s adoption plan, M maintains a good working relationship with social services.

There may have been differences of opinion, and occasionally tricky judgment calls surrounding implementation of contact, but I am quite satisfied that Ms Y did her very best to be balanced.

I have to say that she created a better impression on me that she did on HHJ Richardson QC in 2013/2014.  That is, I believe, because she is in a better place, or at any rate a less bad place, than she was then.  She was composed, articulate and polite.  She acknowledged much that was put to her about the chaotic events of 2014-2018. I did not get the sense that she was telling me manifest untruths.  All that said, I came to the clear view that at times, although not being dishonest, her perception of events was rather different than that portrayed by the evidence; she has persuaded herself of a more positive narrative than the evidence justifies. At times she said “I don’t remember” (commented on by HHJ Richardson QC in the previous proceedings) when, I suspect, questions were too difficult to answer.  She was very over optimistic about her ability to parent X and leave behind her mental health issues. I felt also that to an extent she had expunged, or put out of her mind, or minimised some of the terrible events in her life which have led her to where she is now.  I do not think she did so deliberately, or as a façade, but more as a protective measure for herself.  The reality, it seems to me, must be for her very hard to bear.  </p>

She fell back on “I don’t remember” on occasion. She said that she accepted the findings of the previous hearings, that she had been guilty of FII and neglect, that she did not put the children’s needs first and that she had caused them long-term harm.  But I am confident that, although her sentiments were at one level genuine, her insight into the consequences of her behaviour was skin deep. Under cross examination by leading counsel for the Guardian, she told me that her memory was poor and she could remember very little before 2017.  She was unable to explain why she behaved the way she did (including causing harm directly and indirectly to her children) beyond saying that she was not in a good place.  She could not really articulate the effect upon her children of her own actions.  She was unable to say whether A has struggled as a result of her own neglect, simply saying that they get on well now. Her communications with B, in particular posting on B’s Facebook page in November 2019 a message that she (i.e M) was not in a good place and nobody cared for her, clearly demonstrate to my mind that she does not truly appreciate the impact of her actions on B.  Her acknowledgment of past mistakes was more in form than in substance; a true acceptance that findings were made against her, but a continuing difficultly in accepting how and why those findings have impacted on her children. It is also of note that she has not told members of her support network the full, unvarnished truth about the circumstances of the removal of her older children. </p>

It seemed to me that much of what was put to M about these events emanated from B who did not give evidence and, as a troubled young woman, may not be entirely reliable.  That said, it was clear from M’s evidence that she did contact B on a number of occasions, including occasionally via her father.  Even if she did not seek to discourage her from the therapy, as was suggested to her, the very fact of engaging with B must have been confusing and disruptive and, in my judgment, was inappropriate behaviour on her part given that she was under no illusion about the need to cease contact. The most obviously inappropriate action was to share with B screenshots of abusive messages which she had received from A and his then girlfriend. </p>

Thus, she went to live with Mr R for a while after the original proceedings during which they had separated. She alleged rape against Mr P in July 2017 yet continued to stay in touch with him and was the victim of a vicious assault by him in August 2017. X was, she told me, violent, aggressive, and controlling, yet even after obtaining a nonmolestation order she continued to stay in contact with him and she had to accept that she initially concealed subsequent meetings with him (including him attending the prebirth scan) from social services.

Sometimes the linkage will be obvious, as where the facts proved establish physical harm. But the linkage may be very much less obvious where the allegation is only that the child is at risk of suffering emotional harm or, as in the present case, at risk of suffering neglect. In the present case, as we shall see, an important element of the local authority's case was that the father 'lacks honesty with professionals', 'minimises matters of importance' and 'is immature and lacks insight of issues of importance'. Maybe. But how does this feed through into a conclusion that A is at risk of neglect? The conclusion does not follow naturally from the premise. The local authority's evidence and submissions must set out the argument and explain explicitly why it is said that, in the particular case, the conclusion indeed follows from the facts. Here, as we shall see, the local authority conspicuously failed to do so. </span>

The research demonstrates that this inter-generational impact is a very real possibility. The consequences would be deeply damaging and harmful. One potential cause of such stress (among many others) would be X returning to her care. In other words, and sadly, the very act of rehabilitation of X with M would likely trigger highly negative responses of FII in M’s treatment of X, and FD in herself. </p>

That was during a time when M showed definite signs of improvement. She had undertaken therapy and domestic abuse programmes. She was single and not in an abusive relationship. She had started a job. She was generally cooperative with the LA, although her conduct in this respect was not faultless as demonstrated by her failure to abide by advice not to contact B.  However, and despite the therapy, education, counselling, and very high level of support, from March 2020 she lapsed back into a pattern of presenting with Addisonian symptoms, as well as high levels of emotional and mental health instability, including suicidal ideation and dependency on medication.  In short, she had not made sufficient progress to be protected from the re-emergence of her multiple issues. I find it to be likely that such episodes will be regularly repeated in one form or another, and carry a high risk of exposing X to physical and emotional harm.  </p>

It is, as Ms K explained, a function of M’s ingrained anxiety disorders. This aspect postdates the relevant time for establishing threshold, namely the institution of care proceedings, but in my judgment, it is informative of M’s deep-seated psychological disorders which disable her from meeting the needs of her children appropriately or adequately and which have been present for many years.

On 7 October 2015, 4 November 2015, and 9 May 2018 the records show M struggling to accept why the older children were removed from her care. Her failure to appreciate the consequences of her interaction with B in late 2019/early 2020, and her lack of understanding about the impact on A of her past actions, are further indications of lack of insight, which in turn is a risk to X. </p>

The very fact that M relapsed or, to put it another way, her harmful behavioural patterns re-emerged, demonstrates why X is incapable of being protected by M.  With all the assistance and support of various services from 2014 onwards, M has sadly been unable to demonstrate lasting and permanent capacity for change such as to enable her to care for X both physically and emotionally.  </p>

I accept the evidence of Ms Y that he and the wider family generally were kept in mind throughout as part of an “ongoing conversation”. He attended family network and care planning meetings. He has known of the plan for adoption since at least October 2020. MGF has never formally put himself forward as a potential carer.  He emerged late in the day as a result of a conversation between himself and M in February (which M passed on to Ms Y) in which he indicated a wish to be considered as a carer for X. The LA rightly carried out a stage 1 viability assessment which was completed on 8 March 2021, followed by a stage 2 assessment dated 19 March 2021. For some reason MGF was not made aware by the LA of the negative outcome until during the first week of the hearing and did not receive a hard copy of the assessment until 23 April.  I was told that he disagreed with the conclusion. I invited him to come to court on 27 April to explain his position. He was initially content to participate, including by giving evidence, that same day, but I suggested he should return to court remotely on 29 April so as to have time to prepare and, if he so wished, to secure legal advice.  </p>

He told me that hadn’t read any of the documents in these proceedings.  He had read the judgments from the previous proceedings, but it was clear that he did not accept the conclusion that M had deliberately caused harm to D and B by interfering with their medical care and treatment.  He told me that he thought such issues were misunderstood. He also seemed to me to have a jaundiced view of the Local Authority, an outlook which he shares with other family members.  He said that they all regard M as having been vilified and victimised by the LA. In particular, he felt that Ms Y had been biased and inaccurate.  His belief is that M is an experienced and accomplished mother, and that she does not pose any risk to X.  In answer to questions from me, he felt sure that he would be able to prevent M from seeing X if that was required. After he gave his evidence, the following day he asked to attend remotely again for a short time to sum up his position which I readily agreed to.  </p>

He clearly wants the best for M and X.  However, in my view he minimised to a very significant degree the damning findings against M from the previous proceedings and is over optimistic about M’s progress since then.  He has not seen, and is therefore not aware of, the welter of documents in these proceedings, particularly the expert reports. He cannot, and does not, have a full insight into M’s ongoing issues, and X’s needs.  He was ruled out as being a carer of the older children and age (he is 67) is now somewhat against him.  I also felt that, although he is a robust and strong personality, he would have great difficulty in protecting X from M if that is what is required.  M is herself a strong personality. He does not think she poses a risk, and I judge that the pressure to allow M into X’s life, were she accommodated with him, would be hard to resist.   </p>

In doing so I make clear that this latter comment is not to seek to undermine the fundamental principle expressed in the judgment, merely to redress the difficulty created by the isolation and oft subsequently suggested interpretation of the words “nothing else will do” to the exclusion of any “overriding” welfare considerations in the particular child’s case. </span>

It would be intellectually dishonest not to acknowledge the benefits. But this is not to say that finding one or more benefits trumps all and means that it cannot be said that “nothing else will do”. All will depend upon the judge’s assessment of the whole picture determined by the particular characteristics and needs of the child in question no doubt often informed by the harm which s/he has suffered or been exposed to. </span>

It must undertake a welfare analysis of each of the realistic options for the child having regard among any other relevant issues to the matters set out in section 1(4) of the 2002 Act (the 'welfare checklist'). That involves looking at a balance sheet of benefits and detriments in relation to each option. It must then compare the analysis of each option against the others. It must decide whether an option and if so which option safeguards the child's welfare throughout her life: that is the court's welfare evaluation or value judgment that is mandated by section 1(2) of the Act. It will usually be a choice between one or more long term placement options. That decision then feeds into the statutory test in sections 21(3)(b) and 52 of the 2002 Act, namely whether in the context of what is in the best interests of the child throughout his life the consent of the parent or guardian should be dispensed with. The statutory test as set out above has to be based in the court's welfare analysis which leads to its value judgment. In considering whether the welfare of the child requires consent to be dispensed with, the court must look at its welfare evaluation and ask itself the question whether that is a proportionate interference in the family life of the child. That is the proportionality evaluation that is an inherent component of the domestic statutory test and a requirement of Strasbourg jurisprudence.  </span>

Many of the issues and patterns of behaviour demonstrated in the earlier proceedings, and which continued unabated until 2018, have re-emerged in 2020 and led to repeated crises. They are very ingrained. She continues to experience deep-rooted psychological issues which prevent her from functioning to a level which would enable her to care for her child. Her PTSD, characterised by recurring nightmares and flashbacks, is ongoing. She continues to lack insight into past events, and her own behaviour which led to the removal of her older children. Her SSD and FD, coupled with past FII in respect of her older children, present a clear and present risk of FII by M to X if rehabilitated to M.  M is unable to provide basic care without very considerable support and prompting, despite extensive oversight and support. A return to M’s embedded behavioural patterns would be unthinkable for X and, sadly, that is what has happened over the past year.  Medical crises, abusive relationships, impulsive overdoses, chaotic adherence to medication, FII/SSD/FD, drinking and criminality are never far from the surface. M has shown herself unable to find appropriate coping mechanisms to address stress and anxiety and I have no confidence that she will be able to do so in the future.  Nor, given the history, do I consider that M would be open, transparent, and honest with professionals about such recurring events; she has consistently shown, when under stress, a capacity to minimise and conceal which in turn would jeopardise X’s safety. Absent such meaningful change, X would be placed in an intolerable situation, at risk of grave physical and emotional harm. M would quite simply be overwhelmed. Indeed, a return of X to M would by itself operate as a significant additional stressor in M’s life and thereby increase the risks to X. In short, the better presentation in 2019 is not nearly sufficient by itself to offset all the maladaptive behaviour present in M for most of her life until 2018, and repeated throughout 2020.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">The timetable required for M to overcome her deeply-rooted issues is, in my judgment, more likely to be a minimum of 3 years (as suggested by Professor  J ) rather than 1 year (as suggested by Ms  K ); the fact that M’s patterns re-emerged notwithstanding a considerable degree of prior therapeutic intervention in my judgment tends towards the more conservative timescale. The scale of such a task would be enormous, requiring bespoke and intensive one to one therapy. In my judgment, based on the evidence of Professor J and Ms K, it is likely that the outcome would be unsuccessful. I have concluded that M is unable to meet X’s physical and emotional needs, and were X to be returned to her care she would be at risk of significant harm.X is 22 months old and urgently needs resolution, clarity, and a settled future. M, sadly, cannot offer the strong, consistent, and protective parenting which she requires.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">Nor do I consider that M’s support network is sufficiently robust to assist M in ensuring X’s safety and wellbeing. None of the identified persons has any real insight into the enormity of M’s difficulties and the reasons for the removal of her older children, in part because M has not been fully transparent about these matters. The family do not have any particular concerns about M, and do not see her as presenting a risk to X; the likelihood is that they would give way to M’s own wishes. Some have issues of their own (M’s mother’s health, her sister’s husband’s health for example). M’s father lives too far away. M does not get on well with her sister. M’s mother was found to have colluded with M in the earlier proceedings. The family have a very negative view of the professionals, with whom they would have to work. It is unrealistic to place upon her friends and family the very considerable burden of protecting X. It also seems to me that the support network is broadly the same as that which she relied upon in 2013/2014, and has turned to since then, without any obvious success in terms of M’s own mental health, shielding her from abusive partners, and protecting the children.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">I have carefully considered the suggestion that M and X should undergo a residential assessment for a period of time, although no such placement is currently available. A residential unit, it is submitted, would operate round the clock supervision and support.  Therapy could also be part of the programme. Such an approach would afford the opportunity of observing M’s ability to parent X, and provide her with the intense support which she so obviously needs.  Essentially, what is suggested is a reprise of the proposal in late 2019. Although I can see the attraction of trying to find a way by which the return of X to her mother’s care can be explored, in my judgment there is no real prospect of such a placement being successful.  Given M’s deep-rooted abnormal behaviour patterns, it is likely to break down.  Even if it does not formally break down, the prospect of it leading seamlessly to a phased return of X to M seems to me to be very remote. It would be highly disruptive for X, and probably very distressing. M has not had sole care of X at any time since birth and this would be an untested step. Too much uncertainty would lie ahead. Time is not on the side of M or, particularly, X. X’s needs are pressing, and an assessment of this sort, with little prospect of success, would delay yet further a resolution to her future.  The expert evidence was clear that it would be highly unlikely to achieve sufficient progress to enable the court to contemplate returning X to her mother.  M’s mental health issues will require prolonged, and successful progress, far beyond the timescale of a residential assessment. Ms K and Professor J were firmly against a residential assessment, as was the Guardian, and I agree.  </p>

The risks to X are too great. She would not enjoy the stable, coherent, and nurturing environment that she so urgently requires.  She would, instead, be exposed to an ingrained chaotic lifestyle, inconsistent parenting, inability on M’s part to protect her and risk of exposure to factitious disorder behaviour. </p>

The LA has considered potential family and friends as carers throughout the proceedings, but none are suitable. The family have been aware in general terms of the progress of the case and there has been plenty of opportunity for possible carers to make themselves available for assessment. M put forward only two options; her sister, who ruled herself out because of her husband’s health, and a friend who did not want to be considered. Only M’s father has put himself forward, albeit late in the day, and the viability assessment is negative. I have ruled against a further assessment.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">The preferred course advocated by the LA and the Guardian is adoption; to take such a profound step should only be sanctioned where nothing else will do and it is the best outcome based upon a welfare evaluation of all the circumstances. The obvious disadvantage would be the severing of all ties with M and the biological family, including her half siblings. As against that, it would provide X with certainty, security, and long-term stability in circumstances where a return to M is not realistic or safe. X should be able to achieve a sense of permanence, emotionally and psychologically as well as physically, within an adoptive setting. The Guardian told me that there would be little difficulty in identifying appropriate prospective adoptive parents within a fairly short timeframe, and X would be able to form a secure relationship with them. Further delay in securing a placement would be contrary to her interests. X needs to be able to develop her secure attachments with her long term carer as soon as possible, and in my judgment that can best be achieved within an adoptive setting. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">Long term foster care was not advocated by any of the parties, not least because of X’s age. It seems to me that it would not give this child the sense of permanence which is, in my judgment, essential for her wellbeing. She has an immediate need for long term security and stability which long term fostering would not sufficiently provide.  M would be able to apply in the future to discharge a care order, which seems to me to be replete with risk and uncertainty for X, whereas an adoption order would be final. A fostering arrangement would leave open the question of contact, in a way which generally does not apply in an adoptive placement; cessation of contact with M in the event of adoption is not, on the evidence of this case, likely to be distressing or damaging for X. In a fostering context, the Local Authority would continue to have a role in X’s life.  Fostering does not offer the best all round solution for X, particularly given her age. She needs to develop her attachments and sense of identity.  She cries out for a warm, enduring, nurturing attachment with long term permanence and in my view a foster placement would not be the best means of achieving this. </p>

In so doing, I have considered all matters holistically and in the round.  In the end I conclude that placement for adoption is by some distance the preferred, indeed required, outcome for X. Her welfare is my paramount consideration and in my judgment, adoption is in her best interests. It would give her a sense of permanence, allowing her to settle into the adoptive family to which she will fully belong.  Given M’s obvious, and deep-seated difficulties, F’s decision to seek no part in her life, and the lack of a viable alternative family carer, placement within the birth family is sadly not realistic.

Both in written opening, and during oral closing submissions, the LA invited me to make an order for parental responsibility in favour of F so that his consent to a placement order could then be formally dispensed with under s21(3) of the ACA 2002. Without parental responsibility, he does not qualify as a parent for the purposes of giving consent, and therefore no order for dispensing with consent is required. Although presented to me as essentially a procedural step, it would of course require proper consideration within the context of the welfare checklist and is therefore much more than a technicality. As F had not attended during the hearing (other than briefly by counsel at the very start), I invited the parties to contact his legal team and inquire whether he sought an order for parental responsibility.  He confirmed by written submissions through counsel that he does not seek such an order.  Since he makes no application for parental responsibility, has played no part in X’s life, and M through counsel indicated that she would oppose a parental responsibility order being made, I shall make no such order.   </p>

The Guardian considers that there should be one further, farewell, contact session. Her view is that X needs the emotional space to prepare for a move from foster care to identified adoptive parents.  The Guardian has been assiduous throughout in looking at matters from X’s point of view, but on this issue, and by a narrow margin, I conclude that the Local Authority’s proposal for contact to continue until prospective adopters are identified is to be preferred.  It is not clear how long that process will take.  There is no evidence that X is being discomfited or disturbed by contact with M.  On balance, I consider that it should continue as suggested by leading counsel for the LA in closing. </p>

Nobody can condone or excuse her past actions, but the sad reality of this case is that her behaviour has its origins in mental health problems which can be traced back to her own childhood and have gripped her ever since. I have considerable sympathy for her; mental health illness is a curse. Over time, her behaviour has become ever more ingrained. Stressful events lead to crises which in turn set M back and place her under ever greater stress.  It is a vicious circle.  Unless and until she fully banishes her mental health demons, or at least finds a way to cope with them, she will be unable to lead a happy and fulfilled life.  There are glimmers of hope; a degree of progress for a period in 2019, a job, a life currently without an abusive partner. I sincerely hope that she finds it within herself to embark on the hard journey which she needs to undertake with expert mental health treatment.  </p>
