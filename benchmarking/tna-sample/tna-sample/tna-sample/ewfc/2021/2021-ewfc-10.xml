	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">This is the final hearing about two very young children, A (dob: 10/9/18 – now aged 2 years 4 months) and B (dob: 12/1/20 – now aged 1 year) and where they should live in the long-term. Their parents are M (aged 41) and F (aged 48). Neither of the children has ever lived with their parents, and both parents accept that the children cannot live with them. A has lived with foster carers since he was three days old, and B was placed with him soon after she was born.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The issue for the court to decide is whether the children should live in long-term foster care and indefinitely and continue to have contact with M, or whether they should be placed for adoption, with only the hope, rather than the certainty, of having contact with M. Their current foster placement is short-term, and so whatever the court decides, the children will inevitably have to move to a new home.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The local authority plan is for the two children to be placed in an adoptive placement together and it seeks care and placement orders for both children.  On 18 January 2021 the local authority changed the care plans and will now try to find an adoptive family for the children who would be willing to promote contact with M. If this is not possible, then a goodbye contact would be offered to the parents before the children are moved to an adoptive family. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">M initially wanted the children to be returned to her care. However, on 8 January 2021 she filed a further statement confirming a change of position. She wants the best for the children, and although it is very hard for her to say, she has decided that she is not in a position to care for them at the moment. She does not accept she cannot look after them, and says that her needs have not been properly understood or supported by the local authority. Her case is that she has not had a fair opportunity to look after the children with support. She says if things were different she would like to care for them in the future when things get better for her, but for now she needs to move house and would like to get a part-time job so she can still see the children when she is not working. M absolutely does not agree with adoption because she does not think it is right </p>

In terms of contact, M would like to see the children as much as possible, ideally once or twice a week but at the very least once per month, and she thinks the court should allow her to continue seeing the children. She hopes that when the children get older they will be able to go and stay with her, and maybe even live with her.  </p>

Although he does not actively support the children being adopted, he does not challenge the local authority’s plans. F has not attended contact for some considerable time and says he would be too upset to have a final goodbye session with the children. He also accepts he may appear to be a stranger to them. He would like letterbox contact but accepts and asks for help from professionals in managing this. </p>

The local authority subsequently issued care proceedings in respect of some of M’s other children, and in 2013 they were also made subject of final care orders. In 2015 they were made subject of placement orders, and in 2016 they were adopted in a joint placement. In both previous sets of care proceedings M was assessed as lacking capacity to conduct proceedings and she was represented by the Official Solicitor.</p>

Soon afterwards, there followed a number of incidents involving the police being called to the family home by M. On each occasion M reported she had been physically assaulted by F, including on 26 December 2017 when said she had been punched and hurt badly by him. Both parents accept that their relationship was characterised by controlling and domestically abusive behaviour, including shouting and swearing and instances of physical violence. M also now accepts that she lied to the police in denying that there was domestic abuse in the relationship.</p>

By 23 February 2018, when M was just a few weeks pregnant, the couple were reported as no longer being in a relationship. However, by 30 April 2018 they were reconciled and told the local authority that F had now moved into M’s house and was making a claim for carer’s allowance as her carer. But their relationship continued to be volatile and violent; by the time A was born on 10 September 2018 there had been at least eleven reports to the police of domestic abuse incidents.</p>

Once again the Official Solicitor was invited to act as litigation friend for M, and the court directed an assessment of M’s capacity by a psychologist, Dr Allen. An updated assessment of M’s capacity and cognitive functioning was carried out by Dr Allen on 31 August 2018 (and set out in his report wrongly dated 5 October 2018 but which must, by logical inference, actually be dated 5 September 2018). Dr Allen concluded that M was learning disabled with extremely low cognitive ability. He also concluded that she was of insufficient mental capacity to conduct care proceedings and once again required representation by the Official Solicitor.</p>

The cause of her deafness is not clear, but M has been told she acquired deafness after being infected with measles and mumps by her brother. Dr Austen (one of the expert specialist psychologists instructed in this case) noted that many deaf people do not accurately know their cause of deafness because this relies on their parents being accurate historians. M describes herself as being bilaterally deaf, but having some useful residual hearing although Dr Austen was unclear about this. M reported that she was educated in a Special School for six years up to 1996 which had no specialist provision for deaf pupils. </p>

The medical model of deafness defines the degree of deafness according to the extent of hearing loss (ranging from mild, through moderate and severe, to profound deafness) and emphasises the use of equipment to facilitate communication eg: hearing aids and hearing loop systems. It is generally the case that those people with severe or profound hearing loss are less likely to have any useful residual hearing and more likely to rely on sign language. However, there is considerable variability, with some severely deaf people making use of residual hearing. In addition, some severely or profoundly deaf people communicate orally without sign language, either through choice or lack of opportunity to learn British Sign Language (BSL). </p>

As the RAD puts it, Deaf people consider themselves a linguistic minority and not disabled. The Deaf community espouses a cultural definition, less to do with decibels of hearing loss and more to do with cultural affiliation and the use of BSL. Many deaf people do not consider deafness a disability. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The Toolkit is clear that deafness is not a learning disability; there is the same range of intellectual ability in the deaf population as the hearing population. However, a substantial number of deaf people experience language and educational deprivation during development and may not have fulfilled their true intellectual potential. Such deaf people are often vulnerable, with limited language, poor social awareness and reduced understanding of complex topics. It is important to distinguish people with deprivation arising from developmental experiences from those with a learning disability. Some deaf people will have additional needs such as a learning disability, mental health problems, language impairment or neurodisability. Such disabilities co-existing with deafness often go unrecognised as problems may be attributed solely to deafness. The Toolkit also makes it clear that there is no simple correlation between degree of deafness and intelligibility of speech. Having good speech does not indicate that the person is just ‘a bit’ deaf. Nor does the presence of a hearing aid indicate full hearing. It is also important not to expect a deaf person to be able to read fluently. Due to a disadvantaged education, many deaf people of average intelligence have difficulty with written English. Research indicates that deaf people generally have lower literacy levels than hearing people, with some suggesting that the average reading age of a deaf school-leaver is around 7-9 years (Mayberry 2002; Powers and Gregory 1999). </p>

	      <span style="font-style:italic">Before descending into detail, I would make this observation. It is crucial for professionals and those involved in the court system, in particular judges, to understand one profound difference between the ordinary need in cases where parties to the proceedings may speak a different language for there to be “translation”, and the need for a different character of professional intervention in these cases. This need is not solely or even largely one of “translation” as would be the case in the straightforward translation of one verbal language to another; the exercise is one of “interpretation” rather than translation. Communication between a profoundly deaf individual and professionals for the purpose of assessment and court proceedings involves a sophisticated, and to a degree bespoke, understanding of both the process of such communication and the level and character of the deaf person’s comprehension of the issues which those in the hearing population simply take as commonplace. For a profoundly deaf person, the “commonplace” may not be readily understood or accessible simply because of their inability to be exposed to ordinary communication in the course of their everyday life. What is required is expert and insightful analysis and support from a suitably qualified professional, and the advice this court has in the reports we have, a suitably qualified professional who is themselves deaf, at the very earliest stage. </span>

The important point is that disabled litigants and witnesses are able to participate fully in the process of justice. Making reasonable adjustments or accommodating the needs of disabled people is not a form of favouritism or bias towards them, but part of showing respect for people’s differences and helping to provide a level playing field. Adjustments should be made, provided they do not impinge on the fairness of the hearing or trial for both sides, and all parties can be expected to cooperate. </p>

Lip-speakers are registered professionals who are trained to speak very clearly with lip patterns that are as easy to read for the deaf person as possible. Some may enhance this with finger-spelling and occasional signs. Understanding a lipspeaker is preferable to having to attempt to lip-read several people in court. In this hearing there have been three types of lip-speakers used. There have been two in-court lip speakers used at any one time, working in alternative sessions. Their role has been two-fold; firstly, to relay to M what is being said in court (in that role they simplified the language when necessary) and secondly, during M’s oral evidence, their role was to relay to M what was being asked of her (in that role they did not simplify the language). There were two separate lip speakers provided by the court. There was also a single out-of-court lip speaker in this case. Her role was to relay what was being said out of court to M; in that role she also simplified the language when necessary. During M’s oral evidence she repeated to the court only what she heard M say to the best of her ability and she did not seek to modify or change what was being said in any way. </p>

Regular breaks need to be planned, otherwise interpreters and the deaf person can experience cognitive overload and fatigue. In this case additional strain was caused by the remote nature of the hearing which could be intense and tiring. 15 minute breaks were therefore provided every 45 minutes, and longer lunch breaks were provided to ensure all professionals and parties could take proper time to rest. During M’s oral evidence, 10 minute breaks were provided every 20 minutes. </p>

However, on 3 November 2018 Dr Austen clarified that her recommendation about using an Intermediary at <span style="text-decoration:underline">all</span> significant appointments did not necessarily mean during Dr Cornes’ assessment because she (and he) felt that he has sufficient expertise to carry out the assessment without the use of an intermediary.

She described the particular phenomenon of ‘Deaf Nodding’ which is a tendency for unconfident deaf people to nod while a hearing person is talking. This nod does not mean that the deaf person has understood. It can mean ‘yes I am attending, please continue’ or ‘I don’t know what you are saying but I am too embarrassed to admit it’ or ‘if you keep talking I might get the gist of this in a minute’. Therefore in order for professionals to ensure that the deaf person has understood, it is best to ask them to repeat what has just been said by the professional. </p>

However, shortly afterwards, on 29 October 2018 Dr Austen confirmed that, having researched the matter further, it appeared it would be difficult to find an intermediary with the appropriate lip speaking skills as the person she had had in mind was no longer working. She therefore recommended that a freelance lip speaker should be used, noting that on balance she thought a lip speaker with deaf experience would be better than an intermediary who did not have deaf experience. She explained she had contacted the Association of Lip speakers with Additional Sign (ALAS) who confirmed they would be able to provide lip speakers who could help M lip read (as well as voice over M’s speech for the benefit of the court). </p>

Dr Austen described two common misconceptions that may be made about M as a deaf oral communicator (who does not use sign language); firstly, it may be wrongly assumed that she can understand <span style="text-decoration:underline">everything</span> because she is oral, and secondly, it may be wrongly assumed that her very poor speech is because she is learning disabled.

She advised in evidence that in order for professionals to make any progress with M, they need to know what they don’t know. In other words, if a professional doesn’t understand that M does not pick up 50% of what she lipreads, she agreed it would compromise what M is able to learn from them. She agreed that M’s literacy levels mean that simply asking her to carry out an internet search or to research something herself can be difficult. </p>

She confirmed, however, that a professional can <span style="text-decoration:underline">learn</span> those skills of deaf awareness, and that a hearing person should be able to learn to work with deaf people in a one day course - dependent on that person’s role; for example, she thought that would be adequate for a care or support worker.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Like Dr Austen, he reported that there is a common misconception that deaf people can access information through lipreading people’s speech or by reading written English. He observed that with respect to lipreading, only 30-40% of English phonemes (speech sounds) have a particular facial and mouth position (viseme). Many phonemes share the same viseme and thus are impossible to distinguish from visual information alone. Lipreading skills are not necessarily concomitant with deafness and can rarely be taught with any great success. Ability to lipread also depends enormously on situational factors, which vary constantly; for example, lighting and background, speaker’s facial hair, accent, speed of speech, use of unfamiliar language and so on. </p>

He said that at the start of contact the foster carer would give M a verbal handover, by crouching down and making eye contact with her explaining if A had been fed, and the time his next feed was due and so on.

He was never told that M would only be able to pick up about half of what he was saying via lipreading.

The times he spoke to the social worker were few and far between, and certainly during the period of Social Worker 4’s absence on personal leave (February to May 2020) he spoke to no-one from the local authority.

By that stage, of course, Dr Austen’s assessment, dated 5 October 2018, was also known to the local authority. However, Social Worker 3 said in evidence that although she did complete a one day deaf awareness course (as recommended by Dr Cornes), it was not until 6 November 2019. That course provided teaching about understanding how to speak and communicate clearly with a deaf person. She explained in evidence what she had learned. She said she knows that when you speak to someone who is deaf or who has a hearing impairment you should not speak loudly because changes in the way your mouth moves can help with communication. She also learned about how deaf people experience their lives including how they manage daily living. This training was delivered by a lip speaker. She said in evidence that before that training she was able to have some conversations with M and also wrote things down for her. She said at times she was able to communicate via the maternal grandmother or F who could speak to M and whom M understood. She said M liked text messages and understood them. She believed it was effective when she wrote things down for M in meetings.  </p>

Both parents attended this review, as did Social Worker 3 and the guardian. At this review M <span style="text-decoration:underline">was</span> properly and adequately supported by a lip speaker (Dian Donovan who worked with M for several years) to enable her to communicate properly with professionals. At this meeting A’s progress and development in placement was noted to be very positive. This was a critically important meeting because it considered the outcome of Dr Cornes’ assessment. Social Worker 3 explained that Dr Cornes had concluded M would be unable to meet A’s needs in the long term.  </p>

F said he wanted A to stay in foster care until he is 18 and have contact with A during that time which would allow them to work on themselves as a family. M said that she could care for A and was as clever and smart as anyone else when it comes to his care. She said A needed his parents, but she agreed with F’s plan. She also wanted A to stay in foster care until he is 18 and have monthly contact with him.

She noted that while parents would want A to remain in foster care until he was 16 or 18 years old, this would not be in his best interests. She noted that the recent assessment of Dr Cornes indicated M was not in a position to meet A’s needs, that A’s age meant he required a permanent care arrangement. She recommended therefore that A’s needs would be met via a care plan for adoption. It was agreed that Social Worker 3 would progress the relevant paperwork for a decision to be made by the Agency Decision Maker, and that A would remain in his current placement until a permanent placement could be identified.  </p>

He said that attempts to book a lip speaker during this period were unsuccessful, and eventually he decided to go ahead with the meeting without a lip speaker because his primary purpose was to explain to F why adoption was recommended for young children who could not return home. Although plainly he should have used a lip speaker in accordance with Dr Cornes’ recommendations, the purpose of this meeting was ultimately to reiterate what had already been discussed with and explained to the parents at the LAC review on 4 March 2019, when a lip speaker <span style="text-decoration:underline">was</span> present. The guardian considers that both parents participated fully in this meeting. He noted that neither parent would accept that there were any concerns about their parenting.

As with the guardian, it would have been preferable for Social Worker 3 to have used a lip speaker at this meeting.

Dr Allen described F as a man of borderline/extremely low intellectual ability with an IQ in the range 66 -74 which means he is theoretically performing below 98% of age-matched peers. On the whole and across all areas of formally assessed cognition he performs at an extremely low/borderline level. He has very basic literacy, and it is debatable whether he could be considered to have functional literacy; his reading comprehension ability is commensurate with that of a child aged 9 ½ years. It is clear that he has learning difficulties, although not at all clear whether he fulfils the diagnostic criteria for a formal diagnosis of learning disability. Most importantly, Dr Allen concluded that it is necessary for those working with F to take into account his very limited intellectual ability.  </p>

His evidence, set out in a report dated 10 July 2019 is not challenged, and I therefore also accept it in full. Dr Furlong reviewed and confirmed Dr Allen’s assessment of F. He described F as demonstrating an understanding of the role of the various professionals involved in the case, including the social worker. F was accurately able to describe and acknowledge (albeit disagreeing) professional concerns about his mental health, alcohol consumption and police history, and he was able to identify the expectations of professionals about his parenting. F also acknowledged that if he could not do what was asked of him by the professionals, then he might be less likely to be able to provide full time care for his children who could then be placed with a family member, remain in foster care or be adopted. He was also able to state the changes he was expected to make by the professionals which were for him to attend contact sessions and meetings and to complete any assessments.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.04in">Based on the information obtained during a three hour assessment interview, Dr Furlong’s opinion was that F <span style="text-decoration:underline">did</span> demonstrate an ability to retain, recall and weigh up information relevant to the case. F was also asked about what action he would take if he could not understand something said by the social worker; he said he would ask them to repeat it using words that he understands and he gave an example of when he was unsure about an allegation made against him whereby he asked the social worker for clarification. Dr Furlong concluded that F should be regarded as capable of instructing his solicitor as well as having the capacity to understand the care proceedings. However he also advised it would aid his understanding of information if professionals were able to communicate with him using plain language, and reiterating and rephrasing questions where necessary. He proposed that given F’s specific cognitive profile, combined with his limited verbal reasoning and working memory skills (as identified by Dr Allen), it might prove beneficial to F and the professionals working with him if he was granted access to an advocate.  </p>

Dr Furlong’s assessment was carried out just a few weeks after this visit and he was confident that F fully understood, or was able to ask for clarification, the nature and purpose of the proceedings including the social workers’ involvement. Social Worker 3 confirmed in evidence that F was helpful and there were times when he would explain things to M. She also said she knew she would have left that meeting confident that both parents would have understood what she was saying.

This was an important meeting because Social Worker 3 was signposting the parents towards how they may improve their parenting. It was put to Social Worker 3 in evidence that she had told M that if she did not do the courses suggested, then the children would be adopted. Social Worker 3 denied having said anything of the sort to the parents and said that is not how she would speak to any parent. She explained how she discussed the parenting courses on offer with them. She said both parents had independently gone to seek parenting courses in the summer of 2019 having said they wanted to enhance their parenting skills. Social Worker 3 had become aware of a parenting course for deaf parents and therefore suggested to M that she might want to do it. She was quite clear in evidence that the courses were explained to the parents in the way that would help them to become better parents. However, the way in which she gave the information about the parenting course was simply to provide details of a website address. The guardian said in evidence that he thought this was inappropriate because M would inevitably require support to use the internet; he would have expected M to have been given that support by Social Worker 3. I accept that analysis. M ought to have received support and help to access resources in a way that was suitable for her particular needs, and as advised by Dr Cornes. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.04in">It was also put to Social Worker 3 in cross-examination that her assessment of the effects of adoption on the children was unbalanced. It is right to say that in written form her report did not go into the sort of detail or depth of analysis required in considering whether adoption is in a child's best interests. However, in evidence it was quite clear that she <span style="text-decoration:underline">had</span> considered the detriments of adoption, as well as the benefits. In particular, she had plainly considered that adoption would serve to sever the children’s relationships with their birth family and deprive them of the opportunity to live with their birth family. In evidence she was also able to articulate the positives and negatives of long term foster care and was clear about its advantage in enabling children to remain in contact with their families. She said that even for children of this young age, long term foster care could be beneficial if there was a plan of reunification; she identified that long term foster care in those circumstances could be used as a temporary placement. However, her evidence was clear: given that reunification was not considered to be in the children's best interests, she felt that the children would benefit from having permanent carers via adoption who are invested in them. Any deficits that were present in respect of Social Worker 3’s written evidence were more than rectified in her oral evidence. It was put to her that she had simply carried out a tick box exercise and that she had just written down platitudes. She disagreed. I reject such analysis and I accept her evidence in its entirety.  </p>

A lip speaker was booked for that review. By that stage Social Worker 4 had read the case history, received a handover from Social Worker 3 and discussed the case with her manager. Her understanding was that the recommendation was for adoption and she considered her role to be to support the children and to progress that plan. A’s plan had already been confirmed as being for adoption. B was placed with him immediately after birth in foster care. The plan was for the children to stay together. Therefore she felt that adoption was heavily weighted as the proposed plan for B.

By that stage the plan of adoption for A had already been approved (Social Worker 3 having completed his Child Permanence Report (CPR) on 2 September 2019). Social Worker 4 wrote the CPR for B on 11 May 2020. She said in evidence that she had spoken to M before completing the report but not via an intermediary or with the assistance of a lip speaker. She was also the author of the final care plans for the children dated 6 May 2020. She accepted in evidence that by the time she wrote the care plans she had not met the parents directly.  </p>

However she confirmed that she <span style="text-decoration:underline">had</span> looked at all the realistic options and pointed to evidence elsewhere in her final statement of a consideration of the various different options in the case. However this written evidence does not reflect either the benefits of long term fostering or the detriments of adoption. In that respect it is right to say that her written evidence was unbalanced.

There is a lesson to be learned here about the way in which social work evidence in adoption cases ought to be presented to the court; but that point is more than amply covered in guidance and case law elsewhere and there is no need to say more in this judgment.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.04in">I do not accept those arguments. At the risk of stating the obvious, it is absolutely fundamental that any parent in care proceedings should have the reasonable expectation that they will be treated fairly, provided with appropriate information clearly and in a timely fashion, without any attempt by professionals to ‘second guess’ what they may or may not say or how they may or may not respond. Put simply, what appears to have occurred in this case is a fundamental lack of understanding for M’s needs as a deaf parent from the earliest pre-proceedings point. Even after clear advice and guidance was received from two leading experts in working with deaf people, there was then only fluctuating adherence to that advice – by all concerned. It was as though, once raised and identified, the issue of M’s deafness was then placed well and truly on the ‘back burner’. Having raised the impact of M’s deafness at the hearing on 26 October 2018 such that it was recorded within the recitals to the court order, the issue was thereafter never again recorded as a relevant matter on any court order in a meaningful or helpful way. M was only ever referred to in court orders as being ‘hearing impaired’; even the proper nature of her disability was wrongly recorded.  </p>

The reality is that, regardless of placement option, the children will need to move – either to a longterm foster placement or to a prospective adoptive placement. It is agreed by everyone that they should stay living with each other, and no-one is suggesting that they should be separated. But a change in placement will inevitably have an unsettling effect on them and will need to be managed carefully and sensitively, at a pace that each child can manage and which is in their best interests. They will both need help in transferring their attachments – whether they move to a long-term foster placement or to an adoptive placement. If the children are placed in long-term foster care they will definitely continue contact with their birth family, certainly M, and it may also be possible in an adoptive placement; this is a factor that could ameliorate the risks posed by a transition to a new placement. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.53in;margin-right:0.04in">If the children are adopted, there would be an inevitable impact on their sense of identity in having ceased to be a member of their original family and becoming adopted people. A move to an adoptive placement would have a significant and possibly detrimental impact upon each child’s sense of identity. The local authority intends to search for an open adoptive placement that could promote contact with their birth family; however, this is by no means a certain prospect and is only an aspiration. If contact could continue, it could ameliorate the risks posed to the children’s identities of being adopted; however, it could also cause the children some confusion. However, both the children are developing well and have already developed good attachments to their current carers. There is no evidence to suggest that they would not be able to transfer attachments to new carers – whether foster carers or prospective adoptive carers. It is likely that this process will be assisted by them remaining together as they have always lived together and it is agreed by everyone involved in the case that they should continue to do so. Although the children have several maternal halfsiblings, they have never had any contact with them. </p>

The primary risks of harm in this case arise either from moving to a long-term foster placement, or moving to a prospective adoptive placement. Nor is it actively proposed that the children should move to live with either parent at this stage; however, M’s case is that at some stage, in a few years’ time, she will want the children to live with her.  There are two risks of harm arising from that proposal. </p>

Both parents have accepted that their relationship has been characterised by domestic abuse. In particular, M also recognises that this is not her first violent relationship; her relationship with the father of her other children was also violent. The parents’ relationship has also been characterised by instability and volatility; they have regularly separated then reconciled. There is no evidence that this pattern has changed for the better. Although the parents separated most recently as last October 2020, there was a recent incident between them when M had to call out the police. It is likely that if the children were placed in the parents’ joint care, then they would be exposed at best to that continuing volatility and chaos and at worst to the very real risk of being caught up in violence.

Dr Cornes identified that M has a number of predisposing vulnerabilities which include a learning disability, profound deafness, an unfortunate childhood history of exposure to domestic abuse and violence, she has herself been in local authority care, she has a history of previous violent relationships, she has had several of her other children removed, and has, in his opinion, poor mental health and untreated mental health problems. As well as being an expert in deafness, Dr Cornes is also an expert in trauma within his clinical practice. He described M as having experienced multiple trauma events over a long time. He considered that M is at greater risk of being drawn into a future similar abusive relationship as a result of her predisposing vulnerabilities.  </p>

She needed prompting to remain focused on this part of her evidence, but eventually said that he had pushed her too much and she had not pushed him back. She described asking him not to hurt her any more, and said she told him he had to ‘do something about it’. By contrast, she was much more able to describe the violence she had experienced from the father of the older children with whom she was in a relationship for 13 years. She described how he tried to kill one of the older children by putting a pillow on her face, and hit two of the older children. She called him a ‘serial killer’. She was quite clear that he was worse than F. She said she had told F all about the father of the older children. She was asked why she had stayed with F when she found out he was the same as the father of the older children. She said she told him about everything that had happened and he said he felt sorry for her and that the father of the older children shouldn’t have behaved like that towards her. She was unable to answer the question about the extent or scope of F’s violence, despite significant and repeated prompting or rephrasing of the question. M presented as a straightforward witness who did not appear to be deliberately evasive. However, I was left with the impression that, for whatever reason, she simply could not or would not answer questions directly about the extent or effect of F’s violence. It is not for me to speculate about why this might be. It matters not. What does matter is that both parents have accepted there was regular and repeated violence.

Although he accepts that he has been abusive to M, he says that on occasion he would act to physically restrain M so as to protect himself. This sometimes got out of hand and although he does not accept he was a perpetrator, he now acknowledges that it was an unhealthy relationship at times and that he and M acted inappropriately in resolving issues between them. He accepts this would have placed A at risk of physical and emotional harm. F’s qualified and partial position is a further aggravating feature in considering future risk to the children. </p>

This means she will have some difficulties in understanding on a cognitive level. She said that M has the ability to remember facts, but not things she doesn’t understand. There is no suggestion that M does not understand at the very basic level, that a baby needs feeding or changing – regularly and consistently. There is no suggestion that M does not understand at a very basic level that a young child needs stimulation and play. Indeed, there is clear evidence that at times, when prompted, M was able to do such things. The issue is not whether she could do those things, but as to whether she could do them unprompted, of her own volition, consistently and, most importantly, borne out of empathy and emotional attunement with the children’s needs.

Dr Austen was clear that she was <span style="text-decoration:underline">not</span> assessing parenting, but was only assessing language and cognition.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.53in;margin-right:0.04in">Dr Cornes’ evidence was that throughout his assessment, there was considerable evidence to suggest that M has poor ToM. She has poor alternative hypotheses to situations and demonstrated very poor insight into children’s needs and how to meet them. When he assessed M in February 2019, using a lip speaker as recommended and with all his own experience and expertise, he found her to have only a very rudimentary understanding of A’s developmental, emotional and social needs. At that stage A was aged one – the same age as B is now. His opinion is that there is no evidence to suggest that M would be capable of changing that approach in the future to meet either child’s developing and changing needs because, in his opinion, M has only a very literal and concrete view of what underpins children’s behaviour. She has a very limited understanding of emotional states and finds it difficult to tune into what others are feeling. She finds it hard to take perspectives and to imagine what it would be like to experience something as another person. In summary, he considers that M lacks self-reflection or mentalisation, which is the ability to see ourselves as others see us, and others as they see themselves. </p>

His opinion was that M will have significant difficulties supporting the children’s emotional and social learning, which is premised on her as the parent encouraging the children to understand other people’s feelings and holding perspectives different from her own.

He noted that the delay in feeding at this contact was clear evidence of M’s inability to recognise the physical and emotional needs of her child, and she did not recognise the impact of hunger or tiredness on A. He made some allowance for the inherent difficulty for any parent in being observed, but commented that in those situations this usually results in the parent trying <span style="text-decoration:underline">too</span> hard.

However, the content of the sessions does provide evidence about the extent of M’s capacity to meet the children’s basic needs, and in particular provides evidence about whether M has been able to adapt her responses as the children have developed and grown. At the most fundamental level the contact supervisor was aiming to observe whether M could remember to feed the children on time, whether she could comfort them appropriately, and whether she could stimulate them by playing with them. In those three fundamental regards, he found she could not provide a good enough standard of basic care. Although he confirmed in evidence that M did pick up on some instructions that he gave her when prompting, there was a lack of consistency in her ability to provide a consistent, positive support for the children’s basic care and emotional needs. He confirmed that there were times when M spoke appropriately to the children, and that once prompted she was able to feed and stimulate the children. He certainly was not painting a wholly negative picture. However, he could not agree that he only needed to prompt M rarely, and described having to prompt her very regularly. He said that it was his honest belief that if contact was unsupervised, then he felt M would miss cues from the children that would fully meet their basic needs.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.53in;margin-right:0.04in">As I have already identified, Dr Cornes assessed issues of ToM and attachment that were not addressed by Dr Austen. I accept the evidence of both experts, but where Dr Cornes deals specifically with the issues raised by M’s deficits in ToM, mentalisation and ability to change within the children’s timescales, I prefer his evidence to Dr Austen’s because it is founded not just in his direct expert experience in assessing M, but also in his clinical expertise in attachment. The assessments of the two experts may have overlapped in some areas, but they ultimately covered different things: Dr Austen was instructed to provide an opinion about M’s capacity and cognitive functioning, while Dr Cornes was instructed to carry out an assessment of M’s parenting capacity. Dr Austen did not see A, observe contact or assess any aspect of M’s parenting, while Dr Cornes did all those things and also read the contact records in detail. Dr Cornes was clear that M was unable to state or demonstrate that routines for the children were important. His analysis of the contact notes in total demonstrated a lack of <span style="text-decoration:underline">consistent</span> interaction and ability to meet A’s needs.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.53in;margin-right:0.04in">Dr Cornes presented as a fair, balanced and measured witness: he accepted there had been positives during the contacts when M had shown positive interactions, had played with A and had encouraged him. But it was his concerns about the lack of overall consistency that concerned him. Those concerns mirrored the contact supervisor’s evidence that at the end of two years of supervising contact, he felt no nearer to recommending that M could be left safely unsupervised with either or both of the children. Dr Cornes agreed that M was able to demonstrate she had understood the <span style="text-decoration:underline">concept</span> of stimulation of the children in theory. But he confirmed that his assessment was <span style="text-decoration:underline">not</span> just based on his clinical observations, it was also based on his reading and analysis of the entirety of the relevant other evidence in the case. He remained clear that there was considerable evidence that M could not stimulate the children consistently to make them feel sufficiently secure that she could meet their needs without being prompted. Ultimately, the thing that concerned him the most was her limited ability to show <span style="text-decoration:underline">sustained</span> stimulation of the children; that was what was missing. I do not accept that Dr Cornes demonstrated an overly critical approach to M. On the contrary, he presented as measured and fair. Similarly while I accept that M said she felt Dr Cornes had spoken to her brusquely, he did not match that presentation in any way during his oral evidence. He was considered in his answers, measured in his concessions about M’s positives, and gentle in his tone. In evidence he fairly recognised and appreciated that M felt he had been abrupt and made her feel uncomfortable, but that had not been his intention. He confirmed he had never heard such criticism of his approach before in practice. I accept his evidence. </p>

However, he observed that the problem first is that M must first <span style="text-decoration:underline">identify</span> that she even has a lack of knowledge. The difficulty is that M does not accept there is anything problematic about her parenting style, nor that she could benefit from teaching. </p>

In the first assessment in 2018 she described M as appearing very willing to listen and was quite calm. She was not with F on that occasion. Dr Austen described her as then having an air of humility, was really listening and demonstrating a willingness to learn. By contrast, at the second occasion, on 3 March 2020, she did not perceive the same sense of humility or a sense that M was really listening. Instead she appeared to be saying that she had her own strategies because those were what her partner had told her. She described M as having a new confidence unlike before when she had been listening and taking advice.

No party advocates for the children to be separated. They have lived together for the whole of their lives since B was born. I do not regard any option for placement based on the children being separated as being in any way realistic. It is also the case that they cannot remain living with their current foster carer. Staying with their current carer is also therefore not a realistic option for the children.  </p>

The advantage of long term foster care is that it offers a route back to their birth family for the children. The local authority will be obliged to continue to monitor and review the children’s needs, including contact, every few months. The local authority will also be obliged to continue to consult M and obtain her views and wishes about various plans and arrangements  for the children. This is likely to help the children in understanding the background history, their identity, and would of course maintain their relationship with their mother. As the children grow older that will continue to be of importance to their psychological and emotional wellbeing. If the children are identified as needing particular help with education or health in the future, the local authority would be obliged to provide such help as is necessary to them as looked after children. Another benefit of <span style="text-decoration:underline">Option 1</span> is that it would allow the children the possibility of moving to live with M in a few years’ time when if and when her living arrangements change for the better. That would enable them to live with a member of their birth family which is to be encouraged and promoted if at all possible.  </p>

On her own evidence, by the time M might be able to do this, A is likely to be at school and B not far behind in starting school. Any such change in their circumstances, or even the prospect of threat of such a change in their circumstances, is likely to have an unsettling effect on them at an important stage of their respective developments. It is important that the children have a permanent home well into adulthood. Any placement would need to last much longer than a child’s 18th birthday. A further detriment of <span style="text-decoration:underline">Option 1</span> is that a fostering placement can never be said to be permanent because of the changes in circumstances and commitments that inevitably face many if not all foster carers. There is a potential for disruption in a long term foster placement to a greater extent than in an adoptive placement.  </p>

In addition, it cannot be predicted with any certainty that a long term foster carer would be able or willing to continue providing care, whether practical or emotional, after the children reach the age of 18 and the care orders expire. This would inevitably be a detriment to the children throughout the rest of their lives because the family with whom they may have lived and settled could not predictably be available to them after the age of 18. It is recognised of course that many long term foster placements can and do continue for the duration of a care order, and indeed many foster carers remain involved with the children in their care after the care order expires. That is M’s experience with the foster carers for the older children. But this cannot be predicted nor is it in any way a certainty.

It is right to say that adoptive placements do break down, but the commitment of an adoptive family is inherently and obviously different to that of a local authority foster carer. However committed a foster carer may be, the fact remains that they are always free to change or vary the fostering arrangement. In that sense adoption would be experienced as very different by the children. An adoptive placement is made to last throughout a child’s life. As such, it provides certainty, predictability, security and stability.  The children are still at a very early stage in life. Their existing history of positive attachments means it is likely that they will be able to attach to attach to prospective adopters and settle into a permanent, secure and stable family life. A further benefit of <span style="text-decoration:underline">Option 2</span> is that they will have a settled routine life because, once adopted, the local authority would play no further formal role in their lives. That will mean the children will be free from intrusion and oversight into their health and education needs and it would be the adoptive family who makes the important as well as the day-to-day decisions about the children’s needs. That would inevitably give the children a much greater sense of stability and security.  </p>

The children would grow up knowing that they are adopted children, rather than children who could live with their natural family. Adoption is an inherently draconian step that prevents a child from living with their family of origin. In particular, there is no certainty that they would be able to continue having contact with M because although the local authority intends to search for an adoptive placement with prospective adopters who would promote contact between the children and M, there is no guarantee that such a placement can or will be found. No party invites me to require a minimum search period for such a placement in light of the extensive delay that has already occurred in this case. It is therefore very much a hope and an aspiration, rather than a certainty.  There is also an inherent risk of placement breakdown in any adoptive placement. </p>

I have considered whether this is a proportionate interference in children’s family life in light of their Article 8 rights. However, having balanced the benefits and detriments of the two realistic options, I do not consider it is in their best interests throughout their lives to be placed in long term foster care. I have carried out a global, holistic evaluation of the evidence and considered whether the local authority plan is the right one for each of the children, having balanced the advantages and disadvantages to them of living in long-term foster care with the certainty of contact with their birth family, against those of their being placed for adoption with the possibility, but no more, of continued contact with their birth family. I have borne in mind throughout my considerations that although the children’s interests are paramount, the court must never lose sight of the fact that those interests include being brought up within the natural family, ideally by the natural parents, or at least by one of them, unless the overwhelming requirements of the child's welfare make it impossible. A placement order is in my judgment both a proportionate interference with the children’s Article 8 rights and those of their parents, and therefore it is my judgment that a care order and a placement order should be made in respect of each of the children in this case. </p>
