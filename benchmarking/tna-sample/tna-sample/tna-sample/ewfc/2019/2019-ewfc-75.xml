It is desirable that interviews with young children should be conducted as soon as possible after any allegations are made (Re M (Minors)(Sexual Abuse: Evidence) [1993] 1 FLR 822).  Where a child has been interviewed on a number of occasions the court may attach diminishing weight to what is said in the later interviews (Re D (Child Abuse: Interviews) [1998] 2 FLR 10).  The court will wish to see responses from the child which are neither forced nor led (Re X (A Minor)(Child Abuse: Evidence) [1989] 1 FLR 30).  It is normally undesirable for a parent to be present during an interview with the child (Re N (Child Abuse: Evidence) 1996 2 FLR 214 and see the Cleveland Report para 12.35).  In Re S (A Child) [2013] EWCA Civ 1254 Ryder LJ confirmed that the guidance set out in the Cleveland Report at paragraph 12.34 with respect to interviewing children remain good practice. </p>

In every case the judge had the unavoidable task of weighing up the evidence, warts and all, and deciding whether it had any value or none.  The judge had been entitled to take the flawed evidence into account having recognised its deficiencies and had evaluated it carefully in the context of other independent evidence; the judge, however had to assess the evidence as a whole. Clearly some failures to follow the guidelines will reduce, but by no means eliminate, the value of the evidence.  Some may be purely technical and have no impact at all on value.  Others may reduce the value to almost vanishing point. The question for us in this case is whether the judge was compelled to the conclusion that he must disregard this evidence all together… &amp;….the purpose of the ABE guidelines is not disciplinary; it is to present the court and for that matter the parents with the most reliable evidence which can be obtained.  In every case the judge cannot avoid the task of weighing up the evidence, warts and all, and deciding whether it has any value or none.  Everything will depend on the facts of the case. The exercise has perhaps something in common with the one which judges are used to carrying out when confronted with hearsay evidence, often in a family case third or fourth hand hearsay.” </p>

There were, however, a number of aspects of IJ's oral evidence that struck me as significant. Before setting out the details of these matters I should note that I had reassured IJ that his evidence would be completed in one day - in fact his evidence lasted no more than 2 hours with appropriate breaks - and that he should let me know if he wished to have a break earlier than one which was scheduled and he did so. </p>

Further I indicated that if no counsel took a contrary view I would communicate this view to DC Hopkins. No counsel expressed a contrary view and Mr Vater QC for EF positively endorsed the course I proposed to take. Accordingly, I invited DC Hopkins to return to the witness box and I told him that, whatever view I ultimately come to in respect to the West Midlands Police in this case, he would not be subject of any criticism. I thanked him for his evidence. I considered it to be intolerable that this officer should leave this court concerned that he may be criticised when he laboured under, as he told me, an extremely heavy workload of outstanding cases: and that expresses the pressure under which he was working in a modest and moderate fashion. </p>

DC Andrews’ conduct of the ABE interviews played a very significant role in the boys’ allegations increasing in number and severity and to include other paternal family members. One of the reasons EF gave for making false allegations was the role played by DC Andrews. </p>

I consider, however, that it would be unwise for me to go further and enter into the realms of speculating about her motivation. It is sufficient for the purposes of this case that she had accepted she failed the boys, her actions or inaction was wrong and she caused the boys significant emotional and psychological harm.  </p>

The issue of whether they believed and believe the allegations or had/have false memories, howsoever caused, or they simply told lies is an immensely complex and complicated matter to resolve. I do not yet have the expert evidence or other evidence to enable me to determine this issue. It may be that I am ultimately unable to do so to any beneficial or meaningful extent. These issues have to be addressed individually in respect of EF, GH and IJ rather than collectively because different factors will have been and are in play in respect of each of them. </p>
