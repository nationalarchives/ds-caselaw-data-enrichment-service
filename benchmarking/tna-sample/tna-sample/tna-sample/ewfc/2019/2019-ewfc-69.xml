	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">At the centre of this case is an eight year old child, T.  She is a truly delightful little girl who has occupied centre stage in a long and difficult fact-finding hearing which has taken place over the last ten days.  Whilst T was not present for any part of those two weeks (and indeed had no knowledge of the ongoing court proceedings involving her parents), she was very much a presence throughout as far as I was concerned.  I watched a significant number of video and audio recordings taken during periods of contact between T and her father.  I watched her spending time with members of the extended paternal family.  I observed the recording of a full ABE interview<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="1">

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I had a wealth of written and oral evidence from her parents and those who interacted with her on a daily basis at school.  I saw many pages of the notes and pictures she has written and drawn over the course of the last three years.  I learned about the games she likes to play and her likes and dislikes in terms of food.  I heard about her friends and the particular dynamics of some of those childhood relationships as they were developing during her early years at school.  I heard from those who had observed contact between T and her father at a local contact centre over an extended period of time.  I heard at considerable length from each of her parents as they spoke about their daughter in the context of the very detailed accounts which each gave in their written statements.  I was struck by the enormous joy she brought to their lives before this family became enmeshed in these proceedings which have since had a devastating effect on their lives. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In this judgment, I am going to refer to the applicant and the first respondent as ‘the mother’ and ‘the father’.  I do so to preserve the anonymity of these proceedings and the individual protection afforded to parents in proceedings such as these.  In adopting these neutral generic labels, I have no intention of diluting the clear and very individual impressions which each left on me over the days I had to watch them sitting in court and giving their evidence over the course of many long hours in the witness box.  Leaving aside the over-arching weft and weave of the chronology as it has developed, I was left with the clear impression of two very different human beings, albeit with a wealth of personal attributes and characteristics which make each, in his or her own different ways, complex individuals.  They come from very different backgrounds with diverse personal experiences of life, family and career trajectories.  They are, nonetheless, empathetic and interesting individuals who no doubt once felt a sufficient connection to embark on both marriage and the journey into parenthood.  There is little doubt in my mind that T arrived into this family unit as a much loved and wanted child.  It is important to set this out at the very beginning of what I suspect is likely to be a fairly lengthy judgment.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I have no doubt that T has continued to grow and flourish in the care of her mother during the intervening months and years.  The father accepts that she is doing very well at school.  However, the plain fact is that T has lost all direct contact with her father and has not seen him since May 2017, a very significant gap in her young life </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">to date.  What little this father knows about his daughter’s life comes to him indirectly through some limited contact he has had with her school.  He has been permitted to send to T presents on her birthday and at Christmas but he has no means of communicating with her directly.  Since contact was suspended, it appears he has never been provided with a photograph of his daughter.  Throughout this time, both parents have been attempting to manage the litigation and the very significant psychological, emotional and financial pressures which it has brought in its wake.  Between them, they have spent the best part of £300,000 on legal representation.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It is therefore no surprise that, at times during the recent hearing, I observed each of these parents in a state of exhaustion and extreme distress as they relived the events which have brought about the current state of affairs. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Before I turn to those events, it is right to record at the outset what I said to the parties and their respective legal teams when the case was opened to me some two weeks ago.  The system has let this child down badly.  There have been long periods of delay between the various hearings which have only served to exacerbate the tensions between the parties and the distress felt by the father at his enforced estrangement from his only child.  I recognise and accept that delay is an inevitable part of a court system which is all too often under-resourced in terms of judges and available court time in ever over-burdened court lists.  That said, I would not be discharging my judicial function in this case if I did not observe at the outset that, whatever the cause, the resolution for this child and for these parents has been delayed for far too long. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">At the heart of this case lie allegations that the father has sexually abused T.  As time has gone on, her mother has become convinced that the allegations are true and that various things which T has said over the course which these investigations have taken are manifestations of the experiences which T has had whilst in the care of her father.   He continues to deny that he has, or would, cause any harm to his child.  He maintains, as he has done throughout, that the mother’s allegations are completely untrue and that, in certain respects, she has deliberately fabricated them in order to “frame” him and thereby marginalise him from any effective role as T’s father.  He, for his part, has been entirely persuaded that the acrimonious breakdown of their short marriage led to a wish on the mother’s part to control the extent to which he was able to continue his role as a separated parent to T.  He told me that the passage of time has enabled him to think very carefully and deeply about what her underlying motives might be for this stance.  His attitude may have softened slightly in some respects but he freely admits that at times “the red mist” of fury has coloured his approach to her conduct in this litigation.  She, for her part, perceives her former husband as a highly intelligent and manipulative individual who is very able to “talk the talk” and beguile professionals (including judges, I suspect) into investing in his case as a victim of circumstances.  </p>

When that process failed to produce a meeting of minds as to the appropriate arrangements for T, the father issued an application for contact.  T was just over 5½ years old at this point.  Following allegations that she may have experienced some form of sexual abuse at the hands of her father, a fact-finding hearing was listed.  That took place over the course of three days in July 2016.  The </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Following a further directions hearing, the judge listed a further two day hearing which took place at the end of December 2016. This was, in effect, the second stage of the first fact-finding hearing.  Each parent gave oral evidence.  Judgment was again reserved.  It was handed down in written form at the end of January 2017.  It comprised a full analysis of all the evidence which ran to 132 paragraphs over 31 pages.  Although on that occasion, the judge was not provided with transcripts of all the evidence which had been given by various witnesses at the initial hearing in July 2016, he accepted the father’s denials and found that the mother had failed to establish her allegations to the requisite standard, i.e. the balance of probabilities. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In circumstances to which I shall come, by the beginning of May the following year (2017), T is said to have made further “disclosures” to the individual who was then supervising the contact which the father was having with her at a local contact centre.  Referrals were made to the police and to the local authority child protection services and, in mid-May, when she was nearly 6 years old, T was formally interviewed.  On advice from the police, contact was suspended whilst further investigations were carried out.  This prompted an application by the father to enforce the previous contact order.   He was subsequently interviewed by the police under caution.  No further action was taken.  The matter returned to court in September 2017 when the judge decided to hold a further fact-finding enquiry into the truth or otherwise of these fresh “disclosures” from T.  This time, a guardian was appointed to represent the child’s separate interests. </p>

There was insufficient time to complete both the evidence and submissions.  Written submissions were filed the following month.  No doubt in part as a result of pressure on the lists of other cases requiring the judge’s attention, he did not hand down a written judgment until 9 June 2018, some six months after the (third) fact-finding hearing.  At the conclusion of that judgment, he reversed his earlier findings.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In delivering his judgment on the appeal, Williams J described the delay which had plagued this case and its final resolution as “staggering”.  That is a description which I adopt without reservation.  It is one of the reasons why I said earlier in this judgment that T was a child who had been let down by the system.  Within the extended timetable of this litigation between her parents, she has effectively been allowed to languish in a state of forensic limbo (as have her parents) for more than three years.  In the context of the ongoing development of her relationship with her father, should the court find these allegations to be without foundation, I suspect that the delay will have had serious and far-reaching consequences for this child which will require significant expert therapeutic intervention.  If those allegations are established now some three years on, a great deal of thought is going to be required in terms of the next steps for T.  I recognise that her mother’s evidence is that she has worked extremely hard to ensure that T’s happiness and well being have not been compromised any more than necessary as a result of her father’s absence from her life as she lives it today.  I recognise, too, that, if established, the father’s abuse of his daughter may well militate against any immediate or longer term resumption of direct contact with his daughter.  None of this ameliorates the potential consequences for this child of the loss of her father from her life and I take the view that the delay in the litigation process itself is likely to have delayed or prevented some essential therapeutic work which could otherwise have been put in place at a much earlier stage. </p>

That analysis has inevitably included a fresh assessment of the credibility of each of T’s parents through the evolution of this case.  In order to undertake that analysis, this judgment is of necessity longer than I would have wished.  However, it is essential for T (and for her parents) that we reach a final conclusion to the fact-finding exercise which is now in hand in order that she and they can move on from a process which has become damaging in itself to all who have been inundated (and I suspect, at times, overwhelmed) by its repeated iterations through the court system. </p>

In parallel with the work he continued to do with an international charity, he was able to spend most of his time living at home in London with the mother and T who had been born in June 2011, just over a year after the celebration of her parents’ marriage.  It is clear from the mother’s evidence that, in the early years, she had found his need to go on retreats and his travel to India “irritating in the same way that other women moan about their partners endlessly going to the football or to play golf”.

For his part, the father describes increasingly irrational outbursts on the part of the mother when he became the subject of some vitriolic verbal abuse.  I have little doubt that the unhappiness which each felt as their relationship disintegrated rapidly over the course of the next twelve months is now deeply anchored in their subjective perceptions of its collapse at the end of 2013.  At the beginning of 2013, and no doubt in part to address these difficulties, the family had left London and moved into a home on the South coast close to the mother’s own family.  During his working week at the university in London, it is his case that he travelled to London on Tuesdays returning to the South coast two days later on a Thursday.

It seems reasonably clear from all the evidence I heard that he did not return to the family home following his return to England from India.

I recognise that, to an extent, this might be said to demonstrate the lack of any <span style="font-style:italic">animus </span>towards the mother and a wish to secure a financially stable future for T in her mother’s ongoing primary care.  Nonetheless, I suspect that the insertion of January 2014 as the agreed date of separation is probably a reliable reflection of the reality of the timing of the final demise of this marriage whatever the father’s aspirations to cling for a little longer to the wreckage of a difficult separation. </p>

The father had raised with the mother how they might best celebrate that occasion.  This was an entirely appropriate and child-focussed communication.  It demonstrated a considerable degree of insight on the father’s part into T’s need to share that occasion with others apart from him.  It suggested an entirely non-confrontational approach to the mother characterised by a certain lightness of touch which appears to have infected the response which she sent back later that same evening.  It is worth setting out that response in full in this judgment because it provides a window on how they were attempting to resolve their differences in the early days of their separation. </p>

The parties had by then been separated for a few months.  Contact had been taking place at weekends with the mother travelling with T by train to London.  She was only a little more than 2½ years old when the parties separated.  In the early days, T stayed with her father at his London flat for two nights and returned to the South coast with her mother at the end of the weekends.  Whilst I accept that his home was a familiar environment for her (since it had been her home prior to the move to the South coast in 2013), it is also clear that she was a child who found separation from her mother very difficult.  Understandably for a child of her age, she was clinging and anxious as she made the move from one parent to the other at the weekends.  In the early days of these contact arrangements the mother would stay for the first night with T at the father’s flat, later staying nearby so as to be on hand to settle the child if she was needed. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">I suspect that these insights on the father’s part (including his email to G) will be seen by the mother as “constructs” on his part.  She has clearly felt highly manipulated by him during their marriage and appears to believe that he is eminently capable of manipulating a narrative to suit his own purposes in these proceedings.  Nevertheless, it seems to me that these early stages of the post-separation contact between T and her father were, in the main, happy and enjoyable times for this little girl.  Her weekends were fairly full of activities which the father arranged and there were visits from his extended family with whom she was close.  I accept without reservation that the travel to and from each home on a biweekly basis was tiring both for her and the mother.  T was obviously tired and unsettled by moving to and fro between her parents’ homes.  The mother’s evidence was that T was simply not coping with these contact arrangements.  She was candid in her admission that it rather suited her to be up in London on alternate weekends because that was where G was living at the time and their personal relationship was then ongoing.  The long train journeys were very tiring for T and often took up to three hours at a time when there were delays due to frequent engineering works on the line.  It appears that T became apprehensive in advance of these weekends and would often enquire whether she had to go to see her father.  I suspect that these issues flowed very much from her anxieties about leaving her mother and the amount of travel she was undertaking rather than from any fundamental unhappiness at the prospect of seeing her father.  This much I collect clearly from emails passing between the parents and the mediators whose help they had engaged at an early stage of their separation.  A particular passage from one of those emails speaks volumes to me about two issues.  The first is the extent to which there were difficulties over effective communication between these parents.  The second is the effort which the mother had invested into making T’s visits to London a success.   </p>

It is clear that the initial proposal to work towards two nights each weekend was not implemented: in practice, T stayed with her father on a single overnight stay on a Saturday.  This proved to be a particular point of tension between the parties. Whilst the mother says that T was not coping with two nights away from her, the father interpreted this restriction on his time with T as further evidence of the mother’s resistance to an appropriate sharing of T’s time and as full an involvement in her life as was then possible.  In the Autumn of that year the parents agreed a regime whereby contact in London moved to a fortnightly arrangement with the father travelling to the South coast on a day in the intervening week. T had not yet started full-time primary school although she was attending a nursery/pre-school.  In order to cut down on travelling, from May 2015 he rented a room in a shared house which was about three miles away from the home which T shared with her mother.   </p>

Both parents describe this period as being the time when they were making the best progress in their efforts to co-parent their daughter.   Both agree that they saw it as important for T to see them together and getting on well.  At the mother’s invitation, the father would frequently stay for a cup of tea or for supper in the mother’s home when he returned T after an afternoon out.  I heard about one difficult handover at a local station when T became very distressed at the point of handover.  The father’s evidence, which I accept, was that she quickly settled down with her father once she was on the train and he was able to reassure the mother shortly thereafter by sending a photograph of T sitting happily on the train. </p>

On the whole, it appears that the care he was providing was not provoking in the mother’s mind the sort of concern which might have prompted her to withdraw her support for the regime of contact which was by then in place.  The issue at the time appeared to be the child’s ability to cope with the amount of time she was spending away from her mother.  It is true that she raised an issue about the father having fallen asleep in the cinema with T during one episode of contact. There were other aspects of T’s behaviour which concerned the mother.  For example, I heard that at one stage she was biting children who came to play with her.  However, on the whole, it is clear to me that she was doing what she could to support T’s relationship with her father.  During the period in 2014 / 2015 when the level of parental cooperation appeared to be at its best, she had even suggested (and subsequently arranged) a family outing to the Isle of Wight. </p>

There is an issue between the parents in relation to the fact that, in completing the forms for her entry, the mother failed to alert the school to the fact that she shared parental responsibility for T with the father. The father points to this as further evidence that he was being marginalised from T’s life at the mother’s behest.  She has acknowledged that this was an error on her part and has apologised to the father for her mistake.  She explained that T herself had expressed a wish to be known as “TS” and wanted to take her mother’s surname following an incident after a holiday abroad.  The immigration officer at the airport had queried the fact that T’s passport had been issued in a different name from her mother’s.  This prompted a conversation between mother and daughter.  The mother’s preferred option was that she should be known by each of her parents’ surnames in a double-barrelled form but she accepted that she allowed T to take the lead in relation to how she was known at her school.  She told me that T’s requests had simply gathered a momentum and that <span style="font-style:italic">“to be honest, I just couldn’t be bothered.  There was so much stuff going on and I was so overwhelmed already”</span>.   Looking at the wide canvas of evidence before me of how matters had evolved since the separation, I am unable to find that the omission of the father’s name on the school form which related to parental responsibility was a deliberate act on the mother’s part.  It is inconsistent with the support which I have found she gave to the evolution of contact between T and her father.  It was a mistake which was swiftly corrected.  Whilst I accept and acknowledge the distress which it caused the father at the time, I do not regard that mistake as a strategic part of an insidious process or calculated alienation on the mother’s part.  I regard it as an omission rather than a deliberate commission of an act which was designed to represent that she alone had legal responsibility for this child.  The lack of any steer from her in relation to T’s adoption of her mother’s surname is something which troubles me more and I shall return to this in due course once I have chartered the course which these proceedings took following events in November and December 2015. </p>

Each involved T returning from contact with her father with a sore bottom.   To be more precise, the mother observed that the area around her vagina and labia was very red and swollen and the child was clearly sore.  The first of these incidents occurred on 15 November 2015; the second about a month later on 13 December 2015.  Whatever the cause of the redness and swelling which the mother observed, it appears to be accepted that these symptoms had disappeared by the following morning.  Each parent gives a very different account of the second episode and the father’s knowledge about it and I shall need to determine in due course whose account is the more reliable.  In relation to the first incident of redness and swelling on 15 November 2015 the father accepts that he washed the child’s bottom in the public toilets at the soft play centre where he had taken T to play for the afternoon.  His reason for so doing was the fact that she had asked him to clean her after she had had “a poo [which was] a bit smelly/runny”.  In wiping herself with toilet paper after going to the lavatory, she had smeared some “poo” on the cheek of her bottom. He has explained in his written and oral evidence that he washed T by perching her on the edge of the wash basin and used liquid soap from the dispenser to wash her bottom. </p>

There is an issue between the parents as to the extent to which the mother knew that he sometimes washed T in a similar way whilst she was in his care as a young child.

Whilst there is no other specific  allegation of further harm which post-dates 13 December 2015, T was thereafter to make what have been interpreted as “further disclosures” through things she has said to third parties and through her drawing and writing.  These culminated in a formal ABE interview which took place in May 2017, some eighteen months after the mother first noticed physical signs of redness and swelling in the area of T’s genitals.  During that period, contact was restricted to supervised contact at a local family centre and ceased altogether in May 2017.  </p>

In other words, it was instigated by the father for his personal sexual gratification.  If not directly motivated by his wish to achieve personal sexual gratification, the mother’s case is that his actions were clearly inappropriate and have caused T physical, psychological and emotional harm.

It is true that there had been complaints from the father about the absence of what he hoped would be an increasing trajectory of frequency in the time they spent together.  However, they appear to have managed the arrangements between them in the new circumstances of T’s full-time attendance at primary school.

He was no stranger to changing nappies.  He told me how, following T’s birth, either alone or with the mother, he had purchased a table from a well-known store which they had set up as a changing table in T’s nursery.  Although she disputes the extent to which he engaged in the day to day caring routines, the mother acknowledges that he had attended to nappy-changing and cleaning.

He maintains that he was often involved in T’s bath and bedtime routine.  That, he says, would often involve using a wipe to clean her bottom.  He was able to give me a clear narrative about his use of wet wipes, Sudocrem and their use for a short period of eco-nappies before they reverted to using disposable nappies.  He describes buying equipment for the mother which enabled her to express breast milk for T’s feeds in the early days after her birth. He sometimes mixed feeds when she moved on to formula milk.  Whilst there are issues between the parents as to precisely how long T was exclusively breast fed, I am satisfied that these were not responsibilities which were delegated solely to the mother; to the extent that he could be given the demands of his employment, and whilst these parents shared a common household, I find that the father was equally involved in caring for T as she grew from a baby into a toddler.  Once they separated, he continued to be responsible for these aspects of T’s care whilst she was spending time with him throughout the emerging pattern of contact. </p>

He agreed a regime of ‘compressed hours’ which enabled him to fulfil his duties to his employer by attending at the university premises from Tuesday mornings to Thursday afternoons.

That would have been around the end of 2012 or the early part of 2013.  When he was interviewed by the police nearly a year later on 19 October 2016, he said that this occurred in the main following the family’s relocation from central London to their new home on the South coast.

This was specifically in the context of what had happened when he washed her at the soft play centre on 15 November 2015 although he said it was what he habitually did when she needed a wash.  With the assistance of a child’s toy (a large bear which was produced from the children’s centre at court), he showed me how she would lean forward facing him on the lavatory whilst he supported her upper body weight on his left forearm.  In that position he would lift her from the lavatory seat, rotate towards the sink and then place her on the edge of the sink so that she was facing him with her back to the taps and her legs bent at the knees at right angles to the floor.  In this position, she was sitting perched on her bottom on the rim of the basin. </p>

He described how she would often open her bowels before her evening bath.  In this event, she would simply wash herself in the bath and needed little assistance from him.  He told me that she had her own bubble bath, soap and sponge at his home which she used when she stayed for periods of contact.  His role in bath times once she was older was usually limited to showering her off in the bath with the hand shower attached to the bath.   If she had a bowel movement whilst dressed during the day, she would invariably clean herself with toilet tissue.  On occasions when she asked her father to wash her, she would have her pants and tights around her knees and ankles as she sat on the toilet seat.  He would then lift her over to the sink in the manner I have described above.  She would often ‘wiggle’ herself further backwards towards the flow of water from the tap once the father had ensured that the temperature was correct.  In the bathroom where they had no mixer tap, he would allow the water to run into the basin until it was the correct temperature.  If necessary he would use a gentle baby soap to clean the area around her bottom.  More often than not, the pressure of the water flow from the tap was sufficient to ensure she was clean.  He would then lift her onto the floor, pat her down with a towel if one was available, whereupon she pulled up her pants and tights (or trousers if she was wearing them) and left the bathroom. </p>

They were maintaining regular contact by Facetime usually on an alternate daily basis.  In addition, he was sending cards and pictures in the post.  I understand from his evidence that these were entirely age appropriate and featured cats and other animals which provided a ‘talking point’ for their regular Facetime conversations. </p>

He left the bag he took to the play centre in the area where they had eaten lunch and accompanied T to the womens’ lavatory.  He used the female toilets because he felt they would be cleaner and he did not want to expose T to the possibility of a male entering the men’s toilet area where I understand there was an open urinal.  On this occasion he had used the corner cubicle.  T sat on the toilet and opened her bowels.  He was with her throughout and they were chatting together easily.  T wiped her own bottom using the paper provided.  In the process of wiping herself, she had smeared ‘a bit of poo’ on her right bottom cheek.  Her bowel movement on that occasion was loose, runny and smelt.  She asked her father for help.  He assisted whilst she was still sitting on the toilet by using further toilet tissue to wipe her back bottom.  He said that he wiped in the correct direction in an upward movement and then, in response to her specific request, lifted her onto the edge of the sink to give her a swift wash using the liquid soap in the dispenser to wash the cheek of her bottom which had been smeared.  He described how she ‘did a little wiggle’ after being placed back on the floor, a detail which Miss Giz says was not included in his previous accounts of what happened on that day.  There were no towels available and the father accepts that T may well have been damp when she pulled up her pants and tights.  On his account she ran back swiftly and happily to the soft play area where they remained for the next two and a half hours or more before she was returned home to her mother. </p>

He accepted that he felt distressed at the prospect that some aspect of his care had resulted in the symptoms which the mother had seen.  He told her that he had washed T’s bottom at the soft play centre and used the soap provided after she had ‘had a poo’.  It is common ground between them that during the course of this conversation he told the mother that whenever he needed to wash T at his home in London, he used ‘child soap’. Neither alleges that T was present when they had this conversation.  The mother told me that she was prepared to accept this explanation at the time and did not jump to any conclusions on that occasion. It appears that T was soon settled and thereafter the father remained at the mother’s home where there was what seems to have been a perfectly convivial discussion between them for over an hour about her application for her PhD.  </p>

She told me that he had wanted to come in but her own mother was due to come round for the evening and she did not want him there when she arrived.  It may or may not be relevant in this context that she had raised with T’s grandmother what she had seen after T had returned home the previous month on 15 November 2015. She told me that she had said to her mother (who had been a nurse) that she found it difficult to imagine that the father had done anything ‘like that’ to cause her harm.  She also told me that, having discussed it again with her mother that evening on 13 December 2015, she “shut her down really firmly” when she suggested it could be abuse. </p>

Whilst he now accepts that she has truthfully described what she saw on 15 November 2015, he maintains that he was completely unaware of a recurrence of these symptoms on 13 December until the mother raised it in passing during a telephone conversation a few days later.  It is common ground that he collected T from her mother’s home the following morning on Monday, 14 December 2015 as they had previously agreed he should in order to take T to school for the start of her school week.  The mother accepts that she did not raise any concerns flowing from the previous evening with the father on that morning.  I have seen a video clip taken on the father’s mobile telephone of that journey to school.  Whilst the mother says this is all part of his ‘construct’, it is important to note that, as of 14 December that year, the father had no idea when that footage was taken that the mother would subsequently accuse him of sexually abusing their daughter.  The video shows T skipping happily to school, holding her father’s hand, chatting in an animated fashion and looking entirely happy and relaxed in his presence.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">First, I do not believe her fundamental anxiety to be feigned or fabricated.  However, to some extent this was quite obviously written with an eye on future litigation over contact.  She had plainly been in contact with her solicitor and refers in her letter to the import of the advice she had received.   I bear in mind, too, that this letter was written only one week after the second incident of redness and swelling was observed by the mother on 13 December 2015.  It appears that she made contact with the out of hours Children’s Services following T’s medical examination on 18 December 2015 despite the doctor having confirmed that there was no physical evidence of any abuse and in the absence of any indication from T that she had been harmed in any way.  Whether or not she had been advised to seek advice by the GP, as she maintains, it does not seem to me that this was a mother who had a broadly open mind about the possibility of an innocent explanation for the symptoms she observed.  The whole tenor of her letter to Dr F suggests that her preferred option at that stage would have been for contact to have ceased until a proper investigation had been conducted into the likelihood of T having been abused by her father. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The other matter which I collect from that letter is that T was by then (and had been for some time) picking up on the tensions in the relationship between her father and mother.  Whilst the mother may have referred to making contact “more bearable” for T in the context of the child’s distress over the frequent to-ing and fro-ing to London, her words suggest to me that, in terms of T’s own experience of time with her father, the mother saw contact as it had developed by that stage as something which had to be maintained rather than as something which was there to be enjoyed.  If this was indeed her mindset or approach, it is not difficult to see how her anxiety after the visits on 15 November and 13 December 2015 might have propelled her into the state of “super vigilance” to which she has referred in her own letter to the GP.  It is not without significance, in my judgment, that the mother’s letter refers to “secrets” and </p>

Whilst that narrative was set in the context of the evolving chronology in the aftermath of the events of things T had said to, and drawn for, third party professionals (including social workers and the police) from January through to April 2016, it seems reasonably clear from the contents of her letter to Dr F in December the previous year that this was T’s initial response to direct questioning from her mother at some point prior to December 2015 but (presumably) between 15 November and 18 December 2015. </p>

If she has accurately described T’s reactions to these discussions as “clamming up completely”, this may well have lent some support to something untoward /abusive having occurred.  However, it may equally well have been a manifestation of T’s inability to process and understand the incomplete narrative to which she was being asked to respond by a clearly anxious parent.  Given her heightened awareness about the ongoing tensions between her parents and the vigilance which the mother had already observed in T, the child's potential inability to process that narrative, in the absence of abuse, is a possibility which this mother does not appear to have weighed equally in the balance at that very early stage of these investigations. </p>

At that point we had a very straight forward conversation where I said [T] washes/wipes herself.  I made it clear I didn’t expect to see this again.  And there is no need for you to touch her in this area as, even if she needs help with wiping that should be at the back not the front etc.  The next time you went to soft play she came back red again.  This time all 3 of us discussed the situation I do remember you suggested she had got hot running around but I didn’t feel at all clear about what happened.  I only raise this because both cases of soreness were severe and not something I have know[n] to have [happened] before. </p>

It was sent on 14 January 2016.  That letter was written in connection with “Matters concerning contact with [T]”.  It reflected the mother’s instructions that she had some serious concerns about his ability to care for [T] during her shared time with him.  It referred to his explanations in relation to the two occasions outlined above as being “unsatisfactory”.  Having recorded that the mother was not making direct accusations since she was unclear exactly what had taken place, the letter set out a number of perceived deficiencies in the father’s general care during periods of contact.  Amongst these were T’s apparent distress following her New Year contact with the extended family in Sheffield; the father’s inability to provide her with appropriate food when she stayed at his home in London; and inappropriate play activity (e.g. “locking her in a trunk”). </p>

However, she was in that letter proposing a change to contact arrangements.  Whilst T would continue to see her father in London and on the South coast on alternate weekends, his staying contact would be reduced to daily visits on the Saturdays of those alternate weekends.  Tea after school on the intervening Mondays would continue with returns taking place at 5.30pm.  This, on the mother’s instructions, was to be the pattern of contact both in term times and during the school holidays.  In other words, she had by this stage put a line in the sand in relation to any further staying contact. </p>

The father had checked that this was a safe place for her to hide before the game began and had checked that there were no catches or locks on the trunk.  That play session was videoed by the father contemporaneously (and long before he knew that there might be a complaint by the mother).  I have seen a copy of that video clip which shows T hiding in the trunk and re-emerging without any apparent concerns or unhappiness.  The father’s offer to engage in mediation to improve communication between them was rejected. </p>

It seems clear to me that these were two parents who were each in the very early foothills of dealing with the emotions generated by the breakdown in their marriage.  The mother was obviously in an extremely anxious state and was, on her own admission, hypervigilant to any signs of anxiety or distress on the part of T.  Given the child with whom this court is dealing, I find it difficult to imagine circumstances in which that anxiety and mistrust of the father would not have been communicated to T, even in a subliminal way.  The mother plainly perceived an inequality in the post-separation dynamic of her parenting relationship with the father.  It is clear to me from things she </p>

The father’s case is that nothing inappropriate had been said to T which might have caused her to be resentful towards her mother as a result of his departure from the family home.

On the mother’s case, she received a telephone call from social services informing her that she must stop all contact and make an emergency call to the police on a ‘999’ number.  The reason for this development was that a male who refused to give his name had been in contact with children’s services “trying to get [T]’s records”.  The mother maintains that this intervention came as a “real shock” to her.  There is no evidence that this individual was the father.  However, what we do know is that the father made contact with her GP, Dr F, on 20 January 2016. The GP’s notes record that the reason for his call was to find out whether there was some medical reason for T’s recent episodes of bedwetting.  The father reported to Dr F that she had one episode of bed-wetting whilst she stayed with him over the New Year but that there had been none since.  The GP was apparently able to reassure the father (as is recorded in the notes) that he had seen nothing which had concerned him when T was physically examined in December 2015 and there had been no pathological indication from the urine samples tested that there was an underlying infection.  It seems that the father was at that stage keen to see T’s medical records.  Dr F records that he suggested during that conversation on 20 January 2016 that the father should send a formal written request for such access in a letter together with evidence of parental responsibility. </p>

I regard this as potentially significant evidence from an experienced professional social worker:  that evidence was before the court at a relatively early stage of these investigations and only a matter of some weeks after the two incidents involving the mother’s observing redness to T’s bottom.  </p>

After an initial period of play and colouring and some general conversation about school and the pet cats, Ms Bowles asked T about her father.  T volunteered that they had spent part of the New Year together and had stayed in a hotel in ‘one big bed’.  Ms Bowles asked whether they had slept in the same bed and T confirmed that they had<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="5">

She was then asked about what happened when she goes to the toilet.  T told Ms Bowles that she went by herself.  She was asked if anyone ever needed to wash her after the toilet and she said ‘Daddy does sometimes’.  She confirmed that her mother did not wash her. </p>

In her earlier evidence in the first hearing in July 2016, it is clear that she had been under the impression that this sort of washing was more usually left to the mother<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="6">
		<p class="footnotedescription"> [T:77] </p>
	      </authorialNote>.  Ms Bowles confirmed to me during the course of her oral evidence during this hearing that a complaint based upon a parent washing a child’s bottom after a trip to the lavatory would not necessarily lead to a formal referral as a child protection issue.  She also confirmed that when T answered her questions about washing and her father’s having done this “sometimes”, she was not presenting in any way which suggested this was a matter of concern for her.  She said that T’s response was open and spontaneous and had been volunteered by the child without exhibiting any signs of emotion or concern.  There was nothing to suggest on that occasion that this had made her unhappy. </p>

Having responded quite clearly that there had been none, she was immediately asked a question about going to the toilet and washing.  Whilst the question about the identity of the person who might need to wash her was open, as Ms Bowles confirmed, T was able to respond quite spontaneously and without apparently evidencing any feelings of distress that her father sometimes washed her but her mother did not.  That reality for T appears to be borne out by the evidence of her two parents.   </p>

She explained to T that her role was to make sure that children are safe and happy.  In the event that she was worried about anything, Ms Bowles was there to talk about it and to help.  This session took the form of T drawing on various worksheets and producing responses to things which she did and did not like.  In relation to the latter, T had said she did not like eating spaghetti and beans with her Daddy; did not like going to cold places; and did not like school.  In response to what she loved to do, T said that she loved eating chocolate with her Daddy.  She also referred to her love of swimming with her Mummy,   When she was asked to draw her “caring circle”, Ms Bowles records that they went through the adults in T’s life who look after her and keep her safe.  In answer to a question put to her by Miss Giz during her evidence at this hearing, she agreed that these might be complex issues for a child as young as T to understand. She had included her mother and some of her extended paternal family members and family friends.  When she failed to include her father, Ms Bowles asked if there were any adults in her life who did not look after her well or keep her safe.  T said “No”. </p>

		<p class="footnotedescription"> It is common ground that the ELSA sessions did not come to an end until about June 2016. </p>
	      </authorialNote>.  On 12 February 2016, Mrs Butchers raised with T that her mummy had told her that she and her Daddy no longer lived together [2/C:154].   T was then completing some “Bear cards”, each of whom had different facial expressions.  She was asked to show Mrs Butchers which Bear showed how this makes her feel.  She chose the ‘happy’ Bear (“no more shouting”) (the words in parenthesis having been added as part of Mrs Butchers’ manuscript record of the meeting).  T was asked how she felt about seeing her Daddy.  She chose a ‘worried’ Bear face “because she misses her cats”. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">At the next session on 26 February 2016, T had indicated to Mrs Butchers that she was happy that Mummy and Daddy did not live together any more because “Daddy doesn’t wake me anymore”.  In the following session on 29 February 2016, Mrs Butchers had pursued this remark with her and T had told her that “he always wakes me early for breakfast”.  During this session they had been focussing on how families changed over the course of time.  As part of the session, T had been completing faces in blank circles to describe how she felt (i) when she saw Daddy and (ii) when she did not.  She drew a happy smiling face over which Mrs Butchers has written “to see Daddy”.  A very sad face with an ‘inverted U’ mouth was her representation of how she felt “when she doesn’t see him”.   Mrs Butchers noted that “[T] drew pictures of her now and when she was younger.  She talked about a sleepover she’d had at Daddy’s sister’s house, with him (… this was possibly Christmas 2015).  [T] happily spouted off all the names of her family members who were there too.  The last person [T] mentioned was ‘Mr Sausage’.  She didn’t elaborate anymore but left it there”.  This appears to have given Mrs Butchers some cause for concern.  She has written a note to remind herself to ‘speak to safeguarding for advice’. </p>

This information was imparted to the police by the mother on the same day (1 March 2016) on which T first saw her father at the local Family Centre. </p>

She gave Mrs Butchers a full and lengthy account on that occasion of “what has been happening in the last 2 – 3 years”.  Mrs Butchers accepted in cross-examination by Miss Hendry that the mother’s concerns had become “quite vivid” in her (Mrs Butchers’) mind after their face to face meeting on 7 March 2016.  The following day, on 8 March 2016, Mrs Butchers spoke to an educational psychologist who was overseeing at one remove the ELSA sessions she was conducting with T.  She was seeking advice on how she should move forward “in the correct way” in her sessions with T.  The psychologist advised her to stay on track with ‘emotional literacy’ but that there was no need to speak to T about issues concerning her parents’ separation.  It is clear that the following day, Mrs Butchers spoke to the headmaster of T’s primary school about her concerns. </p>

In terms of the mother’s state of mind at this point in time, the evidence allows me to draw the following conclusions. Without doubt she was extremely concerned about the father’s relationship with T and was preoccupied (if not consumed) by thoughts that he might have harmed her through some form of sexual abuse.  By this stage, it is clear that she was searching for any ‘signposts’ which might help her make some sense of her feelings.  In conducting what appears to have been a retrospective trawl through what she clearly perceived to have been an unhappy marriage, she has seized upon every memory or piece of information which might have some bearing on what she observed to be an emerging picture.  As the mother told me, she was asked to conduct this exercise and to provide to the authorities any and all information which might be relevant to their ongoing enquiries.  To the extent that this was what she was doing, I do not criticise her.  What I am concerned to understand from all the evidence before me is the extent to which this highly anxious mother’s concerns were being projected onto T’s understanding of what had happened in terms of her own relationship with her father.    </p>

Despite T’s obvious unwillingness to say any more on that occasion and the fact that she had put her hands over her ears, the mother persisted with her questions.  She describes in her written evidence how T ‘kept screaming with her hands over her ears’.  In this obviously febrile and anxious exchange, the mother describes how this conversation developed: </p>

The clear message which T might have collected from that conversation is that her mother was there to keep her safe because she was not safe with her father.

I have no way of knowing whether T was aware of the presence of the police officer in her home that evening and I do not speculate about that.  She may well have been in bed when the officer arrived. That is certainly what was suggested to her by Miss Hendry when she was cross-examined.  However what I do know is that (i) the mother was observed by PC Dalley to be “extremely emotional about the situation”, and (ii) T was aware that the police were going to speak to her the following Tuesday.  This must have been as a result of conversation on that day between mother and daughter after the initial telephone call had been made to the police once T had drawn her picture.  I say that because PC Dalley’s note of her visit that evening records the fact that T had told her mother that she might “just draw pictures” when she was spoken to. </p>

She had, as part of my case management directions, been afforded an opportunity to read the verbatim transcript of the evidence she had given to the court in July 2016, some three months after that meeting.  At that earlier hearing, she confirmed her own impression that the mother’s questions to T might well have amounted to implanting in the child’s mind a sense that ‘Daddy had done something to her’ and that she was safe with her mother and needed to tell someone.  She had specifically advised the mother on that occasion that she should listen to T if she wanted to tell her something but should be very careful not to ask the questions or to lead the child with questions.  Despite the mother’s very obvious distress, the officer confirmed that she impressed upon the mother the need to allow anything from T to come spontaneously.  She agreed with Miss Hendry at this hearing that it made it very difficult to regard anything which T said thereafter as being anything other than compromised.  She told me during her oral evidence that, whilst the mother might not have been deliberately putting pressure on T, she was clearly very stressed and worried and that distress would obviously have come across to T.  The mother herself had told PC Dalley that she had become upset in front of T.  The child, in her view, was clearly aware that her mother was upset about something.  Equally, PC Dalley was persuaded that, in her own mind, the mother felt that something had happened to harm her daughter.  She presented as “an extremely worried Mum”. </p>

I listened to a complete audio tape of that interview and I have a transcript of it in the written material within the bundles. It is common ground that T said nothing during the course of that interview which gave rise to concern or which could amount to evidence of abuse or inappropriate touching by her father.  T was asked questions about the picture which she had drawn on 8 April.  She told the police officer that she was licking the vanilla ice cream which she had drawn.  She identified her father as the male face in the drawing but could not remember whose the other face was.  The police were at that stage unaware that it was the father’s case that he had been in the habit of washing T’s bottom after she had been to the lavatory when she was younger.  This is important because of the questions which they subsequently asked her about ‘touching’.   </p>

I said, because you told the police I made you draw that picture didn’t you ?  She said yes.  I said do you think I did make you draw that picture.  She said no.  I said, if you meet people it is important to try and tell the truth because people need to know what has really happened.  She put her hands over her ears and started shouting at me … I don’t want to talk about it.

During that conversation, he mentioned Mrs Butchers <span style="font-style:italic">[Facetime Clip 8]</span>.  I do not know whether he had by breakfast time that morning received Miss Bowles’ letter written on the same day.  It is possible, I suppose, that it was written early in the morning and emailed to him.  There is overt criticism of the father for having said to T during that conversation that he knew and liked Mrs Butchers.  In the context of what was happening at this point in time, it is said that this could be construed as an attempt to exert pressure on T and send to her a clear signal that he was aware of her sessions with this teacher and should not speak.  I accept that this is one possible interpretation and I bear it well in mind in the context of the overall canvas of the evidence.  It falls to be considered alongside the later allegation that he sent T some inappropriate books at Christmas intending to send the same signal that there were matters she should not disclose to those around her.  </p>

She read back T’s first set of words to make sure she had understood them and asked why she did not want to go to Dad’s house.  This provoked the second line which Mrs Butchers has reduced to her own manuscript note as “Dad washes me”.  In a series of leading questions, she then asked T ‘How does he wash you ?’  She replied “with his hand”.  She then drew a picture and wrote “on my bottom”.  Mrs Butchers asked how many times had Daddy washed you like this and T replied “twice”.  When asked how this made her feel, she replied “sad”. She presented during this session as upset and trying hard not to cry.  Mrs Butchers told her she was ‘a really good girl’ and explained that she would have to tell another adult because what T had told her had made her “feel worried in my tummy”.  T had nodded that she understood. </p>

Following that session, Julie Taylor, the supervisor, contacted the Children’s Services Department to report some concerns which arose out of a ‘gut feeling’ she had formed. This arose out of an exchange between T and her father.  T had brought a skipping rope to the session and her father had asked her to teach him to skip.  This she said she would do if ‘Dad was good’.  When asked what he needed to do to ‘be good’, T had replied ‘not breaking a promise’.  There were other exchanges during that session which Ms Taylor had found odd.

This little book appears to have been something connected with the ‘worry doll’ she had been encouraged to make as a result of her sessions with Mrs Butchers.  The mother has photographed the three consecutive pages in the heart-shaped notebook on which T has written in a blue pen: </p>

She then told the child that “Daddy has done something very wrong”.  She also said, “Daddy should never ask you to keep a secret that makes you feel sad.”  The significance, of course,  aside from the fact that these were leading questions, is that this is the first time there had been any suggestion of the alleged abuse taking the form of digital penetration.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Several important considerations flow from what happened on 30 April 2016.  First, T’s notes in her heart-shaped book reveal that she is aware of ‘secrets’.  Secondly, there is no reference at all to her being ‘hurt’ or feeling physical sensations of ‘hurt’ until that is suggested to her by her mother.  Thus, the mother’s evidence that “[T] told me it hurt when Daddy touched or washed her” has to be seen in the context that this was not information which was volunteered by T.  Thirdly, the suggestion of digital penetration is entirely new and emanates from a series of leading questions put by the mother, as she herself accepts.  Nothing which T had said or done up to this point suggested that she had experienced digital penetration even if she then had the capacity to understand what the mother was asking her.  What she <span style="font-style:italic">would</span> clearly have understood from this exchange was that her mother was extremely distressed with her father, that he had done something to her which was very wrong, and that she had been asked to keep this thing secret.  </p>

When she was cross-examined by Miss Giz at this rehearing, she told me that if the mother was not putting pressure on T, she was certainly presenting as a very stressed and worried mother and that had obviously come across to T who was only too well aware that her mother was upset about something.  She confirmed that T did not have a bad word to say about anyone and nothing which the child had said suggested to her (PC Dalley) that T had been </p>

There was no doubt, however, in the officer’s mind that the mother’s mindset was that something had indeed happened.  As I have already recorded, she agreed with Miss Hendry when it was put to her that the clear impression which the mother had communicated to T was that her father had done something wrong but that she was safe in her mother’s care had contaminated the enquiries to the extent that it made it difficult to place confidence in anything which T might say in future.  In particular, it was her view that, having been told that her father had touched her in a bad way, she may well have been confused and that confusion could very possibly have infected the reliability of her account.  When it was put to her directly, she confirmed that she had indeed shared the view of her superior at the time that there had been inappropriate pressure placed on the child by her mother. </p>

She asked her mother if she knew what secret she was talking about and confirmed that it was the one she raised the week before.  She told her mother she had already told Mrs Butchers and she had asked whether it was a good or a bad secret.

I know not whether Mrs Butchers had seen the clear recommendations in that report which stressed the need to avoid leading or closed questions.  I understand that Mrs Butchers was in a difficult position to a certain extent.  She had a small child in her care during those ELSA sessions who was clearly anxious and, to an extent, conflicted.  She was aware of the repeated concerns which had been expressed by the mother and she had spent some considerable time in her sessions with T building up a relationship of trust and creating a safe space for her to express any concerns.  That said, her questions were clearly leading and designed to encourage the child to provide a narrative in relation to the “secrets”.  That process had the potential to contaminate whatever was said in response to those questions, albeit that nothing of substance emerged on that occasion to explain T’s understanding of what those secrets were. </p>

In terms of the separation anxiety she recalls in the context of leaving her mother, I have no doubt that she was recounting real feelings and giving Ms Bowles a broadly accurate account of how she felt at times when she was taken for contact with her father in London.

This was described as a “further assessment/monitoring visit … to continue to gain her views”.  T was initially happy and excited, and talking in an animated way about her recent holiday to Wales.  She was asked to complete a work sheet entitled “Letting go of Worries”.  It included a large tree with several branches.  The caption under the title encouraged the writer to write about any worries and hang them on the branches.  Miss Bowles encouraged her to draw or write any of her worries on the branches of the tree.  T chose to draw on the end of the branches because she said that she did not have any worries.  She was specifically asked when she last saw her Daddy and she replied that she has seen him the previous evening at the “play zoo”.  She said she taught him to skip, that they had chocolate cake and made a collage.  She explained that she liked to play hide and seek with her father.  She said she would like to continue to see her father at the play zoo. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">On 31 January 2017, judgment was handed down.  The court found that the mother had not discharged the burden of proof in relation to allegations that T had been sexually abused by her father.  Before the court on that occasion was a report from the contact centre which had been produced at the behest of the mother.  There was no court direction for this report.  It had been prepared by Donna Blanche who ran the contact centre.  She had reviewed the contact notes although does not appear to have been present for any of the actual contact sessions between T and her father.  There had, by then, been 34 weekly two hour supervised contact sessions since they started on 1 March 2016.  The report confirms that the father had been consistent in his attendance and had complied with all requirements made of him.  He had brought appropriate toys and snacks for T and maintained appropriate conversations with her asking about school and activities.  It records the support given by the mother to these sessions although she was not present whilst they took place.  T is described in the report as a bright intelligent child who is always talkative and who “engages well in contact”.  She always appeared happy to have contact with the father but is “wary of having close affectionate contact with him".  There appeared to be an absence of “cuddling and kissing”.  Mrs Blanche concluded that there was an apparent lack of physical or emotional warmth between father and child.  That, and the fact that contact had been ongoing in the centre for a year, led Mrs Blanche to recommend that contact sessions should remain in the centre on a supervised basis at least for the foreseeable future. </p>

She passed away on 7 February 2017.  Her funeral took place the following week and there was a memorial service on 20 February 2017.  There was some justified criticism of the father at that time (which he accepts) because of his initial insistence that he had contact with T on that date as had been scheduled.  It provoked much distress at a time when the mother was ill equipped to handle confrontation over the arrangements for T.  The father has since apologised but it was insensitive at best and aggressively inconsiderate at worst.  Clearly the mother regarded it as history repeating itself insofar as it mirrored what she had experienced as controlling behaviour on his part during their marriage.  That apology was proffered very late in the day and only in circumstances where he had little alternative but to accept that he had been notified in advance of the date.  I reject any suggestion that the mother had in any way misrepresented the date of the funeral. </p>

I have a copy of the information leaflet produced by the Project leaders and a printout from its website.  Its objective is ‘to support children to build resilience when impacted by domestic abuse’.  The website records that the project “is a unique way of working with children, young people and their mothers who have experienced domestic abuse.  [It] takes place over 12 weeks with groups for children, young people and their mothers running in parallel.  The groups provide an opportunity to explore the experiences, understanding and feelings with an emphasis upon providing fun and creative activities that keep children engaged and interacting with each other.  It is about creating a safe place for children and their mothers to help each other to find the best strategies to deal with their experiences and rebuild their lives.  A key aim of the programme is to help mothers to support their children in their recovery.” </p>

I appreciate that the recent court judgment had not exonerated the father; it had merely established that the mother had not made out her case to the required standard of proof (i.e. on the balance of probabilities).  That said, there is little doubt in my mind that she was anxious and distressed at the prospect that what she had regarded as ‘safe guarding’ measures for T in terms of her future contact with her father might well be dismantled in the foreseeable future.  I am quite sure that she remained extremely vigilant throughout this period and that her anxiety and vigilance are likely to have been communicated to T even if through non-verbal means. </p>

Miss Taylor has in certain respects been swift to reach conclusions about a particular issue on the basis of the answers she received from T.  Having now analysed a very significant quantity of evidence which includes many sessions which third party professionals and others have had with this child, I know that she has in the past frequently responded with hesitation and equivocation (for example, “I don’t know” or “I can’t remember”) when she is asked about things which are difficult for her or in respect of which she feels conflicted in some way.  Thus, in the first session, there was a discussion about families.  T appeared to chat happily about her maternal side of the family.

This was a story which the mother had been reading to T the night before this session following a further discussion with Mrs Blanche about moving contact outside the centre.  T told Miss Taylor she had six worries: “one of them is my biggest worry and one is not so big a worry”. This resulted in the production by Miss Taylor of the ‘worry jar’.  She suggested T might write down her worries and she would look after them for her.   I have a copy of the notes and pictures which found their way into the worry jar on that occasion.  Amongst them were, <span style="font-style:italic">“Dad washs my botm” </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">“mummy is to far away frome me”</span>.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">By the time of the third CEDAR session on 18 April 2016, T and Miss Taylor were working on the NSPCC underwear rule worksheets.  They were apparently discussed in great detail in the context of a conversation about ‘keeping safe’ although I do not have chapter and verse of what was said.  T wrote some “worry” words on a note which went into the worry jar.  They were “sad, upset, nasty, bully, lonely” with a sad face at the bottom.   Using cushions with various “emotion faces”, T was asked a number of different questions and asked to sit or stand on the appropriate cushion to show how she felt.  The prospect of macaroni for dinner prompted her to stand on the </p>

Miss Taylor then asked how she would feel if she were to visit her father at his home this weekend.  T said, “That’s a difficult one”.  Miss Taylor immediately suggested she might write down her answer and put it in the worry jar.  T agreed to do this but said she would read it out before it went in the worry jar although Miss Taylor was not allowed to ask any questions about what she wrote: </p>

She will often do a “thumbs up” sign when she likes something and a “thumbs down” sign when she does not.  A “thumb in the middle” means she is uncertain how she feels or that she has mixed feelings about a particular person or issue.  She engaged in these responses with Miss Taylor during her third session in the context of questions which were put to her regarding how she felt about ‘Dad’.  She said she felt in the middle and that the “mean thing” was “when Dad washes me” and the happy thing was “sweets” (but not too many).  Miss Taylor then engaged her in role modelling in order that T could explain how she felt about Dad.  T asked her to be Dad.  Miss Taylor said, “time for bath then bed, [T]”.  She records that T put her hand up and said, “stop, I can do it myself” and then pretended to get into the bath.  Miss Taylor’s conclusions at the end of that session included a concern that T seemed ill prepared for contact with her father outside the contact centre notwithstanding that those changes to contact appeared imminent. </p>

This was in the context of a discussion about how T might feel if she and her father spent some time together away from the contact centre.  T placed her self on the ‘worried’ cushion.  T offered to write down her thoughts on post it notes for the worry jar but Miss Taylor was not allowed to ask her any questions.   She once again wrote that she was not happy when Dad washed her, when mum was too far away, or when Dad gave her too many sweets. Miss Talyor then embarked upon a series of questions which were designed to explore what T had meant about ‘not liking washing’.  T offered no explanation but said “I’m not sure”.  Miss Taylor asked her to demonstrate using a doll.  T then washed the doll’s bottom using the flat of her hand.  Miss Taylor asked her what it was that she did not like about this.  T said she would write it down.  She wrote: <span style="font-style:italic">‘scratchy, hurt, sore’ </span>and drew a sad face.  She told Miss Taylor in answer to the question ‘How did Dad wash other parts of her body ?’ that she washed herself when she was in the bath.  She told Miss Taylor, again, that she liked Dad ‘in the middle’ but would like him more if he did not do these things.  She asked to take the notes home with her so that she could show them to her father on Facetime in order that he would know how she felt.  Miss Taylor told her that the notes had to stay in the worry jar but she would give her some more paper to write new notes. </p>

Miss Taylor records that she was very upset and crying and was saying that she did not want to go out of the centre with her father.

According to the mother’s account, she said that her mother must be in a room with the doors locked so that “Dad can’t get you”.  She continued to express concern that they could not be there at the same time as her father “so that Dad can’t get you”.

She had some considerable experience of conducting these sorts of interviews with children and was ABE trained. She told me during the course of her oral evidence that there was nothing in T’s demeanour during the interview which enabled her to discern whether or not T had actually had the experience of any form of digital penetration since there was nothing in her body language to indicate one way or the other.  She agreed that she had appeared perfectly happy to answer some initial questions about her father.  However, she accepted that these observations could not point conclusively in one direction or the other given that the account which T gave during the interview could be a credible account of abuse and it was consistent with what she had been saying before.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In relation to the issue of digital penetration, PSI Tarry confirmed to the original trial judge in the second fact finding hearing in January 2018 (as she confirmed to me during her evidence at this hearing) that when she interviewed T in May 2017 she had been unaware that the child had been asked by her mother the specific leading questions, <span style="font-style:italic">‘Does it hurt when Daddy touches you ?’ </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">‘Did he put his fingers inside your bottom ?’</span>.  Those questions had been asked over a year before the ABE interview and T had since the end of April 2016 had a series of meetings with Mrs Butchers (her ELSA teacher at school) and with Miss Taylor (the CEDAR sessions at the contact centre).  These had all been initiated with a view to helping T with her “worries”, to understand what might have been troubling her, and to build her resilience and coping skills.  PSI Tarry told me that, whist she had been aware of Miss Taylor’s involvement, she had no knowledge of the ELSA sessions or Mrs Butcher’s earlier involvement since the “disclosure” which T made in May 2016 after her conversation with her mother.  Further, as is clear from the witness statement which PSI Tarry made in the context of possible criminal proceedings (dated 28 May 2017), she did not see the written reports of the CEDAR sessions and/or Miss Taylor’s notes until after the conclusion of her interview with T. </p>

She agreed that the word ‘hurt’ and the reference to “in her bottom” might well have raised these concerns.  In answer to a specific question put to her by Miss Hendry, she told me that “Yes, she may have been recounting something which she had been told had, or may have, happened”. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The rehearing of the case was listed before the original trial judge at the end of January 2018.  Judgment on the father’s appeal against the outcome of that hearing was handed down on 29 March 2019.  The appeal was allowed and the case was remitted to me.  Because I have been dealing with a complete rehearing of all the evidence in this case, it is neither necessary nor appropriate for me to analyse the original judge’s reasons for reaching a different conclusion following the hearing in January 2018.  In one sense, my task has been a more straightforward exercise than that which confronted the original judge when he reconvened his enquiry into the allegations of sexual abuse in January 2018.  By that stage, he was essentially reviewing developments in the evidence as they had emerged over the course of several months following the conclusion of the earlier hearings in July and December 2016.  His focus, perhaps understandably, was on whether, and to what extent, those developments could or should cause him to review his earlier decision that the allegations were not made out on the balance of probabilities.  Because I have started with a completely blank canvas, I have had the benefit of being in a position to look at the overall <span style="font-style:italic">totality </span>of the evidential landscape and to see how, and when, the allegations first emerged and subsequently developed.   I have been able to analyse not only the development of T’s various accounts but also to set into a proper forensic context what was happening as each milestone occurred and which professionals were involved at the relevant time.  I have also had the benefit of understanding from contemporaneous records and documents produced at the time how the mother’s approach to the unfolding events was made manifest both to T and to the professionals charged with supporting T and investigating the truth or otherwise of her concerns.  What I accept to be a necessarily lengthy and detailed analysis of the chronology of the evidence as it emerged has given me a clear view of the pathway which this investigation took from 15 November 2015 (which has to be the starting point) to the ABE interview some eighteen months later in May 2017.  Apart from the continuing entries which the mother made in her electronic log, the substance of what T said during that ABE interview was the concluding piece in the forensic jigsaw which underpins the mother’s allegations of sexual abuse. </p>

Having completed my survey of the evidence, I have read and re-read all of that material and the very detailed notes which I made whilst listening to submissions on behalf of the Guardian.  I have been taken to many inconsistencies in relation to the evidence of both the mother and the father.  In terms of their overall credibility as witnesses of the truth, I have factored into my approach all that has been said and written in this respect.

However, I would wish the parents, the Guardian and their respective legal teams to know that I have read and absorbed everything which has been said and the fact that I do not specifically rehearse the relative strengths and weakness of each and every submission does not mean that those individual submissions have not been carefully weighed in the balance as part and parcel of my holistic survey of <span style="font-style:italic">all </span>the evidence in this case. </p>

Both have been adversely affected as parents and as individuals by the toll which this litigation has taken on them over the course of more than three years.  Each has given evidence on four separate occasions at different hearings.  The material before the court, whilst extended in terms of the evolving chronology, has by and large covered the same narrative.  Previous inconsistencies in the written and oral evidence have been forensically exposed both in the 2018 hearing and during the course of the rehearing with which I have been dealing.  The parents are well aware of the factual inconsistencies in their respective accounts and the impact which those inconsistencies may have on the conclusions which I am being asked to reach.  In the main, neither has wavered from his or her previous accounts of events and, in particular, the circumstances of the handovers on 15 November and 13 December 2015. </p>

I do not say that to undermine any of those qualities which he undoubtedly possesses.  It is clear to me that the father understands the traction which a presentation based on professional insight and a child-centred appreciation of T’s circumstances has the potential to achieve.  For what I suspect have been entirely straightforward reasons, he has taken informal advice from at least one professional psychologist as to how he should deal with his situation over contact and these emerging allegations.  I am quite prepared to accept that he has gained a degree of insight into his own behaviour and reactions to the events of the last three years.  He has clearly reflected carefully on the situation in which he finds himself and what he needs to do in order to move forward if there is to be a restoration of his relationship with his daughter in whatever form is considered appropriate by the court.  He told me that much of his self-reflection had led him to review the mother’s role in these allegations and it was apparent from some of his answers that his position has softened somewhat as time has gone on.  That said, he continues to pursue his case that T’s mother has deliberately misled the court in certain key aspects of her evidence. </p>

For his part, and from a perspective of persistent denial that he has, or ever would, inflict harm on T, the father has continued to battle on through what he has experienced as a gale of litigation (which he described, at various points, as ‘<span style="font-style:italic">Kafkaesque madness</span>’), including a successful challenge on appeal to findings which identified him as likely to have been the perpetrator of such harm. </p>

On her own admission, she emerged from the marriage with a catalogue of grievances which, for the most part, were sensibly contained as they negotiated their way through the divorce, the financial repercussions of that divorce, and the arrangements for T’s contact with her father.  She had apparently found happiness and support in the new relationship she established with G and she very honestly conceded that, in the early days of the separation, T’s London visits to see her father enabled her to spend time with G at his home in London.

		<p class="footnotedescription" style="text-align:justify;margin-right:0.01in"> In the interests of balance, it is right that I record that the counsellors observed <span style="font-style:italic">each </span>of the parties during those sessions displaying both anger and distress over past behaviours about which each complained during the marriage.  They comment in this context that “it was normal for them to rally quickly and refocus on the future”. </p>
	      </authorialNote>.  Whilst I accept that she was under pressure during these sessions in the immediate aftermath of the breakdown of their relationship, it confirms my impression that the mother felt that the dynamics of the marriage were such that she often felt at a disadvantage in making herself heard.   I cannot accept that, from the outset, the mother was intent on marginalising the father in T’s life.  I can well understand that his very clear distress at the collapse of his marriage fed into her perception of his overbearing manner, insisting (as she saw it) on establishing <span style="font-style:italic">his </span>rights to spend an appropriate amount of time with T.  He would not be the first father in these circumstances to resent the apparent ‘control’ which a primary care giver is often perceived to hold in terms of an ability to restrict time spent in the departed parent’s home.  Her actions in supporting the contact which they were able to agree in the early months after the separation suggest to me that she was then genuinely committed to ensuring that T spent as much time with her father as she could cope with.  It has to be borne in mind that this child was little more than a toddler when the marriage broke down.  All the important milestone developments which she went on to achieve in her pre-school years were met against the background of commuting between the homes of her separated parents.  In the particular context of this case, that included the transition from what I was told was a fairly short period of potty training into taking responsibility for her own personal hygiene.  She was only two and a half years old when the marriage broke down. </p>

There were what might be described as the ‘fairly predictable’ concerns expressed by the mother as the contact arrangements settled down but there was no occasion on which she sought to prevent contact on the basis of a concern that T was not ‘safe’ in her father’s care. </p>

Whilst he still seeks a raft of findings which are underpinned by a submission that she has deliberately sought to “destroy” his life through these allegations, I detected that he has over the course of these proceedings gained some insight into the predicament which faced his former wife when she was presented with what she observed on 15 November and 13 December 2015.  I am prepared to accept that she did indeed observe the symptoms of redness and soreness on and around T’s labia and vaginal area on each occasion.

These suspicions had not then crystallised into formal allegations of abuse and the investigations, such as they were, were in the very early foothills of what was to become a multi-agency investigation of T’s developing account.  The mother told me that as at 13 December 2015 she found it incomprehensible that the father <span style="font-style:italic">could</span> have abused his daughter sexually.  She maintains that when her own mother came round to the house on that evening and matters were discussed, it was her mother who advised her to consider the possibility of abuse.  She maintains that she sought to “shut her down” very quickly.  She says that her counsellor advised her to report the matter to the authorities when it was discussed shortly thereafter in the privileged confines of that meeting.  In my judgment, the mother moved very swiftly in her approach to an entrenched view that T had been abused and all professional efforts must be focussed on providing T with the appropriate space to make her “disclosure”.  I believe that the father is right when he contends that at no stage leading up to the January 2018 hearing had she accepted the findings of the local authority, the police or the court to the effect that there was insufficient evidence to establish the allegations to the requisite standard of proof.  The mother might well say that she was vindicated in her determined approach to protect the interests of their child by the subsequent findings of the original trial judge.  However, those findings have been set aside in their entirety and, as I have said before, I have approached my task as one which requires me to start again with a completely open mind and a blank canvas. </p>

In the statement dated 5 July 2019 which she prepared for the purposes of this rehearing, she made a completely new allegation, the particulars of which she had not raised previously.  She recounts a conversation with the father which took place at some point in the first six months of T’s life when she was an infant.

In my judgment, that statement from the mother tells me two things.  First, with the original findings overturned, she was fighting tooth and nail to persuade the court that her belief in T’s “disclosures” was genuine and deserving of belief by the court.  Secondly, it suggests to me that this mother has a tendency to exaggeration and, at times, hyperbole in order to make the points she seeks to put before this court.   </p>

This assertion was plainly untrue and in my view it should never have found its way into her written evidence (which she had sworn to be true).

However, I remind myself, as I must, that, just because a person has put before the court a demonstrably untrue account of one particular instance or event, that alone does not mean that nothing which they have said is worthy of belief.  People tell lies or mould the truth of their accounts for all sorts of reasons.  A family court, in common with a criminal court, can rely on a finding that a person has lied as evidence in support of a primary positive allegation that something did or did not happen.  As the well-known authority of <span style="font-style:italic">R v Lucas </span>[1981] QB 720 tells us, to be capable of amounting to corroboration the lie told must first of all be deliberate.  Secondly it must relate to a material issue.  Thirdly, the motive for telling the lie (in a criminal context) must be a realisation of guilt.  </p>

Standing back and reflecting on all the evidence which is now before the court, including many hours of oral evidence from the mother, I am persuaded that this is the most likely explanation for this particular lie.  I am also persuaded that she views the prospect of a resumption of contact between T and her father at this stage as a burden which both she and their child will struggle to bear.  She told me in clear terms about the toll which managing the previous contact arrangements had taken on her.  She clearly found it exhausting and stressful.  She told me that at times it had all become too much as she struggled to manage what she perceived to be the ‘demands’ of this father for more time with T.  The process of this litigation will have proved to be excoriating for both parties given its substance and the length of time it has taken to reach this point.  In my judgment, the mother now believes that T is safe, happy and doing extremely well at school.  I am sure she views with trepidation the impact on her household and her settled life with T of once more having to engage with a parent whom she believes has caused harm to her child.  I make these remarks at this stage of my analysis not to demonstrate any final conclusions but to explain why I believe the assertion of digital penetration has been presented to this court as part of the mother’s developing narrative in relation to the father’s guilt. </p>

I accept that there is a well-documented cultural practice of washing in India which is different from Western habits of personal hygiene.  The father lives in a thoroughly Western environment but he has travelled to parts of the Indian sub-continent where his access to public conveniences and toilet paper will have been limited if non-existent.  He told me during the course of his evidence that his brother, a general practitioner in Sheffield, practised washing in this way despite his having absorbed and adopted a settled life in this country.

One such example is his account of not having read in advance the small book which he sent to T for her birthday in 2019.  He told me that this last year was the first on which the mother had not sent to him an online hyperlink of what he should buy for T.  Both he and his family in Sheffield had sent books to the mother’s South coast home through Amazon.  One of those books was called “The Truth Pixie”.  That came from his family.  He sent ‘Drawing Unicorns’ and “To be a Cat”.  Part of the narrative of that story was the angst suffered by one of the characters over the absence of a parent.  The online synopsis includes a quote from the book: <span style="font-style:italic">‘worst of all Dad has been missing for over a year and there is no sign of him ever coming home’</span>.  It was suggested to him by Mr Langrish that, given his love for his daughter and the investment he had made in her care whilst he had been having contact, it was inconceivable that he had not read the book before ordering it.  Miss Giz has suggested that the gift was a clear signal or message to T that he was absent from her life but still a watching presence.  The father’s explanation to me was that he had followed a recommendation from a family member, H, who was a school teacher.  He maintains that he did not read the synopsis but merely looked at the picture online and followed the advice from someone whom he thought would know what was appropriate for a child of T’s age.  I find that explanation difficult to accept.  This was a father who was dedicated to almost every aspect of T’s life during the time which they spent together.  He went to great lengths to maintain an appreciation of the small moments which shaped her everyday life at home and at school.  He sent cards on an almost daily basis in the early stages of this litigation in order to give them a touchstone for their regular Facetime conversations.  He chose with great care the cards he sent so that T would always have something to engage with when they spoke.  I simply cannot accept that this father would not have taken the same care in choosing his present for T when this gift represented what for him must been a very precious point of contact with the daughter he was prevented from seeing because of the allegations he was facing. </p>

I am also prepared to accept that when she was smaller, this was something which caused T no discomfort or concerns.  She was consistently clear in what she said to the professionals who asked her about this that her Daddy washed her but her Mummy did not.  There was never anything to indicate that this was something which caused her distress, discomfort or concern.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In terms of the underlying question as to whether or not there was a sexual motive on the father’s part, I am going to have to stand back and look at all the evidence holistically.  In the context of everything which I now know about this case, I ask myself whether it is likely that this father would take the opportunity of the time he spent with his daughter on either 15 November or the 13 December 2015 to abuse her in a sexual manner by vigorously rubbing her genitalia or her bottom (or doing anything less in terms of sexual touching).  On the mother’s case, something of this nature happened on those days to cause the redness and soreness whilst they were out at the soft play centre (or at some other location).  The inherent probability or improbability of an event remains an important aspect of deciding whether such an event has in fact occurred.  This is as much a matter of common sense as it is a question of law. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">What do their respective accounts about prior knowledge of ‘washing’ tell me about these inherent probabilities ?  The father has been adamant throughout that the mother was aware that he washed T’s bottom in this way when it was needed after ‘a poo’ whilst they were together as a family unit.   In her letter to Dr F on 20 December 2015, and very shortly after these events, the mother referred to the fact that there had been a previous conversation about washing long before these allegations surfaced.  She said that on that occasion she had told the father he must not wash her bottom.  This may or may not refer to the conversation which she said they had in the summer of 2015 after T had shared a bath with her father.  I accept that the parties had by this stage been separated for the best part of eighteen months.  I am prepared to accept that there was an occasion at some point earlier in 2015 when the parties were sharing a meal together in the mother’s home and T had called out to her father from the bathroom asking him to wash her after she had been to the toilet.  As to the mother’s knowledge of his practice of washing T as a much younger child whilst they shared a common household, I suspect that she must have been aware of this even if she did not attribute any significance to it at the time.  T was then a relatively small child and the mother has accepted that the father was fully engaged in all aspects of her physical care which they appear to have shared when he was not away from the home at work or abroad.  I accept the father’s evidence that this was not a practice which was ever conducted ‘behind closed doors’ and I further accept that, as they went about their normal lives, there were probably times when they spoke to one another whilst he was helping T in the bathroom.  I suspect that this may be an aspect of the evidence which the mother has been able to consign to the past in her attempts, as she perceives it, to </p>

I am reinforced in my view about the mother’s prior knowledge of the father’s practice by the evidence produced by Julie Taylor.  When, in May 2017, Ms Taylor made a safeguarding referral to Children’s Social Care as a result of what T had said during her fifth CEDAR session on 2 May that year, she had included in her document a reference to a previous allegation of inappropriate washing in the context of which the father had raised the issue of this being a ‘cultural’ practice.  During the course of her evidence in January 2018, Ms Taylor had confirmed in cross-examination on behalf of the Guardian that this information had come to her from Donna Blanche as an explanation which had been given to the contact centre supervisor by the mother at the time when the contact arrangements in that centre were being set up.  The mother does not accept this and I accept that there is no reference to such a ‘cultural practice’ in the initial referral form which she completed.  The first supervised contact session took place at the centre at the beginning of March 2016, some four months before the mother claims to have been aware of this element of the father’s explanation of ‘washing’. </p>

I do not think that much turns on whether or not the father could recollect hearing T crying.  He has accepted that she was sore and that the mother observed the symptoms of redness and soreness which she describes.  It is accepted that he provided her with an explanation of how he had washed T using soap from the dispenser whereas he was accustomed to using a (presumably milder) children’s soap when he washed her at home in London.  It is clear from what I heard from both parties that there was a conversation on that occasion when the mother made it clear to the father that T was old enough now to take care of herself when she went to the toilet, a proposition with which the father appears to have agreed.  He confirmed in his evidence that he has not washed her since in this way.  The fact that they were able to have an apparently civilised conversation thereafter for what appears to have been some two hours after T was put to bed about the mother’s application for her PhD suggests to me that the mother was not overly concerned by his explanation at that stage in terms of any pointer towards potential sexual abuse.  If and insofar as there are differences in their respective recollections, I prefer the evidence of the father in relation to what transpired on this occasion. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Of perhaps greater significance is the differing accounts which each has given of the second handover on 13 December 2015.  The significant issue between them is whether or not there was any reference by the mother on this occasion to further redness and soreness.  The mother accepted in her evidence that these symptoms were not as obvious as they had been on 15 November. The father maintains that he only became aware of a further episode of redness during a telephone conversation which he had with the mother a few days later.  It is accepted by the mother that there was no complaint by T on that occasion.  The mother claims to have taken T back downstairs and to have said to her in front of the father, “Okay, T has a red bottom again.  Can someone tell me what is going on ?”.  As I have described already, her case is that father and daughter stood in front of her ‘like cartoon characters’, apparently whistling, with neither prepared to look at the other.  Whilst she states that he definitely stayed for a period of time on that occasion, she told Miss Giz that she could not recall whether the father stayed for dinner or tea.  She told Miss Hendry in cross-examination that she wanted him out of the house before her mother arrived.  She maintains that she was trying to address the issue in an open way and ‘give everyone a chance to say what they wanted to say’.  The father refutes this account and maintains that, although he wanted to stay, he hardly got beyond the front door.  </p>

His aspiration at that stage was to share T’s school holidays.  He was well aware that there had been an exchange between them but a month before about the mother’s concerns over washing T’s bottom.  He had acknowledged on that occasion that she was old enough to take care of herself and that he would not do this again.  If the mother did indeed observe further physical symptoms on 13 December which could indicate yet another incident of rubbing or other inappropriate sexual touching, one has to ask the obvious question:  why would he do this when he was clearly on notice that the mother was already vigilant and concerned ?  The mother’s explanation to me was that he was a “chancer” and “liked to push things to the edge”.  I confess that I found this a singularly unconvincing explanation and one which I do not accept.   </p>

We know that the mother’s solicitors’ letter was written on 14 January 2016 as the means by which overnight staying contact was halted.  Whilst that letter set out a number of general concerns over the father’s care of T, what was expressed to be “the most pressing issue” was the lack of clarity in the mother’s mind about these two handovers and the two occasions when T had returned with the symptoms which the mother has described.  As this solicitors’ letter makes plain, the mother’s ‘follow up’ email on 11 January 2016, some three days before, was designed to elicit a clear response from the father as to the cause of these symptoms.  Whether or not that email was written as a direct precursor to her solicitors’ letter and as part of her justification for reducing contact to daily visits, I know not and I do not speculate.  From the content of the written material which provides some support for the mother’s account that there was a conversation between them on 13 December 2015 which involved an explanation about running around a lot, it may well be that the passage of time has caused each of these parents to conflate what was said at the handover and what was subsequently said (on the father’s case) during the course of a telephone call a few days later. </p>

Earlier in my judgment I have set out at some length a careful and detailed analysis of how that account developed and the climate in which the succession of professional interviews with this child took place.   The number of interviews to which T was subject as this litigation has unfolded is a matter of significant concern to me.  She was a very young child when those interviews commenced and, as I have found, the interviews were conducted against what was clearly a deeply entrenched and hardening position which was taken by the mother in relation to the truth of T’s evolving “disclosures”.  There is no doubt in my mind at all that a significant impetus for the evolution of that account was a series of leading questions and suggestions emanating from the mother.  I accept that, as time went on, she became increasingly anxious about T but I find that, in her desperate wish to establish what had happened, she effectively closed her mind to any option but that her daughter had been abused and that the father was the perpetrator of that abuse.  She had clearly begun to construct a case to support her suspicions as early as her letter to Dr F in December 2015, but a matter of weeks after the two handovers in November and December.  She was very keen that the police should check the father’s computers as part of these investigations long before there was any solid evidence of his involvement as a perpetrator of such abuse.  She rejected the conclusions reached by professional bodies that there was no reliable evidence to support her concerns and, as a result, I have little doubt that T was well aware that her mother was extremely concerned that she should engage with the professionals to report her “worries”. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The mother’s case to me was that it was the ‘unfolding story’ which had convinced her that T has been describing sexual abuse at the hands of her father.  For reasons which I can well understand given her day to day involvement in the care of such a precious child, I regret to say that I believe she has lost sight of her own role in that developing story. </p>

I am sure that each has dealt with many cases since their involvement with this.  On the whole, I am satisfied that each did her best to help me in terms of each stage of this long investigation. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">From the first home visit by Becky Bowles on 22 January 2016 it is clear that T displayed no hesitation at all in allaying any concerns that something wrong or that something bad had happened to her.  Ms Bowles accepted that T might have been under the impression that she needed to say something.   As far as Mrs Butchers involvement is concerned, T’s ELSA sessions through February and March 2016 reveal that T was still happy to see her father notwithstanding that the mother had by then stipulated that contact must move to the Family centre on a supervised basis.   The reports from the mother of what transpired on 2 and 8 April 2016 were clearly unhelpful in terms of the trajectory of the ongoing investigation.  They tell me a great deal about the increasing pressure to which T was being subjected and her mother’s insistence that she had to be ‘brave’ and to ‘talk to Mrs Butchers about what Daddy has been doing to you’.   PC Dalley accepted that anything which T said as a result of this pressure had the potential to contaminate any ongoing criminal investigation. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Despite the fact that the mother was told in clear terms that she must not ask leading questions of T, that is precisely what she did when, on 30 April 2016, she asked T directly, in the context of being ‘hurt’, whether her father had put his fingers inside her bottom.  As before, T’s account to the professionals who were by then involved appears to have mirrored very closely the suggestions which had been put to her.  An issue which separates the parties on the facts is whether or not the mother may herself have written the notes on the heart-shaped pieces of paper which T presented to Julie Taylor on 2 May 2017.  Despite the apparent inconsistencies in her account as to whether or not those notes bore T’s handwriting when she returned with her plastic folder from her session, I am not persuaded that this mother deliberately wrote on those notes and presented them as T’s own work.  I am sceptical as to whether or not she was able to insulate herself as completely as she has suggested from what was going on in those sessions given the hyper-vigilance which she was demonstrating by that stage.  However I do not believe that she manufactured these notes and passed them off as T’s own despite my finding that she has lied about the issue of a previous admission of digital penetration. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Whilst I accept that both Mrs Butchers and Ms Taylor in their ELSA and CEDAR sessions were there to support T over any worries or concerns she might have, there is nevertheless some evidence that these sessions and the issues which were raised during them may have only reinforced in T’s mind the need to say something to someone.  I have already found that there was inappropriate pressure from her mother in this respect.  There is further evidence in the records of these sessions that suggestive or leading questions were put by each of Mrs Butchers and Ms Taylor.  For example, when Ms Taylor was confronted with T’s note on 2 May 2017 and the reference to the father having put one finger in her bottom at a time, an experienced safeguarding professional would have recognised immediately that no further questions should have been asked.  In effect, Ms Taylor was conducting something akin to an interview of this child and she was not professionally equipped in these circumstances to undertake that task.  None of the recognised safeguards was in place in terms of the relevant statutory and non-statutory guidance.  This mirrors the issues which flowed from the fact that what T had said at an earlier session on 26 April that year involved the introduction of a doll.  T’s comments on that occasion ought to have alerted Ms Taylor to the fact that the introduction of a doll and the invitation to reenact what had happened were highly inappropriate in that context and in breach of recommended and accepted guidance and practice. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In terms of the consistency of T’s account, I cannot ignore the fundamental fact that from an absence of any complaint on the two occasions when she presented with an inflamed and sore genital area, to making no complaint whatsoever to the social worker over any discomfort or inappropriate touching whilst her father was washing her bottom when she first spoke to the social worker, she had moved over the course of 16 months to alleging that the father had put his finger into her bottom one at a time.  Despite her increasing maturity by the time of the ABE interview in May 2017 she was unable to provide any reliable narrative account of how this happened, where, or on how many occasions.  Her response to the effect that it happened anywhere there were toilets demonstrates to me that it is highly likely that T has continued to see the narrative of the continuing professional involvement in her life as having its genesis in her mother’s initial concerns about washing bottoms, toilets and Daddy having done something wrong.  I accept that there were concerns on the mother’s part about other examples of T’s apparently sexualised behaviour (sitting cross-legged on the floor with a finger in her vagina) but, without more and in the light of my findings that this father has not abused his child in the manner alleged by the mother, there may be other plausible explanations which do not involve the father. </p>
