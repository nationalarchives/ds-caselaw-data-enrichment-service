	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">This is an application by the Queen’s Proctor to set aside a decree nisi of divorce granted in the Willesden County Court on 21 November 2013. The decree was made absolute on 24 February 2014. The Queen’s Proctor asserts that both decrees are void – nullities – by reason of non-compliance with section 1(2)(d) of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973. The application is of profound concern and worry to the parties, both of whom have since re-married on the faith of the decrees. The matter is also of very great public concern because the cause of the predicament in which the parties now find themselves was error on the part of the court, error not merely by the court staff but also, and fundamentally, error by judges.  </p>

The statutory condition precedent required for making a decree of divorce in section 1(2) of the 1974 Act was therefore not met. The District Judge’s purported retrospective validation of the decrees of divorce in his order of 18 January 2017 was in error.

Very properly, Ms Bazley acknowledged that this was very much a ‘team effort’, the team including, as well as herself and Ms Dunseath, a pupil in chambers, Mr William Vaudry, whose contribution it is only right that I should publicly recognise. I am immensely grateful, as I sure P is, to all three of them as well, of course, to Ms Budwal and Mr Nuttall.  </p>

Section 4 of the Summary Jurisdiction (Married Women) Act 1895, read together with section 1 of the Summary Jurisdiction (Separation and Maintenance) Act 1925, provided that a married woman could apply to a court of summary jurisdiction for orders under the Acts in a number of specified circumstances, one being (see section 4 of the 1895 Act) that her “husband shall have been guilty of persistent cruelty to her.” The applicant wife alleged that her husband had been guilty of persistent cruelty. The justices, although finding the allegation not proved, nonetheless ordered her husband to pay her maintenance. Their order was eventually (page 330) set aside on appeal by the Divisional Court of the Probate Divorce and Admiralty Division, which “discharged” the order. The husband then brought proceedings in the Queen’s Bench Division claiming damages against the justices. His action was dismissed by Diplock J, as he then was, and his appeal was dismissed by the Court of Appeal.  </p>

The riposte on behalf of the husband (page 301) was that the order was bad on its face and therefore void.

In some of the older authorities it seems to have been envisaged that there were only two possible outcomes – either the transaction was void or it was valid … it is now clear that there are not only two possible consequences of non-compliance with a statutory or other legal stipulation, but three – the subsequent transactions may be neither void nor valid but voidable. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.04in">It is trite law that it is the duty of the court, in construing a statute, to ascertain and implement the intention of Parliament as expressed therein. Where Parliament has used in nontechnical legislation words which, in their ordinary meaning, cover the situation before the court, the court will in general apply them literally, provided no injustice or absurdity results. In such a case it is a reasonable presumption that Parliament or its draftsman has envisaged the actual forensic situation. But in many cases (and the instant seems to be one) it will seem probable that Parliament and the draftsman have not envisaged the actual situation before the court; and the duty of the court in such circumstances will be to surmise, as best it can, what Parliament would, within the context of the words of the statute, have stipulated if it had done so. A number of rules, founded on common sense, have been evolved to assist the courts in this task – for example, Parliament will be presumed not to intend injustice or absurdity or anomaly. But the most useful approach was laid down as long ago as <span style="font-style:italic">Heydon’s Case</span> (1584) 3 Co Rep 7a. The court will seek to ascertain what was the pre-existing “mischief” (that is to say, defect) which Parliament was endeavouring to remedy: this will often give a guide to what remedy Parliament has provided, and to its extent and its sanction (pages 11-12). </p>

Nevertheless, this possible disadvantage to the wife must be balanced against the far graver disadvantages which may flow from holding that in every case a decree absolute shall be void automatically if obtained without compliance with the provisions of section 6 of the Divorce Reform Act 1969 or its modern successor, section 10(3) of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973. Furthermore, if the decree absolute be held voidable and not void, the court retains a discretion to decide whether to declare that the decree absolute shall be void or valid. This discretion will only be exercised after all the relevant circumstances have been considered, including the financial provision for the wife which the court has power to order or which is offered. In my opinion, the possibility of doing justice to all concerned, whether they be the wife, the husband, the children of the family, or third parties, is enhanced if the decree absolute is held to be voidable but diminished if it is held to be void in every case irrespective of the circumstances. </p>

But, undoubtedly, the registrar, when the application was made, could have done what judicial officers often do in such circumstances and say: ‘If you undertake to issue a summons I will make the order.’ The absence of the summons is, as it seems to me, the most technical defect that one could really imagine, and if one has to decide whether it falls on the side of – to requote [counsel] through the mouth of Dunn LJ – ‘A mere technicality or slip or mistaken step in the litigation …’, or whether it was a fundamental mistake in the proceedings not to issue a summons, it seems to me impossible to come to the conclusion that it was other than of the first character.

It is an affront to the rules of natural justice. Mr Hornby says that it all stems from the wife’s failure to acknowledge service, but that, with respect, is not correct. It stems from three things. First, the wife’s failure to acknowledge service; secondly, the husband’s solicitors’ failure to inform their professional colleagues of what was going on to a degree which might reasonably be considered by the wife’s solicitors to amount to conduct which lulled them into a sense of false security; and, thirdly, and primarily, from the failure by the court to give the notice which the court is required to give.” </p>

Following the transfer by the Peterborough County Court to the High Court of a divorce petition, the petition was purportedly transferred back to the County Court pursuant to rule 27 of the Matrimonial Causes Rules 1977. Subsequently a judge in the County Court granted a decree nisi. In fact, rule 27 had been revoked and due to a lacuna in the drafting of section 38(2) of the Matrimonial and Family Proceedings Act 1984 there was no power to transfer the case back to the County Court.

In this case, I have no doubt that Lord Moynihan’s divorce petition was deliberately framed in a way which was calculated to deceive the court. All the subsequent representations and submissions which were made to the court were vitiated by fraud. He wished to obtain a divorce. He wished to do so even if his wife objected to it, as I believe she did or would have objected, if only on financial grounds. He quite deliberately set out to deceive the court. His affidavit verifying the petition was false, and in swearing it he committed perjury. He perverted the course of justice and succeeded in obtaining a decree. It is a gross case. The inevitable consequences to all are serious. I have no doubt that I should set aside and declare null and void the decree absolute and the decree nisi and dismiss the petition.” </p>

In each of the cases before me jurisdiction was sought to be founded in accordance with, in most of the cases, the fifth or, in a small minority of the cases, the third limb of Article 3(1)(a) of the Council Regulation. So, in every case it was being asserted that either the petitioner or the respondent was habitually resident in England and Wales at a property called Flat 201. In fact, in every case that was a lie, supported by false and in some cases perjured statements. None of the parties was even resident in England. Flat 201 was not a residential property; it was a mail box. The Queen’s Proctor’s case (para 16) was essentially that in each of the cases the proceedings were fraudulent from beginning to end and, in particular, that each of the decrees, whether a decree nisi or a decree absolute, was procured by fraud.  </p>

That is something one finds sometimes stated in terms – as by Phillimore LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">P v P</span> [1971] P 217, page 225, by Sir George Baker P in <span style="font-style:italic">Dryden v Dryden </span>[1973] Fam 217, page 236, by Rees J in <span style="font-style:italic">Wright v Wright </span>[1976] Fam 114, page 124, and by Holman J (who, as we have seen, knows a lot about these things) in <span style="font-style:italic">Krenge v Krenge </span>[1999] 1 FLR 969, page 978 – and it is, in truth, implicit in much of the analysis which underpins all these cases. And the language used is typically robust. If Phillimore LJ confined himself to the proposition that a court “ought not lightly to treat a decree absolute as void”, Sir George Baker P, followed by Holman J, said that the court “should strive to hold that a decree absolute is voidable rather than void”, while Rees J said that the court “should only hold a decree absolute to be void if driven by the terms of the relevant statute so to hold.” </p>

It is reassuring to see that family lawyers are not the only ones who struggle with the distinction, for the authors observe (para 4-058) that “Behind the simple dichotomy … lurk terminological and conceptual problems of excruciating complexity” and go on to cite (para 4-070) a dispute within the Academy where the view of one corner is denounced by the other as “a tissue of pseudo-conceptualism behind which lurks what is in reality a <span style="font-style:italic">pragmatic </span>conclusion.” Grateful though I am to Mr Murray, it is neither necessary nor appropriate for me to chart these difficult waters, though I note the view of the authors (para 4-062) that in the public law context the distinction has been “eroded” by the courts, which “have become increasingly impatient with the distinction.”  </p>

It is sometimes said that Roger Casement was hanged by a comma, but, whatever the truth of that, one has to ask what conceivable principle of justice or public policy could possibly be served by treating as nullities decrees where the parties were the innocent victims of failure by the court itself, and where their subsequent marriages, entered into in complete good faith and in reliance upon the court’s own orders, would thereby be treated as bigamous, when the entire problem derives from the fact that a cross was placed in the wrong box. We are no longer in the days of Parke B. Surely the modern judicial conscience would revolt if compelled to come to such a conclusion. </p>

In these circumstances there can be no question of avoiding these decrees. To do so would be to add insult to the injury already inflicted on these innocent people by the State’s blunderings. Every principle of justice and public policy demands that, as I do, I exercise discretion in their favour. There is, as it seems to me, irresistible force in the point made by Ms Bazley and Ms Dunseath that people are entitled to plan their lives in accordance with judgments of the court; that in this case the parties have, essentially, twice been granted relief by the courts (first when the decrees were originally granted; secondly, when the decrees were upheld by District Judge Middleton-Roy); and that it would be unjust to both parties to determine that they have been living their lives under the auspices of a status twice vindicated by the courts, but which, nevertheless, turns out to be false. I should add that the Queen’s Proctor entirely concurred with the parties, in the event that the decrees were found to be voidable, on the question of the exercise of discretion in their favour in these circumstances. </p>

That is why I have set out the history in such painful detail. The public, in order to understand this, does not need to know who P and M are.  </p>

This was because, as it was put in the decision letter dated 28 February 2019, her disposable income had been assessed at an amount which made her ineligible for legal aid. In her application for legal aid, she had set out her aggregate monthly income as £2,674.70, the relevant deductions as £2,233.57 and her disposable monthly income (aggregate income <span style="font-style:italic">less </span>such items as PAYE and NI, housing costs and various expenses) as £441.13. These figures were re-assessed by the Legal Aid Agency as, respectively, £2,694.13, £1,113.26 and £1,580.87. The </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.04in">major alteration, the reduction in the assessed amount of the relevant deductions, was the result of the Legal Aid Agency capping in the sum of £545 her actual housing costs of £1,500, on the basis that she has no dependants. The upper limit for aggregate income is £2,657 and the upper limit for disposable income is £733. An applicant for legal aid becomes financially ineligible for legal aid if <span style="font-style:italic">either </span>limit is exceeded. So P would in any event have been ineligible because her aggregate income exceeded the upper limit by, on the Legal Aid Agency’s figures, £37.13. I should add that her disposable capital of £30.17 fell very significantly short of the upper capital limit of £8,000. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">I do not criticise the Legal Aid Agency which was, no doubt, operating within the confines of a system imposed on it by others. But the idea that someone with an available net monthly income of £625.87 (the amount if one takes the actual rather than the notional amount of her rent: £1,580.87 – (1,500 – 545) = £625.87) and, for all practical purposes, no capital has the means to fund litigation of this kind is, to adopt a phrase used by Frankfurter J in <span style="font-style:italic">United States v Dege</span> (1960) 364 US 51, page 53, “unnourished by sense.” Nor is it immediately obvious why someone whose disposable income is so low should be denied legal aid because their aggregate income exceeds some artificial limit, let alone when it does so by a sum as trivial as £37.17. After all, P, like all of us, has to live on what is left after payment of PAYE and NI (deducted, of course, at source) and the costs of housing. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">What I was faced with here was the profoundly disturbing fact that P does not qualify for legal aid but manifestly lacks the financial resources to pay for legal representation in circumstances where, to speak plainly, it was unthinkable that she should have to face the Queen’s Proctor’s application without proper representation. The State has simply washed its hands of the problem, leaving the solution to the problem which the State itself has created to the goodwill, the charity, of the legal profession. For what brought this matter to court was, to repeat, failures, mistakes, by the State, by the court system, and, specifically by judges. Moreover, the application has been mounted by an officer of the State, the Queen’s Proctor. Yet the State has declined all responsibility for ensuring that P is able to participate effectively in the proceedings. I make as clear as possible that in saying this I intend not the slightest criticism of the Queen’s Proctor, who has acted throughout with complete propriety and, moreover, with conspicuous concern for the predicament in which P and M find themselves. Indeed, the Queen’s Proctor, having discussed the point with the court, very properly took the highly unusual step of writing to Messrs Duncan Lewis a letter to assist with P’s application for legal aid in this case. Yet the situation is, it might be thought, both unprincipled and unconscionable. Why should the State leave it to private individuals to ensure that hapless individuals like P and M, victims of the State’s failings, are able to obtain justice? Or is society in the twenty-first century content with the thought, excoriated well over a century ago by Matthew LJ, that justice, like the Ritz, is open to all? It is deeply wrong and potentially most unfair that legal representation in a case like this, where it is a vital necessity, is available only if the lawyers, as here, agree to work for nothing. </p>

That counsel for the father and for the mother should appear pro bono in such a complex case as this is in the finest traditions of the legal profession. Up and down the country, counsel, solicitors and legal executives fill the gaping holes in the fabric of legal aid in private law cases because of their commitment to the delivery of justice. Without such public-spirited lawyers how would those such as the father and mother in this case navigate the process and present their cases? How judges manage to deliver justice to the parties and an appropriate judgment for the child without such assistance in cases like this begs the question. It is a blight on the current legal aid system that cases such as this do not attract public funding. So far removed from the stereotyped ‘fat-cat,’ the legal profession in cases such as this are more akin to Boxer in George Orwell’s ‘Animal Farm’ always telling themselves “I will work harder.”” </p>

So the role of specialist family counsel, and of the specialist family solicitors who instruct them, is vital in ensuring that justice is done and that so far as possible miscarriages of justice are prevented. May there never be wanting an adequate supply of skilled and determined lawyers, barristers and solicitors, willing and able to undertake this vitally important work. There can be no higher call on the honour of the Bar than when one of its members is asked to act on behalf of a client facing the might of the State. The Bar, I am sure, will never fail in its obligation to stand between Crown and subject. And the same of course goes for the solicitors’ profession. But there is something profoundly distasteful when society, when Government, relies upon this as an excuse for doing nothing, trusting to the professions to do the right thing which the State is so conspicuously unwilling to do or to provide for. </p>
