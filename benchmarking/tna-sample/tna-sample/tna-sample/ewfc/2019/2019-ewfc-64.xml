A further 12,000 were considered but not disclosed, and some were served but not put in evidence.  Documentation essentially consumed the energies of two junior counsel for nine months and one junior counsel for some six months before that.  In addition, there were 67 Achieving Best Evidence interviews to consider.  Moreover, 150 electronic devices were seized, which yielded the equivalent of 800,000 pages of data.  As much of this was delivered late by the police, the instructed expert was going to struggle with time, so 41 external hard drives every week for nine weeks were purchased by the local authorities to ensure that parties received the relevant information as quickly as possible.

Charging decisions were expected in early 2019 and, of course, no one could offer any serious prediction as to when any criminal trial might in fact take place.  It was, accordingly, accepted on all sides that the care proceedings could not wait upon the criminal proceedings but, of course, the care proceedings were dependent on police disclosure of evidence.  In fact, the police did better than their then predictions.  The arrests and interviews took place in the early summer of 2018 and the Crown Prosecution Service made a decision not to charge in September 2018, a decision which was not challenged by the police.  Thus, disclosure was made rather earlier than had been feared.  The only qualification the police have made to the decision not to take proceedings is that they would wish to take stock of the matter after this trial, and no doubt to that end will want to see this judgment.

Considerable care had to be taken over disclosure, for whilst the test for disclosure was always relevance, there was a need for proportionality, and so the test of relevance was somewhat refined so that documents which were repeats of other documents but had come from different sources were not disclosed; if the information in the document was already available elsewhere, it was not disclosed; if it did not bear upon an issue relevant within the proceedings, it was not disclosed; and, wherever possible, private information was excluded from the documents.

Arrangements had been made to use a witness suite in the same building, which was made available for the whole three months of the trial.  It was a room which was sufficient for the witnesses, for those counsel asking questions and for the judge.

In fact, we endeavoured to explore that through Mr W, the electronics expert, but the plain fact was that he simply could not be heard throughout the whole courtroom, and, in fact, hearing witnesses was manifestly going to be a serious issue.  The result was that every respondent and intervenor, as I say, gave evidence from the witness suite.  It also had to be recognised that some witnesses had been so traumatised by all these events that they were unable to deal with certain parts of the evidence.  Mrs P, the foster carer, was unable really to look in detail at her own diaries and DC R found it extremely difficult to deal with the content of the ABE interviews, and it should be mentioned that she has been withdrawn from all such duties ever since.  This did, inevitably, result in some constraint on the range of cross-examination.  In the event, unusual though they were, I thought the arrangements worked reasonably and that everyone was able to hear the evidence they wanted to and needed to hear.  </p>

There was regular involvement of Social Services, SCC, throughout, and although there is no positive evidence of child sexual exploitation, there is evidence that inappropriate and pornographic materials may have been available, and there is evidence of disinhibited sexual behaviour, leading to the question as to what children might have seen.  The plain fact is that when these children were finally removed on 28 April 2009, they had suffered serious emotional and psychological damage, they were in a very poor physical condition, they had obvious learning deficits, in particular in relation to the twins, and they were almost entirely unsocialised, and a number of witnesses have used the word "feral" to describe their behaviour and condition.  They were removed to the paternal grandparents, but a few days later, on 1 May, the girls were placed with the maternal grandparents, AGF and AGM.  Of course, what happened to them in that home is highly controversial, but the broad overall time frame is not.

During the course of the holiday, something happened between AA and IB.  I am not invited to make any findings about it, but certain consequences are material to the main case.  IB and his parents were distraught over it and that persists until now.  Both parents were overcome by emotion when giving evidence about it.  It still has a significant impact on IB too.  As a result of it, AA became rather more isolated from the family.  She could not be present when IM or IB was there.  She could not go unsupervised into certain children's activities.  She spent time alone with AGF on some occasions and, of course, the police were involved.  There were formal interviews and an investigation, and it was not until ten months after their involvement, that a decision was taken on 14 June 2016 to take no criminal proceedings on the basis that they did not think that a sexual intent on the part of AA could be proved. </p>

I do not think it was inspired by sexual gratification other than to do something that involved a dominant role.  AA was first surprised by the reaction of others and then, I think, was ashamed of what she had done.

We rely heavily on oral evidence, especially from those who were present when the alleged events took place.  Day after day up and down the country, on issues large and small, judges are making up their minds whom to believe.  They are guided by many things, including the inherent probabilities, any contemporaneous documentation or records, any circumstantial evidence tending to support one account rather than the other, and their overall impression of the characters and motivations of the witnesses.  The task is a difficult one.  It must be performed without prejudice and preconceived ideas.  But it is a task which we are paid to perform to the best of our ability. </p>

She is a woman involved in a successful marriage with one child of similar age to AA, and she and her husband would have liked more.  She had had a career in human resources and was clearly a competent and responsible person.  She had some personal experience of child sexual exploitation, although the details of it were not investigated.  They lived, in short, a successful middle-class life in a large house.  They felt that they had something more to offer, and for that reason had explored fostering and had been accepted, and found themselves on the books of a private agency.  These three girls were their first, and in the events that have happened, their last placement.  During the course of this placement, she kept precise and detailed records, as befitted her professional background.  She sent her records to the agency, who regarded them as confidential and did not disclose them.  However, she kept a parallel record, which she disclosed to the police, and she was in very regular contact with</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.78in;margin-right:0.60in">It is important to note a number of matters about all this.  First, there is generally no record of the questions that she asked, although undoubtedly she did ask them.  The consequence of that is that it is difficult to work out what of what the girls were saying was truly spontaneous and what was elicited by question.  It is important, also, to have in mind AA's reaction to all this.  She was obviously acutely jealous of the attention that was being received by the twins, but she manifested an absolute determination to say nothing more than she wanted to say, and in due course she wanted to move placement for individual attention and made life sufficiently difficult for the family to ensure that that is just what she did.  She clearly thought that she was being coached to say more, and indeed after her move, she made no more extensive </p>

They had never felt so safe or so secure as they did in that foster home.  They had never had such individual attention before as they had in that foster home.  They had never been made to feel so important before as they were in that foster home.  They had never been so praised or encouraged before, something that AC in her oral evidence specifically acknowledged.  It follows that there was at least a serious risk of their taking the message that if they continued to make allegations, all these good things would continue, as indeed they did.

What had happened, in fact, was that the local authority had assumed that the investigation was now the responsibility of the police and had limited their role to providing emotional support to the foster carer, something that seems to have been abdicated by the fostering agency who had the first responsibility for doing that.  The police, meanwhile, concluded that the foster carer should be allowed to continue these conversations since the girls clearly had sufficient confidence to confide in her.  It may be that they gave some advice as to the official guidance in these investigations, but I also accept the foster carer's evidence that the police would often ask her for extra detail and she would revert to the girls to get it.  Moreover, these revelations had an increasingly oppressive effect on the foster carer, and I readily understand why she has described the effects of this placement on her and her family as she has, and I am not surprised at her reporting symptoms akin to post-traumatic stress disorder, or at her feeling unable to continue as a foster </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.78in;margin-right:0.60in">I want to revert to the question of guidance.  The effect of the police evidence was that it was only guidance, and that, of course, is true, paragraph 1(1) of the guidance says so, but the whole paragraph must be read and understood.  I found DI J's evidence helpful in understanding the approach of the interviewing officers.  She was a very experienced ABE interviewer, who advised and reviewed in this case.  She acknowledged that this was a very challenging enquiry, involving multiple allegations against multiple offenders by girls of lower functioning and capability.  In her view, the ABE process was designed for reasonably articulate people, and so here, as in other cases, they would have to depart from the guidance, even if that had implications for the integrity of the evidence and also because the best interests of the child always came first.  That was something echoed both in the evidence of the interviewing officers and of DI P, the officer in charge of the case.  The essence of what she was saying was that all the police can do is to get the best evidence that the child can give.  The court, inferentially, must make the best it can of what it has got.  I think that did indeed reflect the police approach to this case, even though the current guidance does allow for lower ability witnesses.  That did not seem to have been fully appreciated.  It was apparent from DI P's evidence that he readily accepted the CPS view that the evidence did not justify charging anyone.  I well understand why he might have taken that view.  That said, I do want to acknowledge the high level of co-operation and assistance afforded to the Family Court.  DI P personally </p>

She described an occasion where I think she had done something wrong in the park and, back in the house, she was engaged in a battle with her grandmother to get her pants down so that she could be smacked on her bare legs.  It was her descriptions of her feelings for her grandfather, her love of his attention and feeling as though she was being treated as his wife, and there was a part of her oral evidence where she dealt with pornography.  She had finished the day before distressed, the subject of pornography having just been raised.  She returned remarkably cheerfully the following day and cross-examination resumed.  Her first response was to deny that she knew what pornography was.  In the room we were in, I was actually sitting close to her.  My strong impression was that she caught my eye, but however it may have been, she immediately admitted using pornography and the evidence that followed was more relaxed and spontaneous, in my view, than had been seen the day before.  She also made the comment that she had watched porn: "It stopped me from thinking about </p>

I do not think it was a technique of evasion, but was a genuine failure to recall.  That, of course, can be a feature both of damaged children who use this to protect themselves from the past and also of those with significant intellectual deficiencies.  It was a feature noticed by both Mrs P and the police, and it may be important.  In those circumstances, I propose to approach her evidence with considerable caution.

Moreover, Ms H was clearly under the impression that they had accessed pornography whilst in the care of Mrs P.  There are conflicts of evidence about this.

Like every worthwhile art, it is, of course, underpinned by technique and science.  That is all that has been talked about in Parts XII and XIII of this judgment, but it does not stop there.  Reliability is and remains the lodestar of fact-finding, and that, as we have seen, is underpinned by techniques of investigation and the science of reasoning. </p>

So long as the judge remains alert to the dangers arising from unreliability and exercises the caution due to that, it may be possible to discern flashes of truth or incidents that have about them the ring of truth.  Where the judge meets that, and, having exercised all due caution, is convinced of it, then the court has not only the right but the duty to act upon it.

I also found compelling her account of why, having stopped after her initial complaint, AGF went back to touching her in a way she did not like.  She said that he simply could not help himself.  If that be true, it has other implications in this case.  None of these matters demonstrate that what AA is saying is true.  They are merely factors which must come into consideration in deciding whether or not I can rely on AA's evidence or indeed any part of it as being true.  Alongside that, I must consider the evidence of the grandparents.  As I have said, it is fundamentally defensive in character, advanced by a long series of denials.

There may properly be lots of physical contact with kisses and cuddles and it may properly be across genders.  Where lavish expressions of affection shade into sexual contact is not always easy to define, though the parties involved are likely to and certainly should know when that line is crossed.  Age will, of course, play a part.  Pubescence and adolescence often require greater physical restraint </p>

That conclusion is driven in large part by my conclusions that certain parts of AA's evidence have the ring of truth about it and they are found in what I have already said.  Principally amongst them are her accounts of punishment, her description of her relationship with AGF as a wife, her evidence about pornography and her explanation for AGF's behaviour, of which she complains.

At its worst, it involved lying on top of her with his dressing gown open but wearing boxer shorts, and then fondling and kissing parts of her body in what must have been obvious to him as a sexual manner.  This was the culmination of behaviour that was, of course, a transition from affectionate to sexual contact.

Crucially, the court should resist the temptation to condemnatory judgment made possible only with the inestimable benefit of hindsight.  That said, with the benefit of hindsight, I slightly regret giving the local authorities time for reflection in this trial.  It is not that the time was not properly used, I am sure it was, but it reasonably raised expectations that the local authorities were going to withdraw some of their cases.  I do not seek to criticise the local authorities for not doing so for the reasons I have given, but it did add to the already considerable emotional burdens on the respondents.

They are the ones most at risk of being exploited, sexually or otherwise.  It follows that every investigator should be and remain familiar, and should be required to do so, with the current guidance.  That was not the case here and it is something that should concern those responsible for safeguarding investigations in education, health, Social Services and the police.  Of course, guidance is only guidance and, of course, there are times when the needs of interviewees will have to take precedence, and, of course, all that can be obtained is the best evidence that the child or vulnerable person can give.

There was a continuing duty on the local authority to ensure that the girls' welfare was being properly addressed.  That is at its clearest in terms of the role ultimately given to the foster carer, who was given an investigative role that was not her responsibility nor should it have been asked of her.  I say nothing more about the details of that than has already been said, but the responsibility for that falls equally on the local authority and the police.  There should have been closer liaison at a more senior level than fieldworker and detective constable.  Working together is a concept both obvious and simple, but experience repeatedly shows that it is very difficult sometimes to deliver.

Because all the information came to light at different times over the middle and late summer of last year, protective proceedings were taken at different times.  In some cases, interim care orders were made whereas in some cases a voluntary protective framework was put in place which did not justify the making of an interim care order.   This is one of those cases in which it is very important that no inference is drawn from the fact that interim care orders were or were not made.

Although there have been very serious delays here, they would have been much more so had it not been for the co-operation which the families and their representatives have been able to give and it is a tribute to all that with the exception of the three young people who were the original complainants, there is no child in this case who is presently in foster care, but all are accommodated within their natural families. </p>

On a worst case scenario basis, the Local Authorities were asking the court to set aside 15 weeks in order to try the matter.  It will be understood that this was not an altogether straightforward matter in order to determine how this should work or who should try it.

It is right to say that these proceedings have raised very serious challenges for the police force involved.  Notwithstanding the fact that they have been actively investigating this matter since last summer, they made it clear to me in evidence in January of this year that they would not be in a position to make any arrests before the early summer and they would follow that up rapidly with interviews of those who were arrested.   They did not anticipate that any charging decisions would be made until early 2019 and thus, as a matter of inevitability, a trial as complex as this would be fortunate to get launched even in late 2019 at the earliest. </p>

The difficulty then was the accessibility of the evidence so far as the Family proceedings were concerned.   I wish to record that the investigating police force have been as helpful as they felt able to be, but the plain fact is that they object to any disclosure of the substantial material in this case to the parties until they have completed their programme of arrest and preliminary interview.   I recognise – and no one dissents from the view – that in the ordinary course of events that is an entirely reasonable stance for the police to take because, of course, any disclosure before then reveals their hand prior to arrest and provisional interview. </p>

There will, in all inevitability, be disclosure issues which the court may have to adjudicate upon in relation to the evidence.   The parties will inevitably want to reflect on the need to make Part 25 applications in respect of expert evidence and cannot, of course, do so until they have been in the position to identify the issues which directly concern their clients.    There will be a need for the collation of evidence as well.   There are issues relating to where and how a case of this magnitude can actually be accommodated and, of course, the issues are sufficiently grave that the principal participants in this matter may wish to instruct leading counsel, the Local Authorities having already done so. </p>

It is most unlikely there would not be other work to do but even if there were not, it seems to me that the court should take some responsibility itself for ensuring that timetables are indeed being adhered to.   It is comforting to observe that so far timetables have been observed and the court should, of course, acknowledge that the timetables for which the police contended on the last occasion are in danger not of being exceeded but of being foreshortened.

Where an action is being heard by a jury it is, of course, quite usual and often very convenient at the end of the case of the plaintiff or of the party having the onus of proof, as the defendant had here, for the opposing party to ask for the ruling of the judge whether there is any case to go to the jury, who are the only judges of fact.  But it seemed to be not unusual in the King's Bench division to ask for a similar ruling in actions tried by a judge alone.  We think, however, that this is highly inconvenient for the judge in such cases is also the judge of fact and we cannot think it right that the judge of fact should be asked to express any opinion on the evidence until the evidence is completed.  Certainly no one would ever dream of asking a jury at the end of a plaintiff's case to say what verdict they would be prepared to give if the defendant called no evidence, and we fail to see why a judge should be asked such a question in cases where he and not the jury is the judge that has to determine the facts.  In such cases, we venture to think that the responsibility for not calling rebutting evidence should be upon the other party's counsel and upon no one else." </p>

It may be dangerous to say never, but I can only conceive of a termination that rested on a concession from the applicant that that was inevitable or appropriate at the conclusion of the evidence.  So long as the applicant sails on into the gunfire, I think the judge has the obligation to hear the case out.  His obligation derives from his responsibilities to the child.

I think it is important to appreciate that Rule 29 does not confer on the local authority any new power at all.  What actually is happening is that Rule 29.4(2) is imposing a restriction of permission on a power which otherwise every claimant in civil proceedings has, namely, subject to the question of costs, to discontinue their claim as of right.  That right has been circumscribed by the requirement for permission.  It is in those circumstances entirely unsurprising that there is not a specific equivalent right in respondents to make any such application, but it does not mean that that right does not exist by another route.  Nor indeed is it remotely surprising that such applications are rarely made.  In the ordinary case, a submission of no case to answer is likely to meet with a firm and summary refusal; Mr Storey even suggested occasionally brutal treatment.  But be that as it may, that is undoubtedly the likely outcome, and where there is real merit in any such submission, the probabilities are that the local authority, with or without the encouragement of the judge, will apply to withdraw and the basis of withdrawal has become well established in a series of first instance </p>

If, on the other hand, I were to fail to make a finding when I should have made a finding, it would be to expose children immediately returned to that person's care to wholly unacceptable risk of abuse in the future.

Technically, of course, that could be enforced by committal proceedings, but the convention or practice of the court is not to do that, it is rather to draw an adverse inference from a failure to give evidence, that adverse inference being that the party has something to conceal which they are not willing to risk in those proceedings, and I have to say that, in my experience, both as the trial judge and as an occasional member of the Court of Appeal, I cannot recall any case in which a party has refused to give evidence and has not had an inference drawn against them.
