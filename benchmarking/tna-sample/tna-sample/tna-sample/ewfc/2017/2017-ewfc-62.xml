She would scream when she went into the toilet, she was not the compliant little girl she had been in the term before and she would often say ‘no’ she did not want to go home: this reluctance was mostly in respect of going to her father’s home but was, with the same reaction and behaviour, sometimes expressed in going to the home of her mother and maternal grandmother.

She did see the community mental health team in January 2017 who confirmed the diagnosis and referred her on to the wellbeing service. We have had no correspondence from that service so we do not know if she has ever been seen. Currently she is very anxious and did attend A+E at New Cross on 24/7/17 and was given a short course of diazepam. She was prescribed some amitriptyline 10mg at night for her anxiety back in June which she reports helps. Her prognosis remains uncertain as anxiety and depression can last for many years and be aggravated by stress full situations.

In his evidence he told me that he had not told the maternal grandmother that YQ had been in prison because he thought the mother would have done so.

ZK then paused for a very very long time, cleared his throat several times before venturing an answer to the question asked that he spoke to SD occasionally and that he knew TD and PD. These latter two are accused by CD in the criminal proceedings of organising and charging money for her serial sexual abuse by a considerable number of men including the father and YQ. It was plain and palpable that ZK was being very very evasive in his answers about the SD/CD family and especially in respect of SD and CD.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Y underwent two ABE interviews on 21 August 2015 and 25 April 2016. I watched extracts of the DVDs of these interviews as requested by counsel. Although it was often difficult to understand what Y was saying, her demeanour and body language was very striking and informative. At the first mention of her father, by way of example, the change in Y’s demeanour is dramatic. She had appeared relatively relaxed and comfortable in the interview room. When her father is mentioned she collapses back onto the sofa on which she is sitting, puts her hands over her face and immediately pulls her knees up to her face and wraps her arms around her legs: effectively wrapped into a tight ball. She remains in this position, not communicating with either the police officer or the intermediary, for a significant period of time. </p>

There are, I accept, inconsistencies in Y’s comments, disclosures and interviews. She has little or no concept of time. Such inconsistencies are hardly surprising in a child with severe learning disabilities who is speaking about events which occurred many months or even years ago. In her disclosures or comments made at nursery and school over a considerable period of time a consistent theme emerges. </p>

In the light of my other conclusions I do not ascribe so generous a view to this comment.
