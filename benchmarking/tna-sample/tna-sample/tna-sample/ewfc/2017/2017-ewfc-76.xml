	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In October 2008, XW and XH were married in Italy. They did not enter into a bespoke nuptial agreement, but at the wedding they signed a form, headed “<span style="font-style:italic">Atto di Matrimonio</span>” (which has been translated as meaning “deed of marriage”), stating that they had chosen the separation of goods regime under Italian law (“<span style="font-style:italic">separazione dei beni</span>”). Prior to the marriage, the parties had lived in England and they continued to do so throughout the marriage, although they also owned properties in other parts of the world. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The wife came from a very wealthy Asian family, and before and during the marriage her mother, who has established a series of family trusts, provided her with substantial financial support. The wife herself had trained as a doctor but subsequently worked as an artist. The husband is a successful businessman. At the date of the marriage, he was a man of considerable means, although the precise value of his assets at that point is a matter of dispute between the parties. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The couple have one child, AB, to whom they are both devoted. Sadly, AB has a rare, life-threatening condition and also has significant disabilities. The vast majority of his care is carried out or arranged by the wife, although the husband also plays an important role. There is no dispute between the parties that AB’s needs will be fully provided for in the years ahead.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">During the marriage, and in particular in a period of three or four years between 2011 and 2015, the company of which the husband was chief executive officer (“the company”) became hugely successful, substantially because of the enormous popularity of one product used by millions of people across the world. The value of the business increased dramatically and in 2016 it was sold. The husband’s own shareholding realised about $540m.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Unfortunately, in 2015, the marriage broke down and the parties separated. The wife filed a petition for divorce and an application for financial remedies. That claim has been pursued through to a full hearing before me earlier this year. The parties’ respective positions as set out in open offers are very far apart. The wife seeks, in effect, a half share of the increase in value of the husband’s shareholding in the company during the marriage, which she says should result in a lump sum payment to her of £235m. The husband says that she is not entitled to any part of the proceeds of sale of his shares because the <span style="font-style:italic">separazione dei bene</span> agreement amounted to a nuptial agreement to which the parties should be held by the court. In the alternative, he contends that the wife’s claim in respect of his shareholding in the company should be rejected, or at least very significantly reduced, for several reasons, in particular (1) because the increase in the value of the shares should be regarded as a unilateral, non-matrimonial asset; (2) because at the date of the marriage there was a latent potential in the company so that its true pre-marital value was higher than reflected in the formal valuation produced in these proceedings; and (3) because the increase in value of the shares during the marriage was attributable to his own special contribution. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The legal complexities in this case are on a scale not often encountered even in the field of so-called big money cases. Admittedly, and fortunately, the litigation has not involved an extended search for the assets. The location and extent of the assets is clear, save in some respects for the assets held in the wife’s family trusts, which, in any event, have only limited relevance to my decision. It is accepted that the wife’s interest in those trusts, whatever it is, does not amount to a matrimonial asset. The husband makes no claim on that interest, and only asserts that it is relevant when assessing the wife’s needs – this being, he argues, a needs case. But the legal arguments arising are complex and challenging, incorporating a number of controversial and difficult issues, including the identification and treatment of nuptial agreements, the distinction  between matrimonial and non-matrimonial (or “unilateral”) assets, the valuation of business assets and the treatment of “passive growth” and “latent potential”, and special contribution. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Fortunately, the parties and this court had the advantage of legal representation of the highest quality – Lucy Stone QC and Duncan Brooks, instructed by Stewarts Law, on behalf of the wife, and Martin Pointer QC and Rebecca Carew Pole, instructed by Sears Tooth, on behalf of the husband. I repeat what I said at the conclusion of the hearing – “the efforts which have been expended on  behalf of these parties are on any view exceptional, both the quality and the quantity of the work put in by all the lawyers has been outstanding”. But the complexities have been such that the preparation of this judgment has taken much longer than I would have hoped. I apologise to the parties for the delay. Although their means are such that neither of them has suffered financially as a result of the delay, I am conscious that each is anxious to get on with their lives. They will appreciate, however, that the law in this area remains in something of a state of flux, as illustrated by the sheer number of recent cases cited in the course of the hearing. Identifying and reconciling the principles in those cases, and applying them to the facts of this case, has not been straightforward.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In one of the 50+ cases cited to me (<span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Jones v Jones</span> [2011] EWCA Civ 41), Wilson LJ (as he then was), who is, of course, a pre-eminent authority in matrimonial finance law, respectfully criticised the lengthy first-instance judgment under consideration in the Court of Appeal, observing that he refused to accept that our modern principles of ancillary relief are as complex as the judgment implied. I am conscious that this judgment may be open to similar criticism. But I venture to suggest that, in the period of seven years since that case was heard, the law in this area has become even more complex, demonstrated by the significant differences of opinion amongst even specialist judges described below. In other areas of family law, it is possible to reduce the guiding principles derived from case law to a set of propositions which other judges can then apply. The fact that this has not occurred in matrimonial finance law means that there is an unacceptable level of uncertainty, to the great disadvantage of parties, practitioners and judges, which continues to drive the campaign for root and branch reform in this area of the law.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The wife, XW, was born in 1969 to a European father and an Asian  mother.  She has two sisters, Q and R.  In around 1980, when she was about ten years old, the family moved to Asia.  Subsequently her parents divorced.  The wife came to England for her A-levels and has lived here ever since, but remains close to her mother,  who lives in Asia. After school, the wife read for an arts degree at a British university but then decided to switch to medicine, attended medical school and qualified as a doctor in 2000. Shortly after qualifying, however, she gave up practice and started work as an artist. Initially, she had intended this to be only a temporary break from a medical career, but in the event she has not returned to medicine. She was able to do so because she was receiving substantial financial support from her mother. At one point in her evidence, the wife described herself before the marriage as “living the life of Riley”, supported by her mother.</p>

She describes herself in her statement filed in these proceedings as coming from “a large dynastic family which has, over the years, enjoyed industrial and financial success.” She has substantial wealth which for a number of years has been held in a series of trusts. The structure of those trusts, and the value of the assets held therein, were the subject of considerable investigation in the course of the proceedings. Amongst the family trusts is one, called the MHT, of which the wife is a discretionary beneficiary. The wife asserts that she has never received any payments from this trust, although it was clearly established in the course of the proceedings that she has received financial support from her mother  on occasions before, during and after the marriage. Whether any of the wife’s family assets, either those held in the MHT or elsewhere, are financial resources which the wife has or is likely to have in the foreseeable future, is an issue arising on this application.</p>

It is the wife’s case that the parties lived together in her flat from around the beginning of 2008.  The wife asserted in her statement that she and the husband never discussed their respective financial positions. She knew what his job was and that he owned a flat in Kensington. They became engaged in May 2008 and were married in  October 2008, in Italy.  The wedding ceremony was conducted entirely in Italian. The circumstances of the ceremony have been the subject of intense analysis in these proceedings for reasons set out below. At the ceremony, the parties signed a document in Italian headed “<span style="font-style:italic">Atto di Matrimonio</span>” (Deed of Marriage) which included a declaration that the parties had chosen the <span style="font-style:italic">separazione dei beni</span> regime.

It was obvious to me, seeing them in court, that they are deeply devoted to their son and anxious to do what they can to help him develop as much as possible. Perhaps inevitably, given the strongly adversarial nature of financial remedy litigation in general, and these proceedings in particular, the respective roles of the parents in the care of AB have become an issue which will require some analysis later in this judgment. In exercising my powers under s.24 of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973, I must of course give first consideration to AB’s welfare while he is a minor. I shall therefore say more about AB shortly.</p>

[W]hatever the division of labour chosen by the husband and wife, or forced upon them by circumstances, fairness requires that this should not prejudice or advantage either party when considering paragraph (f), relating to the parties’ contributions.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">“9. The starting point is surely not controversial. In the search for a fair outcome it is pertinent to have in mind that fairness generates obligations as well as rights. The financial provision made on divorce by one party for the other, still typically the wife, is not in the nature of largesse. It is not a case of ‘taking away’ from one party and ‘giving’ to the other property which ‘belongs’ to the former. The claimant is not a supplicant. Each party to a marriage is <span style="font-style:italic">entitled</span> to a <span style="font-style:italic">fair </span>share of the available property.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">11.

This ‘equal sharing’ principle derives from the basic concept of equality permeating a marriage as understood today. Marriage, it is often said, is a partnership of equals. …. The parties commit themselves to sharing their lives. They live and work together. When their partnership ends, each is entitled to an equal share of the assets of the partnership, unless there is a good reason to the contrary. Fairness requires no less. But I emphasise the qualifying phrase: ‘unless there is good reason to the contrary’. The yardstick of equality is to be applied as an aid, not a rule.”</p>

In this case, the husband says that the sharing principle does not apply because the parties’ act in executing a <span style="font-style:italic">separazione dei beni </span>in the course of their marriage ceremony in Italy amounts to a prenuptial agreement to which this court should now give effect.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly, in applying the sharing principle, a distinction is drawn between assets or property that can be classified as matrimonial as opposed to non-matrimonial. In this case, the husband, relying on case law, including the recent decision of the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Sharp v Sharp</span> [2017] EWCA Civ 408, [2017] 2 FLR 1095, asserts that the assets generated by his business activities in the company, both before and during the marriage, were generated by his efforts and, given the relatively short duration of the marriage, the fact that the wife did not work outside the home during the marriage, and her own substantial wealth, this is plainly a case in which she is not entitled to a share in the value of the company at all. In the alternative, he asserts that a true valuation of the business at the date of the marriage would include a significant uplift to reflect its latent potential realised during the marriage so that any increase in the value of his shares in the business generated during the marriage which might be subject to the sharing principle was consequentially reduced.  </p>

Both parties provided further evidence about this in statements filed subsequently in the proceedings and then in the oral evidence.

It is her case that, in the years leading up to and after AB’s diagnosis in September 2014, there have been literally hundreds of medical assessments and appointments, therapy sessions and meetings about his care and treatment. She attends all of his therapy sessions so that she can continue to practice what the therapist had been doing by bringing it into AB’s play and daily routines. She states that she is also constantly reviewing his therapies and looking out for new approaches and treatments in order to meet his evolving and unpredictable needs, whilst being careful not to “overtherapise” him. She says that her main focus is ensuring that AB feels safe and surrounded by love and support. At present she feels unable to leave him and as a result although she has friends that visit her at home, she does not go out in the evening.</p>

He describes AB as “a son with a genetic condition which has to be carefully monitored [who] is having various therapies to improve his condition. He is in no way a difficult boy – quite the reverse. He is very happy and tremendously enthusiastic. He loves his school, he is leading in most respects a normal life, doing normal things.” The husband says, and the wife acknowledges, that he plays a part in caring for AB. Although the parties have now separated, the husband, when he is in England, continues to visit AB every morning before school and accompanies them on the school run. In the evenings, he spends an hour or so with AB before he goes to bed. At weekends, the couple spend time together as a family for AB’s benefit. The family also continue to go on holiday. The husband maintains that AB benefits because he feels that he is in a very secure environment. So far as their son is concerned, the couple present a united front.</p>

In particular, Miss Stone in cross-examination sought to demonstrate that the husband had undervalued the wife’s contribution. Looking at his evidence overall, however, I do not consider that he has undervalued that contribution. In oral evidence he described her care of AB as “fantastic” and “amazing”. It is fair to say, however, that their respective contributions toward AB’s welfare have been very different, reflective of their different personalities.</p>

On the other hand, the fact that the parties have a child, and furthermore a child  with special needs, is a material factor when considering some of the arguments below, in particular the husband’s arguments as to unilateral assets and special contribution. </p>

The wife asserts that this is a discretionary trust and she is not beneficially entitled to any of the funds. The trust predated the marriage and therefore, on any view, it does not count as a matrimonial asset which could be subject to the sharing principle. The husband asserts, however, that it is a relevant factor in the case and I consider this issue further below.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Excluding his interest in the company, the husband’s assets prior to the marriage, including properties in London and Germany, and bank accounts, amounted to £3.8m. The husband’s shareholding in the company, and the manner in which it should be treated in these proceedings, is one of the major issues between the parties. On sale of the company in 2015, the husband received $540m, then worth approximately £370m. The proceeds were invested variously in a substantial property in London, trust funds overseas, various other investments and bank accounts, and the husband also received RSUs and stock options in the Parent Company, the company which purchased the company. Through currency fluctuations, the value of many of the assets acquired with the proceeds of sale has increased substantially and are now worth in the region of £500m. With regard to the RSUs and stock options, to which the wife’s representatives ascribe a value of approximately £14m, the husband says that the preponderance of the options are dependent upon his continued employment and performance-related bonuses which he asserts are unlikely to be paid. For that reason, he argues that they should be disregarded. With regard to the husband’s other investments, including the trusts, most of which are held offshore, he contends that he is likely to bring the majority of the funds back to this country where he intends to continue to live and work. As a result, he anticipates that he will incur significant sums by way of tax. He asserts that he is likely to bring back onshore funds to the value of £150m and therefore seeks to deduct a tax liability of £29m for the purposes of these proceedings. On behalf of the wife, however, it is submitted that it is unlikely that he will bring back funds of that magnitude. Instead, it is suggested that a more likely figure is in the region of £50m, giving rise to a tax liability of £10 million.</p>

Provision is made for the unlimited application of the Trust Fund if the Settlor becomes incapacitated.  Paragraph 3.4 of the Memorandum<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>continues by providing that, subject to those provisions, “the Trustee should consider holding and distributing the trust fund as to both income and capital for the benefit of [the wife] as the Settlor may suggest” and, “in the event of the Settlor’s incapacity and after her death, then as follows, but subject to [the wife’s] wishes, taxation considerations and other criteria set out, as long as they are not to the Settlor’s detriment: up to 50% of the income and capital of the trust upon [the wife] attaining the age of 50; the remaining balance … upon [the wife] attaining the age of 60; other than the above, such reasonable amounts from time to time if [the wife] was able to make a good case to you of a worthwhile acquisition; and respect [the wife’s] wishes if she expresses a wish to you that all or some of the Trust Fund should not be distributed at the ages specified above or at all and how she would like her issue to benefit.” The Memorandum goes on to record the Settlor’s further wishes in the event of the wife dying before the whole of the Trust Fund is distributed. Paragraph 3.12 of the Memorandum adds, however, that “notwithstanding the Settlor’s wishes on distribution at specified age of the relevant beneficiary set out therein, the Trustee should also take into account the following in making distributions to [the wife] and her children or remote issue, amongst any other concerns that you may have: (i) that the Trust Fund of the Trust should be kept in trust to avoid at all possible from being subject to financial settlement in the hands of a beneficiary who is or may potentially be involved in a matrimonial dispute and the relevant beneficiary should be consulted on this ….”</p>

In her statement, she said that she wanted to support them until they became financially independent, providing they were working hard and doing something worthwhile. To that end, in the eight years prior to the parties’ marriage (2000 to 2008), she gave the wife a total of £964,982 and, in addition, purchased a flat in Knightsbridge for her. In the eight years after the marriage, she gave the wife a total of £389,958, and also funded the purchase, renovation and refurbishment of a substantial property in Bayswater for the parties. Between November 2013 and October 2014, she also paid £485,000 for repairs and renovation work on the Knightsbridge property.</p>

It is only relevant to the extent that the trustees would be likely to advance money to W if she were to ask.  The expression of wishes is dated 6 April 2011, when the marriage was happy.  It provides that the trustees should treat the wife's mother as the principal beneficiary until her death.  Thereafter the wife will receive up to 50% aged 50 and the remainder aged 60 (with the trustees to give effect to any request by the wife for her share to be passed down).  Miss Stone and Mr. Brooks observe that the trustees appear to have honoured those wishes thus far and submit that there is no reason for the court to suspect that W will be in a better position now. They further submit that the fact that the wife’s mother has substantial assets of her own is of no relevance. She is under no obligation to support her daughter, and the possibility that the wife may inherit money from her mother at some point is no more than a <span style="font-style:italic">spes successionis</span> and should not be taken into account by this court: <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Michael v Michael</span> [1986] 2 FLR 389.</p>

It is their case that the wife has been less than frank about her share of family wealth, and that the wife’s mother, far from being open and frank in her approach to disclosure, was a financial sophisticate and a “wily manipulator” whose evidence was designed to be unhelpful. It is the husband’s case that the payments to the wife from her mother which have been made regularly over the last 16 years amount to an “allowance”, and that the wife and her mother have failed to provide a full explanation of the connection between the earlier trusts and the birthstone trusts, or why the wife was excluded from receiving funds from the earlier trusts when they were wound up. They contend that there is a clear correlation between the withdrawals from the MHT between 2011 and 2016 and the payments by the wife’s mother to the wife during the same period.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The MHT is a discretionary trust but the court must, in my judgment, look behind the legal structure to find the realities. The realities here are plain and obvious. The wife’s mother is a woman of very considerable wealth. She has supported all of her children very substantially throughout their lives and continues to do so. For many years, before and during the marriage, she paid substantial sums of money to the wife. In my judgment, the MHT is plainly for the wife’s benefit. Although the wife’s mother is named as the primary beneficiary, the terms of the trust only require the trustee to benefit her to the extent that she requires money from the trust funds, but always with a view to the long-term aim that the trust is intended as a trust for the benefit of the wife and her issue. Having regard to the wife’s mother’s evidence, and her own very substantial wealth, I consider it highly unlikely that she will require money from the trust fund. I therefore conclude that there is a very strong probability that the wife will benefit from the trust fund in its entirety. In terms of s.25(2)(a), it is a resource that she is “likely to have in the foreseeable future”. </p>

If an ante-nuptial agreement deals with those matters in a way that the court might adopt absent such an agreement, there is no problem about giving effect to the agreement. The problem arises where the agreement makes provisions that conflict with what the court would otherwise consider to be the requirements of fairness. The fact of the agreement is capable of altering what is fair. It is an important factor to be weighed in the balance. We would advance the following proposition, to be applied in the case of both ante- and post-nuptial agreements ….</p>

None of this is to suggest that evidence of foreign law will be necessary in a foreign case.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">“Where the ante-nuptial agreement attempts to address the contingencies, unknown and often unforeseen, of the couple’s future relationship there is more scope for what happens to them over the years to make it unfair to hold them to their agreement.

Of the three strands identified in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">White</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Miller</span>, it is the first two, needs and compensation, which can most readily render it unfair to hold the parties to an ante-nuptial agreement. The parties are unlikely to have intended that their ante-nuptial agreement should result, in the event of the marriage breaking up, in one partner being left in a predicament of real need, while the other enjoys a sufficiency or more, as such a result is likely to render it unfair to hold the parties to their agreement. Equally, if the devotion of one partner to looking after the family and the home has left the other free to accumulate wealth, it is likely to be unfair to hold the parties to an agreement that entitles the latter to retain all that he or she has earned.</p>

In that case, Moor J found that there was no dispute that the agreement was entered into by both parties freely and with full understanding of its implications (paragraph 45). The agreement had been witnessed by two notaries, although no formal advice was given by either of them, and there had been no formal disclosure. On the facts of that case, Moor J, applying <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Radmacher</span>, rejected all the arguments put forward that it would not be fair to uphold the agreement in so far as it excluded sharing.

Mostyn J received detailed evidence as to Catalan law to the effect that, on divorce, a court in that jurisdiction may depart from the default position where it would be unjust to implement it, which, as the judge observed, had a “ring of familiarity to an English family lawyer”. On the facts of that case, Mostyn J rejected the husband’s argument that there was a mutual intention that on divorce the parties would be bound by the separation of property regime.

She says that he told her that most people opt to keep things separate as it was the easiest and he suggested that they should do this too. She said that she agreed. She added: “it was the briefest of conversations. It did not seem important at the time either to me or, I thought, to XH.” She states that the husband did not explain to her the effect of choosing to keep assets separate. He did not explain which assets would be covered, nor did he disclose all the assets that he had. She was under the impression that it meant that her flat would continue to belong to her and that he would keep his properties. She added: “I did not think, and certainly did not know, that it would apply to assets acquired during the marriage or that it would have any relevance if there was a divorce. The prospect of divorce, in the happy days of planning our marriage, did not ever enter my mind.

The wife’s evidence was that, although it would not have been her choice, she agreed as she knew it would make the husband and his father happy. In June 2008, the parties went to Italy  for the first of several visits looking at possible venues for the wedding and reception. After visiting a number of churches, they settled on a church (“the Church”). They met the resident priest, Father G. He spoke no English and, in every conversation he had with the couple, the husband had to translate for the wife. The wife has an O-level in Italian but says that she speaks very little of the language. Prior to meeting the husband, she says that she was able to recall a few polite phrases and “could navigate my way round a menu in an Italian restaurant.” After starting a relationship with the husband, whenever she met his parents, who could speak no English, she was dependent upon the husband to translate.</p>

It is her evidence that Father G was there on most of their visits and that other than exchanging the briefest greetings, she was unable to speak to him either in Italian or English.

	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">“The first time we discussed the separation of goods was three or four months before the wedding in the early summer of 2008 in XW’s  flat …. I remember it was in fact in the drawing room and it was not a short conversation. I remember the moment well since I was very anxious. It was an important matter for me that I could show XW and her mother that I was not marrying for the purpose of entering into a wealthy family. I wanted the separation of goods regime, where XW’s assets were to be kept separate from mine, to ensure that XW and her family always kept their own wealth and I would not be part of it. Equally I wanted to keep separate from her assets any future wealth which I created from my own shareholding in the company (which I had worked so hard to build up), albeit I never anticipated that it would be anything compared to the wealth of XW and her family. I had been preparing this conversation for some time beforehand. I had discussed the question of separation of goods with my father who had introduced me to a lawyer, Mrs C, with whom I had had two phone calls, one shortly before my meeting with XW . I repeated to XW what she had advised, namely that there were two regimes under Italian law, community and separation of goods. The community of goods was the default regime whereby each party owned what they had before the marriage but after the marriage or assets thereafter acquired would be owned jointly. In the separation of goods regime, the assets of each party would always be kept separate, and each party kept their own assets not just before the marriage but thereafter and they would always be kept separate. In the early summer of 2008 in XW’s flat in London, I explained to XW the difference between the two regimes as I had written down from my previous discussion with Mrs C, and that I wanted, for both our sakes, the separation of goods regime. At the end of my explanation I told XW the way it works is very simple: both before and after the wedding, what is hers always stays hers and what is mine always stays mine. I also told her that despite the community of goods being the default regime many couples would choose separation of goods. She said she fully understood and was in agreement with this and it was the right choice. Therefore there was no need to have any further discussion with XW directly on this topic, nor did XW raise any question nor ask to have further information on this matter. XW was always very focused on detail and she always researched every aspect of the ceremony. Thus I was sure she had understood and was in full agreement with the choice. There was no need for doubt about this.”</p>

In particular, it is the husband’s case that Father G specifically required them to attend a meeting on 11 October 2008 in order to explain the procedure under Italian law, ensure that all relevant documents were prepared, and to ascertain the intention of each of the parties about the choice of the matrimonial regime. During the meeting, Father G explained the difference between community of property and separation of goods, and the husband translated what he was saying. It is the husband’s case that during the discussion the priest pointed out that, if they chose separation of goods, what each owned before and acquired during the marriage would remain that person’s property even if they separated. In his statement, the husband further asserted that following this explanation, he and the wife stated that they had elected the separation of goods regime and the priest then wrote the word “Si” on the agreement.</p>

It is the husband’s case that, although the wedding was conducted in Italian, the wife understood what was going on; that he translated to her what they were signing, including the confirmation of the separation of goods; that both parties confirmed that they had chosen that regime, and signed the marriage document twice in the presence of the witnesses.</p>

On this point, the wife asserts that there was no set “regime” or arrangement. It is her case that, during the period of their cohabitation prior to the wedding, and during the marriage, the household expenditure fell into a spontaneous pattern with which both of them were comfortable and about which they never needed to have any discussion.</p>

He described his general practice of compiling the marriage document in a meeting with the couple before the ceremony. He explained that it is a requirement that he sees the couple and goes through the details. In his statement he said it was “also very important I write down the choice of patrimonial regime. That is to say under which regime they wish to marry….Under Italian law spouses have to decide at the time of marriage if they want a community of goods for ownership to be shared from the day of the marriage or separation of property arrangement under which each spouse always maintains exclusive ownership of all property owned before and after marriage is celebrated and which remains the same if the parties separate …. I have to be absolutely sure that each future spouse understood what I said during these meetings, including about the patrimonial regime. If both future spouses are Italian there is no problem, but if one party is not I have to ensure that the non-speaking Italian future spouse fully understands what I am saying because he or she must confirm to me that they have understood. If I am not satisfied, if the parties cannot agree, or if they choose the community of goods regime, I leave the space blank.” Although he has celebrated many weddings with foreigners, Father G stated that he has never used an interpreter, because he makes it clear that there must be a friend or family member who can translate what he says.</p>

I was also invited to view a number of video clips showing events leading up to the ceremony and parts of the ceremony itself. Ultimately, however, I did not find any of this evidence particularly enlightening on the issue. Neither of the wife’s witnesses speak Italian and neither noted anything of relevance to the issue of the <span style="font-style:italic">separazione dei beni</span>. Both of them assert that they are confident that, if the wife was aware of the importance of the election of a property regime, she would have raised it with them. One of the husband’s witnesses, the best man, does not speak Italian, although his evidence was that the husband was speaking to the wife during the ceremony and it seemed obvious that he was translating what was being said. In oral evidence, the best man spoke of a short conversation he had with the husband the night before the wedding as to what would happen during the ceremony, during which the husband referred briefly to the separation of goods agreement. The husband’s second witness is Italian and has attended a number of Italian weddings in church. In his statement, he said that he heard the Celebrant  reading out the articles of the Italian Civil Code and referring to the separation of goods regime. The witness saw the husband speaking to the wife but could not hear what he was saying. In one of the video clips, it is plain, as was pointed out in cross examination, that the husband’s two witnesses were talking to each other at one point in the ceremony when documents were being signed by the parties. The video clips do show the husband talking to the wife during the ceremony but I was unable to discern exactly what he was saying.</p>

Nick Jacob suggested that I look into it further to make sure that my understanding was correct. I therefore arranged for a translation.

They agreed that, when celebrating a marriage in church, a priest in Italy is a public official who is required to perform various civil functions. They also agreed that the <span style="font-style:italic">atto di matrimonio</span> is a public deed and is fully valid provided that the act of marriage is registered in the state civil registry and the banns of marriage have been previously published at the municipal office. They further agree that the marriage remains fully valid and effective unless and until a claim for forgery (“querela di falso”) is established in the Italian courts. They disagree about three principal issues: (1) the extent to which a priest while celebrating a marriage is subject to the obligations imposed by the civil code; (2) whether a priest celebrating the marriage is obliged to arrange for an interpreter to translate all or part of the proceedings to a non-Italian speaking party and, if so, the consequences if no interpreter is present; (3) whether the election of the <span style="font-style:italic">separazione dei beni </span>regime amounted to an implied agreement that the property relations between the spouses are to be governed by Italian law.

Avv Mele identified what she described as a crucial distinction between a priest celebrating a marriage in church and an <span style="font-style:italic">ufficiale dello stato civile</span> celebrating a civil marriage (roughly the equivalent of a registrar in a registry office in this jurisdiction). Although the priest acts as a public official, it was Avv Mele’s opinion that he does not fulfil the functions, nor have all the obligations, of the <span style="font-style:italic">ufficiale dello stato civile</span>. In the case of a civil marriage conducted by that official, the law as set out above requires the presence of an interpreter, or the use of some other method, where one of the spouses does not speak Italian. It was Avv Mele’s evidence that no such requirement was imposed on a priest. Avv Russo agreed with Avv Mele, but Avv Ceschini demurred. In her opinion, the priest is acting as a public official when celebrating a Concordat marriage and, as such, is required to comply with all the same formal requirements, including requiring an interpreter where one or both of the parties does not speak Italian. </p>

She supported her interpretation by reference to the terms of the declaration stamped on the <span style="font-style:italic">atto</span> - in translation, “we choose the regime of separation of assets pursuant to article 162, paragraph 2 of the Civil Code.” In Avv Mele’s view, the fact that the declaration was expressed as an election of separation of goods under the Italian code, rather than separation of goods generally, indicated an implied choice of Italian law.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Avv Ceschini disagreed. It was her opinion that the election of a marital property regime and the choice of law were different and had to be done separately. When there is an election of marital property regime with no choice of law, the applicable law is determined by the Italian conflicts law set out in Articles 29 and 30 of Law 218/95. As she observed in cross-examination by Mr Pointer, “the election of the marital regime and the choice of law is to be done separately and, if it is not done, it is determined by the law not by implication.” It was her opinion that the phrase “pursuant to Article 162, paragraph 2 of the Civil Code” in the declaration stamped on the <span style="font-style:italic">atto</span> indicated that the declaration was being made in a manner permitted by that paragraph (“the choice of a system of separation of property can be declared also in the record of celebration of the marriage”) and did not indicate anything about the choice of law. </p>

It was his opinion that the reference in the declaration stamped on the <span style="font-style:italic">atto</span> “cannot imply anything else than the choice of Italian law as the governing law of the patrimonial relationship. It is not a reference to an unspecified separation of assets. It is making - they are making - reference to a typical separation of assets envisaged by our Civil Code”. He acknowledged that there was no precedent to assist in this interpretation but considered his opinion to be “consistent with the good-faith interpretation of the statement of the parties and in contract”. When I suggested to him that the wording on the declaration stamped on the <span style="font-style:italic">atto</span> might refer to the formality rather than the substance of the agreement, he replied that he thought it referred to both.</p>

Avv Mele stated that “just to be as sure as possible - I mean that the choice of law and the choice of the separation of assets regime would be binding for the marriage, I will probably advise him to draft an agreement … before a Notary Public in which they both chose the Italian law and, within the Italian law, the separation of assets agreement.” She further agreed that, to be more confident, she would probably also ask for the opinion of an English lawyer as to whether the agreement would be binding if the parties were subsequently to get divorced in England. Avv Ceschini stated that, if an Italian client was marrying a non-Italian under a separation of goods regime and wanted to be certain that it would bind him and his fiancée if they subsequently divorced in England, she would advise him to consult an English lawyer and arrange for an English pre-nuptial agreement to be drafted. Avv Russo also responded that he would possibly advise the client to consult an English lawyer “to know exactly how an even valid choice of Italian law and separation of assets is considered and treated in English courts”.</p>

They rely on three principal submissions: (1) Italian law provides that the parties’ property regime is governed by English law. There is nothing in the regime that refers to or restricts claims in English law on divorce. Therefore the regime itself does not have the effect for which the husband contends, even in Italian law. (2) The wife had no appreciation of the implications of the regime. Almost every conceivable safeguard required of an English pre-nuptial agreement was absent. (3) The effect for which the husband contends, namely that he would keep the entirety of the proceeds of his company shares because of this agreement, falls foul of the fairness test set out at paragraph 80 of <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Radmacher</span>. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">All three Italian law experts agreed that under article 29(2) of Law 218/95, the default position is that the parties’ personal relations are governed by English law because England is the place where they have resided during the majority of their marriage, and that under article 30(1) their property relations are also governed by English law unless they have agreed in writing that those relations are governed by the law of another state of which one of the parties is a national. In this case, there was no express agreement or election providing that the parties’ property relations were governed by Italian law. The husband relies on the stamp on the deed of marriage that the parties “choose the regime of separation of assets pursuant to Art. 162 paragraph 2 of the civil code”. Article 162 is headed “form of marriage agreements” and paragraph 2 provides: “The choice of a system of separation of property can be declared also in the regular celebration of the marriage”.  Miss Stone and Mr Brooks invite the court to accept Avv Ceschini’s construction of the Italian statutory provisions, namely that an election of applicable law must be express and in writing and is separate from, and additional to, an election of separation of goods. They therefore contended that, both as a matter of English law and construction of Italian law, the election of separation of goods regime cannot be said to restrict the wife’s claim on divorce.</p>

Her lack of credibility undermines all of the evidence as to the extent of understanding of the implications of the agreement.</p>

The fact that the deed was only signed at the wedding is irrelevant because the wife agreed to a separation of goods regime in the conversation in her flat some four months earlier and, it is submitted, was provided with a full explanation of its meaning during the conversation with Father G. The fact that the agreement was in Italian was irrelevant because the relevant earlier conversations were conducted in whole or in part in English. The husband’s failure to tell the wife that he had taken legal advice is also irrelevant because it would have made no difference if he had told her. The fact that the wife herself did not seek legal advice is not a matter to which the court should attach significant weight. The wife is an intelligent and highly educated woman who had plenty of opportunity between June and October to seek legal advice if she had wanted. Furthermore, there is no reason to believe that, had she done so, the outcome would have been any different. </p>

One example relied on by his counsel is the fact that property was transferred by the wife’s mother from her family trust into the wife’s sole name. Mr Pointer and Mrs Carew Pole submit that the wife’s mother’s evidence that she did not fully read the translation of the marriage certificate was patently false. They invite the court to infer that she had the document translated in order to reassure herself that there was an effective agreement in place. The agreement was entirely consistent with the wife's mother’s policy of drafting settlements so as to include her daughters’ spouses only so long as they remained married to them. It is their case that the wife and her mother both knew perfectly well what the marriage contact contained.

On this point, I accept the opinion evidence of Avv Ceschini. The phrase “pursuant to Article 162, paragraph 2, of the Civil Code” contained in the declaration stamped on the <span style="font-style:italic">atto</span> is simply an indication that the parties are declaring their choice of a system of separation of property in the record of the celebration of the marriage as permitted by Article 162, paragraph 2. Article 162, set out above, is headed “Form of marriage agreements” and contains a series of formalities required in order to ensure the validity of the agreement. I see no basis on which it can be said that the reference to Article 162, paragraph 2 in the <span style="font-style:italic">atto</span> indicates that the parties were choosing Italian law as the law governing their property relations. In the absence of an express declaration, the default position established by Articles 29 and 30 of Law 218/95 applies. I am fortified in my conclusion that Avv Ceschini’s interpretation is correct by the subsequent change in the form of the <span style="font-style:italic">atto</span> (which all the experts agree did not involve any change in the law), and by the rationale for the change explained in the Italian government circular quoted above. It would have been unnecessary to change the template “to allow those intending to marry the possibility of indicating, at the time of marriage, the foreign law applicable to their property relations” if the choice of law was implied by the election of the <span style="font-style:italic">separazione dei beni</span> regime. </p>

It is also notable that all three of the Italian legal experts stated that, were they to be asked to advise an Italian client who was proposing to marry a non-Italian under a separation of goods regime as to whether that regime would bind him and his fiancée if they later divorced in England, they would advise the client to consult an English lawyer.

In the very small number of cases where they might make a difference, of which <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Miller</span> may be one, the answer is the same as given in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">White</span> in connection with premarital property, inheritance and gifts. The source of the assets may be taken into account but its importance will diminish over time. Put the other way round, the court is expressly required to take into account the duration of the marriage: section 25(2)(d). If the assets are not ‘family assets’, or not generated by the joint efforts of the parties, then the duration of the marriage may well justify a departure from the yardstick of equality of division. As we are talking here of a departure from that yardstick, I would prefer to put this in terms of a reduction to reflect the period of time over which the domestic contribution has or will continue ….</p>

This is simply to recognise that in a matrimonial property regime which still starts with the premise of separate property, there is still some scope for one party to acquire and retain separate property which is not automatically to be shared equally between them. The nature and the source of the property and the way the couple have run their lives may be taken into account in deciding how it should be shared. There may be other examples. Take, for example, a genuine dual career family where each party has worked throughout the marriage and certain assets have been pooled for the benefit of the family but others have not. There may be no relationship-generated needs or other disadvantages for which compensation is warranted. We can assume that the family assets, in the sense discussed earlier, should be divided equally. But it might well be fair to leave undisturbed whatever additional surplus each has accumulated during his or her working life. However, one should be careful not take this approach too far. What seems fair and sensible at the outset of a relationship may seem much less fair and sensible when it ends. And there could well be a sense of injustice if a dual career spouse who has worked outside as well as inside the home throughout the marriage ended up less well off the one who had only or mainly worked inside the home.”</p>

They purchased two properties for a combined price of just over £3m. During the marriage, they contributed equally to the household expenses. At first instance, Sir Peter Singer, sitting as a judge of the High Court, awarded the husband 50% of the total matrimonial assets, amounting to £2.75m. The Court of Appeal allowed the wife’s appeal, set aside the order and awarded the husband £2m, or 36%.</p>

As demonstrated by the extracts from the citations above, one point on which the two principal speeches in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Miller</span> differed was whether or not the court should make a distinction between “family assets” and “business or investment assets”. Lord Nicholls was of the view that the court should be “exceedingly slow to do so” (paragraph 20). In contrast, Baroness Hale and the majority adopted a more flexible approach taking account of “the nature and the source of the property and the way the couple have run their lives” (paragraph 153). </p>

This was also the ratio of Baroness Hale’s decision on the facts of <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Miller</span> ….

The distinction between the treatment of short marriages in paragraph 152 and the (<span style="font-style:italic">obiter</span>) discussion about dual career marriages in paragraph 153 in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Miller</span> was recognised by this court in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Charman</span> at paragraph 83 and that distinction is carried forward in paragraphs 85 and 86. At paragraph 85 the court addresses the issue of short marriages and accepts the majority view expressed by Baroness Hale at paragraph 152 of <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Miller</span>, while at paragraph 86 they address the <span style="font-style:italic">obiter</span> example of dual career marriages. It was clearly unnecessary for them to do so, because <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Charman</span> was not a dual career marriage. What is said at paragraph 86 is therefore <span style="font-style:italic">obiter</span> comment on Baroness Hale’s <span style="font-style:italic">obiter</span> comment on dual career marriages. The court appears to have been concerned that recognition of unilateral assets as falling outside the sharing principle in a <span style="font-style:italic">long</span> (or more than short) marriage could well produce an unfair result. For that reason, they wanted the notion of different treatment of unilateral assets in such marriages to be ‘closely confined’. Baroness Hale had herself recognised the need for care and limitation in the last three sentences of paragraph 153. That issue, which does not arise on the facts of the present case, remains a matter for debate on another day. On that analysis of the key passages in the judgment in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Charman</span>, there is no impediment, in terms of possible conflict, for this court now to contemplate a departure from the equal sharing principle in the case of a dual career marriage which was short, and where the couple had kept their finances separate.”</p>

With regard to the way in which the couple have run their lives, they point out that the wife has devoted her life to the day-to-day care of AB, and managing his therapeutic needs. As a result, the husband has been able to work demanding hours and generate substantial wealth. With regard to Baroness Hale’s preferred characterisation (at paragraph 152) of how the duration of the marriage may justify a departure from the yardstick of equality - namely “in terms of a reduction to reflect the period of time over which the domestic contribution has or will continue” – Miss Stone and Mr Brooks submit that there is no basis for the court to allow any reduction of the wife’s share because by the time AB is independent she will have made a substantial domestic contribution for a long period.</p>

In that case, the parties were married for just under ten years. At the date of the marriage, the husband was the sole owner of a company which he had started some ten years earlier. At the date of the separation, the company was worth about £12m. After the breakdown of the marriage, however, where the proceedings for ancillary relief were underway, the husband sold the company and the net proceeds of sale in his hands amounted to £25m. That figure amounted to the net assets of the parties at the date of the hearing at first instance.</p>

First, as a matter of principle, when valuing the non-matrimonial assets at the end of a marriage, the court should so far as it can look at what has actually happened and not at what might have happened. In parenthesis, I would add that, because of this principle of ‘reality’, I would reject the graphs provided by Miss Stone seeking to establish the values of the company at certain dates based on an artificial assumption of a straightline growth up to eventual sale. Secondly, if only passive growth is taken into account, the law rewards the spouse who buries her non-matrimonial assets in the ground rather than the spouse who actively manages them. The correct analysis in my judgment, in circumstances of the present, is that, where a spouse has a non-matrimonial asset of the present kind, he is entitled to that element of the company at the end of the day which can fairly be taken to represent the fruits of the non-matrimonial assets that accrue during the marriage, even if the fruits are the product of activity by him or on his own behalf.”</p>

Moreover, it is a construct which is not always capable of clear identification.  An asset can, of course, be entirely the former, as in many cases, or entirely the latter, ….  However, it is also worth repeating that an asset can be comprise both, in the sense that it can be partly the product, or reflective, of marital endeavour and partly the product, or reflective, of a source external to the marriage.  ….  When property is a combination, it can be artificial even to seek to identify a sharp division because the weight to be given to each type of contribution will not be susceptible of clear reflection in the asset’s value.

Investigation can be “extremely expensive and of doubtful utility”.  The costs involved can quickly become disproportionate.

First, “a case management decision will need to be made as to whether, and if so what, proportionate factual investigation is required” (paragraph 89). Secondly, “the court will need to make such factual decisions as the evidence enables it to make” (paragraph 91). At that point, the court “may decide that the non-marital contribution is not sufficiently material or bears insufficient weight to justify a finding that any property is non-matrimonial” (paragraph 92). Alternatively, “if the evidence establishes a clear dividing line between matrimonial and non-matrimonial property, the court will obviously apply that differentiation to the next, discretionary stage” (paragraph 93). Where, however, “there is a complicated continuum, it would be neither proportionate nor feasible to seek to determine a clear line …. In those circumstances the court will undertake a broad evidential assessment and leave the specific determination of how the parties’ wealth should be divided to the next stage” (paragraph 94). The third and final stage of the process “is when the court undertakes the s.25 discretionary exercise” (paragraph 95). Importantly, Moylan LJ added that:</p>

At the date of the hearing, the company was worth over £2 billion and the spouses’ assets totalled £219m, including investment properties purchased with funds from the sale of the business. It was contended on behalf of the wife that all the assets constituted matrimonial property and she applied for an equal division. The husband, on the other hand, argued that the total value of his shareholding should be regarded as non-matrimonial property. Holman J awarded the wife a total of just under £70 million.

To fail to give due weight to initial flat years before the J curve takes off would be unfair to the wealth creator and bestow disproportionate reward upon the claimant, because it would ignore the true value of the endeavour made by one party entirely outside the marriage partnership and, in this case, for years before the parties met. Mr. Pointer and Mrs Carew Pole submit that this is particularly germane in a case where the husband’s wealth has been generated over such a relatively short period of time. They therefore argue that, if the court declines to uphold the <span style="font-style:italic">separazione dei beni</span> as a binding agreement,  the latent potential in the company at the date of the marriage should be reflected by adopting either the approach of Holman J in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Robertson</span> (thereby treating 50% of the value of the business at the date of sale as having been created prior to the marriage) or the approach of Mostyn J in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">WM v HM</span> (thereby excluding the proportion of value in the business that was created before the marriage on a linear apportionment basis, which in this case they calculate to be 46.6%). </p>

Having now heard submissions, both full and reasoned, against the concept of special contribution, save in the most exceptional and limited circumstances, the danger of gender discrimination resulting from a finding of special financial contribution is plain. If all that is regarded is the scale of the breadwinner’s success, the discrimination is almost bound to follow since there is no equal opportunity for the homemaker to demonstrate the scale of her comparable success. Examples cited of the mother who cares for a handicapped child seem to me both theoretical and distasteful. Such sacrifices and achievements are the product of love and commitment and are not to be counted in cash. The more driven the breadwinner the less available will he be physically and emotionally both as a husband and a father. There is also some justification in Mr Mostyn’s emphasis on the extent to which the homemaker frequently sacrifices her potential to generate assets by undertaking the domestic commitment to husband and children.

Nevertheless in practice, and for a self-evident reason, the claim to have made a special contribution seems so far to have arisen only in cases of substantial wealth generated by a party’s success in business during the marriage. The self-evident reason is that in such cases there is substantial property over the distribution of which it is worthwhile to argue. In such cases can the amount of the wealth alone make the contribution special? Or must the focus always be upon the manner of its generation?”</p>

Often, however, he or she will need independently to establish such a quality, whether by genius in business or some other field. Sometimes, by contrast, it will immediately be obvious that substantial wealth generated during the marriage is a windfall – the proceeds, for example, of an unanticipated sale of land for development or of an embattled take-over of a party’s ailing company – which is not the product of a special contribution.”</p>

The greater concern, however, is the obverse risk that it might encourage a court to discern special contribution in the generation of wealth above the threshold in circumstances in which it should not properly do so.

We find it hard to conceive that, where such a special contribution is established, the percentages of division of matrimonial property should be nearer to equality than 55% - 45% … Arbitrary though it is, our instinct is … that, even in an extreme case and in the absence of some further dramatic feature unrelated to it, fair allowance for special contribution within the sharing principle would be most unlikely to give rise to percentages of division of matrimonial property further from equality than 66.6% - 33.3%.”</p>

The judge asked herself five questions: (1) Can it properly be said that he is the generating force behind the fortune rather than the product itself? (2) Does the scale of the wealth depend upon his innovative vision as well as on his ability to develop those visions? (3) Has he generated truly vast wealth such that his business success can properly be viewed as exceptional? (4) Does he have a special skill and effort which is special to him and which survives as a material consideration despite the partnership or pooling aspect of the marriage? (5) Would it, in all the circumstances, be inequitable to disregard that contribution? To all of those questions, the judge’s answer was “yes”.</p>

The qualities of the contributor may become relevant but only as a secondary factor. Thus it was submitted that the court should first consider whether the quantum of the contribution alone is exceptional and whether it has a quality which makes it inequitable to disregard; only if the quantum alone is not sufficient should it consider whether there is some other quality in the manner of the production or the quality of the contributor which rendered it sufficiently exceptional; and then assess whether any such special contribution is ‘unmatched’ by the other party. The Court of Appeal rejected this approach saying that it:</p>

The contribution has to derive from something the contributor has done.

Her recollection was that during 2007-8, the relationship between the husband and SS was very much that of business partners, with SS being in charge of both the UK and US side of the business. She does not agree that the husband came up with the concept for the product that could be used as it was, or that the company was the first company of its type to start advertising on television. She asserts that, compared to at least one other company, the company was slow off the mark to identify the scope of promoting products. She also asserts that the IPO was not perceived as a great success, pointing out that the share price dropped after flotation, that the shares continued to trade substantially below the initial offering price, and that the price paid on the eventual sale of the company valued it at more than $1 billion below the valuation at the IPO.</p>

There have been only three – <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Cowan</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Sorrell</span>, and <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Cooper-Hohn.</span> Special contribution was also found in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Charman</span> but was conceded by the wife in that case. She submits that this case does not fall into the same category. Mr Cowan and Sir Martin Sorrell were men who, through their own personal qualities (described at the time as “genius”) made outstanding contributions and made fortunes in an era before the development of the internet through which, as Miss Stone puts it, the exponential power of technology can realise exponential outcomes in terms of wealth creation. As for <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Cooper-Hohn</span>, Miss Stone submits that the value of the assets dwarfs those in the instant case, notwithstanding the husband’s efforts to align himself with the figures. If this court asks the same questions posed by Roberts J at paragraph 282 of her judgment in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Cooper-Hohn</span>, Miss Stone submits that the answers are not in the affirmative as they were in that case. She argues that the facts of this case are closer to those in the other recent cases, (for example, <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Robertson</span>) in which the plea of special contribution has not succeeded. She concedes that the husband has been an exceptionally good CEO. Like Mr. Robertson, he is “talented, hard-working, astute and a very good leader of the team”. Like Mr. Robertson, however, he has not been “notably innovative, revolutionary or possessed of any truly extraordinary quality”. Like Mr. Robertson, the success of the company has been a team effort. Although he led the team, he was reliant on other members, notably LL. The team did not invent something of fundamental importance, but rather spotted the opportunity opened up by others and exploited it to great advantage. In so doing, the company was not unique. Other companies were doing the same thing at the same time and in some cases earlier. The company was able to make a vast amount of money largely because of the success of one product  which was invented and developed technically by LL. On behalf of the wife, it is therefore submitted that the husband has exaggerated the quality and extent of his contribution. </p>

They criticise him for downplaying the extent of AB’s problems and thereby by implication the extent of the wife’s contribution. Their principal argument is that the husband has not made a special contribution but add, in the alternative, if he has, then so has the wife. It must be possible for the contribution of a housewife and parent to be “special” – otherwise, the whole concept would be discriminatory. Miss Stone and Mr Brooks submit that, if anyone is the paradigm of an exceptional parent, it is this wife and mother. Furthermore, her contribution will continue long into the future, because of AB’s disability. </p>

The impression formed by the husband – and the court – as to the wife’s role as a mother is not informative as to the answer to the question whether his own contribution was special. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">First, the parties have to a very substantial extent kept their financial affairs completely separate during the marriage. As Baroness Hale observed in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Miller</span> at paragraph 153 (quoted above), “the nature and the source of the property and the way the couple have run their lives may be taken into account in deciding how it should be shared”. In this case, the way this couple chose to run their lives was to keep their financial affairs separate. This is, to my mind, a matter of considerable relevance. No doubt on occasions each party paid for things which benefitted the other, but when it came to managing their affairs during the marriage they largely kept their finances apart. In my judgment, that is a factor which the court should take into account when deciding the extent to which the assets should be shared now that the marriage has come to an end.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly, the assets which grew so substantially in value during the latter years of the marriage were the husband’s business assets. The case law remains unclear as to whether such assets should be regarded as matrimonial or non-matrimonial. In the sense that the growth in value occurred during the marriage, they could be said to be matrimonial. On the other hand, the assets remained at all times in the hands of the husband. They were never pooled. In that sense, they can properly be described as non-matrimonial. Ultimately, the label does not matter. What is relevant, in my judgment, is that they were the husband’s business assets. That does not mean that they should be excluded altogether. To hold otherwise would be contrary to the decision of the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Charman</span> and, as explained above, I do not interpret the more recent decision in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Sharp</span> as providing any support for a change in approach. But the nature and source of the property is relevant to deciding <span style="font-style:italic">how</span> the assets should be shared. The fact that the enormous wealth at issue in this case was created through the husband’s business activity is something which must be taken into account in reaching a fair decision.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Thirdly, I am satisfied that there was a latent potential in the  company not reflected in the conventional valuation conducted by Mr Kay. The ultimate phenomenal success of the company was due in part to developments and decisions taken in the business during the marriage, but it was also attributable to developments and decisions taken before the marriage – the creation of the company, the putting together of the team, the earlier activities of the company in its field, including the original product models, and the development of a marketing strategy. To a not inconsiderable extent, the later success was built on those earlier foundations. Mr Kay thought that this was not a significant factor in determining the value of the company at the date of the marriage because the subsequent growth in the business did not occur for several years after the marriage. In my judgment, however, the latent potential was there at all material times – it just remained latent for rather longer until the opportunities for growth arose.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">How should this latent potential be taken into account? To my mind, with great respect to both Holman J and Mostyn J, I consider that neither the approach in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Robertson</span> (treating 50% of the value of the business at the date of sale as having been created prior to the marriage) nor the approach in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">WM v HM </span> (excluding the proportion of value in the business that was created before the marriage on a linear apportionment basis) is appropriate in this case. As Arden LJ noted in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Jones v Jones</span>, the court must try to look as far as it can at the reality of what actually happened rather than proceed on an artificial assumption of a straight-line growth from the date of foundation of the business up to the eventual sale. To insist on a linear or arithmetical approach would be to fall into the error identified by Moylan LJ in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Hart v Hart</span> of imposing “constraints which are not needed to achieve, and which deprive the court of the flexibility required to achieve, a fair outcome.” In this case, adopting Moylan LJ’s approach, I conclude that the evidence does not establish a clear dividing line between matrimonial and non-matrimonial property and it is neither proportionate nor feasible to seek to determine a clear line. Instead, I propose to undertake a broad evidential assessment before deciding how the wealth should be divided. My assessment is that there was a significant, though unquantifiable, latent potential in the company at the date of the marriage which is not reflected in the formal valuation. The fact that there was such a latent potential in the company must therefore be taken into account when determining the extent to which there should be a departure from the sharing principle.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Fourthly, and finally, I am satisfied in this case that the husband’s contribution to the growth in the value of the business assets during the marriage comes within the concept of special contribution. The growth in the value of the company, and therefore of the husband’s shareholding, was due in part to the latent potential that existed at the date of the marriage, but it was also due to developments during the marriage. On any view the growth in the value of the shares during the marriage was spectacular. The increase in value was, in my view, on a scale sufficient by itself to bring this case within the concept of special contribution. But in addition I do consider that the husband’s contribution to the business during the marriage was of a quality which can properly be described as special. I accept the evidence of his former colleagues, set out above, about the crucial importance of his role. Now that the Court of Appeal has removed the word “genius” from this analysis, it seems to me plain that the contribution made by the husband in this case can be seen to be of a character to justify departing from the sharing principle. The nature of his contribution is such that it is very obviously inconsistent with the objective of achieving fairness for it to be ignored.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Taken together, these four factors justify a significant departure from the sharing principle. But in coming to a final figure, I must of course check my preliminary views against the yardstick of equality. I remind myself that, when a marriage comes to an end, each partner to the marriage is entitled to an equal share of the assets of the partnership, unless there is a good reason to the contrary. Fairness requires no less. I must be particularly careful not to undervalue the domestic contribution of the homemaker to the welfare and happiness of the family as a whole. In this case, the wife’s enormous contribution to the welfare and happiness of the family, as the home-maker and principal carer of AB, both during and after the marriage, has been and will be incalculable. She has devoted herself to the day-to-day care of a child with special needs and by doing so has freed the husband to a very considerable extent to enable him to pursue the business activities which have generated the enormous wealth now available. These are important considerations when considering the extent of the departure from the sharing principle.</p>

In this case, I have found that there are other features unrelated to special contribution which justify a greater departure from equality. </p>

I therefore accept the wife’s contention that I should proceed on the basis that he is likely to bring back in the region of £50m and that I should therefore allow for future tax liabilities in the sum of £10m.</p>

This is equivalent to approximately 28.75% of the parties’ total assets. I recognise that, applying the yardstick, this is a significant departure from equality. In my judgment, however, for the reasons set out above, this award is in line with the legal principles binding on this court and represents the fair outcome in all the circumstances. </p>
