	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I am concerned with two children, BT and GT who are twins who were born in 2010. It is almost impossible to imagine the circumstances in which it would be considered appropriate to separate twins and place them for adoption by different prospective adopters. This is, however, what occurred in this case and I have before me an application by a couple, whom I shall refer to as A and B, to adopt BT and an application by a single carer whom I shall refer to as C, to adopt GT. </p>

She may be familiar with the words 'tummy mummy', but she has no real understanding of what they mean or of their significance. Given her age and stage of development there is little that could be done to prepare her for a move to her father's care, nor would it be possible to explain to her, in a way which would have any real meaning for her, what is happening to her, whether before, during or after the move."

Their long-term placement would therefore need to be fully aware of the high level of commitment that will be required, and the ongoing support that the children are likely to require from agencies and services throughout their lives”” </p>

The increasingly secure relationship we observed with her prospective adopter is, itself a protective factor. However, as we saw during the course of the assessment, the progress GT has made is very fragile and she can quickly resort to primitive defence mechanisms such as disassociation to segregate intolerable mental states when she is in touch with difficult feelings or memories. It is likely that such defence mechanisms helped her to survive her early trauma. However, their continued use had led to significant disturbance in the development of a coherent self-construct, as she appears to have an only just emerging sense of self. Lack of a coherent sense of self is a significant risk factor in difficulties in the development of personality. </p>

It is likely that his would make living together and sharing resources very difficult for BT and GT and would set up the adults charged with this responsibility, with an extremely difficult task.

This contact reassessment should include a review of the quality of letterbox contact in the intervening period; an update on how settled GT and BT has each become in their adoptive families (for example frequency of emotional dysregulation, how they have managed minor difficult experiences or transitions, how they have been able to make and manage new relationship); an update on the circumstances of whichever birth sibling has requested contact (how settled they are in their own relationships, their emotional wellbeing, how close their relationships are with other birth family members and how well they would be able to maintain a level of safe confidentiality for example about the whereabouts of each twin’s adoptive family).” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.78in;margin-right:0.00in">Dr Morris told me that both children were receiving a very high quality of care from their prospective adopters. BT and GT feel ‘ownership’ of their separate families. Living apart but coming together at regular contact visits offers them the best opportunity to enable them to build a positive and enduring relationship with each other. The recommendation was that contact should occur at a minimum of six times per year with indirect contact by Skype, Facetime and/or letters and cards taking place on a more frequent basis. Ongoing direct and indirect contact is so vital for BT and GT that Dr Morris advised that the court should make a contact order. This is required to make very clear the importance of contact for the twins and not because of any lack of commitment on the part of the prospective adopters. All three of them recognise and accept the children’s need for regular and indirect contact and are fully committed to ensure the same occurs. </p>

They had not previously taken into account that the fact that by being adopted separately BT and GT would lose their legal status as brother and sister (I mention this not as a point of criticism but as a matter of fact). They both reflected. They then gave a very powerful reason for preferring an adoption order. BT and GT will be likely to remain vulnerable into early adulthood. They will need a legal family to provide for and to look after them beyond attaining the age of 18. An adoption would provide this forever family. A SGO, of course, would cease to have effect when they attain their majority. The carers would then have no relationship or connection with BT or GT in law. The only people who would have a legal relationship with would be their mother and their father: the very people who had harmed and abused them and caused them profound emotional, psychological and developmental damage. </p>

She readily accepted the decision to terminate BT’s adoptive placement in late 2017 had been wrong and the whole episode had been badly dealt with by the local authority. Mr Noble had noted that some of the documents disclosed in the hearing related to events some months or even up to two years before but had only appeared on the local authority’s computer system within days of each other in February or March 2018. When asked why this was, Ms Leader said that the previous social worker, D, had got seriously behind with her administration and had thus spent the last few days of her employment uploading two years worth of notes, records and other documents onto the system. When asked how this could have been allowed to happen, she could give no answer other than to say it was not good practice. This ranks as a masterful understatement and was a completely inadequate response. For the last seven or eight months of the social worker’s employment in children’s services, Ms Leader had been her line manager and had taken no effective steps to remedy this extraordinary state of affairs. </p>

Sometimes, the court proceedings and conversations with the local authority, make it seem like our family life is constantly strained by BT’s behaviour and our ability to cope with it. In fact, this is far from accurate. Whilst BT’s behaviour has of course been very challenging, especially in the first months, we have in more recent months actually found most of our time with BT to be the family we wanted and expected it to be when we adopted. We feel that BT is also happy and feels like he is part of a family, living a positive family life. </p>

BT refers to us as a family, wants family hugs and draws pictures of us all together. He is bonding with, and embracing of, our wider families. He is excited and is starting to understand that they are now his family. BT loves playing with his cousins and chatting with aunts, uncles and grandparents. For example, one of his favourite things to do is to sing along to the radio, especially with his grandmother who he refers to as ‘nan’.” But he does present challenging behaviour at times: </p>

We have and continue to work hard to make BT feel safe and to distract him and reassure him as needed to reduce the times he triggers.

This conclusion is reinforced by the local authority reversing its decision and purporting to withdraw the s.35(2) notice just two days after the decision was communicated to A and B and the notice was issued. Therefore, I am satisfied that the decision to remove and the issue of the notice was unlawful and both should be quashed. </p>

The Children Act 1989 imposes duties on the local authority in respect of the care of children. If the local authority receives information that a child has been subjected to or is likely to be subjected to serious harm it has a duty to investigate the report and, where there are reasonable grounds for believing that it may be well founded, to instigate care proceedings. In this respect the role of a local authority has much in common with the role of a prosecuting authority in criminal proceedings. It is for the court, and not the local authority, to decide whether the allegations are well founded. It is a serious misfortune to be the subject of unjustified allegations in relation to misconduct to a child, but where it is reasonable that these should be investigated by a court, justice does not demand that the local authority responsible for placing the allegations before the court should ultimately be responsible for the legal costs of the person against whom the allegations are made.  </p>

Wilson LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">In re J </span>at para 19 disclaimed any suggestion that it was appropriate "in the vast run of these cases to make an order for costs in whole or in part by reference to the court's determination of issues of historical fact". But, as I have indicated, there is no valid basis for restricting his approach in that case to findings in a split hearing. The principle that he applied would open the door to successful costs applications against local authorities in respect of many determinations of issues of historical fact. The effect on the resources of local authorities, and the uses to which those resources are put would be significant.  </p>
