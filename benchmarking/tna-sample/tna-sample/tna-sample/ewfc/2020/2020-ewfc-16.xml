	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.50in">After nearly 7 years of almost continuous litigation concerning an 8 year old girl, A, involving dismissed allegations of sexual abuse, transfer of residence from mother to father following allegations of parental alienation, breakdown of contact with the mother and allegations now of parental alienation by the father, with a successful appeal from an indirect contact only order made two years ago, I am dealing with a re-hearing on the question whether to vary an order for direct contact between A and her mother and 18 year old half-sister, B.    A has not seen them since February 2018. </p>

If there is one thing everyone is agreed on, this litigation needs to come to an end for the sake of A and all the adults involved in it.   To do that needs a robust judgment that is complete as it can be.   I have decided that the history of the litigation needs to be dealt with in some detail to explain how we have got to where we are.   Also the judgment may be helpful to those working with the family and, most particularly, in any life story work done with A.  And it is important for the adults involved who will need to find a strategy to promote A’s best interests and convert what is now a least worst outcome into something better for her. </p>

	      </authorialNote> from an order made by HHJ Meston QC on 23 February 2018.  HHJ Meston had varied an order for direct contact between A and the mother and B made by consent in March 2017 and replaced it with an order for indirect contact only, coupled with a three year section 91(14) bar.    In particular Cohen J considered that the possibility of what he called identity contact and the differential positions of the mother and B had not been explored.   As HHJ Meston had by then moved courts, Cohen J directed that the matter be re-heard by me.    As Cohen J has subsequently made clear, the re-hearing is not restricted to the question of identity contact.  Both the mother and B seek more regular direct contact with A.   </p>

In such case contact should only be refused where the court is satisfied that there is a serious risk of harm if contact were to be ordered (Re D (Contact : Reasons for Refusal) (1997) 2 FLR 48).   It is however to be noted that in each of the two cases to which I have just made reference the Court of Appeal upheld a “no contact” outcome, with the consequence that these oft quoted statements are in fact obiter.   Further, in Re J, where contact was refused in order to avoid placing the child in a situation of stress as a result of the mother’s implacable hostility to contact, Balcombe LJ rightly acknowledged that affording paramount consideration to the child’s welfare may, in some cases, produce an outcome which is seen as “an injustice” from the perspective of the excluded parent. </span></p>

The question in each case is whether the child’s welfare requires interference with Article 8 rights and whether the extent of such interference is proportionate. </p>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">60…In doing so I would stress the latter two elements in the judicial armory that I have listed. The need for the single judge who has charge of the case to establish a 'set strategy for the case' and to stick consistently to that strategy, so that all parties and the judge know what is happening and what the court plainly expects will happen, cannot be understated. If, as part of that strategy, the court makes an express order requiring the parent with care to comply with contact arrangements, and that order is breached then, as part of a consistent strategy, the judge must, in the absence of good reason for any failure, support the order that he or she has made by considering enforcement, either under the enforcement provisions in CA 1989, ss 11J-11N or by contempt proceedings. To do otherwise would be to abandon the strategy for the case with the risk that a situation similar to that which has occurred in the present case may develop; to do otherwise is also inconsistent with the rule of law.  </span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">61. The first time that a judge should give serious consideration to whether or not he or she will, if called upon, be prepared to enforce a contact order should be before the order is made and not only after a breach has occurred. Such forward thinking should be part of the judge's overall strategy for the case. If a directive contact order is called for, then, on making it, the judge should be clear, at least in his or her own mind, that, upon breach, enforcement may well follow. If, on the facts of the case, enforcement is not to be contemplated, then an alternative judicial strategy not involving a directive court order (and which might in an extreme case include a change of residence or, at the other extreme, dismissing the application for contact) must be developed. The error … that I have already identified in deciding whether or not to 'attach a penal notice', when now, as a matter of law, all contact orders are to contain a warning notice as to enforcement (CA 1989, s 11N), is not a minor technical error.    It is an error that, with respect, indicates a misunderstanding of the nature of the task of making a directive contact order in the first place. Under the modern law, the judicial discretion is not whether or not to attach a penal notice, it is whether or not to make the contact order itself.  </span>

The court may draw proper inferences from the evidence but must not reverse the burden of proof: <span style="font-style:italic">Re B</span> [2008] UKHL 35; <span style="font-style:italic">Re A (A Child) (Fact-finding hearing: Speculation)</span> [2011] EWCA Civ 12.

The father himself accepted there was a difference in their positions and was far more wary of what B might do than what the mother might do.  As the guardian accepted, there was no real evidence that B had actually communicated her allegations to A, but there remained a risk that because B feels strongly that nothing would keep A safe, and there was therefore a continuing risk that B would feel she must tell A so as to protect her.  As to the mother the judge had been more qualified.

The factors above indicate that the resumption of direct contact would compound this and place A at increased risk of long-term psychological problems including emotional disorders and relationship problems.  Dr Jefferis regarded the likelihood of resumed direct contact running smoothly as negligible, given that these parents had been in dispute for the last seven years.  There would at the least be tense handovers and complaints about the conduct of contact. </p>

Adults were sometimes disengaged from child protagonists in the narratives, being unaware of the child’s needs at times. More positively, there was little in the way of cruel or violent behaviour by adults.

Dr Jefferis thought nonetheless that they indicated a degree of psychological damage.  A’s scores gave the impression of a child who is constrained in her ability to fully express and explore her emotions and a defensive stance which has most probably developed against the backdrop of complex and troubled family relationships.  Children in such circumstances often partially shut down their emotional functioning as a coping strategy, likely to lead to psychological problems as they get older.  A’s portrayal of adults as less then fully aware of, and attentive to, the child’s needs may reflect her experience of the adults in her life being preoccupied about their own concerns, including the conflicts about the proceedings which is likely to have drawn their focus away from A’s needs.  </p>

He described it in evidence as a very difficult tense meeting and said it was hard to establish a constructive dialogue or rapport.  He felt he approached the meeting carefully and stressed a number of times that he was listening to her and tried to empathise.  However, B wasn’t receptive.  Largely B’s anger was directed towards the system, save a point when she thought Dr Jefferis was smiling.  He said that B was articulate and did not shout or raise her voice but nor was her anger controlled.   Dr Jefferis thought B presented as a deeply mistrustful individual who trusted no one in the legal proceedings. </p>

While he thought A would experience some confusion and sadness and her sense of identity may not be as complete as it might be (although he questioned whether direct contact would enable her to develop a coherent sense of identity), the disadvantages of contact outweighed any potential benefits. He considered that direct contact would be harmful. The impact could be mitigated through indirect contact.   </p>

It might be in her interests to re-visit the question of direct contact around that time (when she is in her teenage years and if A makes it clear she wishes to do so) but only after careful evaluation of her views and wishes by an appropriate professional.  The adults would also have to come to an agreement about the version of events which A should be given about the reasons behind the decisions made about contact.

Dr Jefferis said, if the coping strategy stays in place, there may be general difficulty in accessing and regulating emotions, perhaps to the point where emotions are so suppressed that there is no functional way around them, coming out as anger or self-destructive behaviour.  If the coping strategy breaks down this may become a lifelong habit and result in depressive breakdown if faced with sufficiently difficult circumstances.    </p>

Dr Jefferis acknowledged it was very difficult.   It is right that a parent should be sensitive but she needs also to be able to say (to herself) she is not sure if B is telling the truth.    Instead the mother holds two parallel beliefs in an unintegrated and unresolved way.   This leads to unpredictable and erratic behaviour and is a problematic position to have.  If she had said she was in real turmoil, that would have been a healthier position.  She was trying to ride two horses but pretending not to. </p>

It is likely A would find out and her school environment is a neutral safe place for her.   The mother should have A’s school reports.  He wondered whether having photos of her mother and B might stir up unhelpful emotions in A, but thought that was just something that has to be managed. If it was unsettling perhaps it shouldn’t be continued.  There is no reason why the mother shouldn’t have photos of A; it helps maintain the link. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.50in">Pressed on the idea of separate identity contact, Dr Jefferis maintained there is a real risk that any form of direct contact will unsettle A, with the risk of such contact being emotive.  While the mother’s recent statements were appreciated, there was a background of behaviour identified as consistent at least with borderline personality disorder.  Her contradictory beliefs were in that territory.   While he had not assessed the mother for BPD he was confident she has personality problems.  He was worried that the mother’s behaviour in contact would be unpredictable.  If is difficult to see how contact could be conducted in a straightforward way with both the mother and B believing A is living with a paedophile. </p>

Nonetheless the mother has acted with dignity and calmly and has made realistic litigation decisions in A’s interests.  The difference was that, as was submitted to HHJ Meston in 2017, the father approaches the case on the basis of what is best for him, whereas the mother’s approach is focused on A and B. </p>

Without skilful parenting A is likely to suffer with emotional dysregulation.   Neither Dr Jefferis nor the guardian had met with the father.  The court has at least had the advantage of forming a clearer view of him from his evidence.

He found that they were not proved.   His comment that he could not say nothing happened may be regarded as unhelpful in terms of the mother (and B) moving on and in terms of the binary consequence of his finding.   However, his finding was that the allegations had not been proved on the balance of probabilities.  The binary consequence – that nothing happened – is the consequence of the finding, not the finding itself. </p>

I am less inclined to be so critical.  Absent a finding that the mother does not actually believe the allegations herself, it is understandable that she finds herself in an irresolvable dilemma.    My interpretation of her evidence is not that she genuinely accepts the court’s findings, but that she accepts the court has made the findings and the binary consequence for the purpose of the court’s decisions about A is that the matters alleged did not happen.   That is in my view not an incoherent position to hold. </p>

Neither made a formal diagnosis.  There may be enough in the mother’s behaviour generally to justify such a conclusion (coaching B, influencing friends, shutting out the father) but I am less convinced that Dr Jefferis is right to rely on what he regarded as her incoherent position as evidence of personality difficulties.    The previous findings of the court have not been that the mother has knowingly fabricated false allegations in which she had no belief in order to alienate A from her father.  On the contrary two judges have found that she has maintained her belief in the allegations and that is also a conclusion I reach on the evidence now. </p>

It is notable that despite that she seems settled and happy (superficially at least) and it should to be forgotten that she spent her formative years, when attachment was laid down, with her mother.

There is however a degree of manipulation of the court and the court process.    Objectively speaking it seems to me that the father is capable of more engagement than subjectively he believes.   This is demonstrated by his ability to attend court and give evidence much more robustly than anyone anticipated from his state as reported to the court.   His motivation in coming to court was to pursue his application for injunctions against the mother and B (hence his initial prescribed agenda of topics on which he was prepared to be questioned). </p>

The Cafcass Positive CoParenting Programme is careful to distinguish alienation from justifiable rejection (because of the non-resident parent’s behaviour), alignment with the resident parent and attachment issues.  All of these exist on a spectrum and may overlap.  It is not uncommon to see cases which feature all, or any combination of, justifiable rejection, alignment, attachment and alienation.   It is essential that the court understands, through findings if necessary, what it is dealing with. </p>

And now, although A expresses some ambivalent thoughts about her mother and sister (borne out of suppression of freedom of expression) she is generally positive in her responses to direct contact and says she would like to see them.

It is unsurprising therefore that she finds it difficult to talk about issues around relationships and contact.    Any positive comment she makes about her ‘other family’ is likely, through her eyes, to be seen as betrayal of those she is closest to.    I also suspect, although this has not been canvased in the evidence, that she is well aware that her father is unwell at the moment, mentally and physically, and is anxious about his vulnerability.   She may see her defensiveness as protective of her vulnerable father. </p>

There has barely been a time when she has been able to enjoy relationships with them both at the same time, and certainly not in an uncomplicated way.     Her perspectives of the non-resident parent have also been complicated by the adult perspectives communicated to her directly or indirectly. </p>

It will not be difficult for her to find them, even if the mother does not use social media.    The question is how that is handled by the adults.   If A thinks she is going behind her father’s back and being disloyal that is likely to mean either that she doesn’t make contact, probably resulting in frustration and resentment, or that she does but behind closed doors, creating feelings of guilt and disloyalty.    Neither will be healthy for A.  </p>

It is inevitable that this experience has been harmful for her.  I accept there is no evidence that the mother (or B) has discussed B’s allegations with A.  I accept that the father and stepmother have said to A that her mother and sister love her.   I find also though that A has received very negative messages from each of her parents through their words and actions about the other parent (and B in the case of the father and stepmother).     </p>

It almost goes without saying that for a child to grow up into adulthood without such important relationships, relationships she would want to happen, is a huge deficit for her.    </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.50in">More catastrophic though would be the harm to A if, in pursuing those meaningful relationships, she lost her father, or a relationship with him and/or her stepmother.  HHJ Meston said he was certain the father would walk away.    I am not quite so certain, but I consider the risk of him either suffering a drastic failure of his mental health or simply walking away is very high.   Either way, it is not a risk I can ignore.    While the father’s medical evidence may be seen as self-serving, deriving largely from what he has told his treating medical practitioners, there is an unchallenged psychiatric diagnosis of adjustment disorder and two attempts on his own life which everyone accepts must be taken seriously. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.50in">I say that outcome would be more catastrophic for two main reasons.  First, it would be the loss to A of her current primary carers.   That would be a more profound change of circumstances for her that continuation of the loss of relationships with her mother and sister in circumstances where she has adjusted to that change, albeit superficially.   Secondly, loss of her father would not mean automatic restoration the care of her mother.  It is common ground that is not possible, at least at present.  The likelihood is (unless the stepmother assumes sole care of her) that A would end up in foster care, an outcome that nobody considers would be in her interests.  There is also a serious risk that A may come to blame the mother (and perhaps B) for the loss of her father or relationships with him and/or the stepmother. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.50in">I can deal with the option of section 37 and interim care shortly.     It is common ground that A is settled and apparently happy in the care of her father and stepmother, even if there are worries about her emotional and psychological wellbeing.    There is no realistic prospect that a local authority will consider the threshold met at the moment for care or supervision proceedings.   The grounds for interim care (the safety of the child requiring immediate separation) are plainly not engaged here. </p>

It is better than nothing as it serves to remind A about her mother and sister but it is no substitute for a direct relationship.  I also accept that indirect contact may be more difficult to maintain and may give rise to more questions than answers as A gets older and more inquisitive and continues to ask ever more difficult questions about why she can’t see her mother and sister.  </p>

And what would be the point of punishment for its own sake rather than to secure compliance? </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.50in">The risks apply were the direct contact to be frequent or identity contact.   Although the opportunities for tension and anxiety might not arise so often with identity contact, the build-up and let down for the adults around less frequent contact does risk more emotive occasions and, perhaps, heightened monitoring of signs in A that all is not well in the care of her father and stepmother.  And there are added risks of A asking more questions than identity contact answers and re-kindling a need that is unfulfilled by infrequent meetings. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.50in">So I have come to the conclusion on balance that the risks for A around direct contact outweigh the immediate and long-term benefits that it would bring her.   As a result the order for direct contact of March 2017 is varied and the order for indirect contact made by HHJ Meston QC in February 2018 confirmed with the adjustments indicated below. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.50in">I do consider it would be sensible if any professionals working with B had access to this judgment so they can understand the family context.  In this respect I note the very recent observations of Knowles J in <span style="font-style:italic">A City Council v A Mother, AB and Others</span> [2020] EWHC 217 (Fam) about the importance of professionals working with families understanding context.    I understand of course that organisations specialising in counselling victims of sexual abuse approach counselling on the basis that the abuse alleged happened.   As the father says, there is a danger, if it did not happen (and that is the basis on which the court proceeds), that B’s position will simply be reinforced and potentially further referrals encouraged. </p>

Further I will give permission for this judgment to be disclosed to any professional working with A in relation to the matters raised in this judgment.   </p>

Secondly, that would require a condition attached to the indirect contact order (that is the only vehicle I can think of that could mandate disclosure).  In my view any conditions on that order should relate to implementation or exercise of the indirect contact itself, not to wider questions. </p>

When I sent this order out in draft I understood that would take us to Spring 2023 and proposed a 3 year order to allow time for any further judicial consideration to be completed if possible before A started a new academic year.    The stepmother pointed out however that, as A is a ‘summer baby,’ she will not start senior school until a year later.  Remaining faithful to the guardian’s logic I will therefore make a 4 year order.   That is, I consider, a necessary and proportionate interference with access to the court (by requiring a filter) to allow A a period to settle at senior school without the additional uncertainty and anxiety of further litigation hanging over her at a point of transition. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.50in">Mr Langrish expressed concern that the work should be done.  The work is plainly belated, necessary and proportionate to the likely resources needed.   I have directed that the local authority must file a report with the court when the work is completed or by 12 months at the latest setting out what has been done and any outcomes.   That provides a mechanism by which the court can satisfy itself that the necessary work is undertaken.   </p>
