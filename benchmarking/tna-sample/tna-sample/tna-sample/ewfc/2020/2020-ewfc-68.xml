The children are represented by Ms Lisa Edmunds of counsel through their Children’s Guardian, Ms Anglim.  Both children currently reside together in the same foster carer placement, where they have been placed throughout these proceedings.  The applicant local authority is represented by Mr Shaun Spencer and Helen Crowell of counsel.  This is the second judgment I have handed down in this matter, the first being <span style="font-style:italic">A Local Authority v W (Application for Summary Dismissal of Findings)</span> [2020] EWFC 40. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The first respondent mother is W, represented by Mr Nicholas Stonor, Queen’s Counsel and Miss Kirsty Robinson of counsel.  The mother was at times very measured in her evidence, willing for example to tell the court that the father had stated he was lucky to be the children’s father.  However, I am also satisfied that the mother was at points during her evidence deliberately evasive, sought to dissemble markedly at some points and introduced a new version of events surrounding the discovery of S moribund on 2 June 2019 during the course of her evidence.  I will come in more detail to the import of this below.  However, I am satisfied that the mother has failed during this hearing to assist the court by disclosing all that she knows about how S came to be admitted to hospital on 2 June 2019 with a hypoxic ischaemic head injury.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The second respondent father is R, represented by Mr Damian Garrido, Queen’s Counsel and Mr Mark Steward of counsel.  It became apparent during the course of these proceedings, and during the course of this hearing, that the father has been <span style="font-style:italic">serially</span> dishonest with doctors, social workers, the police, the jointly instructed expert psychologist and this court.  Indeed, at one point in cross-examination the father conceded that the court could not rely on <span style="font-style:italic">anything</span> he had told the police.  I will deal in detail below with the multiple lies told by the father and their forensic import having regard to the careful direction I must give myself when evaluating their significance and what is, as rightly acknowledged by the local authority, the father’s longstanding strained relationship with the truth, which is not specific to the events under consideration by this court.  For now it is sufficient to note that the father presented at times as an arrogant witness who could not see the need for the fact finding exercise in which the court was engaged, at times as a young man with some insight into the damaging nature of his past behaviour and at times as a person who was highly evasive, with a memory that conveniently failed him at crucial points in the history of this matter. Indeed, selective recall became the defining feature of the father’s evidence as that evidence progressed.  At one point the father claimed to have, effectively, no recall of the point at which S was discovered to be moribund beyond seeing his condition.  However, only minutes later he gave detailed evidence about aspects of this incident.  Within this context, I must accept Mr Spencer’s submission that the father presented as a prolific dissembler and unreliable historian whose account of events must be treated with caution.  As with the mother, I am satisfied that the father has failed during this hearing to assist the court by disclosing all that he knows about how S came to be admitted to hospital with a hypoxic ischaemic head injury. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">When the father was aged 11 he became aware that his parents had separated when he was 4 years old by reason of his biological father having sexually abused his sister.  It was clear during the course of the father’s oral evidence that this subject remains a sensitive and upsetting one for the father.  Mr Garrido and Mr Steward submit that the mention of this incident during cross-examination of the father, and his reaction to it, assists in explaining why the father’s evidence was in many respects unsatisfactory.  Whilst I acknowledge that the father finds it a difficult subject, I am not persuaded that this was at the root of his subsequent dissembling during his oral evidence.  Following his discovering the actions of his biological father, the father began exhibiting problematic behaviours, including anger and threats of suicide which led to his exclusion from school. The father readily conceded that he has had difficulties with his mental health from his early teens and has, at times, struggled with anger and thoughts of suicide. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The parents’ relationship commenced in 2016.  By this time the mother was living in county A and the father in city B. The mother subsequently moved to city B.  The parents’ relationship was characterised by instability, with frequent separations. Neither parent disputed that the word “toxic” was an apt description of their relationship.  Following the birth of L the father reported that he was using cocaine and the mother reported that she struggled to bond with L due to illness but that this improved with social work support.  On both parents’ account, the father undertook a good deal of the care of L at this time.   </p>

The parents’ relationship continued to be unstable.  During the periods of separation both parents formed short-term relationships with other people.  This led to doubts as to the paternity of S in the minds of both parents.  Upon becoming pregnant with S, the mother initially stated that the father was not the father of S, before later stating that he was.  The father told Dr Shieldhouse that he had doubted the paternity of <span style="font-style:italic">both</span> children at points during the mother’s pregnancies.  Within this context, the mother contended during her oral evidence that the father “did not want to know S”, claiming that he was not reassured regarding the issue of paternity until DNA testing was undertaken.  The mother stated in oral evidence that the father was more distant and less affectionate with S than with L although she told the police that he was “still amazing with S” and that he would take it in turns to get up to care for him.  The father told both the police and Dr Shieldhouse that he considered that he did not have the same bond with S as he had with L.  In crossexamination the father conceded he had doubted S’s paternity and that the mother’s assessment of the relevant dates had failed to reassure him. </p>

The father appeared to accept in cross-examination that his behaviour had changed in May 2019, he stating that this was possibly due to the stress in the household, and that he was taking almost no role in the care of the children.  In cross examination the father further conceded he was not there enough for the mother as “I was too engulfed in my lifestyle to care about her feelings”.  In addition, a lack of money meant that the parents were short of milk and nappies for S and food for L.

The father’s memory became very selective when he was asked in cross-examination about the consequences of his infidelity being discovered.  The father claimed that he could not remember any argument but then conceded that there had been a huge falling out with the mother in the days leading up to S going into hospital.  In a text message on 27 May 2019 the father related that “it has all kicked off round here, I’m fine but friends and girlfriends are not for me”. On the mother’s account, the dispute regarding the father’s infidelity led to an argument between the parents, which in oral evidence the mother described as “a lot of screaming and slamming of doors”.  The father left  the family home on 30 May 2019 and used alcohol and drugs during the day on 31 May 2019.  This left the mother caring for both S and L, L being at that time unwell.

The father concedes that he and DB had been engaged in an all-day drinking session, supplemented with cocaine.  Both parents agree that DB was barely able to stand. Within this context, the parents contend S’s Moses basket was knocked off its stand by DB and S fell to the floor.  On the parents’ account, S’s fall from the Moses basket occurred as a result of DB accidentally kicking the basket when he attempted to stand. The only witness was the father, who, it is said, himself remained severely intoxicated by alcohol and cocaine.  The mother asserted that she heard alarm in the form of someone shouting “S, S, S”.  I note that in her initial response to threshold the mother raises doubts about the father’s account of this incident, suggesting that the father’s account of pushing DB towards the radiator as he became unstable did not accord with the location of the radiator and that the Moses basket did not look as if it had been kicked as S was too close to the basket to have fallen from it.  The mother asserts she took S to kitchen to examine him for marks and whether he could focus on her.  However, she stated in oral evidence that the father’s claim that they got a torch out to check S’s eyes is untrue.

Both parents contend that 1 June 2019 was a normal day.  The father conceded he was exhausted and that he was far short of the sleep he needed.   Both parents denied ongoing arguments concerning AG or the fact that the father had brought home a man who was insensible with drugs and alcohol and which had resulted in S being knocked to the floor, although the father went as far in cross examination to concede that it was likely that the parents did argue during 1 June 2019.  Neither the mother nor the father was willing to elaborate in any detail what transpired between the parents on the evening of 1 June 2019 notwithstanding the fact that the mother was plainly upset about the father’s conduct over the course of the preceding day and the father was recovering from a high level of alcohol and cocaine use. The most that was conceded was that the mother and the father spoke about the father’s infidelity.   </p>

S vomited after a milk feed therefore his feeds were stopped and intravenous fluids started. He was reviewed by a paediatrician on the ward who witnessed two episodes that were felt to be seizures. Examination of S’s body revealed no evidence of trauma and there were no bruises or other visible injuries.  On 5 June 2019 at approximately 11.00pm S was observed to have a further suspected seizure. At hospital the father provided an account stating that S was observed to have been awake in his Moses basket at 12.10am and that when the parents next attended to L, who slept with her parents on an air bed, at approximately 5.00am S was seen to be floppy and unresponsive and apparently not breathing, that he was blue around the lips, was not responding, eyes rolled back, and grunting. No mention of a fall from the Moses basket was recorded.  Dr F, who took the history, does not recall anything being mentioned about the fall from Moses basket and it is not in her notes. Whilst she acknowledges that it is possible that the mother mentioned it and it is not documented (as Professor David points out, the notes of the Emergency Department doctors are very brief), since this was during acute admission, she considers that it would have been potentially important clinical information which she would expect to have documented and remembered. </p>

The consultant paediatric neurologist reporting on the MRI considered that the appearance was consistent with a metabolic or mitochondrial disorder, that the features were not those classical of non-accidental injury but that non-accidental injury could not be ruled out as a possible cause of the features seen on the MRI.

Reports were provided by S’s treating clinicians dated 10 June 2029, 1 July 2019, 10 July 2019 and 27 August 2019.  The provisional report dated 10 June 2019 indicated that S’s treating clinicians were investigating the possibility of an underlying medical disorder but were unable at that stage to rule out non-accidental injury as a cause of the features seen on the MRI scan and in the EEG.  They however, discounted a fall from a Moses basket as the cause of the head injury to S.  The subsequent reports indicate that genetic testing for mitochondrial disease has indicated no evidence of pathogenic variants that would confirm a diagnosis of mitochondrial disorder. Mitochondrial DNA disease results indicated no evidence of a mutation with further testing ongoing to screen the entire mitochondrial genome.  Further, metabolic results received to date have returned as normal or with no evidence of an organic acid disorder.  The urine amino acid screen detected “several unknown compounds” which may have been drug/diet related metabolites.  A repeat urine sample indicated no abnormal purines or other endogenous compounds although the plasma / urine guanidinoacetate and creatine results were slightly unusual and repeat samples were taken.  </p>

In this regard, Professor David told the court that the competing possibilities in this case, i.e. a medical cause and an inflicted cause, are not equal in that the probability of a natural cause is far greater than an inflicted cause simply because the former is more usual than the latter.  Within this context, having regard to the relative frequency of natural events as against incidences of babies being intentionally suffocated caused him to favour the former explanation.  In addition, Professor David told the court that he attached weight to a paper published in 1989 by Constantino which described a series of cases that closely resembled what had been seen in S. He further reminded the court that that there is still a lot being learned in terms of scientific research in terms of why babies collapse and die and therefore acknowledging what is not known about these conditions is important, his report quoting Dr Levin’s statement that:  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Finally, as I have noted, in his oral evidence, Professor David also stated that a third possible cause of S’s presenting symptoms was that of S having been overlaid by an adult.  Professor David conceded that it had been an omission not to address this mechanism in his reports.  This possibility was however, explored further in crossexamination.  Professor David stated that the lack of oronasal blood might be regarded as a factor against overlaying, but did not wish to emphasise that point too strongly and reiterated that overlaying was a possible explanation.  Professor David told the court that there is no research data to support the concept of overlay, rather it is a theory based on admissions by adults.  Professor David considered that overlay depends on the adult being asleep, that it would be possible for a parent to roll onto and then roll off a child and that, as set out above, there is research evidence suggesting that complete airway obstruction of 60 seconds is probably needed to produce major physiological changes. Within this context, Professor David agreed that overlay for a short period could result in some features of hypoxic ischaemic injury short of death. </p>

It is true that very occasionally the episode ‘went wrong, when a mother, trying just a bit too hard to convince the treating team that there really was something seriously wrong with the baby, would suffocate the child for longer than necessary to cause apnoea and loss of consciousness.  The catastrophic end result of prolonged obstruction was brain damage resulting from lack of oxygen.  This was fortunately a rare occurrence, but I have vivid recollection of one such case occurring on the paediatric ward at the old St Mary’s Hospital in Manchester.  At the risk of serious oversimplification, for the sake of brevity, the motivation for this behaviour was not to harm the child but was believed to be a form of attention seeking behaviour, the mother deriving ‘support’ from the extra medical attention given to a sick child”. </p>

If a child alleges sexual abuse by a parent, it is common sense to start with the assumption that most parents do not abuse their children. But this assumption may be swiftly dispelled by other compelling evidence of the relationship between parent and child or parent and other children.

He was forced to retreat from both of these claims during cross-examination by Mr Stonor, acknowledging that the serious domestic abuse had not in fact been “six of one and half a dozen of the other”, that the allegations of domestic abuse had not simply been made up by the mother and that he had been wrong to state to the psychologist that the mother “likes it when I kick off”.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">With respect to the timing of the event which resulted in the impairment of the oxygen supply to S’s brain, the preponderance of medical evidence favours a finding that S’s oxygen supply was impaired a short time before he was discovered moribund.  Professor David was clear that the rapid improvement in S’s pH levels “most likely reflects that whatever happened to S was very recent”, that the timescale involved was “minutes not hours” and that “one could say with some confidence that the family were not sitting on a dangerously ill child for many hours”.   Each parent is clear that S’s recovery from the point of discovery was relatively rapid.  Whilst great care must be taken with each parent’s evidence given the manifest issues with their credibility that I will come to, I am satisfied that the description of S’s improving state apparent over the course of the 999 call given in the heat of the moment is likely to be accurate and is corroborated by the results of the examination subsequently undertaken by paramedics.  In the circumstances, I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that S’s oxygen supply was impaired for a period shortly before the 999 call was made.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Within the foregoing context, I am satisfied that the event that impaired S’s respiration and, in consequence the oxygen supply to his brain occurred proximate in time to his discovery in a moribund state at approximately 5.00am on 2 June 2019.  With respect to the duration of the cessation of S’s respiration, Professor David opined that “There is no way of knowing for how long S’s respirations had ceased before this was discovered.  Plainly the period cannot have been very long, or he would have been found dead.”  Within the latter context, I further bear in mind the unchallenged evidence of Professor David that the amount of time necessary to smother an infant to the point that their electroencephalogram is flat and there is no spontaneous respiration has been estimated at between 70 and 90 seconds (although, again, this is based on observations in only 4 children) and that, in his opinion, complete airway obstruction of approximately 60 seconds is required to produce major physiological changes.  I accept that evidence and am satisfied that the impairment to S’s oxygen supply lasted for a period sufficient to cause S to suffer a significant hypoxic ischaemic injury but insufficient to result in his death, that period being anywhere up to approximately 60 seconds in length.  I will examine the import of this conclusion in more detail below.     </p>

However, it is also important to note that Professor David conceded that it is well recognised that it is possible to fatally suffocate a baby with little or no evidence of trauma.  Within this context, whilst I agree with Professor David that medical diagnosis has to be based on facts and evidence and that an inability on the part of doctors to exclude a non-accidental cause should not be accorded undue forensic weight, the fact that a deliberate or accidental suffocation might not leave any medical evidence beyond the injury caused by the same must, in my judgment, reduce the weight to be attached in this case to the fact that no other evidence beyond S’s hypoxic ischaemic head injury was found by the examining doctors. </p>

In this context, Professor David emphasised that the data gathered by Professor Meadow in respect of unnatural infant deaths and by Professor Southall in respect of repeated intentional suffocation represents the only substantial data available in respect of these occurrences.  However, in my judgment it is difficult to separate entirely scientific methodology from evidence gathered by those whose methodology has been so comprehensively and justifiably criticised.  At the very least, I accept the submission of Mr Spencer on behalf of the local authority that the data must be treated with the utmost caution in light of the criticism levelled at the work of both Professor Meadow and Professor Southall.   </p>

Professor David readily acknowledged these problems, in particular with respect to Professor Meadow.   In this regard, Professor David made clear that Professor Meadow’s series of unnatural infant deaths is a retrospective rather than a prospective study comprising highly selected cases collected over 18 years with no reference to a denominator population.  There was no control group.  In addition, Professor David considered it likely that the series was the subject of bias in circumstances where Professor Meadow developed clear suspicions concerning the presence of oronasal blood and where considerable reliance was placed on the conclusions reached in court cases where he was directly involved, giving rise to “an element of circularity in placing great faith in the conclusions of the courts”.  Further, Professor David described the data as being “extraordinarily” incomplete.  Within this context, in his report Professor David made clear that uncontrolled case series collected by tertiary specialists occupy the lowest level in the hierarchy of evidence based medicine and in that context, in oral evidence, stated that: </p>

Professor Southall’s data concerned incidences of repeated intentional suffocation.  S’s case concerns a single incident of interrupted respiration.  In these circumstances, Professor David conceded that it is not possible to make a direct comparison between Professor Meadow’s series or Professor Southall’s series and S’s case.  Within this context, and whilst I acknowledge Professor David’s point that this is the only substantial data available and again accept that Professor David makes the effort he does in all good faith, this must in my judgment undermine even further the <span style="font-style:italic">forensic</span> efficacy of profiling S’s case against the data collected by Professor Meadow and by Professor Southall.    </p>

In particular, the authorities make clear that in every court case of this type, the answer is not to be found in the inherent probabilities <span style="font-style:italic">per se</span> but in the evidence, and that it is when analysing the evidence in a specific case that the court takes account of the inherent probabilities as appropriate (see<span style="font-style:italic"> Re B</span> [2009] 1 AC 11 and <span style="font-style:italic">Re BR (Proof of Facts)</span> [2015] EWFC 41).  Thus, in the context of the general population it is less likely that a child presenting with S’s symptoms will have been smothered or overlaid than it is that he will have been the victim of a natural event.  However, in the context of the evidence in <span style="font-style:italic">this</span> case, the inherent probability of smothering or overlaying as against being victim of a poorly understood natural event will necessarily be different because inherent probability is sensitive to context.   </p>

As I have already alluded to, that evidence was deeply unsatisfactory, the court being satisfied that neither parent was being frank and honest in their evidence to the court.  Three particular difficulties arise from this that must be borne in mind when the court seeks to draw inferences from and make findings on the basis of that evidence.  First, the court does not have a fully frank account of what occurred on the morning of 2 June 2019 from the only two adults present at the time.  Second, and within that context, the court must be cautious about relying on the evidence given by the parents regarding those events and should look for corroboration where it seeks to do so.

The home environment was toxic and harmful by reason of parental immaturity, exhaustion, mental health issues, drug and alcohol use, domestic abuse and acute relationship discord.  I am satisfied that I can rely on the parents’ evidence that this was the position in circumstances where that evidence comprises of admissions against their respective interests.  In particular, I am satisfied that on the evening of 1 June into 2 June 2019 both parents were exhausted by this situation and that the father was also recovering from extremely heavy alcohol and drug use over the course of 31 May 2019 into the early morning of 1 June 2019.  Their level of exhaustion was exacerbated by the fact that they had been dealing early in the morning of 1 June 2019 with the aftermath of the incident in which S was caused to fall to the floor and had both risen later that morning and spent a full day with the children and DB.  Within the foregoing context, I am likewise satisfied that when the parents came to go to bed on the evening of 1 June into 2 June 2019 they were each still exhausted.  </p>

Whilst the parents deny that S was likewise brought into the bed at any point prior to 5.00am, I bear in mind that, as I have noted, they were co-sleeping with L on that evening. In addition, both parents concede that on occasions the father would fall asleep whilst holding or feeding S and would not wake when the mother removed S from him, the father further conceding that it was possible he would not remember these incidents due to the influence of drink or drugs and that the mother being able to remove S from him without him waking would fit with him being heavily under the influence of those substances during such incidents.  Further, neither parent was apt to follow the advice of professionals regarding the sleeping arrangements for S, as demonstrated by the use of a pillow in his Moses basket against the clear advice of the health visitor and had on occasion actively rejected the same, as demonstrated by the father’s view that the Health Visitor’s advice was “bullshit” and “bollocks”.  Both parents were exhausted, making it more likely in my judgment that they would on that evening have adopted any practice that allowed them to sleep, particularly in circumstances where the father stated to medical staff that the parents would take steps to try and prevent S from waking overnight for a bottle by giving him water, telling a paediatric registrar that “I can’t be arsed to get up in the night me”.   </p>

In the circumstances, it remains unclear at what time this took place and whether he moved from the sofa to the inflatable bed in the dark.  Indeed, the inability or unwillingness of both parents to recount the movements and events of the night of 1 to 2 June leading up to S being found critically unwell was striking. On the father’s case however, this move into the bed during the night was habitual and autonomic in nature, with the father claiming little awareness of his actions or surroundings when habitually making this move.   </p>

As at 2 June 2019 L was 18 months old.  Within this context, she was described by the parents to the social worker as sleeping well and rarely waking throughout the night.  In her police interview the mother informed officers that “She used to go sleep at 7 but now longer naps so between 8 and 9” and that “when L wakes up, if she doesn’t tap me and say, “Mummy, I’m awake,” then she’ll get onto the sofa and she’ll start playing with her toys or reading her books or something. Erm, but it’s very unlikely she doesn’t let me know. She always wants something when she wakes up.” Within the latter context, the mother informed the Children’s Guardian that “L sleeps right through 10pm to 10am. I spoke to the health visitor about it at one point because I was worried.”  Within this context, it is not clear what caused L, unusually, to wake up at 5.00am, close to or at the very point S needed to be rescued from his moribund state, when the account of the mother to the Children’s Guardian (which was not challenged) suggests that L was by then sleeping through the night, a situation that would also have been commensurate with her then age.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The parents’ evidence as to who found S in his moribund state contained a number of inconsistencies.  The mother maintained that it was she who found S to be unresponsive 15 minutes or so after she had been woken by L and after she had finished tending to L’s needs.  However, as noted above, there are passages in the father’s police interview and history in medical records that suggest the opposite.  In particular, the father stated during the course of the 999 call, which call I am satisfied took place only moments after it was realised that S was not responding, that “It’s when I picked him up, he’s obviously...he was...I don’t know what was wrong with him but he was fucking...he weren’t there.” In oral evidence the father sought to suggest this was a reference to his having taken S from the mother. Again, I note that during cross-examination by Ms Edmunds the father, apparently unwittingly, at one point stated “I did not have the best mental state and I find my son like that”.   The overall approach of the father was to claim that he could not remember the circumstances that pertained early on the morning of 2 June 2019 but then give answers that demonstrated a clear recollection of certain events.  For example, in one answer he would state that he would never forget the way S presented at that point before claiming that he had no memory of events only minutes before but then stating confidently that he had at no point during the incident changed S’s nappy and recalling that he had undressed S as he knew being overwarm could cause convulsions.   He could not say whether he had left the room to fetch milk for L upon being requested to do so by the mother but that this is ordinarily what he would have done.  Following this, the father asserted that he had fallen back asleep or was in the process of falling asleep when the mother raised the alarm regarding S.  </p>

Against this assertion, the mother’s descriptions to the police of looking at S’s chest to see if he was breathing and her picking him up by putting her hand “underneath his head and bum”.  When cross examined by Ms Edmunds the mother accepted that these statements tend to suggest that S was on his back when found, although she continue to deny that this was the case. During his oral evidence, in chief and during cross-examination, the father maintained that in addition to not having seen S go to sleep on 2 June 2019, he had not seen him wake up some 5 hours later before the mother picked him up.  Within this context, the father’s evidence was that he could not say whether S was sleeping on his front at the point the mother picked him up.  As I have noted however, certain of the responses by the father to the police and medical staff act to gainsay that assertion.  </p>

Namely, she contended that she had seen S with his face down into the pillow, a scene that she described as being “unforgettable”.  The mother further contended that seeing S face down had caused her to “turn his head a little bit”.  The mother conceded that she had never before given that account to the doctors, police or in her written evidence to this court.  Moreover, the mother was taken to a series of entries in her police interview, in the medical records and in her statement that directly contradicted the account.  For example, in her police interview the mother had said “when his head has been to the side in the morning when I actually woke up.”  During her oral evidence, the mother further claimed to have informed the father at the hospital that she had seen S face down in the pillow, before claiming only to have remembered that this is what happened some 15 months later in August or September this year.  She was not able to explain how she had informed the father on 2 June 2019 of a fact she claimed only to have remembered some 15 months later.  The father disputed that he had been told by the mother about S being found face down before this hearing.  In cross examination by Mr Stonor the father reiterated that he had never been told by the mother that she had found S face down. The mother claimed also to have told someone else, who may have been her solicitor or a social worker, but offered no further evidence of this.    </p>

Notwithstanding this, she maintained her account that it was some 15 minutes after she woke, during which time she concentrated solely on feeding and changing L, that she first thought to check on S, notwithstanding he had never previously failed to wake during the night.  In the circumstances on both parents’ account S would have been next to them during the 15 minute period the mother was dealing with L but the court is being asked to believe that at <span style="font-style:italic">no</span> point during that time did either parent notice S was face down in a pillow in the context of him for the first time having not woken during the night.  When cross-examined by Ms Edmunds the mother contended that, notwithstanding that S was face down in the pillow she stared at him for a “second or two” and moved his head rather than reacting by picking him up.

Within this context, and as I have noted above, the father had contended that he had thrown away the SIM card ending 101 immediately before the police attended the family home to search that property.  Whilst the father sought to maintain his account that this was the result of his “tidying” the property prior to the police visit, as astutely pointed out by Ms Edmunds in the crossexamination of the father, the photos taken by the police during <span style="font-style:italic">that</span> visit show dirty nappies <span style="font-style:italic">in situ</span> notwithstanding the father’s claim to have tidied the property in preparation of the police search, as well as other evidence that no tidying had in fact taken place. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">On the balance of probabilities, I am satisfied that the parents have colluded to conceal their telephone, text and social media communications proximate to S’s collapse by deleting messages from the mother’s telephone and disposing of the SIM card from the father’s phone.   It is plain that the lies conceded by the father in relation to the telephones were each designed to avoid the interrogation of the SIM card ending in 101, which was a SIM card in use by the father at the time of S’s collapse.  The father’s lie regarding the mother taking the Alcatel phone and giving him her iPhone for use at hospital was designed to place the Alcatel phone in the mother’s hand with a view to asserting she had locked the SIM card ending in 101.  The lie regarding the purchase of the SIM card ending 103 to replace it was designed to reinforce the story regarding the former SIM card being locked.  The disposal of the SIM card ending in 101 was to prevent that SIM card being interrogated by the police.  I am satisfied that the father was plainly not telling the truth when he claimed it was disposed of as part of an exercise to tidy the house before the police search.  The disposal of the SIM card immediately prior to the attendance of the police is further indication that it was disposed of in order to keep the contents of that SIM card used by the father at the time of S’s collapse from the police and from the court.  Within this context, I am also satisfied that the most likely explanation for the missing messages on the mother’s phone is that those messages were deleted as part of an overall effort to sanitise the communications between the mother and the father that took place before, at the time of and after S’s collapse. </p>

I am satisfied that the lies told by the parents, and the efforts to mislead the court, have been deliberate, relate to the question of how S’s respiration came to be interrupted, arise from a fear of the truth becoming known and are clearly shown to be lies by other evidence. Whilst I have borne in mind in respect of the father the contents of Dr Shielhouse’s report and her opinion that the father has a longstanding difficulty with fabrication, I am satisfied that the lies told by the father in this matter are marked by the fact that they cluster around the discovery of S on the early morning of 2 June 2019.   Whilst I also accept that the father was a drug dealer in the relevant period, it is of note that he did not advance this as an explanation for deleted messages or disposed of SIM cards.  At no point did he state that the explanation for his actions was that the phones in question were being used to deal drugs and not disposing of them or deleting messages would have put him at risk of adverse action by the police, those who supplied drugs to him and/or those he supplied drugs to.  Within this context, I am satisfied that the lies and obfuscation practiced by both parents in this case were designed to disguise the truth of what happened to S.    </p>

In summary, in reaching this conclusion I have in particular (a) concluded that I can place only limited weight on the conclusion of Professor David that the event that resulted in S’s breathing being interrupted was most likely an natural event, (b) placed weight on the exhaustion of the parents and the stressed and toxic nature of the home environment on 1 to 2 June 2019, (c) placed weight on the fact that the parents engaged in the practice of co-sleeping with L and that the father had previously fallen asleep whilst holding S, (d) placed weight on the unlikelihood of the parents being woken by L close to or at the point S has suffered a naturally occurring respiratory arrest, particularly where the evidence is clear that L ordinarily slept through the night, and (e) concluded that the inconsistencies in the parents’ evidence and the dishonest conduct in which they have engaged with respect to the circumstances of S’s collapse further increases the likelihood that that occurrence was a non-natural asphyxial event rather than a poorly understood natural event.    </p>

Within this context, and accepting that parents can lose their temper for the first time and seriously harm their child, I am satisfied on the basis of the evidence of Professor David that S’s injury is not consistent with a sudden and momentary loss of control by a parent.  Further, I am satisfied on the basis of Professor David’s evidence that in order to consider intentional suffocation as a cause for S’s interrupted respiration the court must, given the degree injury to S, contemplate a parent who has been able to maintain the obstruction of S’s airway whilst tolerating him fighting and struggling to live for a period of up to 60 seconds.   In my judgment, when viewed in the context of the evidence with respect of the parents in this case, this markedly reduces the probability of deliberate suffocation by a parent being the mechanism of asphyxia I have identified as having occurred in this case.   </p>

Following the birth of S professionals recorded that the mother was responsive to both children, offered good levels of comfort to assist in soothing the children and was emotionally warm in respect of each of them.  During the course of her evidence the mother displayed, both verbally and in her reactions, a very obvious emotional warmth towards the children when she spoke of them. Within this context, and accepting that the mother neglected the children’s needs and exposed them to a risk of emotional and physical harm, there is no evidence before the court that the mother engaged in physical conduct towards the children such as to cause them harm, whether in temper or otherwise.  The longer standing concerns of the local authority in respect of the family centred on neglect and a failure to meet properly the children’s needs rather than on physical abuse or unexplained injuries. </p>

I am also satisfied that the father has, on at least one occasion, stated that he hated S and could throw him against a brick wall.  That conclusion is consistent with his short temper, his erratic and aggressive conduct when under the influence of drugs and alcohol and his well-evidenced doubts about paternity.  However, whilst as with the mother, accepting that the father neglected the children’s needs and exposed them to a risk of emotional and physical harm, there is no evidence before the court that the father engaged in physically abusive conduct towards the children such as to cause them harm, whether in temper or otherwise.

Both parents admit that L was taken into the bed with the mother, and remained in the bed when the father moved into it at some point prior to 5.00am on the morning of 2 June 2019.  Both admit that the father had in the past fallen asleep whilst feeding S and failed to rouse when S was removed from him, the father conceding that it was possible he would not remember these incidents due to the influence of drink or drugs, he having used both heavily in the days prior to 2 June 2020.   </p>

Further, the mother stated in evidence that she would use her “own little tactics” when she was exhausted to comfort a child because it was “easier”, that L would be “a big comfort’ to her, and that sharing a bed with your child is “an amazing feeling.”   On 2 June 2019 the parents were each exhausted for the reasons set out above, the father had been using drugs and alcohol heavily in the preceding days.  Within this context, the mother had also been under extreme emotional pressure by reason of the conduct of the father over the previous number of days, including the discovery of his infidelity and his conduct with DB and, therefore, likely in need of comfort that the father was not giving.

Given that both parents were aware of this incident, and that the evidence shows they spoke about the circumstances of S being discovered moribund prior to the arrival of the paramedics, I am satisfied that both parents were aware of the circumstances of S’s collapse and that the fact that they both failed to tell doctors of the incident of 1 June 2019 at the first opportunity speaks to collusion between them.  I am likewise, again for the reasons I have given, satisfied that each parent sought to obscure their telephone, text and social media communications for the period before, during and after S’s injury.

I am not satisfied that the acknowledged level of acrimony between the parents, both at the time and now, gainsays this conclusion in circumstances where both parents have, through dissembling, obfuscation and dishonesty, each demonstrated an individual desire to hide their manifest parenting failures from the court.   </p>
