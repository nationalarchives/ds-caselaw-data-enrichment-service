Centrally, it does not alter the general rule on the burden of proof. Where there are a number of people who might have caused the harm, it is for the local authority to show that in relation to each of them there is a real possibility that they did. No one can be placed into the pool unless that has been shown. This is why it is always misleading to refer to 'exclusion from the pool': see Re S-B at [43].

	      <span style="font-style:italic">To guard against that risk, I would suggest that a change of language may be helpful. The court should first consider whether there is a 'list' of people who had the opportunity to cause the injury. It should then consider whether it can identify the actual perpetrator on the balance of probability and should seek, but not strain, to do so: Re D (Children) [2009] EWCA Civ 472 at [12]. Only if it cannot identify the perpetrator to the civil standard of proof should it go on to ask in respect of those on the list: "Is there a likelihood or real possibility that A or B or C was the perpetrator or a perpetrator of the inflicted injuries?" Only if there is should A or B or C be placed into the 'pool’. </span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic">[64]  Any Court conducting a Finding of Fact Hearing should be alert to the danger of such a serious finding becoming 'a bolt on' to the central issue of perpetration or of falling into the trap of assuming too easily that, if a person was living in the same household as the perpetrator, such a finding is almost inevitable. As Aikens LJ observed in Re J, "nearly all parents will be imperfect in some way or another". Many households operate under considerable stress and men go to prison for serious crimes, including crimes of violence, and are allowed to return home by their long-suffering partners upon their release. That does not mean that for that reason alone, that parent has failed to protect her children in allowing her errant partner home, unless, by reason of one of the facts connected with his offending, or some other relevant behaviour on his part, those children are put at risk of suffering significant harm. </span>

In his oral evidence having been shown a further image of B in hospital he was clear that from that picture a convergent squint was present. He confirmed he would have expected the health visitor to look for and note any convergent squint present at the six week check and so it was unlikely it was present on 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2019.   </p>

However, there was no note of RICP by the treating neurosurgeon and it would be very unusual on a baby where the skull sutures are not closed. He accepted that squint is seen as a non-specific response to head trauma and is suggestive of an intracranial event prior to admission. The presence or not of convergent squint did not change his opinion on mechanism/cause and does not assist on timing.  </p>

The acute i.e. white blood seen over the cerebral hemispheres and a thin film over the cerebellum, could be dated to somewhere between 0 and 14 days old. However, as the blood is bright white, it was in her view more likely to be closer to the earlier part of that age range than the later. In this second scenario, the older component of the blood would be difficult to age but could be somewhere between 1-3 weeks of age. It could however be older as the density of the subdural haematoma over the cerebral hemispheres is complicated by acute bleeding.  </p>

She noted that when infants with pre-existing head injuries, such as a chronic/subacute subdural haematoma, are followed over time, small spontaneous rebleeds within or around the original bleed are often identified on subsequent imaging. Therefore, she accepted it is possible that the acute bleed over the cerebral hemispheres could be attributed to rebleeding. However, as the acute haemorrhage seen in the posterior fossa is separate from the enlarged subdural spaces over the cerebral hemispheres that cannot be explained by rebleeding. In addition, rebleeding into the subdural haematomas over the cerebral hemispheres could not explain B’s dramatic collapse. </p>

The left knee fractures overlap with both date ranges. He accepts that theoretically, particularly if one considers the opinion of Dr Arthur, that there could be a single episode that caused all the fractures. But he was clear that that was not probable. Dr Watt offered a clear rationale for that opinion: the different healing presentation of the metaphyseal fractures as opposed to the ribs and, in particular, that there was no evidence of any healing on the 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> rib fracture whereas there is established bony healing on the metaphyseal fractures. These different stages of healing would be consistent with two separate incidents at different times.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.04in">In giving a paediatric overview of the injuries, he concludes that B presented with clear clinical features of physical abuse: at least two shake injuries causing the head injuries and the retinal haemorrhages and at least two incidents causing the rib fractures and leg fractures. The rib fractures were most likely caused by a single compression force to the chest consistent with shaking. The leg fractures were caused by multiple twist/pulling events. The force required to cause the fractures would be outside normal, even rough, handling. Taken together there were probably at least three incidents if it is accepted that the rib fractures happened slightly before the acute event leading to collapse on 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2019.

He was not swayed in that view under cross examination. He was not concerned at the paramedics describing B as presenting with normal observations; being of the view that 10 minutes between the 999 call and the paramedics arrival was sufficient for a child to recover. He did not think it increased the likelihood of a delayed presentation. The court also notes the phone calls made by the father at 7.12 pm and 7.13 pm may well suggest that there was a very short delay between the injury and the parents calling for the ambulance. He notes the child is reported as being well during the day. The breathing difficulties described by the family friend’s mother and sister are very non-specific and B’s subdued presentation does not assist. In his view, the dramatic change in B’s condition as reported on the 999 call is the key to timing. </p>

The paternal family in contrast gave evidence that all was not actually well in the relationship between the maternal family and the father. The paternal grandmother and the paternal great grandmother described difficulties between the father and the maternal grandmother; the father having told them the maternal grandmother was racist and on one occasion she had gone to hit him whilst holding A.

The paternal great grandfather said that the father would be aggressive and punch walls and would damage the TV and phones by throwing them. He also had a terrible reputation at work and couldn’t keep a job, saying he was mardy and a coward. It was also his view that the father used his mental health and he questioned whether there were really any genuine problems, describing the father as a fantasist who tells lies.  </p>

The paternal great grandmother’s evidence was particularly difficult and fractious in her exchanges with counsel for the father. It is clear that she believes her grandson has caused these injuries to B. She is angry, defensive, intolerant and indignant at what she perceives to be the lack of focus on B and the case it appeared her grandson was pursuing against his mother. Whilst that kind of response is not helpful within the court arena, one can perhaps understand paternal great grandmother’s reaction to cross-examination as a very natural one in light of her vehement belief that her grandson has caused very significant injuries to her great grandson and now, it appeared, was seeking to deflect responsibility by accusing his mother of some elaborate plot to harm B. One can understand why it all seemed somewhat bewildering.   </p>

I am satisfied that to some degree that coloured their evidence and they were prone to exaggeration and inaccuracy.

There were no other marks to his body nor did he show any signs of distress. There were no concerns. At about 11 am they went to the paternal great grandparents’ home. They were there for a couple of hours and left at approximately 2:30 pm. She took B straight home to his parents. Nothing remarkable happened. </p>

In any event she says she asked the parents what had happened and the father informed her that A had fallen on him. She says she asked for more detail about it and the father said that A had slapped B in a playful toddler way. The father said he had then slapped B’s hand and that he would not be doing that again.

Throughout her evidence there was not the least sign of aggression or any capacity to have violently and in cold blood injured a baby. There is also nothing in her past to suggest she would be capable of such actions.

Indeed, the details of those notes were not for the most part challenged: the thrush, nappy rash and presence of bruises. It is difficult to understand why within those contemporaneous notes she would lie about what she had seen and was being told, particularly on matters such as the explanations given by the father for the bruising when he accepts the bruises were there and is reported to have given similar accounts to others albeit differing in the detail.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">There has been some criticism of the paternal grandmother’s evidence regarding what the father said to his GP on 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> September, and in particular whether he described seeing B going red and blue and feeling like he was not safe around him. The GP note does not record him making those comments and the Court is satisfied that the GP would have recorded any such concerns given the safeguarding implications. I do however note that in her police interview on 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> October 2019 the paternal grandmother says the father told her this on the way to the GP which may provide one explanation for the inconsistency with the GP’s record.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Overall, I am satisfied the doubt over the reliability of her evidence regarding the GPs visit does not undermine the overall credibility of her account. She may well have exaggerated what was said by the father either directly to her or to the GP when she reported back to her parents. But for the most part I found her to be a reliable historian of fact.  </p>

The paternal grandmother’s concerns have been described at various points as malicious and groundless; a difficult argument to make when sadly it turned out that she was right.  </p>

She says she didn’t hear anything apart from the father speaking to him.  All was fine. The next thing that happened was that the father banged on the bathroom door saying help.

On the second time she told the father to ring an ambulance because he wasn’t really coming back round. The mother thought this all happened from the father going upstairs in about 7 minutes.

Whilst both parents have been consistent in saying B was in the sole care of the father as the mother was looking after A in the bath/shower, there are elements of the account which are concerning. The father gives a detailed account to the police of B crying, having a tantrum, being distressed and that he was trying various ways to soothe him and get him to settle immediately before he went ‘limp’. Despite accepting the baby monitor was downstairs, the mother’s evidence is that the only thing she heard was the father at one point talking to B in a perfectly calm way.  As her evidence is that she was just in the process of getting herself and A into the shower/bath in that she had just started to run the shower and was getting A undressed when the father banged on the door, it doesn’t fit that she would have heard nothing of what the father describes was happening upstairs. The timing does not make sense. It is also not clear how the two unanswered phone calls at 19.12 and 19.13 would fit with that timeline. The detail does not ring true.  </p>

All three of them are agreed the Moses basket incident with A was not particularly concerning at the time and B did not respond as if injured or hurt. The way in which this information is given to the police is highly suggestive that there had been careful discussion between them as to what to say to the police.  It would certainly be difficult to believe there had been no discussion at all between the father and the mother as to what happened and what they could say to the authorities. It’s also difficult to believe that once they discovered B’s injuries they did not discuss matters with the family friend who had had care of B twice in the week before admission to hospital as to whether anything happened, or indeed with the family friend’s mother.

He then says B was crying, screeching with anger and throwing a tantrum. He was agitated. In his first statement to the court he describes B as screaming so much that his face went red then blue. He put B in his bouncer for a minute to let him calm down. He describes him as going red and throwing his body and then stiffened himself up. The father says that wasn’t working so he picked him up to try to soothe him.

He was questioned at great length about his mental health and its impact upon him.  He was able to talk about his mental health and his difficulties freely and articulately and without any apparent difficulty. Indeed, whilst quite possibly a feature of his illness, he appeared somewhat self-absorbed by his mental health. That is reflected in the nature and extent of his messages to the mother throughout September and may lie at the root of the paternal family’s view that he plays on his difficulties. I note, just as one example, that in his police interview, he complains that at the hospital his family were only interested in B and not him. He observes that they were not there for him. The court also noted a significant change of demeanour when being challenged by counsel for the paternal grandmother about his memory difficulties. He notably became much more hostile and defensive in the face of less sympathetic questioning.  </p>

It is clear the father was insecure and jealous and that the father was subtly seeking to restrict her contact with friends. There are, for example, unpleasant text messages about the family friend on 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September with the father making clear he did not want her around. Similarly, he messages her: “And you don’t need friends babe. Life isn’t about friends”. It is clear to the court that the father demanded the mother’s sole attention.  He expresses frustration and anger when she does not respond immediately to his texts. This accords with the concern of the family friend’s mother that the father  ‘suffocated’ the mother in the relationship and had her on a short leash.  </p>

The court observes that although the family friends gave clear evidence that they were told by the mother that she caused the bruise by winding, it is accepted by the mother and the father that it is quite possible the father sent the text. The father was clear to his mum that he caused the bruise on B’s cheek by winding albeit the details differed. Winding is not accepted by Dr Austin as a plausible explanation.

B’s discharge from hospital was therefore really the first time the mother was caring on her own without the maternal grandmother being around.

The opportunity being not only the occasions that the paternal grandmother had care of B and could have inflicted the injuries upon him but also doing so in the knowledge that the injuries would either be noticed, or, resulted in such a concerning reaction that the parents would seek medical attention leading to the injuries being discovered.

Notably, however, during the times she cared for B she did not spend very much time on her own with him. She was largely engaged in visiting other family members. The court also notes, in particular, that the window for the rib fractures (within which she had care of B being 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> September) another of her sons was in the house with her. It is highly implausible that she would calmly and coolly break B’s ribs whilst her son was nearby in a different room and knowing her parents would shortly be arriving to visit. </p>

There would have been no obvious external sign of injury by way of bruising or swelling.

Whilst the mother is young and relatively inexperienced, the presence of bruising on a non-mobile child is a clear cause for concern.

On the basis of Dr Austin’s evidence, those two incidents cannot necessarily be causatively linked to the first abusive head injury. It is however significant that medical attention was not sought from either the hospital or the GP. Nor was it raised with the health visitor on 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September despite that providing an obvious opportunity to do so. Nor did the mother raise it with her close family and friends, despite the family friend having overnight care shortly after the reported incidents. That in and of itself constitutes, as is accepted by the mother, a failure to seek medical attention. She was unable to offer a credible explanation as to why she did not. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">It is also clear on the evidence before the court that mother was fully aware of the serious nature of the father’s mental health difficulties. Whilst she may not have been told all the details, she did know he was hearing voices, hallucinating, was expressing suicidal thoughts and was extremely depressed. That must have been deeply concerning, even frightening for her. Yet she did nothing to safeguard the children or protect them from exposure to the father’s difficulties. She did not seek any assistance from the health visitor or any other professional regarding the father’s presentation.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">It is also difficult to conceive how mother could have had no knowledge of the pressures and strains that led to the repeated abuse of B when they were living so closely within the same household. This was a couple who everyone described as joined at the hip. The father was never alone with B without mother being somewhere in the property. It is difficult to conceive how she could not have seen or heard anything of concern. The very short-lived separation after B’s admission to hospital and the contents of the messages passing between the parents is indicative that she knew more as to what was happening than she now discloses. Certainly the content of those texts is almost exclusively focused on the parents’ needs and their relationship rather than B, their very sick child.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The court must consider these factors within the wider context of the parents’ relationship and the very revealing oral evidence mother gave about it. It is clear to the court that at the time of B’s injuries both parents were completely absorbed by their relationship and, indeed, remain entirely enmeshed. It is striking that mother is able to give a  detailed description of why the parents argued at the hospital following B’s admission: describing how she felt ignored, excluded, non-existent, over-looked and that B didn’t want her, yet struggles to recall key details about the injuries to her son. It illustrates where her focus was and still is.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The mother’s continuing strong feelings, emotions and loyalty towards the father were abundantly clear in her evidence. It was evident in mother’s extreme difficulty and patent distress in accepting that the father injured B. The court has no doubt that were if not for these proceedings, and despite accepting the father has caused the most serious injuries to her children, she would still be in a relationship with him. She describes how she tries to forget about it because it is upsetting; that she doesn’t want it to be true. In my judgment that is indicative of her mindset now and during those fatal weeks whilst B was at home. The mother simply did not want to know. She wilfully turned away. In my judgment she has demonstrated a sustained inability to prioritise the needs and safety of the children over her relationship with the father. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Finally, the court has to consider and balance its earlier finding that mother has not been fully open and honest within these proceedings. As already noted above, the fact she has lied is not direct proof of guilt on matters on which the Local Authority seek findings. But if the mother does not lie to protect herself as perpetrator of these injuries, it is a reasonable inference to draw that she lies to protect the father. </p>

It was however still limited to a handful of occasions and as is clear from her surprise at the father’s derogatory comments about her, it was not perhaps apparent to her as to the extent of the tension and difficulties. There is also nothing within the communications between the mother and the family friend that discloses to the family friend the mother’s struggle with the children or concerns about the father.

That lack of honesty in the face of a child having suffered such very significant injuries is deeply troubling. It is reasonable to infer that the reason for that lack of candour – if not to protect herself – is out of misplaced loyalty to protect the parents at the potential expense of ensuring safe decision making for B and A. </p>

I am therefore not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that such a finding is made out. However, in light of the concerns expressed by the court about the family friend’s lack of candour in these proceedings and the implications for safeguarding children in her care, I would give permission for my comments to be disclosed to her college so they may consider them in determining whether the family friend can return to her course.   </p>
