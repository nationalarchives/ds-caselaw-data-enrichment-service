The Court first made Interim Care Orders on 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2019 which have continued to be renewed. The children have remained with their mother under the aegis of the Interim Orders. A fact-finding hearing was scheduled to be heard in May 2020 but was adjourned in consequence of the restrictions required by the public health crisis. The hearing was adjourned until 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2020. It has been conducted as a Hybrid hearing, by which is meant that some of the witnesses have given evidence via a video conferencing platform whilst some have attended in person and spoken from the witness box. The children’s father and his legal team have been in court throughout as have the Local Authority’s. The Guardian, who was ‘shielding’ for much of the case, has attended remotely and her lawyers have attended court as and when they considered it necessary to do so. The mother and her lawyers have also alternated between attending court and joining via video conferencing platform.</p>

The court is sizeable. It can accommodate 18 people under the regulations, though no more than 14 have ever been present. Court staff have been vigilant to ensure rigorous hygiene standards. I should like to pay tribute to them not merely for their considerable efforts but also for creating an environment in which all involved have felt comfortable and safe.

In response to a 999 call, made by the father, at 19:39, an ambulance arrived at 19:45. Paramedics identified that infant N (the youngest of the siblings with whom I am concerned) was pale, unresponsive showing poor respiratory effort. The paramedics commenced bag valve mask resuscitation. A second crew arrived minutes later and established the closest hospital as X Hospital. N’s airway was secured with a laryngeal mask airway and monitored. N’s heart rate began to drop and he went in to cardiac arrest. Intra osseous access was gained to establish a drug route and three cycles of adrenalin were administered along with Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). This was all in accordance with Advanced </p>

He became agitated at the delay caused by the operator’s necessary enquires. <span style="font-style:italic">“come on its wasting time this!..”</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">“he’s gonna die!, he’s dying.”</span> He was asked when the fall had happened and he replied, <span style="font-style:italic">“just now, just now!”</span> In response to the question <span style="font-style:italic">“What caused the fall?”</span> F responded, <span style="font-style:italic">“he was just with my.. youngest on well either way he’s [inaudible] the bed, while I was just going getting a towel… he just fell off.”</span> The telephone call was recorded and transcribed. I have listened to the recording and read the transcript. The seriousness of N’s situation is all too clear.  The operator asked F to count between  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">N’s breaths. The interval is disturbing to listen to and resulted in the operator immediately instructing F on the mechanics of CPR. It is important to note that F now denies that he was <span style="font-style:italic">“going to get a towel”</span> at the point he claims that N fell. He accepts, as he is bound to, given the recording, that he said this during the course of the call, but he is at a loss to understand why he should have said it. He attributes this error to his general distress at the time. Experience reveals that the first account of an injury may be significant both for the medical profession and forensically more widely. I highlight these passages because they are F’s first account of what he claims happened to his son.  </p>

I am also bound to observe that, notwithstanding the wide array of expertise garnered to assist this investigation, this rather striking detail has received little attention. I asked the father, in simple terms, how he thought N came to land in that position. He told me that he had <span style="font-style:italic">“no idea.”</span> Neither do I nor does it seem anybody else in the case has. Though I will analyse the mother’s circumstances later in this judgment, it seems to me pertinent to observe that this is a question that I might have expected her to ask F about and return to, given his own response, as I have recorded it. </p>

	      <span style="font-style:italic">“Mother told me that on Thursday evening of last week [N] was a bit unsettled. She gave him some Calpol before putting him to bed. On Friday morning mother took [N] and [K] to a Play Centre with some friends and he seemed fine. On Friday afternoon mother was getting [N] ready and putting him into the car seat ready to go and pick up his brother, [L], from school. He then had a fit with shaking of all four limbs and he became unresponsive. This lasted for 2-3 minutes. Mother called an ambulance; it took about an hour and a half for the ambulance to come by which time [N] was recovering. They were taken to X Hospital where he was assessed in A &amp; E and then transferred to the ward for a while. Mother said that when he arrived in A &amp; E he did have a fever. Mother says she spent some time with [N] in the A &amp; E Department and then went to the ward. At 11.00 p.m. on the Friday [N] was discharged with a diagnosis of a febrile convulsion due to viral tonsillitis. Mother said that on Saturday he was still ‘a bit off’, so not quite back to his normal self, but by Sunday he was back to normal. On Monday and Tuesday he appeared well and on Tuesday he was eating and drinking normally. Mother says she gave the boys their tea and then went out to work at about 5.30 p.m.. Father said he did his normal routine which included bathing [N] and putting on his pyjamas. He then put [N] in the top bunkbed in the children's bedroom along with his three year old brother, [K]. Father said that his seven year old brother, [L], was in the same room on his laptop. Father said that he left [N] at the pillow end of the top bunk. The ladder is at the other end, which is the only gap in the railings. [N] was on his back .. playing with a balloon when father went outside. Father went onto the landing to sort out the children's clothes and do some ironing. Father said the next thing he heard was a thud and went in and found [N] on the floor. His head was next to the ladder of the bunk bed. Initially [N] cried. Father picked him up and then he went floppy. Father said he noticed some blood in his mouth. He then decided to take [N] downstairs so that he was away from the other two children. Father says he put [N] on his side as he had been advised to do this after he had the febrile convulsion. Father then called the ambulance and was advised to put him on his back and to do CPR. Father said he was concerned that there was a lot of blood in [N’s] mouth so he did not do any breaths for him. He was advised to start chest compressions and was about to do this as the ambulance arrived. Father said that [N] had been very well and happy in his bath earlier that evening. Father had sent a photo to mother from his phone showing [N] looking happy. [N] was born at term by normal delivery. Apart from this attendance at X Hospital for the febrile convulsion he is previously fit and well. Developmentally he is crawling and rolling. His two older brothers are fit and healthy. There is no family history of any bleeding problems as far as parents are aware.” </span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic">Subdural haemorrhage means bleeding into the potential space between the thin arachnoid membrane which intimately covers the brain and the thicker dural membrane which lies between the brain and the skull. Subdural bleeding is most commonly the result of head trauma and can occur after accidental injury. In the absence of a history of a significant accident this pattern of bleeding raises the suspicion of a non-accidental head injury such as shaking or shaking and impact injury. Biomechanical modelling suggests rotational forces such as those generated by shaking with or without impact are important factors in causing subdural bleeding. The bleeding is described as acute which means recent. There was no bruising or swelling evident to [N’s] head. There was no evidence of any skull fracture on the CT scan. [N] was also found to have extensive swelling to his brain. During an episode of shaking damage to the brain itself which can occur via shearing and tearing forces through the brain. This causes secondary damage and swelling. [N] was also found to have extensive bilateral retinal haemorrhages. This means bleeding at the back of both eyes. Retinal haemorrhages occur in 70-80% of infants who have suffered subdural bleeding caused by shaking. Retinal haemorrhages can occur following severe accidental injury but again are strongly associated with inflicted head injury, particularly when they are extensive as described in [N]'s case. Miss A also described that [N] had perimacular folds in both his eyes. This is when there has been more extensive force to the back of the eye so that the retina is torn and this suggests significant major trauma.” </span>

I would not expect such a devastating brain injury or such widespread subdural bleeding or retinal haemorrhages from such a fall.

Ms G described MGM, in the course of her evidence, as being visibly distressed at this point. This, according to the family’s evidence, was an uncharacteristic betrayal of her emotions as she steadfastly maintains a stoic “stiff upper lip” approach to adversity, as it has been described. At the XYCH L did not feel able to go to see his brother and say goodbye. L was spoken to by DC H at the XYCH, and later that evening spoken to alone at MGM’s home. This was an informal enquiry, though notes were taken by DC H’s colleague, RS. I am perplexed as to why L was spoken to at the hospital, given the distressing situation he was in, nor do I sense that a great deal of thought had been given to the scope and range of the meeting at MGM’s home. It struck me as rather free flowing and discursive. DC H is plainly an experienced and committed professional and I am clear that she was sensitive to minimise any distress to L. DC H was at pains to point out that this conversation was intended to be no more than a preliminary inquiry. The purpose was to evaluate whether L should be interviewed in accordance with Achieving Best Evidence (ABE) guidelines.  </p>

Ms G did not consider L’s blunt account, with its striking lack of detail as being in anyway out of character for this particular boy. She described how, though L could be fulsome and enthusiastic when engaged, he was rarely instinctively forthcoming. She observed that whilst other children would spontaneously volunteer lots of information to her when they arrived at school, L would merely say “morning” and move on to his desk. I have a strong sense that Ms G liked L, whose school work was of <span style="font-style:italic">“good quality”</span>, whose manners she saw as faultless and whose appearance she described as <span style="font-style:italic">“always immaculate.”</span> She later shared with him that she too had lost a sibling when she was 7 years old. She told L that he could come and talk to her about his loss whenever he wanted. L did not take her up on that offer. He had little opportunity to do so as he moved to junior school at the end of the academic year. Ms G described L as <span style="font-style:italic">“a very black and white concrete thinker.” </span> She said that L lacked intuitive imaginative skills and drew from that a conclusion that L must be telling the truth. It is important to signal, as I did to Ms G, that L’s credibility is not in issue here. It is important to listen carefully to what he is reported as having said and to evaluate that in the broad canvas of the wider evidence. It requires to be emphasised that L does not recount seeing any fall and has never done so at any stage. I stress this because there are frequent references to “what L saw,” which has, on a few occasions, elided in to a misapprehension that he has said that he saw N fall from the bunk bed. He has not.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">At the commencement of these proceedings the Local Authority’s stated position was that it wished to investigate the evidence before advancing a positive case. By this I understood the situation to be that they intended to analyse the two competing hypotheses i.e. a fall or a shaking injury, before determining which they considered to be more likely, having heard all the evidence. Somewhat to my surprise, I am told that the Local Authority has been unable to resolve its dilemma and, at the conclusion of the case, is no further advanced in its thinking. Ms Heaton QC, on behalf of the Local Authority tells me that her clients remain securely pivoted “on the fence”. She has told me, twice, that she is “instructed” to advance a neutral position. Ms Walker, on behalf of the Children tells me that the Guardian is in the same position. For completeness, I record that the father contends this was an accident. The mother continues to support the father’s case. Manifestly, this puts the Court in an invidious position. Ms Heaton submitted that, notwithstanding the Local Authority’s inability to reach a conclusion, the Court could, nonetheless, properly determine that the injuries leading to N’s death arose in consequence of shaking and impact. Mr Vine QC, on behalf of F, submitted that the Local Authority’s position, when properly scrutinised, is that it cannot maintain that the “threshold criteria,” pursuant to Section 31(2) Children Act 1989, can be met on the basis of a shaking and impact injury. Sitting on the fence, Mr Vine contends, can only mean that the Local Authority, on its own account, has not established this aspect of their case to the requisite standard i.e. the balance of probabilities. I agree with Mr Vine.  </p>

I am careful not to characterise these as concessions but rather as a correct understanding of the applicable legal framework. Mr Vine recognises that it is intrinsic to the Article 8 rights of both these subject children, that the central factual dispute at the heart of this hearing should, if possible, be resolved one way or the other. He also, responsibly acknowledges, that such an approach does not compromise F’s Article 6 rights to a fair hearing, F having been aware of the allegation he faced and having had extensive opportunity to challenge the evidence both by the instruction of experts and in cross examination, presented by leading counsel.  </p>

It is not a comfortable position for the Judge to be placed in and in my view reflects an incomplete understanding of the approach of the court when weighing, assessing and generally evaluating the evidence at fact finding hearings. Logically, the Local Authority’s forensic approach should seek to foreshadow the court’s approach. It strikes me as necessary to consider the scope and ambit of the applicable law in greater detail than I had originally contemplated.  </p>

The conclusions of well-reasoned, carefully assessed expert evidence, free from dogmatism or defensive protection of amour propre, will always weigh significantly in the Court’s evaluation of the evidence as a whole. However, it will rarely, if ever, be determinative. Developments in medicine and imaging technology, most strikingly in the last 20 years, have displaced shibboleths and perceived orthodoxies across a range of clinical understandings and practice. Developments in neuro imaging, in particular, have enhanced understanding of the impact on the brain of a wide variety of organic illnesses and both accidental and non-accidental injuries. This progress has, or at very least should have, caused both the professionals and interested members of the public, to recognise that today’s mainstream prevailing professional consensus may, in the future, be disproved or refuted.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It is important to emphasise both facets of Wilson LJ’s reasoning in the above paragraph. A court should not dismiss a <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">“highly unusual”</span> hypothesis merely because it is rarely seen. However, there must be some <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">“demonstrably rare feature”</span> that establishes a possible <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">‘nexus’</span> between that feature and the injury, and which should be the subject of <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">“specialist appraisal at an early stage”</span>. The emphasis above is mine. It seems to me that these words have particular resonance in this case. By parity of analysis, a free-standing hypothesis that cannot root itself within, or gain any traction from the available evidence, becomes mere speculation. It may be that such speculation has a range of plausibility from ‘possible’ to ‘highly unlikely’ but to achieve evidential weight it must, in some way, be connected to reliable identifiable evidence. That may be within the wider medical interdisciplinary material but need not be confined to that and may be rooted in lay evidence, where that is found to be credible.  </p>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#323235"> 97 were cases of what is known as 'shaken baby syndrome'. The controversy to which such cases gives rise should come as no surprise. A young baby dies whilst under the sole care of a parent or childminder. That child can give no clue to clinicians as to what has happened. Experts, prosecuting authorities and juries must reconstruct as best they can what has happened. There remains a temptation to believe that it is always possible to identify the cause of injury to a child. Where the prosecution is able, by advancing an array of experts, to identify a non-accidental injury and the defence can identify no alternative cause, it is tempting to conclude that the prosecution has proved its case. Such a temptation must be resisted. In this, as in so many fields of medicine, the evidence may be insufficient to exclude, beyond reasonable doubt, an unknown cause. As R v Cannings, para [177] teaches, even where on examination of all the evidence, every possible known cause has been excluded, the cause may still remain unknown. </span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#323235">[2]     This court has heard, over a period of 3 weeks, three appeals concerning three babies, two of whom died, whilst in the care of a single adult. During the course of the trials a large number of medical experts were called. In two of the appeals what was asserted to be 'fresh' medical expert evidence was called. These three cases highlight a particular feature of cases where it is alleged a baby has been shaken in the care of a single adult. The evidence to prove guilt may consist only of expert evidence. It must never be forgotten that that expert evidence is relied upon to prove that the individual defendant is lying in the account he gives, either at the time or at trial. The correct management of such evidence is, therefore, of crucial importance in cases such as these. The correct approach to such evidence must be identified. If a conviction is to be based merely on the evidence of experts then that conviction can only be regarded as safe if the case proceeds on a logically justifiable basis. That entails a logically justifiable basis for accepting or rejecting the expert evidence (see R v Kai-Whitewind [2005] EWCA Civ 1092, [2006] Crim LR 349, para [90]). Hearing these three appeals in succession affords an opportunity to make observations on the correct approach and the management of such expert evidence.” </span>

Other seriously harmful behaviour, such as alcohol or drug abuse, is regrettably all too common and not at all improbable. Nor are serious allegations made in a vacuum. Consider the famous example of the animal seen in Regent's Park. If it is seen outside the zoo on a stretch of greensward regularly used for walking dogs, then of course it is more likely to be a dog than a lion. If it is seen in the zoo next to the lions' enclosure when the door is open, then it may well be more likely to be a lion than a dog.” </span>

Professor Ian Christopher Lloyd, Consultant Ophthalmic Surgeon and Paediatric Ophthalmologist at the Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, was instructed to provide an independent report. For much of his distinguished career Professor Lloyd has held a special interest in the ocular features of cases of suspected non-accidental injury. He is a member of the Ophthalmic non-accidental injury working party, convened under the aegis of the Royal College of Ophthalmologists which published the guidance in this area. It is also pertinent to note that Professor Lloyd was a member of the Child Protection Ophthalmology Injury Group which critically surveyed and appraised the Ophthalmic literature concerning shaking injuries. In his report dated 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2020, Professor Lloyd reports having examined over 170 infants suspected of suffering non-accidental injury since 1991.  </p>

However, he emphasises that bilateral haemorrhaging to this degree is entirely atypical in the context of a fall. Usually retinal haemorrhages following a fall are minor, unilateral (this he stresses as significant) and occur on the same side as a co-existent intracranial haemorrhage. Additionally, they are characteristically constrained to the posterior pole of the eye. Retinal haemorrhages in such cases are usually mild and do not extend to the peripheral retina.

To put it another way, if we as clinicians and pathologists regard our findings as near incontrovertible to incontrovertible evidence of a non-accidental event based on sound prior shared and agreed experience such a position nevertheless needs to be reconsidered when supplemented by additional evidence seriously challenging such a position. For example, if CCTV imaging is obtained confirming an accidental injury event previously regarded as implausible, the whole equation changes – to insist that a nonaccidental injury event remains on balance the most likely explanation might still be valid as a general rule, but becomes untenable in the particular case under scrutiny. Should the relevant circumstantial evidence obtained in this case prove credible to any Court I would have to accept that father’s account is true. The specifics of the accidental scenario under consideration in this case might further be an exceptional explanation for the fatal outcome and full injury profile obtained, but in my opinion such specifics (height and possible manner of fall and impact) introduces a reasonable prospect of causing a fatal head injury, allowing me to reconcile the account provided with the tragic fatal outcome.” </span>

This resonates with the evidence of Ms KB, Paramedic, who, during the course of her safeguarding report, told the operative (as recorded) that her safeguarding instincts were triggered from the outset by the fact that <span style="font-style:italic">“a 9-month-old baby was on the top bunk bed in the first place”</span>. It should be noted that this observation occurs in the context of a very sympathetic response to the distress of both parents. I refer to it here because I consider it to underscore that which can be easily lost sight of in the complexities of the medical debate i.e. the factual circumstances in which it is said the fall took place are themselves both alarming and unusual; the constellation of injuries caused by the fall are atypical to a degree which has never been seen before by the doctors.

In the context of the neurological evidence he contributes a perspective of experience from a specialist regularly evaluating paediatric head injury in children, the majority of whom survive their injuries. Self-evidently, this is a very different perspective from that of the pathologist whose experience, by definition, must concentrate on the examination of patients who have died from various pathological processes. Dr Stoodley considers the neuroradiology of a whole range of treatments referred for imaging in a wide spectrum of head injuries from a variety of causes across the spectrum of severity.  </p>

He added to this that in the context of domestic injury it is, in itself, unusual to see injury to the brain. The central hypothesis, as I have foreshadowed, put to Dr Stoodley and to Professor Lloyd, is that the angular mechanism of the fall might have mimicked flection/extension of the kind seen in shaking cases. It was suggested that some whiplash reaction to the fall could contribute to the mimicking of the neurological and ophthalmological signs. Dr Stoodley made, what I consider to be, a real attempt to reconcile this hypothesis with the neuroradiology.  He was clear that a consultant in this sphere should <span style="font-style:italic">“never say never”</span> but his approach was to seek to contextualise the possibility of a fall by reference to the totality of the imaging and from that perspective he concluded that if the court found that a fall from the bed had occurred as described, he regarded it as very unlikely that any injury sustained from such an episode could be reconciled with or unify the scan features. In response to Mr Vine’s direct question, Dr Stoodley stated <span style="font-style:italic">“I don’t feel I can reasonably explain the constellation of imaging findings as an impact injury; even where short distant falls give rise to fatality the imaging is very different.” </span>Dr Stoodley agreed with Mr Vine that “every fall is different” but insisted that in the context of a domestic head trauma he would <span style="font-style:italic">“not expect to see brain injuries, particularly bleeding in the spinal canal”</span> and, further, that <span style="font-style:italic">“in the range of trauma he has seen”</span> he had not <span style="font-style:italic">“seen anything like this”</span>.

The parameters of the dispute in this case have become, as is clear from the above, confined to a central dispute as to whether the ophthalmic and neurological signs strongly associated with shaking/shaking impact injury could have been mimicked by a fall from the height described. It is however necessary for me to conclude this review by reference to the evidence of Dr P H T Cartlidge and Dr Tim Lawrence, Consultant Paediatric Neurosurgeon.  </p>

He is an Associate Editor of Archives of Disease in Childhood. Dr Cartlidge described himself as having “got off the fence”. He told me that “if he were N’s doctor” he would consider that the injuries were caused by a single traumatic event, of which a fall from the bunk bed is the most likely cause. Dr Cartlidge said, in evidence, that he “deferred to the ophthalmologists and pathologist”. I consider that </p>

Manifestly, he was not agreeing with Professor Lloyd’s conclusions. Dr Cartlidge stated in his evidence that he had been involved in low level falls with retinal haemorrhages in practice and, during the course of his evidence, tried to find in his records examples of such cases and to assess how serious they were.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I repeat, the professional consensus in this case is that retinal haemorrhages, as numerous and as diffuse as those seen here, have not been encountered professionally by any of the doctors, in the context of low-level falls. Neither does the extensive research that I have been referred to establish that they may occur in such a context. Again, I emphasise loudly and unambiguously that none of this drives me, automatically, to exclude this possibility. Dr Cartlidge considered that if N fell onto his head, in ‘free fall’, that might have been a sufficiently high energy impact to explain the neurological and ophthalmological signs. I am inclined to accept Dr Cartlidge’s view that N was not at a sufficient stage of development to be able automatically to break his own fall. I do not understand any other witness to take issue with this. I note that, in his report dated 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2020, Dr Cartlidge recognised that on his interpretation this was a ‘statistically unusual case’, but he perceived it to be unusual in any event for <span style="font-style:italic">“a 9 month old infant to free fall such a distance”</span>. I interpret that to mean the distance is considered by Dr Cartlidge to be the unusual feature rather than the “free fall” mechanism. It would seem to me to follow from Dr Cartlidge’s reasoning, that any infant of this age, of normal development, would be unable to break a fall instinctively.   </p>

I hope Dr Cartlidge will not think me in anyway discourteous, but I considered his remark, in fact, to be illuminating rather than clumsy. Doctors in clinical practice must of necessity evaluate the reliability of the account given to them in order to factor it in to a differential diagnosis. Doctors by and large assume their patients are being truthful if not always entirely accurate. Lawyers do not start with that same assumption. Whether F’s account is reliable is a matter for the court to assess, having had the benefit of evidence across a wide range of medical and factual issues. Dr Cartildge’s conclusion is inextricably linked to his assumption that because he can reconcile the clinical features with the ‘proffered history’ F’s account becomes the most likely cause. Whether there was a fall or not is a matter to be determined by this court. </p>

As an infant’s head is unsupported and large, relative to their body, the head moves rapidly from the extremes of range, forwards and backwards. Veins bridging the subdural spaces and subarachnoid spaces may then rupture resulting in widespread, multicompartmental, acute subdural and subarachnoid bleeding. Rapid, forceful, movement of the spine and limbs, during shaking could cause damage to the nerve roots with evidence of bleeding and damage to the nerve tissue as seen in N. The act of shaking would require the perpetrator to grasp the infant around the chest. Bruising might be expected to occur at the points where the infant was held. There was no evidence of bruising to N’s body recorded. None the less shaking remains a likely mechanism to cause the combination of injuries seen.</span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic">resulting from N’s head making forceful contact with an unyielding object, with additional rotational movement of the body, following a fall from approximately one and a half meters would be unlikely to cause the constellation of injuries seen. With such a mechanism, one would expect there to be external evidence of injury in the form of soft tissue swelling over the site of impact, skin abrasions, bruising or lacerations. However, it is possible for infants to suffer intracranial injury without soft tissue swelling. A skull fracture might be expected but it is also possible that a skull fracture could be absent following impact trauma causing intracranial injury in an infant. The presence of a skull fracture and scalp swelling is disputed in this case and it is for the court to decide on the presence or absence of a frontal fracture beneath an area of scalp swelling that was seen at post-mortem but not on clinical examination. A fall from a height of approximately one and a half meters onto a carpeted floor would be sufficient to cause a traumatic brain injury. The severity of the traumatic brain injury suffered by N is considerably more severe than would be expected following a fall from such a height. The distribution of injuries is also inconsistent with an impact trauma where a predominance for one side over the other might be expected, causing more localised traumatic lesions. There is evidence that low level falls can cause significant, lifethreatening brain injuries in infants. Plunkett performed a retrospective review of falls in infants and children and found 18 cases of death following low level falls. However, the specific pattern and anatomical location of injuries seen on N’s scan and at post-mortem would be unusual following impact trauma. The spinal and nerve root injuries seen at post-mortem are more difficult to explain following an impact trauma compared with a shaking trauma. Rotational movement of the body at the point of impact would be required if the fall was the sole cause of the injuries. Death in infants following a fall from one and a half meters is extremely rare, therefore, robust evidence from post-mortem studies does not exist that might help us understand whether such spinal and nerve root injuries, suffered by N, are an expected or recognised finding. </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">MRI is becoming more common following various different mechanisms of trauma, and it is evident that spinal subdural blood is not a frequent finding following accidental trauma. The spinal and nerve root injuries identified at post-mortem may also not be evident on clinical imaging in children who have survived the injury. Consequently, it may be appropriate to state that the injuries suffered by N are unlikely, on the balance of probability, to have occurred following the fall, but insufficient evidence exists to safely state that it is not possible for the injuries to occur following the mechanism described.” (my emphasis) </span>

I do not want in any way to shrink the scope and ambit of the medical evidence that I have heard, but I do consider it necessary to identify a clear consensus to the effect that whilst a shaking/impact injury most readily explains the key medical evidence, it does not exclude the theoretical possibility of it having been caused by a fall from the upper bunk, if that fall mimicked the rotational/accelerative/decelerative forces more commonly seen in shaking/impact injury. There are shades of difference between the experts as to how likely “the fall” explanation is but all agree that the starting point is that it is unlikely. I should record that Dr Cartlidge did not seem to agree this enthusiastically, perhaps not at all. On this I reject his view as unsustainable for all the reasons set out in the opinions of the other experts.  </p>

Both the language they used and the incidents they alight upon have a striking similarity. I considered that F seemed to display little, if any, insight into the impact of some of his more fastidious traits on M’s general sense of well-being. As I have said, both parents identified the example of an argument which arose because of F’s displeasure with untidiness in the car. It did not seem to occur to F that a mother with three children under 7 might be permitted some latitude when it came to keeping the inside of a car clean. Nor did M seem entirely to grasp that it might be F rather than herself at fault in this situation.  </p>

Even the arrival of Professor Lloyd’s report did not, it seems, awaken any doubt in her. Her identification of what I find to be underlying stresses in her relationship with F, however, was both spontaneous honest, entirely free from vindictiveness and was not, in my assessment in anyway designed to undermine his case. Paradoxically, this only serves to make her evidence about the difficulties in the relationship all the more compelling. I sensed that M was too tired, too overwhelmed by her grief even to sense that some of Ms Heaton’s questions on these issues were guided to identifying any dynamics within the parent’s relationship which might indicate heightened levels of stress within the household which might have elevated N’s vulnerability.  </p>

The contact is supervised by the maternal grandmother (MGM). It is obvious from what everybody has said that F and MGM hold each other in some esteem. I am sure the social workers consider that MGM must have sufficient objectivity about the issues in the case and the risk F must be deemed to present, to be able to exercise authoritative and independent supervision. I have not heard from MGM but the evidence I have heard has not reassured me on this point.  </p>

Without F’s considerable input, I have no difficulty in understanding why ‘standards’ may have slipped a little in F’s perception. It was obviously a recurrent theme. It played a significant part in her decision finally to separate from F. Though M asserted that she and F were happy prior to 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2019, my impression was that their differences in parenting style and their approach to general standards and routines around the home was longstanding.

I am equally clear that she appreciated that by taking them to live with her mother they were moving to less than ideal circumstances. She told me, in a way that I found to be utterly convincing that <span style="font-style:italic">“anything was better than being at that house”</span>. She was pressed as to whether she left in order to put a barrier between the children and the father. This she flatly rejected.

The couple had at best, 45 minutes or so together before M left for work. F had described this routine as often feeling like “ships which pass in the night”. The supermarket is only ten minutes away, but M left at 5.30pm. Both the parents explained that she sometimes did this because of the delay at traffic lights. M and F told me that there had been no problems between them that day. Neither expressed themselves to be under stress due to the pace of their lives or their respective workloads. Though N was teething at the time, both parents said this had caused no trouble or extra burden to either of them. Neither expressed having experienced any continuing stress following N having become unwell on 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2019 and suffering a febrile convulsion on the 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> June.

Unfortunately, the injection, which was to have been given on 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2019 could not go ahead. F accepted, in response to questions from Ms Heaton, that he was sometimes in pain during the day, particularly when he had been standing. He had been prescribed Naproxen, an anti-inflammatory.

[L] remained upstairs with [N] and [K] with me downstairs. I watched a bit of television and gave [N] a baby snack he likes. I washed and sterilized [N’s] bottles and it was then bath time. By this time bath and bedtime routine had changed a little. [M] had been back at work for about 2 weeks. It was more difficult to try and bath all 3 boys at the same time and so I tended to bath [N] only on the nights [M] was at work.

I know that you should not pick babies up if you don’t know the injuries as it could make them worse but my instinct was to pick him up which I did straightaway. I held him under his arms facing me so I could look at him. I saw blood on his mouth and then his eyes started to roll back, his head lolled back and he went floppy. I was worried he was going to have another fit. The hospital had told us if he did we should lie him on his side. I told the boys to stay in their room and took [N] straight downstairs holding [N’s] body against my chest. I cannot remember if I supported his head or not. I put [N] on the living room rug on his side. I saw blood in his mouth and he was struggling to breath at this point. I therefore rang 999 and asked for an ambulance. I think that this was at about 7.40pm. From this point I stayed on the phone to the 999 operator. I remember that she was asking for lots of details such as [N’s] date of birth and all I wanted was an ambulance to come. At some point I think the boys had come downstairs as I remember they were there when the ambulance arrived… I have read in the papers that it is said I asked [K] if he had pushed [N].

There are other casual examples revealing F’s vigilance to his children’s safety (see para 104 above). NX was asked whether she would ever have thought that F would cause a serious shaking/impact injury to N. She told me she would never have believed it.

The language is not consonant with the event. It simply lacks the grief, guilt and despair that would consume any parent in such a situation. As I have noted, Ms KB, Paramedic, was instantly alerted to safeguarding issues on these related facts alone. It strikes me that if this had truly been the mechanism by which N came by his fatal injuries F would not have described them in this manner. In the intense focus on the competing medical hypothesis, these simple realities have been lost sight of. F is describing an accident which involves him acting entirely out of character, for no apparent reason and describing the event in language which is incongruent and jarring.  </p>

I asked him, in the witness box, whether he had, since his interview, developed any idea of any manner of fall that could have led to N landing in this position. He told me that he could not. I am bound to say neither can I, nor has anybody else suggested how landing in this position might have occurred. Mr Vine’s riposte to this is to draw from the medical evidence the undoubted fact that the position in which the body lands is not an indicator of the mechanics or nature of the fall. This I accept but, with respect to him, that is a different point. Whether a fall involves the accelerative/decelerative features that might mimic a shaking injury is a different question from the simple enquiry as to how, whatever the nature of the fall itself, N’s body could have landed face down at the bottom of the ladders.  </p>

He says that he picked up N’s body and went downstairs to conceal N’s obviously very serious condition from his brothers. He placed N’s body on the rug. F then claims to have realised that he needed the mobile phone and called L to bring it downstairs. None of this sounds particularly coherent but I, of course, accept that </p>

What I do find to be significant is that F told the ambulance service at a time when he correctly appreciated that his son was dying that <span style="font-style:italic">“oh he sort fell off bunk bed…”</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">“he fell off his bunk bed high up, he’s only 9 month old, oh my god I can’t believe it!”. </span>A little later he is recorded as saying <span style="font-style:italic">“He was with my youngest son on… well either way he’s [?] the bed while I was just getting a towel he’s just fell off”</span>. F completely denies the accuracy of this though, as it is recorded, he accepts he said it. He has no explanation as to why he might have said it. It is not reconcilable either with the account he gives to this court or that which he gave to the police in interview.</p>

The history she records states “he had fallen off a bunk bed. <span style="font-style:italic">“I asked if it was a top bunk bed to which he replied yes. I do not remember the exact dialogue, but he implied he had only left him for a few seconds, as he had been distracted by another child who was in the bathroom and needed assistance.” </span>Ms P was confronted with a baby on the sitting room floor with a small amount of blood around his mouth but with no other visible markings. He was unresponsive and making poor respiratory effort, breathing at two respirations per minute. It was obvious that this baby was in real difficulty. It is perhaps hardly surprising that N was Ms P’s, focus rather than noting the exact dialogue. However, Ms KB who was the last paramedic to arrive at the scene noted what was said, filed a statement in these proceedings and gave evidence. A transcript of her safeguarding referral, made shortly after N had been taken by ambulance to hospital, has been filed in these proceedings. The following extract is relevant: </p>

It is of course admissible in these proceedings but must always be treated with appropriate caution. Ms B has a strikingly clear and detailed recollection of that evening, which may not appear obvious from the transcript of the call but is much clearer in the recording, to which I have listened (at Ms Heaton’s request) and in her evidence. N is clearly a patient who has stayed in her mind. She was absolutely clear that NP told her that F reported that he was bathing the children and had put N on the top bunk. She was clear that Ms P said, <span style="font-style:italic">“he’s gone to get the other child out of the bath and then he’s come back in. I don’t know if he’s heard him fall or whether he’s gone in and found him on the floor.

Ms P was also entirely proper in recognising and acknowledging that her own recollection of what F said was incomplete. As Ms Walker notes F’s response to Ms P’s evidence was that she was “making it up”. He later moderated this but, so that he is clear on reading this judgment, I reject his suggestion.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">For all the reasons identified above it is obvious that I must treat L’s account with great care. F has, I consider, largely accepted that it is likely that L overheard at least part of his call to the ambulance service and thus perhaps aspects of his account of a fall. In any event I consider it likely that L will have heard the call. It is also clear that R may well have overheard discussions within the family about a fall. The grandfather is reported as urging the family to <span style="font-style:italic">“keep it down” </span>when discussing what had happened in order not to be heard by the children. This occurred after N had been taken to hospital on the night of the 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2019. If, as is contended, L was “fixed to his computer” and did not see a fall, it seems to me likely that he would have accepted F’s account as he overheard it. As his teacher said, he is a concrete thinker, somewhat lacking in imaginative capacity. He would have had no reason to disbelieve his father. It would not have occurred to him that F might not be telling the truth. </p>

L’s assertion to DC H to the effect that F was downstairs with A.. <span style="font-style:italic">“before [N] fell”</span> is strenuously contested as inaccurate by F. It strikes me that it may be that L has conflated his own lived experience with his attempt to absorb F’s account. Certainly, there was a point when L was upstairs alone. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The emphasis in the above extracts is mine, to assist in contrasting L’s own responses to DC H. During his “preliminary interview” L volunteered, apropos of nothing,: <span style="font-style:italic">“Dad has put N on top of the bunk bed before”</span>. As is clear from the above, this is said by F to have happened on only one previous occasion. F volunteers in his interview: <span style="font-style:italic">“[L] would have been there”</span>. I note that F does not say “L was there”. I also note that F was not describing anything remarkable, merely having placed his son on the top bunk on a previous occasion when absolutely nothing happened. Accordingly, I can see no reason why L would even have noticed this, let alone remembered it and, entirely uncharacteristically, volunteered it in interview. I was struck by how Ms G was so clear that L was rarely forthcoming in ordinary social exchanges and I remind myself again that she described how L would never volunteer anything to her unless she probed it by questioning. She told me that when she did ask L about e.g. what he had done over the weekends he would happily tell her. Left to himself he would simply say “morning” and move on. I have already recorded DC H’s observations relating to L finding it easier to respond to closed questions (see para 21). When I consider the notes of DC H’s interview it is striking that apart from the above L rarely, if at all, volunteers’ information which is not in direct response to the specific and usually closed question asked. Virtually the only piece of information spontaneously volunteered in the interview is this line: <span style="font-style:italic">“Dad has put N on top of the bunk bed before”</span>. This was a response to a different question namely: <span style="font-style:italic">“How was Dad before [N] fell?”</span>. R’s response to the question, proffered at the very end of the interview, does not strike me as authentic, it is far more consistent with the delivery of a message that L feels he is required to. I do not know whether L is repeating something he has heard or whether he has been coached by F. I am satisfied that L is unlikely to be relating his own recollection. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In her evidence M told me that she did not think it was appropriate to speak with L about events surrounding N’s death. However, she unexpectedly volunteered, during the course of cross examination, that as long ago as October 2019, L had spoken to her about that night and told her that N was going to the <span style="font-style:italic">“edge of the bed”</span>, and so he went to find F who said, <span style="font-style:italic">“just a minute”</span>. M told me that she confronted F about this. She considered it to be so important that she waited outside the house in order to avoid being overheard by the children. As Ms Heaton points out this is not significantly different to what L had told DC H. It is difficult to see what emphasis M was placing on it and why she felt it necessary to confront F outside, in the way she tells me she did. She created the very clear impression that she had been troubled by what L had said and was unhappy, even angry, with F. On M’s account F seemed equally troubled by what M told him. Despite M’s attempt to keep this from the children, she told me that F went inside the home and went straight upstairs to confront L about it. NX, who was in the house at the time, manifestly thought his behaviour was inappropriate and said to him words to the effect of <span style="font-style:italic">“you shouldn’t be doing this”.</span> There is no doubt that this was a significant confrontation but the dissonance between what is reported to have been said and the reaction of the adults is striking. I infer that something far more troubling than I have been told was related that day. NX of course, was entirely right in her admonishment of F. He should not </p>

This, I assume, was one of the reasons NX was there to supervise F’s contact and to ensure that L was protected from such questioning. It is equally clear that F went upstairs with the purpose of straightening out L’s recollection and that by acting in such a hasty way against the advice of his partner and her sister his interests in speaking to L were his own and not his sons. All this serves to enhance my concern, set out above, relating to the authenticity of some of L’s observations to DC H.  </p>

It was, of course, M’s birthday. Given that the couple had barely spent any time together that day, M’s lack of response seems odd. Similarly, given the horrific news F communicated to M after the ambulance had arrived, the reasons M gives for failure to respond to F’s subsequent phone calls, does not strike me as convincing. This was plainly an emergency. Additionally, the couple rarely communicate, I was told, by telephone but prefer to send SMS messages and snapchat. I am bound to say that I would have expected M to have had the phone close to her and, given that she responded to F’s original call, I cannot see that she would have put her phone on silent mode. I emphasise that M has not said that she put her phone on silent, she insists that she had only one priority, namely to get home. Accordingly, I am asked to accept that she drove home listening to her phone ring out and declining to answer it. Again, I understand entirely the instinct M articulates, nonetheless I struggle to understand why, in such extremis, she did not respond at all to F’s insistent calls.   </p>

There is all manner of reasons why one would have expected M to answer the phone in the heat of such a crisis… most obviously F might have been telling her to go directly to the hospital. On his account, which M does not dispute, F told her, on that short phone call, that the ambulance was already there when he was calling her. Both parents have denied that there was any argument or upset between them that evening, but I am unable to rely on the disavowal of either.

Once the court comes to the conclusion, as here, that the adult’s account cannot be relied upon, it is driven back to the wider evidential canvas which, inevitably, can only be constructed from the available thread. The task of the court remains: to identify such facts as it can; to evaluate each of the expert opinions; to identify reliable evidence from which inferences may reasonably be drawn. The court will then weigh this evidence to arrive at such conclusions as it can, on the balance of probabilities.  </p>

In fact, on reading Ms Heaton and Ms Walker’s closing submissions, it strikes me that they do not, ultimately, follow the logic of their own reasoning to its inevitable conclusion. Both cast significant doubt on F’s reliability as a witness. On the evidence that I have identified they were, in my judgement, bound to. Ms Walker correctly identifies that an assessment of F’s credibility is intrinsically linked to the plausibility of F’s account of the fall. It follows that if F is himself implausible, as a witness, the account he advances is also weakened.  It does not follow, automatically, that as I am unable to rely on F’s evidence his explanation of a fall must be discounted. I have reminded myself that individuals in such circumstances may lie for a variety of reasons. I considered L’s evidence with particular care to see whether it can lend real credence to the explanation F advances. For all the reasons analysed above I have come to the conclusion that L’s evidence does not provide such support and not merely because he has never given any account of seeing a fall.  </p>
