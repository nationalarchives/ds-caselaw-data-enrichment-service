In that capacity she was responsible for the ordering of supplies.  She would deliberately over-order and sell off the surplus food, usually in city markets, keeping her employers in ignorance of what can only be described as her theft from them.

It is inherently unlikely that the equivalent of £1.3-1.5m could have been saved in cash by H’s mother and concealed in her siblings’ homes even taking into consideration her account that in the late 80s she diversified into the buying and selling of textiles.  The vast majority of Ukraine was poor at that time.  It would be naïve of me to assume that there was not some sort of black market, but I find it inconceivable that this size of fortune could have been achieved largely from a stall in a market.  </p>

In 2003 she moved from her 3 roomed apartment to another flat.  It cost just $10-20k more than her previous apartment which is not suggestive of her having much wealth at the time. </p>

She doubts very much that he had that sum of money available at that time to give away and she says it is inconsistent with a letter which H read to her in 2002 in which she says GS said that she wanted to make no financial claims whatsoever against H.  GS and H deny that there was any such letter and I consider that this is an example of W gilding the lily.  I cannot see why GS should have written such a letter.  Although she has had a successful career in banking, she was in 2005 very much a middle manager with a student child who needed support.  If she is right, as I am willing to accept, that she had played a significant part in assisting H in creating wealth, it would be surprising if she was willing to give up her claims so easily.   </p>

It is important to point out that there is a distinction to be drawn between a contract entered into in anticipation of divorce and one predicated on the continuation of the marriage.  This falls into the latter category. </p>

	      <span style="font-style:italic">69. The safeguards in the consultation document are designed to apply regardless of the circumstances of the particular case, in order to ensure, inter alia, that in all cases ante-nuptial contracts will not be binding unless they are freely concluded and properly informed. It is necessary to have black and white rules of this kind if agreements are otherwise to be binding. There is no need for them, however, in the current state of the law. The safeguards in the consultation document are likely to be highly relevant, but we consider that the Court of Appeal was correct in principle to ask whether there was any material lack of disclosure, information or advice. Sound legal advice is obviously desirable, for this will ensure that a party understands the implications of the agreement, and full disclosure of any assets owned by the other party may be necessary to ensure this. But if it is clear that a party is fully aware of the implications of an antenuptial agreement and indifferent to detailed particulars of the other party's assets, there is no need to accord the agreement reduced weight because he or she is unaware of those particulars. What is important is that each party should have all the information that is material to his or her decision, and that each party should intend that the agreement should govern the financial consequences of the marriage coming to an end. </span>

Such a conclusion would fit in with when the documents were submitted to Companies House.  It also fits in with the family emails at around this time.  I am not impressed also with the fact that the company’s registered name was given as being an address which did not become its registered address until 12 October 2018, months after documents prepared by the family had given that as the company’s address.  W’s argument that this slip spills the beans that all the documents must have been prepared after that date is only superficially attractive.

I have documentation which points in different ways and it is inconclusive.  The evidence is insufficient for me to make any finding that H has purchased the property.  I say that notwithstanding the fact that the evidence shows that as late as December 2019 documents in relation to the property were still being sent to the OR Property, in particular a document saying that completion was soon to take place followed several months later by a package from Florida attorneys. </p>

If they feel unable to form a conclusion they have used the term “inconclusive”.  They have explained that to mean that they are unable to express an opinion which would assist the court.  The term covers an opinion which might have been expressed on a fine balance.  It does not mean 50:50 but covers a number of degrees on either side.  Above that are the terms limited positive evidence, moderate evidence, strong evidence, very strong evidence and conclusive evidence, although other comparable terms are sometimes used. </p>

There is only one rule of law, namely that the occurrence of the fact in issue must be proved to have been more probable than not. Common sense, not law, requires that in deciding this question, regard should be had, to whatever extent appropriate, to inherent probabilities. If a child alleges sexual abuse by a parent, it is common sense to start with the assumption that most parents do not abuse their children. But this assumption may be swiftly dispelled by other compelling evidence of the relationship between parent and child or parent and other children. It would be absurd to suggest that the tribunal must in all cases assume that serious conduct is unlikely to have occurred. In many cases, the other evidence will show that it was all too likely. If, for example, it is clear that a child was assaulted by one or other of two people, it would make no sense to start one's reasoning by saying that assaulting children is a serious matter and therefore neither of them is likely to have done so. The fact is that one of them did and the question for the tribunal is simply whether it is more probable that one rather than the other was the perpetrator.” </span>

It is therefore extremely difficult to draw any firm conclusions about H (or on his case the family’s) percentage ownership. H places this at 16.5% and W asserts it to be at least 50%. The registered shareholding as at 22 January 2019 lists Mrs S as holding 33.5% but notes that she holds 17% of those as nominee for E Ltd. H accepts that, for a time in 2018, 50% was owned by his offshore company SOM Ltd but he again asserts that this was as bare nominee on the basis of private agreements and that it does not reflect his true beneficial ownership at any time during the company’s history.  </p>

W instructed Grant Thornton to review that report but there were substantial limitations on what they could do due to the lack of access to the company’s full books and records.  All they were able to conclude was that they were unable to see why any valuation as at April 2019 would not be at least equal to the value of the business adjusted net assets which were some £10m.  As they had no access to relevant documents, they could not begin to assess what the proper valuation might be.  I am in no better position.   </p>

Her schedule of costs puts the financial remedy total at £1.67m.  Bearing in mind that this case has overrun by some 3 days, the figure is only likely to be revised upwards.  If interest charged by the litigation lenders is added the total comes to some £2.25m.  Additionally, she has incurred £204k by way of costs in children proceedings with another £90k by way of interest and fees.  Thus, her total expenditure on costs is between £2.5-2.6m inclusive of interest.  This is a very large sum in the context of this case and is to be compared with £305k paid by H, £105k paid by AS and approximately £200k paid by GS.  Amalgamating their costs to a total of £610k and excluding interest costs and children’s costs, W’s costs of the financial proceedings are still some 2.5 times that which has been spent by H, AS and GS.   </p>

Doing the best that I can, I have determined that the sum to be shared between the parties after giving those credits is £16m.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">At the end of the day I have to fix a figure that is fair in all the circumstances of the case.  My award for a clean break is £8 million, which is inclusive of the property assets held in W’s name and which were given to her during the marriage. This represents a sharing award above W’s needs, and it will permit her to fund any further litigation in Ukraine without having to have recourse to the needs-based award.  I shall hear counsel as to what properties shall be used to meet that award. </p>

This is in no sense a criticism, but this long judgment would become impossibly lengthy if I was to deal with every single argument and point raised.  I have attempted to take into account all the important matters.  Simply because I have not referred to it does not mean that an argument has been overlooked.  </p>
