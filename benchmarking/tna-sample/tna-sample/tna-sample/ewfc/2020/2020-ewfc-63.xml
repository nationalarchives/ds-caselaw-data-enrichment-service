Indeed, so far as I am aware, and the very experienced counsel who appear before me do not dispute this, the case is unprecedented. Certainly, the researches of counsel have identified no decision directly in point. The applicant's own description is that his applications are "novel." I suspect that the initial reaction of most experienced family lawyers would be a robust disbelief that there is even arguable substance to any of it.  </p>

Mr Justin Warshaw QC and Mr Joshua Viney, appearing for the respondents, dispute that the court has jurisdiction to give the applicant the relief he seeks under the 1973 Act or the 1989 Act and dispute that the inherent jurisdiction can ever be exercised as the applicant would wish. Mr Tim Amos QC, on behalf of the applicant, contends otherwise. In support of these claims, Mr Amos seeks to pray in aid the applicant's rights under each of Article 2, Article 6 and Article 8 of the Convention, taken on their own, and, in any event, his rights under each of those Articles read together with Article 14 (he expressly disavowed reliance on Article 3).   </p>

In the interests of fairness, as they put it, it is necessary to remind the court of some of the features of what they call the applicant's own egregious conduct. Mr Amos rejects these complaints.  </p>

The applicant, as I have said, is their son. He has several educational and professional qualifications: he has a first degree in Modern History; he is a qualified solicitor; he has a Masters in Taxation, for which he studied at the Institute of Advanced Legal Studies; and he is now studying for his Chartered Tax Advisory and Law School Admissions Test examinations. As against that, he has various difficulties and mental health disabilities which there is no need for me to elaborate at this stage, though their true extent is not clear; they will become highly material if the matter proceeds. Suffice it to say that his case is that they constitute "special circumstances" as that phrase is used in section 27(6B)(b) of the 1973 Act and paragraph 2(1)(b) of Schedule 1 to the 1989 Act. That is disputed, as a matter of both fact and law, by Mr Warshaw and Mr Viney. The applicant's case is that he is in any event "vulnerable" as that word is used in the authorities relating to the inherent jurisdiction. That also is in dispute, but for the purpose of deciding the preliminary issue I am prepared to assume, though I emphasise without deciding, that he is indeed vulnerable in that sense. He has been unemployed since 2011. </p>

He characterises their stance as seemingly being that, having in fact, whether wittingly or unwittingly, nurtured his dependency on them for the last 20 years or so – with the consequence that he is, so it is said, now completely dependent on them –, they now seek to cast that dependency onto the State. He characterises their stance as being that the British state should pick up whatever is the appropriate "tab" for their son, rather than that he should be supported by his non-resident parents. He submits that "this proposition imports an obvious disconnect and should be rejected by the court, inter alia as a matter of policy." He invites the court to say that it has both the jurisdiction and the duty to protect the applicant, rather than abandon him now to the capricious decisions of his parents. He submits that the nature and style of their attacks on their son is another reason why the court should not leave his future in his parents' discretion. They </p>

In other words, all he should be entitled to do is to intervene with leave in his parent's suit for divorce, nullity or judicial separation in order to apply for financial provision. We do not think that it would be desirable to give a child (particularly an adult child) a power to take his parents to court to obtain finance because, for example, he wants to embark on a scheme of training which they are not prepared to support</span> (emphasis added)." </p>

Although the precise method for application varies, the principle of the present law so far as marital children are concerned is reasonably clear, namely that a child of 18 and over should be able, in specified circumstances, to obtain financial provision from his parents where their relationship has manifestly broken down. We therefore recommend that the Guardianship of Minors Act 1971 should be amended to allow a child who has attained the age of 18 to apply to the court in certain circumstances for an order for periodical payments or a lump sum. The result will be to confer on all children of 18 and over, not just those born outside marriage, a new right to apply at their own instance for financial provision if they are undergoing education or training or if there are special circumstances. The children of divorced or divorcing parents already in effect have rights to apply for financial orders by virtue of the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Downing v Downing (Downing intervening)</span> [1976] Fam 288 and we can see no sufficient reason why this right should not be shared by other children whose parents' relationship has broken down (emphasis added)." </p>

The simple fact, as Mr Warshaw and Mr Viney say, is that a child may apply for relief under section 27 only where there has already been an order in the child's favour applied for by one of the parties to the marriage. More generally, as they correctly put it, there is no free-standing jurisdiction under the 1973 Act for a child to bring a claim for maintenance against a party to a subsisting marriage.      </p>

This is the effect of section 23 of the Act of 1973 and rule 68 of the Matrimonial Causes Rules 1973. But it would be necessary for the applicant's father or mother to obtain the leave of the court under rule 68 (2). Since neither parent wishes to make such an application and since the child's right to financial provision is sanctioned by the Act a procedure must be found. The answer seems to be provided by rule 72 (2) [quoted] that is to direct that the children be separately represented on the application, either by a solicitor or by a solicitor and counsel."   </p>

It can only have been, as indeed he made clear, sections 29(1) and 29(3), read in the context of and in conjunction with section 23(1). But – and this is the important point – jurisdiction under section 23(1), in contrast to section 27(1), which itself specifies who may apply for relief under the section, is conferred not, as in the case of section 27(1), because someone has made an application but rather upon the happening of a defined event. This, as Mr Warshaw and Mr Viney point out, is why section 26 is needed in relation to section 23 but has no relevance in relation to section 27. Section 23, in contrast to section 27, does not address the manner in which applications are to be made or who can apply; that is governed by section 26. Accordingly, in my judgment, sections 23, 26 and 29 throw no light upon the true meaning and effect of section 27.  </p>

Section 27 is clear and restricts the circumstances in which a child may apply to those set out in subsections (6A) and (6B).

Who is, or are, the persons embraced in the words "each other" in the statutory language "living with each other"? The answer is supplied by the immediately preceding words "the parents of the applicant." So, by adding in a reference, as Mr Amos would have it, to someone else - "the applicant" - one is not construing the statutory language; one is adding words so as to change its meaning.  </p>

Although the concept of who are a couple for this purpose has changed down the years, section 54 of the 2008 Act, like section 30 of the 1990 Act, is clear that one person cannot apply. Section 54(1) could not be clearer, and the contrast in this respect – obvious to any knowledgeable critic – between adoption orders and parental orders, which is a fundamental difference of obvious significance, is both very striking and, in my judgment, very telling. Surely, it betokens a very clear difference of policy which Parliament, for whatever reasons, thought it appropriate to draw both in 1990 and again in 2008. And, as it happens, this is not a matter of mere speculation or surmise, because we know from what the Minister of State said in 2008 that this was seen as a necessary distinction based on what were thought to be important points of principle. </p>

That intent and effect, he submits is "particularly aggravated" by the fact, he says, that, on any view, the applicant must properly be viewed as a vulnerable adult, bearing in mind that the applicant  is "(a) very ill; (b) a danger to himself in terms of inter alia neglect; and (c) wholly unlikely to be able to get, far less maintain, any employment position at all, still less one commensurate with either his high intellect or the level of his education and educational attainment." Article 2 is engaged, he says, on the basis that, to apply the legislation in the restrictive way contended for by the respondents, would, or might well, where maximum state allowances represent only a small fraction of a severely disabled child's true and reasonable needs, result in a very substantial and serious risk to a/this disabled child's life.  </p>

Be that as it may, their short, and in my judgment irrefutable, point is that for Article 2 to be engaged the bar is high, and much higher than can here possibly be made out: they refer to cases such as <span style="font-style:italic">Osman v UK (Case 87/1997/871/1083)</span> [1999] 1 FLR 193, <span style="font-style:italic">Venables v News Group Newspapers Ltd and others, Thompson v News Group Newspapers Ltd and others</span> [2001] Fam 430 and <span style="font-style:italic">Van Colle v Chief Constable of Hertfordshire Police (Secretary of State for the Home Department and others intervening), Smith v Chief Constable of Sussex Police (Secretary of State for the Home Department and others intervening)</span> [2008] UKHL 50, [2009] 1 AC 225, as showing that what must be established is a "real and immediate risk" or a "specific and serious" threat to life.

He points to the editorial comment in the 2020 Red Book, para 2.233[1], p 488, that "the adult child whose parents are living together and for no valid reason are refusing to support him or her through university is in a <span style="font-style:italic">markedly worse</span> situation than an adult child whose parents have separated (emphasis added)." He submits that on this basis the law is fundamentally unfair and obviously discriminatory in the sense that it treats differently, and, he says, with no good reason, two identical people in otherwise identical situations.

It is, he says, classic "birth status" discrimination based on the child's parents' marital status. He submits that the marital status and living arrangements of the child's parents are clearly irrelevant to the child's objective needs and cannot be used as the basis to deny financial relief to a child of married parents in the situation of the applicant (that is, living in a separate household to both his parents) in contrast to the child with identical needs of divorced parents. This, he says, plainly constitutes unlawful discrimination. </p>

On this approach, he says, one of the "twins" has a claim under section 27 because of the previous order, while the other does not, "simply because of the accident of there being no previous order." This, he says, is reminiscent of the kind of immutable personal characteristic which is entirely beyond one's personal control and for which the Strasbourg court has consistently held there can be no objective justification.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">First, the suggested analogy with "birth status" is wholly false. The marital status of the parents at the date of birth (I ignore the subtleties deriving from the doctrine of <span style="font-style:italic">legitimation per subsequens matrimonium</span>) directly affects, indeed determines, the status of their child as legitimate or illegitimate. That status of the child, although derived from the status of the parents, is a status of the child recognised as such in law. It may be that when the parents have died the child also attains the status of an orphan. But the status of the parents as either divorced and/or separated (which is what we are concerned with here) has, in general terms, no effect in law on the status of their child. As Mr Warshaw and Mr Viney put it, legitimacy is a question of both birth and status. The distinction between adult children whose parents are cohabiting and those who are separated is neither. It has nothing to do with the birth of the adult child or the status of the adult child.  Likewise, the distinction between adult children whose parents are divorced and those who are not. This is why the reliance Mr Amos places on <span style="font-style:italic">Inze v Austria (Application no. 8695/79)</span> (1987), <span style="font-style:italic">Pla and Puncernau v Andorra (Application no. 69498/01)</span> (2004), <span style="font-style:italic">Fabris v France (Application no. 16574/08)</span> (2013), and <span style="font-style:italic">Wolter and Sarfert v Germany (Applications nos. 59752/13 and 66277/13)</span> (2017), is misplaced; for, as Mr Warshaw and Mr Viney point out, these are all cases of discrimination on the basis of illegitimacy. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly, in a case such as this the question in relation to Article 14 concerns the status of the child, not the status of the parents. The issue is, therefore, whether the applicant can bring himself within the relevant words of Article 14: "without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status." The asserted status here is being the child of parents who are either divorced (or not) and/or separated (or not). That is not a status included within the enumerated list, nor, in my judgment, is it an "other status" within the meaning of Article 14. It is, to repeat, a matter of status as between the parents which has no impact in law on the status of the child. Mr Amos has been unable to point me to any authority to the contrary; his failure is unsurprising. I am not aware of any authority suggesting that whether an applicant's parents are cohabiting or not (or divorced or not) impacts upon the 'status' of the applicant. </p>

What it addresses is this applicant's specific situation as an adult child who lives separately from cohabiting parents. Reading paragraph 2(4) in this way would leave a lacuna because the adult child of cohabiting parents who remains in the same household as the parents would, on the applicant's analysis be unable to seek the remedy he now seeks. In other words, there is a fundamental disconnect between the way in which Mr Amos invites me to read paragraph 2(4) and the discrimination upon which he relies, that is, the inability of an adult child whether or not he is living with them to bring a claim against cohabiting parents. Mutatis mutandis there is likewise a fundamental disconnect between the way in which Mr Amos invites me to read section 27 and the discrimination upon which he relies. </p>

It is, they submit, entirely legitimate and proportionate for the state not to intervene where a cohabiting relationship subsists.

This was never ever envisaged by the drafters of the legislation or by Parliament; in fact, as they point out, it was expressly disavowed.

But the choice of metaphor is revealing: the inherent jurisdiction is a safety net, not a springboard. And Lord Donaldson would have been the first to acknowledge that the inherent jurisdiction, whatever its theoretical reach, is, in settled practice, recognised as being subject to limitations on what the court can and should do.

'Hot pursuit' in the days of Lord Eldon LC conjures up the image of the coach and four labouring up Shap Fell taking the young heiress and her unsuitable paramour to the Scottish border and the blacksmith's forge at Gretna Green. Today it more probably conjures up the image of the potential teenage jihadist travelling by aeroplane to the Turkish border en route to join so-called ISIS in war-torn Syria. But we have to remember that the romantic or idealistic call to participate in foreign wars is nothing new: one has only to think of John Cornford who went as a young man, but in law still a minor (technically, in the language of the era, an infant), to fight in the British Battalion of the International Brigades in the Spanish Civil War, where he was killed in action the day after his 21st birthday. And, to bring this closer to home, financial disputes between parents and their financially dependent adult children have been with us for ever. Recall that familiar figure in Victorian and Edwardian culture, the remittance man. Yet it is a striking fact that, notwithstanding the prevalence of these disputes, there is no trace of them ever having been litigated. The law – that is, the common law and equity – never entertained a cause of action or claim between a financially dependent adult child and his parents, and this whether the child was illegitimate or legitimate, nor was there any process by which a legitimate adult child could have made such a claim.              </p>

Indeed, they say, the applicant cannot point to a single authority in which this or any other facet of the inherent jurisdiction has been invoked to require a party to pay maintenance.

Maintenance, they say, is essentially a creature of statute, because although at common law a husband was obliged to maintain his wife and, by extension, his minor children, that duty had no corresponding remedy when breached, save through the agency of necessity, by which a deserted wife could pledge her husband's credit. I agree. Long before the modern law emerged, a deserted mistress could claim maintenance for her illegitimate children under various statutes.

Like so many rights, the right extends only so far as the remedy to enforce it extends. There is no longer any agency of necessity and the common law has no remedy. The remedies to enforce a duty to maintain are the statutory remedies which are variously laid down in numerous statutes … One has the statutory framework in Sch 1 to the Children Act 1989, but when one looks beyond that one finds only specific statutory provisions." </p>

If they are to be free to withdraw their support, notwithstanding the level, depth, and intensity of his dependency on them, the reality, he says, is that the applicant will face the prospect of not only penury and degradation but also squalor and abuse. If he cannot claim under either section 27 or Schedule 1, then, says Mr Amos, it is only just and fair that the inherent jurisdiction should fill the legislative gap since, he submits, the adult disabled child of parents living together but in a separate household from their child is self-evidently just as deserving of financial relief as the identical children of parents living in households separate from each other. It is, he says, unreasoned and illogical to make this arbitrary distinction, and both are equally deserving of access to justice, of the court's protection, and of financial relief.  </p>

Between them, the 1973 Act and the 1989 Act provide a comprehensive statutory scheme dealing, along with much else, with the circumstances in which a child, including, as here, an adult child, can make a financial claim against a living parent (I put the point this way to make clear that I have not overlooked section 1(1)(c) of the Inheritance (Provision for Family and Dependants) Act 1975). More specifically, the legislation, in its general reach, applies to the applicant, as to every adult child, and is comprehensive in relation to cases falling within its ambit. Furthermore, as Mr Warshaw and Mr Viney point out, the legislation deals explicitly with the very claims the applicant seeks to make; indeed, in the case of the 1989 Act it explicitly prohibits the claim he seeks to pursue. There is accordingly, in my judgment, no scope for recourse to the inherent jurisdiction. To exercise the inherent jurisdiction in these circumstances would simply be to do what Lieven J has rightly said is impermissible.     </p>

Conventional wisdom and practice are that, in an appropriate case, the court will make orders in relation to secondary and tertiary education, the latter extending to one first degree course, but no further. Whether in addition an order will be made to cover a post-graduate professional qualification – qualifying, for example, to be called to the Bar or admitted as a solicitor – is, it would seem, an open question amongst practitioners, and neither I nor the very experienced counsel before me is aware of any case in point, reported or not. I would not want to be thought necessarily opposed to the making of such an order in an appropriate case, though I would require to be persuaded that it was right as a matter of principle. But it will be appreciated that the applicant's contention here goes much further, since he already has a first degree, is qualified as a solicitor and, indeed, has further qualifications. I make the point because I would not want it to be thought that by saying nothing I am somehow accepting that in this respect the law and practice extends anything like as far as the applicant asserts the court should go. On the contrary, conventional wisdom and practice would suggest that these provisions were never intended to be used and cannot be used to fund the education of a perpetual student. </p>

Their response the same day was that I should <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> embark upon a detailed analysis, followed shortly after by their written submissions in respect of that proposition. They complain that the applicant seeks to reopen the entire case and reconsider every single point – which is correct so far as concerns paragraphs 61-98 of the judgment. It is, they say, a fundamental abuse of process, a waste of court resources and puts the respondents to yet further costs. So far as concerns the contention that I should grant a declaration of incompatibility, this, they say, is a volte face, Mr Amos having, as I have already noted, specifically disclaimed any such application. </p>

As against that, as Mr Viney fairly acknowledges, such conduct must be unreasonable "to a high degree" for 'unreasonable' in this context "does not mean merely wrong or misguided in hindsight" and "whilst the pursuit of a weak claim will not usually, on its own, justify an order for indemnity costs, the pursuit of a hopeless claim (or a claim which the party pursuing it should have realised was hopeless) may well lead to such an order": <span style="font-style:italic">Noorani v Calver (No 2/Costs)</span> [2009] EWHC 592 (QB), paras 8-9.

This, with respect to Mr Amos, is a hopeless submission. I made a forensic assumption, to facilitate legal argument as to proper ambit of the inherent jurisdiction, that the applicant was vulnerable within the meaning of the authorities on the inherent jurisdiction. I made no finding of fact to this effect; indeed, in the order I made on 28 July 2020 the assumption was expressly stated to be "without prejudice to the respondents' case as to whether he is." Mr Amos also refers to the medical evidence filed on behalf of the applicant: the report of a consultant psychiatrist. Given the nature of the hearing before me on 12 August 2020, this has never been the subject of either cross-examination or submissions. Moreover, even if it be the fact that the applicant is vulnerable, it has never been suggested that he lacks capacity either to litigate or to manage his affairs; and the documents he has himself prepared demonstrate his intellectual abilities. Vulnerability does not confer a licence to litigate with impunity.   </p>

No adverse or immediate costs order would have been made against him had he still been in possession of a legal aid certificate. He should not now be penalised for the complexity of his case, which was clearly outside of his control. To this I would merely observe that the fact is that the applicant is <span style="font-style:italic">not </span>legally-aided and that, even if he were, this would not immunise him from the making of an order for costs, merely from its enforcement without further investigation and order. </p>

This, says Mr Amos, is an important factor which I can and should have regard to in deciding whether to make a costs order. This may be, but the simple fact is that, on my reading of the correspondence, the applicant was holding out for significant ongoing financial provision – and in that endeavour he has wholly failed. </p>

I have come very close to ordering the applicant to pay all the costs on an indemnity basis but am persuaded – just – that that would be to go too far. In relation to the costs down to the end of the hearing on 12 August 2020 I shall order the costs to be paid on the standard basis. For reasons which will be apparent (see for example paragraph 158) the position from 13 August 2020 onwards is significantly different. The abuse of process to which I there referred requires that these costs be paid on the indemnity basis. In relation to the first period the costs claimed amount to £63,420; in relation to the second period to £11,047.50. I summarily assess them in the sums of £47,500 and £9,925 respectively. </p>

Failure to comply with these directions (time to be of the essence) will debar the applicant from pursuing the claim and lead to the removal of the restriction.
