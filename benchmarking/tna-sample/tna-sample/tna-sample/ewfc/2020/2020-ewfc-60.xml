The extent of the evidence and the nature of the allegations which has required extensive forensic analysis, reflected unfortunately in the length of this judgment. I am concerned with a young boy, J (born in 2017), who is now aged 3 years and 8 months. J has been placed in foster care since 2 October 2019, initially accommodated, but since 24 October 2019, subject to an interim care order.  </p>

He has open to him the third alternative of saying that the party on whom the burden of proof lies in relation to any averment made by him has failed to discharge that burden. No judge likes to decide cases on burden of proof if he can legitimately avoid having to do so.

It requires a judge of first instance, before he finds that a particular event occurred, to be satisfied on the evidence that it is more likely to have occurred than not. If such a judge concludes, on a whole series of cogent grounds, that the occurrence of an event is extremely improbable, a finding by him that it is nevertheless more likely to have occurred than not, does not accord with common sense. This is especially so when it is open to the judge to say simply that the evidence leaves him in doubt whether the event occurred or not, and that the party on whom the burden of proving that the event occurred lies has therefore failed to discharge such burden. </span>

The absence of any history of a memorable event where such a history might be expected in the individual case may be very significant. Perpetrators of child abuse often seek to cover up what they have done. The reason why paediatricians may refer to the lack of a history is because individual and collective clinical experience teaches them that it is one of a number of indicators of how the injury may have occurred. Medical and other professionals are entitled to rely upon such knowledge and experience in forming an opinion about the likely response of the individual child to the particular injury, and the court should not deter them from doing so.

	      <span style="font-style:italic">‘[72] As to the seriousness of the allegation, there is no logical or necessary connection between seriousness and probability. Some seriously harmful behaviour, such as murder, is sufficiently rare to be inherently improbable in most circumstances. Even then there are circumstances, such as a body with its throat cut and no weapon to hand, where it is not at all improbable. Other seriously harmful behaviour, such as alcohol or drug abuse, is regrettably all too common and not at all improbable. Nor are serious allegations made in a vacuum. Consider the famous example of the animal seen in Regent’s Park. If it is seen outside the zoo on a stretch of greensward regularly used for walking dogs, then of course it is more likely to be a dog than a lion. If it is seen in the zoo next to the lions’ enclosure when the door is open, then it may well be more likely to be a lion than a dog. </span>

It may be unlikely that any person looking after a baby would take him by the wrist and swing him against the wall, causing multiple fractures and other injuries.

The inherent improbability of the event has no relevance to deciding who that was. The simple balance of probabilities test should be applied.’ </span>

But to attach any significant weight to such impressions in assessing credibility risks making judgments which at best have no rational basis and at worst reflect conscious or unconscious biases and prejudices. One of the most important qualities expected of a judge is that they will strive to avoid being influenced by personal biases and prejudices in their decision-making. That requires eschewing judgments based on the appearance of a witness or on their tone, manner or other aspects of their behaviour in answering questions. Rather than attempting to assess whether testimony is truthful from the manner in which it is given, the only objective and reliable approach is to focus on the content of the testimony and to consider whether it is consistent with other evidence (including evidence of what the witness has said on other occasions) and with known or probable facts.’  </span>

Here, the reliability of the hearsay material may be tested in many ways e.g., do similar issues arise in the records of a variety of unconnected individuals? If so, that will plainly enhance their reliability. Is it likely that a particular professional e.g., nurse or doctor would not merely have inaccurately recorded what a parent said but noted the exact opposite of what it is contended was said? The reaction of witnesses (not just the parents), during the course of oral evidence, to recorded material which conflicts with their own account will also form a crucial aspect of this multifaceted evaluative exercise.

Two common (and related) errors are to suppose: (1) that the stronger and more vivid is our feeling or experience of recollection, the more likely the recollection is to be accurate; and (2) that the more confident another person is in their recollection, the more likely their recollection is to be accurate.  </span>

In fact, psychological research has demonstrated that memories are fluid and malleable, being constantly rewritten whenever they are retrieved. This is true even of so-called 'flashbulb' memories, that is memories of experiencing or learning of a particularly shocking or traumatic event. (The very description 'flashbulb' memory is in fact misleading, reflecting as it does the misconception that memory operates like a camera or other device that makes a fixed record of an experience.) External information can intrude into a witness's memory, as can his or her own thoughts and beliefs, and both can cause dramatic changes in recollection. Events can come to be recalled as memories which did not happen at all or which happened to someone else (referred to in the literature as a failure of source memory).  </span>

Our memories of past beliefs are revised to make them more consistent with our present beliefs. Studies have also shown that memory is particularly vulnerable to interference and alteration when a person is presented with new information or suggestions about an event in circumstances where his or her memory of it is already weak due to the passage of time.  </span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic">The process of civil litigation itself subjects the memories of witnesses to powerful biases. The nature of litigation is such that witnesses often have a stake in a particular version of events. This is obvious where the witness is a party or has a tie of loyalty (such as an employment relationship) to a party to the proceedings. Other, more subtle influences include allegiances created by the process of preparing a witness statement and of coming to court to give evidence for one side in the dispute. A desire to assist, or at least not to prejudice, the party who has called the witness or that party's lawyers, as well as a natural desire to give a good impression in a public forum, can be significant motivating forces. </span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic">Considerable interference with memory is also introduced in civil litigation by the procedure of preparing for trial. A witness is asked to make a statement, often (as in the present case) when a long time has already elapsed since the relevant events. The statement is usually drafted for the witness by a lawyer who is inevitably conscious of the significance for the issues in the case of what the witness does nor does not say. The statement is made after the witness's memory has been "refreshed" by reading documents. The documents considered often include statements of case and other argumentative material as well as documents which the witness did not see at the time or which came into existence after the events which he or she is being asked to recall. The statement may go through several iterations before it is finalised. Then, usually months later, the witness will be asked to re-read his or her statement and review documents again before giving evidence in court. The effect of this process is to establish in the mind of the witness the matters recorded in his or her own statement and other written material, whether they be true or false, and to cause the witness's memory of events to be based increasingly on this material and later interpretations of it rather than on the original experience of the events. </span>

First, they erroneously presuppose that there is a clear distinction between recollection and reconstruction, when all remembering of distant events involves reconstructive processes. Second, such questions disregard the fact that such processes are largely unconscious and that the strength, vividness and apparent authenticity of memories is not a reliable measure of their truth.’</span>

The possible effects of delay and repeated questioning upon memory should also be considered, as should the effect on one person of hearing accounts given by others.

So, to state the obvious, the concept of the pool does not arise at all in the normal run of cases where the relevant allegation can be proved to the civil standard against an individual or individuals in the normal way. Nor does it arise where only one person could possibly be responsible. In that event, the allegation is either proved or it is not.

Where there are a number of people who might have caused the harm, it is for the LA to show that in relation to each of them there is a real possibility that they did. No one can be placed into the pool unless that has been shown. This is why it is always misleading to refer to 'exclusion from the pool': see Re S-B at [43].

	      <span style="font-style:italic">Likewise, it can be seen that the concept of a pool of perpetrators as a permissible means of satisfying the threshold was forged in cases concerning individuals who were 'carers'. In Lancashire, the condition was interpreted to include non-parent carers. It was somewhat widened in North Yorkshire at [26] to include 'people with access to the child' who might have caused injury. If that was an extension, it was a principled one. But at all events, the extension does not stretch to "anyone who had even a fleeting contact with the child in circumstances where there was the opportunity to cause injuries": North Yorkshire at [25]. Nor does it extend to harm caused by someone outside the home or family unless it would have been reasonable to expect a parent to have prevented it: S-B at [40].  </span>

	      <span style="font-style:italic">It should also be noted that in the leading cases there were two, three or four   known individuals from whom any risk to the child must have come. The position of each individual was then investigated and compared. That is as it should be. To assess the likelihood of harm having been caused by A or B or C, one needs as much information as possible about each of them in order to make the decision about which if any of them should be placed in the pool. So, where there is an imbalance of information about some individuals in comparison to others, particular care may need to be taken to ensure that the imbalance does not distort the assessment of the possibilities. The same may be said where the list of individuals has been whittled down to a pool of one named individual alongside others who are not similarly identified. This may be unlikely, but the present case shows that it is not impossible. Here it must be shown that there genuinely is a pool of perpetrators and not just a pool of one by default.  </span>

It is also a tautology: the true distinction is between an accident which is unexpected and unintentional and an injury which involves an element of wrong. That element of wrong may involve a lack of care and / or an intent of a greater or lesser degree that may amount to negligence, recklessness or deliberate infliction. While an analysis of that kind may be helpful to distinguish deliberate infliction from, say, negligence, it is unnecessary in any consideration of whether the threshold criteria are satisfied because what the statute requires is something different namely, findings of fact that at least satisfy the significant harm, attributability and objective standard of care elements of section 31(2). </span>

The gloss imported by the use of unexplained legal, clinical or colloquial terms is not helpful to that exercise nor is it necessary for the purposes of section 31(2) to characterise the fact of what happened as negligence, recklessness or in any other way. Just as non-accidental injury is a tautology, 'accidental injury' is an oxymoron that is unhelpful as a description. If the term was used during the discussion after the judgment had been given as a description of one of the possibilities of how the harm had been caused, then it should not have been; it being a contradiction in terms. If, as is often the case when a clinical expert describes harm as being a 'non-accidental injury', there is a range of factual possibilities, those possibilities should be explored with the expert and the witnesses so that the court can understand which, if any, described mechanism is compatible with the presentation of harm.  </span>

The GP referred J to the on-call paediatrician at Hospital A in Town C, where he was admitted as an inpatient until he was discharged home on 28 April 2017.  During that admission J was under the care of Dr U, consultant general paediatrician. In evidence she confirmed the accuracy of the entry dated 20 April 2017 taken by a junior doctor at 10:50. After he was seen by junior doctors, Dr U was asked to review him clinically herself due to his age and concern about his presentation with possible seizures. She confirmed in evidence that the history of the death of an earlier child and the jerky movements in J had been given to her by one of two junior doctors, and that it had been the combination of those two factors that made them come and seek her out as the more senior colleague. Those junior doctors had picked up that this was potentially very serious. She was clear that the SIDS was a significant and relevant factor for the hospital staff. </p>

She also gathered there was a history that M had had a previous child who had died from SIDS at 6 months.

She therefore made a clinic plan for him to be covered for infection with IV antibiotics and to have bloods taken, including for a metabolic screen. He had an ECG and was admitted to the ward and an MRI of his brain was requested. A plan for an urgent EEG was made and to plan a lumbar puncture.

Dr U discussed her concerns about possible infection and seizures, and said she felt J needed to remain in hospital in case of further deterioration, offering a variety of options including babysitting by hospital staff. Dr U also explained to M that the results of the MRI report, which had suggested a possible microbleed/developmental venous anomaly, increased her clinical concern at the time. However, the family remained adamant they wanted to discharge J. In the end, Dr U explained the risks were unknown and she felt she would have to refer to the LA if they did leave. Ultimately, M then agreed for J to stay overnight and there were no further issues. J was reviewed the following day during a ward round. There had been a documented episode of jerking, but otherwise he was stable.

The referral stated that J had been admitted the day before aged 12 days old having been presented to have had 3 episodes of jerking/twitching of his arms, lasting for 1-2 minutes. He was also reported to have had some episodes with a change in his breathing pattern accompanied by some unusual leg movements. These episodes were reported to have occurred while he was in PGM’s care. The report also stated that J’s older sibling had died at the age of 6 months due to SIDS. M was noted to have a diagnosis of non-epileptic dissociative seizures, and the PGM to have a diagnosis of epilepsy. J was documented to have a normal neurological examination, a normal EEG and an MRI scan reported as demonstrating a tiny hypodense region in the L cerebellar hemisphere. It was considered by Evelina staff that it was unclear if these episodes were epileptic seizures, and that it was more likely they were more suggestive of a benign sleep myoclonus. It was therefore recommended that if further episodes were witnessed, samples should be taken for toxicology assessment. </p>

It was reported that J had been exposed to his parents being unpleasant to each other, and that M had been unable to control her emotions in front of J, shouting and becoming very emotional towards professionals and F. She was described as crying and shouting, and getting up and walking in and out of the room. J was described as not being distressed by this which was regarded as being extremely worrying to the SW and indicating that at 2 years old he was already normalising this behaviour.

M had also apologised to F for reporting to VW that J returned home from a weekend at his house with bruises. It was noted by BX that the SW (VW) had visited the home the following day but had been unable to see any bruises on J. M told the meeting that she loses her temper and was completing an online anger management course. However, M was also adamant that she had a baby who died at 6 months. She said she understood that there were no records of the death.

M showed AZ messages which stated how he missed her, asking her not to ignore him and how he missed his best friend. M’s replies were minimal and to the point. M also reported that she had received a telephone call from F stating that he had received a phone call from AZ on 11 June 2019 stating that if M failed the psychiatric assessment that J would be taken into temporary foster care. AZ told M that she had not had such a discussion with F, although she did explain to M that part of the psychiatric assessment would explore whether she is mentally well enough to be able to keep J safe. During this home visit M told AZ that F had been saying that J was arriving at his home with bruises, and that F had been accusing XYZ of causing them; M stated that XYZ had not harmed J, and said that J falls over and bumps into things a lot. M said that F had accused XYZ a few times. M took J’s tee-shirt off to reveal four fingerprint bruises – one in the centre of his back, and three to the left.

The LA therefore no longer invites a finding that they were caused by XYZ, or that this is a case in which the identification of a perpetrator would involve the court straining to such an extent (or indeed at all) to identify a perpetrator, such that the only safe finding would be that there is a pool of possible perpetrators. </p>

She said she leaned into the cot over the side to put her ear near to his mouth standing on the bottom bar of the cot. She said as soon as she couldn't hear anything she instantly ran out of the room to get her mobile and sent a message to F. Then she went straight back into his room and rang 999; at that point nothing seemed to have changed. During the telephone call she said F phoned her on her house phone which was on a little shelf just outside J’s room.

She described how she didn't know what to do but said she saw his chest rising and falling. However, a moment later when asked to describe the colour of his face, M then said – for the first time – that it was hard to see what was happening because the lights in the room had just blown and she could only see vaguely what she was doing. She gave this as the reason why she could not describe if there had been a change in his face. There is no reference to the quality of the light at all in the 999 call nor that she was having any difficulty seeing J.

Ultimately all the tape confirms is that J was making no noise for the early part of the call but then was heard to be gurgling . Professor Fleming also observed that for most of the tape the action was <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">after</span> J was breathing. In summary, he could say nothing more than this tape was consistent with the baby not making a noise but he certainly couldn't put it any higher than that. He said in evidence that he has dealt many times with children where parents cannot tell if the baby is breathing or not. But he said that what M has described in this case is not to be characterised as a seizure. He also said that although M had described an apnoea, he could not say that one had occurred. He said babies can have 10 to 12 second apnoea episodes very regularly and in most circumstances it is not correct to say they have stopped breathing.  </p>

Although Dr L said he did not believe he made a mistake, he did confirm in evidence that an accurate history is absolutely essential to his working practice and said he would have stressed to M the importance of providing a clear picture during that consultation. He confirmed that his usual practice is to make brief handwritten or electronic notes during a consultation then to dictate his clinic letter at the end of the clinic on the same day. He said that as he does his letters in the clinic room they are predominantly based on his recollection. His clinic letter can therefore be taken as a contemporaneous letter, not least because it refers in the first sentence to him having reviewed J in the clinic that day. He agreed in evidence that his clinic letter and the account given by M of the description of the jerking movements therefore represents the best evidence of what she said. He was clear that he dictated it on the evening of the consultation appointment and that it included everything important to M’s description.  </p>

He said that benign sleep myoclonus is not uncommon and it is not uncommon for that particular movement to raise concerns in a parent about seizures. By contrast his report dated 30 November 2019, which includes a reference to M saying that J had experienced an episode she thought was a seizure, is dated over two years later. I accept therefore the clinic letter dated 15 November 2017 represents the best evidence of what Dr L was told by M and where it differs to the later report, I accept the earlier letter as the most accurate account. I therefore cannot find that M used the actual word ‘seizure’ to report this incident when talking to Dr L.

The note then goes on to describe a second period of apparent seizure activity similar to the first, but lasting for about two minutes, with eyes having rolled back and J dribbling.

Dr S explained, as indeed did Professor Fleming, that what is included in notes and letters very much depends on the purpose of the document; in other words, the person for whom the document is intended dictates to a greater degree the way in which the information is conveyed. Much was made in cross-examination on behalf of M of the fact that in Dr S's first email to Dr L that evening there is a reference to J having started a twitchy movement of his right leg and twitching spreading to all extremities. I find it likely on the balance of probabilities that this was information that was provided to Dr S and HR during the consultation attended by M and F. I find nothing necessarily sinister about the fact that some information was included in the email written a couple of hours later between from one doctor to another but not having been included in the handwritten notes by a senior nurse practitioner nor included in Dr S's discharge summary note.

He attributed this to a transcription error, but explained again that this is a matter of common sense that was most probably caused by being under work pressure that day. I accept his evidence. For these purposes, however, the critical point is that he confirmed that the exact length of time does <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">not</span> actually make any difference for diagnostic purposes. He went on to confirm that when all the notes are taken together and read as a whole they also do not make any difference to his clinical assessments. I found him a frank and helpful witness who was quite open about the less than optimum accuracy of some parts of the notes, but I place that in the realistic context in which busy medical professionals work every single day. The most important elements of this part of the evidence relates to the impact or the lack of impact on his overall diagnosis. Nothing critical turns on these differences and in the end it matters not.  </p>

He described M saying she had seen absences on and off for a couple of months and then told him what had happened that day. She said there were two episodes very close in time. He was cross examined about the fact that in his later statement he describes a single event when plainly his contemporaneous notes refer to two events. Although he initially agreed in evidence that what he was told on the day was a combination of what M and F had seen, he then revised his opinion and confirmed that he really could not recall anything that F had said in addition to M. However, on reflection he thought when looking at the tone of the writing (by HR and his own notes) that it must have been M giving this account. He also accepted in crossexamination that if F had made a contribution of significance about the seizure behaviour he would have expected it to be noted.  </p>

He said that appointments with doctors and professionals make him nervous and so he tends not to do the majority of the speaking. He finds it particularly difficult if he is talking to professionals if he has not met them before. He described how a big part of the problem for him is if a strange person is asking him something seriously and quickly and it becomes even more inhibiting for him because he has no time to process the information. He was quite clear that unless somebody has specifically asked him a question then he will leave that to M.  </p>

The interview with the parents was relatively short at the end of the day. The presentation of  both parents in the witness box confirmed that whereas M appears articulate and at times quite assertive, this is in marked contrast to F who appeared vulnerable and at times fragile and highly anxious. F described M as being the life and soul of the party and very sociable, whereas by contrast he is sensitive and quiet and M is much more confident. In addition F suffers from an extreme stammer which becomes significantly worse under stress. That was apparent at various points in his evidence. </p>

I do not think for a moment that if that is what happened with Dr S or HR there was any malign intent to make F feel discarded. But I do think it likely on the balance of probabilities that in a fairly quick consultation dealing with a highly stressful and upsetting event and where J had by then been at the hospital for several hours, it is most likely that it was M who provided the bulk if not all of the description of what had happened that day to Dr S.  </p>

What is important is that F described M speaking to Dr S before he himself spoke and that she had already started to outline what I had told her over the weekend.

It is now two years later, almost three years, after this meeting and in that time F has been diagnosed with a condition that is considered possibly post-traumatic stress disorder and he is on medication for extreme anxiety. In addition when I weigh in the balance his likely response to difficult or stressful situations in terms of his fluency I think it highly likely that he is genuine in that he cannot remember what happened.  </p>

She said that F was just as worried as she was about the seizures. She agreed that what she had described was all a single episode that lasted up to five minutes. However she confirmed that the phrase arms flapping and flailing no twitching eyes closed were F’s words not hers. She said in evidence that she believed that the her two reports of what she said and what F said have become intertwined into one, and she denied robustly that the entire history had come from her. Her position remained that the note of Dr S has conflated and mixed up parts of what she said and parts of what F said. But she also said both reports are wrong in any event . She denied that she said the phrase spreading to all extremities nor that she had said 10 minutes.  </p>

When I look at the totality of the evidence, where there is a factual dispute between M and F, then I prefer and accept F’s evidence. Similarly, where there is a factual dispute between M and Dr S, then I prefer and accept the evidence of Dr S. The absence of any reference at all to previous events over the preceding weekend, whether reported by F or not, in the transcripts of the 999 call, the ambulance notes and the contemporaneous notes by HR, are highly relevant and supportive of the proposition that the only cogent reason for the absence of that material is because it was never said. </p>

The likelihood of F being able to give any sort of fluent account, including using words such as extremities which he does not understand and cannot pronounce in light of his extreme stammer in times of stress during a short consultation at the end of an inevitably stressful stay in hospital, is highly unlikely. It matters not whether F was there at the beginning of the appointment or came in after the appointment had started. What matters is that my observation of F in evidence throughout these proceedings, including his obvious deterioration in fluency at times of stress, make it inherently unlikely that he would have been able to interrupt the flow of discussion between unknown medical professionals and the more dominant character of M. </p>

He reported that unfortunately since he had last seen J there had been the emergence of some more events, including continuing to have perhaps one or two brief vacant spells on a daily basis. However he remained unconvinced that these were seizures. He also explained that M had told him perhaps more pressingly that J was experiencing episodes which generally started with a behavioural arrest before the development of initially intermittent and then more rhythmic jerking of the right leg which then spread up to the right arm and could also spread across to the left leg. He said he was told that typically these only lasted for one or two minutes although earlier in the week there had been an episode which lasted for 10 minutes and prompted attendance at the hospital.  </p>

He said in evidence that he was quite clear at that second appointment the only basis on which to make a diagnosis of epilepsy was M’s account of the events and he felt they needed more evidence before committing J to long term treatments.

He agreed it was possible that he had made an error but his recollection was that she said daily and in any event he was clear that she gave him a more active description. I accept his contemporaneous clinic note as the best evidence of what happened in that appointment. Although he agreed in evidence that he had not written down explicitly that it was M who said it and he accepted in general terms that his memory could be faulty, he was also clear that he remembered it was M who gave the account and that she had directly witnessed events because he was struck by how much clearer her language was on this second occasion. He also confirmed that the vast majority of information came from M and did not remember F contributing much to the conversation. He said there were times when M looked to F for confirmation but that it was M who described the events as things she had herself witnessed. He said there was never a moment where he doubted that.

She said she asked F for the clips again but he told her that he had upgraded his phone without backing it up and had also lost the video files.

She saw M at home with J. M told her that she had recently had to call an ambulance as she could not rouse him although when the ambulance arrived he woke up and set up. M told her that J had had a seizure during his stay in hospital that staff had witnessed. She also told her that J was under a paediatric consultant, Dr S, who had prescribed carbamazepine as a temporary treatment for possible seizures. This medication was not started until the appointment with Dr S on 8 January 2018 and confirmed at the clinic appointment with Dr L on 11 January 2018. It must therefore follow, and M confirmed as such in cross examination, that any account or treatment referring to the administration of carbamazepine could not have any relevance to episodes in 2017, and could only relate to episodes witnessed <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">after</span> January 2018.

At face value it could be taken as a simple lie, told in a moment of panic by M who had experienced deep grief and emotional response to previous events in her life. In her oral evidence M sought to perpetuate an account that she was so far embedded in the lie that she could not now resile from it. However, the court does not necessarily need to concern itself with motivation or culpability, and the LA’s case is quite properly limited in that regard. As the LA puts it, at this stage it does not matter <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">why</span> M does what she does.

I do find that the fact of the lie has caused J significant emotional harm. Firstly, because M has deployed the lie as part of his medical history which has created a false reality for him in medical terms. And secondly, because she has deployed the lie as part of creating a false actual or potential false emotional reality for J himself.

She said it was something that she now deeply regrets saying but at that point that is what she believed and that is why she said it. She also said that on reflection at the time she had not considered the seriousness of what she was saying and what the consequences could be for J but now accepts that it clearly has had some sort of medical impact on him and that giving a false history has been unhelpful to J.

It would have been highly understandable for her to have told Dr L that she was distressed and there would be no reason for her to be so vociferous in her denial of his evidence about this. But she was at pains in her evidence to state that he <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">had</span> recorded this wrongly. The obvious and only logical inference to draw from this is that she understands only too clearly what the impact of her having linked ‘Lily’ to J was for the doctor, and now seeks to distance herself from having sought to convey a false impression about that. In evidence she confirmed very clearly that she understood then, and understands now, that doctors do need a truthful account, and that without a truthful account there can be serious consequences for a child. She was able to give as an example a child being given the wrong medication as the result of an inaccurate medical history being provided. </p>

Dr L was in no doubt that M told him this, and he said he had no reason not to take it at face value. I accept his evidence completely. He is an experienced medical professional, but remembered this case particularly acutely because it was his first FII case. He said that obtaining an accurate history from parents is absolutely essential to his working practice.

He rightly cautioned that it does not necessarily mean that such a parent will lie about other things and he was plainly experienced in having received information given in this sort of way. However, he said that in this case lying about something so serious does give him slightly more cause for concern. In evidence he explained that the <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">context</span> of the lie is relevant because when it is taken as part of a child’s medical history it raises the level of concern on the part of medical professionals. Put bluntly, he said from a medical professional perspective it is well known that if there is a death from SIDS in an earlier child, there will be an <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">increased chance</span> of a subsequent child dying of cot death (whether due to socio-economic or medical factors). He was therefore unequivocal in his opinion that such a history would immediately and quite properly have raised concerns for the treating doctors. He explained the investigations in such a case would almost inevitably be more thorough and also that with a history of a previously unexpected death medical professionals would never just seek to send the child home it would immediately raise their cause for concern. </p>

Although she said L was some sort of therapist she did not remember or know her discipline. She said L was helpful to her and then she understood that ‘Lily’ was dead. Although she said she had some more counselling in March 2020, she was clear that it was the first period of counselling that <span style="font-style:italic">‘shifted her thinking’</span>. She described this counselling as having helped her see what was a figment of her imagination. She said there was no single event in the counselling that had transformed her thinking rather it was little by little through talking to the counsellor, L.

She did not demonstrate any empathy for PGM during her account at this part of the evidence and I find her evidence confusing in this regard. Either she honestly believed that ‘Lily’ was alive at the point that she was pregnant with J in which case it is extraordinary that no mental health difficulty appears to have been identified by any health professional including her midwife. Or she was deliberately lying to PGM; for whatever reason matters not at this stage.  </p>

It is plain that until at least the day that she was questioned about this during this hearing in November 2020 she <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">had</span> continued to assert either explicitly or by implication that she was a mother of two children - one who had died, one who was still alive. It is difficult to reconcile this evidence with her earlier assertions that she now believed, with the help of ‘extensive counselling’, that ‘Lily’ was not real. Notwithstanding the ‘extensive counselling’, it is clear that as late just a few weeks ago she was still maintaining images and references to ‘Lily’ on her social media accounts which indicate and confirm her as the mother of a dead child.  </p>

This was an obvious example of M telling a lie even faced with what appeared to be incontrovertible evidence. I have considered whether there might be a benign cause for such a lie, for example because she was worried she would get into trouble. However, by this very late stage in her evidence she had no reason to maintain such an unnecessary lie. The only conceivable reason for her continuing to lie is simply to bolster her own case still further. At this stage in her evidence she was lying in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary. She gave evasive and highly defensive answers and she was reluctant and uncooperative. In a period of extraordinary evidence over several days this was probably the most extreme example of such dissembling behaviour. She maintained that she was not responsible for the changes to her Facebook and WhatsApp accounts and had no idea how those changes had been made.    </p>

Secondly, because she had also deceived F and PGM the longest, she felt it was only right they should be the first people to know.

Although the presenting problem was later considered to be consistent with benign sleep myoclonus, the history of SIDS directly influenced the decision to give J various tests, including an MRI scan under sedation, an EEG, a lumbar puncture, a sleep study and chromosome testing. The commencement of that passage of treatment in April 2017, combined with the further history given by M, also directly led to the commencement of carbamazepine in January 2018. </p>

For example, during a SW home visit on 17 July 2018 J was observed to become upset when M left the room and sought comfort from her. Equally, the health visitor’s evidence about J’s lack of reaction to what sounded like a disturbing and persistent argument between the parents at the CIN meeting on 8 May 2019 was concerning to her. I accept that evidence. It is unrealistic to suggest that a child a young child is not emotionally attuned to the reactions and actions as well as the inactions and omissions of the adults around him. From just a few weeks of age J was subjected to repeated medical appointments, invasive medical treatments and drugs that he ultimately did not need.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.25in;text-indent:0.00in">Dr L refers to three review appointments in 2017 that were made for him to review J in the paediatric neurology outreach service. The first two of these were on 5 June 2017 and 3 July 2017. These appointments were cancelled but it is not clear from the hospital records who requested the cancellations. There is therefore insufficient evidence to support a finding that the parents deliberately missed these appointments. However a third appointment was booked for 14 August 2017. J was not brought to that appointment. It is beyond doubt that M knew about that appointment because the date of that appointment was recorded in the clinic letter copied to the parents that was sent following Dr P’s clinic letter on 19 July 2017. That letter was sent to the parents at M’s home address. M said explicitly in her evidence that she lives in a one bedroomed flat on the ground floor, the post is delivered through the front door into the living room and she is in the habit of picking letters up straight away. It is therefore most unlikely that she did not receive letters from the hospital. However, F said in evidence that after he and M separated, he did not receive letters about medical appointments. It is correct that all the letters I have seen were addressed to the parents at M’s home address. </p>

M says that F cancelled this appointment due to his anxiety. However, she gave no cogent reason why she herself did not attend that appointment. There was no evidence that M shared F’s anxiety about travelling to London some two months after the bomb attack. I do not consider that a bomb attack two months previously represents a cogent reason for missing such an important review appointment for J. Furthermore the letter was received directly by M at her home address but F was aware of it. <span style="font-weight:bold">I find that the important review appointment with Dr L on 14 August 2017 was missed intentionally and without good reason by both M or F.</span></p>

In the health visitor’s note of that home visit to M, she described M as telling her that F cancelled the August appointment and that J has now missed three appointments. For reasons already stated, I accept the health visitor’s evidence. On the basis of that evidence that it is safe to find that the parents <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">were</span> both aware of the two earlier appointments with Dr L on 5 June 2017 and 3 July 2017.

M told her that she could not contact the hospital as F had the details and she had the money ready to take him. Neither aspect of that explanation to the health visitor makes sense, particularly in the context of the now long overdue and important appointment with Dr L specifically to review J’s health. In any event, M says in her second witness statement that she did call the hospital to reorganise an appointment on 31 August 2017 due to her then-partner, PQ, wanting to be at the appointment but being prevented by work. This lends further weight to the fact that M was misleading or lying in her conversation with the health visitor on 6 September 2017 when she said she did not have the details to contact the hospital. In any event, by this stage it would not have been difficult for M to have obtained the details for the paediatric neurology clinic at Hospital B.  </p>

There is no indication that the appointment was cancelled internally.

Dr S had made it clear at that stage that part of his plan was to offer a follow up appointment in three or four months’ time in his clinic. Dr S wrote to the GP on 17 April 2018 explaining that he had tried to contact the parents on the mobile phone numbers recorded in the system but the call was not answered. He then asked his secretary to contact the family the following day and offer a further appointment on 10 April 2018 with a plan to stay for further observation if the seizures were still not settled. He was hopeful at that stage of making contact and communication with the family to carry out the suggestion for that further observation made by Dr L. That letter also was copied to the parents at M’s home address. M’s explanation for missing this appointment in her recent witness statement was that J was staying with F from 31 March until 6 April for the run up to his birthday. She said that she was not aware until after she had collected J that F had not attended due to lack of funds. That explanation lacks any credibility. It has never been presented as the case that these were parents who refused to attend appointments together. It should have been entirely foreseeable to M that it was necessary to take J to this important follow up appointment with Dr S.  </p>

Section 31 defines the nature of the harm that may be suffered but does not indicate the necessary degree of that harm. When making a finding of harm it is important to distinguish between simple harm as opposed to significant harm. Minor shortcomings or deficits in physical, psychological or social development should not require compulsory intervention unless cumulatively they are having or are likely to have serious and lasting effects on the child. For J it is exactly the accumulation of harm arising from the sustained conflict between the parents that is of concern and that I find does satisfy the threshold criteria.  </p>

It matters not whether M herself made the comments about the masturbation or whether it was her then-partner, PQ; the fact remains that M was present and was responsible for giving the history to the medical professionals. If M had doubts about the veracity about anything being said by PQ, then it was her responsibility as J’s mother to correct the information. But she did not. It is not relevant at this stage to seek to understand why she said these things, or whether she believed they were true or not.

QL has no knowledge of the matters in this case and has had no involvement with any of the parties. She was contacted by FS on 31 October 2019 by email and telephoned her on 2 November. She has known FS since 9 November 2018 in her capacity as social worker involved with the family. In that time she has had limited contact about every three to six months before statutory reviews. Prior to her recent involvement during these proceedings, she last spoke to FS during the school summer holidays. She describes her as someone with complex needs who is very vulnerable; she said her partner, JK, has disabilities and is also vulnerable. She said both of them are prone to exploitation by others. However, she said FS has always been transparent and open in working with her. FS told QL that she had been asked to lie to the police by M, but that she had not wanted to do this because she knew it would be a lie. QL made a contemporaneous note of their conversation in which she stated that FS said she used to be a neighbour of M but has now moved. She told QL that she feels intimidated by M which negatively affects her mental health. QL described her as seeming very, very frightened of repercussions on this day, was becoming increasingly agitated and began to hyperventilate. QL was clear that FS has never said anything like this to her before. I accept QL’s contemporaneous note as accurate and I accept her evidence about her experience of DC as accurate.

It is difficult to know how to do justice to these marks shown so graphically in the photographs taken by M that afternoon on return from nursery. It is plain that J is crying in one of the photographs and both arms show dark reddish brown obviously linear marks. They are not minor marks, and would make any parent shocked. That is not the reaction that I observed at any time in M when giving evidence about these injuries. It is correct to say that in evidence she agreed the bruises were shocking, but words do not necessarily equate emotional response. She was asked why she had not been the first one immediately to look at the bruises when they got home, and why she had gone first of all into the kitchen. She denied that it wasn’t a priority for her. But then she said – <span style="font-style:italic">‘let’s face it, it would have made no difference to the bruises.’</span> Her tone when she said this was sarcastic, rude and hostile. She then became tearful at this point, but this appeared to be borne not out of empathy for J but out of concern for herself about the persistent and highly effective questioning by Miss McGrath. I take account of course of the inevitable stress on any lay party in giving oral evidence, not least over several days as happened in this case. But she was being questioned entirely appropriately and I found her tone extraordinary in terms of the issue she was being asked to describe, and by contrast with the obvious anger and pain and shock experienced by both XYZ who saw the bruises first hand, and by F who saw them in photographs. </p>

She said she was unsure where they had come from and hadn’t noticed them before. She queried whether they could have been caused by J running into the corner of the wall which is something he does when restless. She said he had done this the previous night when he was up all night with cough and cold symptoms. She had given him Calpol at midnight and 06:00. During the previous day he hadn’t been eating as much, but was drinking well with no vomiting and fever. No marks had been noticed that morning when getting him dressed. M said XYZ and two friends were also there that morning and these bruises weren’t noted. At 09:00 she walked him to nursery. </p>

She noted some marks on his upper abdomen, R knee and R ankle which were consistent with a mobile child and not of concern. She also noted multiple blanching red spots around his mouth, each less than half a centimetre, which could be consistent with a viral infection such as described by M.  </p>

Dr Saggar noted the history taken from the foster care which described J as a rough and tumble boy who rarely shows any sign of bruising; the foster carer has not seen any bruising that has not obviously been related to a small knock or play. However, she did report that occasionally J may get some bruises on the palms of his hands, near the thumbs when he has been pressing or lifting himself against things. There has been no history of any bleeding or nosebleeds. However, the foster carer has noticed that J is quite hypermobile and seems to be able to bend a lot. She has also never observed J have any fits. There is no history of any falling over although he is a bit wobbly in his gait. </p>

This risk may therefore predispose J to a greater degree of bruising and/or bleeding for any given force. However, because there are no known genes for hypermobile EDS, the diagnosis is a clinical one established through a combination of the symptoms, signs, family history, examination findings and exclusion of overlap EDS syndromes by genetic testing. </p>

It is also well described that HSD is associated with easy bruising, which is frequently without obvious trauma or injury. However, in his opinion, HSD alone would not explain spontaneous and sudden onset of fingertip type bruising. </p>

He was of the same opinion in relation to the bruising on the arms, explaining that these bruises could not have occurred spontaneously and in order for J to have caused them himself, he would have needed to have gripped himself by each arm. He described seeing many, many children with EDS and holds about six clinics a month; the bruising to J’s arms is unusual in his clinical and expert experience.

He deferred to Dr Saggar in terms of the degree of lesser force that might be required to cause such bruising because this is outside his own area of expertise. However, the fact that this bruising to this type of area has not been repeated and therefore represents an isolated event, means in his opinion it is unlikely to have arisen due to normal, routine handling. He considered that the hypermobility would be unlikely to be a relevant factor and said that it’s not a condition where a child bruises with relatively normal handling, although he accepted that one might need a bit less force than necessary. </p>

She presented as a cogent and straightforward witness, and I accept her evidence in its entirety. </p>

She confirmed that she and all the nursery staff were trained in safeguarding procedures. She also confirmed that their practice is to adhere to a ratio of usually 1 member of staff to 5 children aged under 3, but that they always make sure there are three staff actually available, 2 staff with the children eating lunch, and 1 staff member cleaning the bathrooms. She said in evidence that it would be very unlikely that a staff member would be under such pressure that they could have caused bruising to J without her knowing. She also said that if such a thing had happened, she would imagine that the child would have made a noise. She said they can always hear staff with all the children all the time, and that even when she is in the staff office, she can hear what’s going on in the bathroom. She said her practice is always to leave her office door open. </p>

She confirmed in evidence that generally all the staff take notes about all the children, who attend nursery in one big room. On 2 October 2019 at 15:02 she spoke to M about the bruising; although she had not seen the bruising herself, she was reliant on MN’s body map and half-completed safeguarding incident form and was also reliant on what she had been told by staff. She told M that some bruising had been noticed. In evidence she said that the nursery routinely records any injury caused there, and that in those circumstances the parents would be shown a separate accident form and asked to sign it at the end of the day. There was no such form completed on 2 October 2019 which confirms that the bruising was not caused by a member of nursery staff during the day. I have seen an example of the nursery’s use of such a form in respect of some marks to J’s nose reported by M on 24 September 2019. IJ gave clear and cogent evidence demonstrating a good understanding of the importance of the nursery staff keeping accurate records. She was clear that the bruises had not been caused at nursery.

He said M phoned him saying she had collected him from nursery with the bruises. Initially he imagined they would just be normal, little bruises caused by bumps. He said M sent him the photographs in the bundle, and he described how shocked and upset he’d been when he saw them thinking that someone had grabbed J by the forearms and upset at the very thought of him being upset. He said when he saw the photos he was crying because they were really upsetting. I found his evidence in this regard credible and moving. He was presented as genuinely emotional about this incident. He said as soon as he saw the photos, he immediately thought they looked like grab marks and that someone had grabbed him. </p>

I find that the injuries were grab marks caused by M’s very firm or vigorous handling of J’s arms, most likely more than once. The force used was excessive and inappropriate and would have been painful for J. I find that M would have realised that J was being harmed.  </span>
