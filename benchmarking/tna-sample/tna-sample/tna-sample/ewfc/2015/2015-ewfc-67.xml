L’s welfare in care proceedings is my paramount consideration. It must also be considered before granting leave in a case of such significance for him and his family.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The case began its life on the basis that L had suffered significant harm, and the indications from the medical evidence advanced were that this was a shaken baby case for which there was no explanation, but in which the parents and their mothers were in the pool of possible perpetrators.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The local authority must as a matter of law prove their case to the requisite standard, the balance of probabilities, and in a case such as this, the whole of the evidence, including that of the parents and other lay witnesses as well as the doctors and experts concerned would fall to be considered to provide the court with a wide over-view of the relevant facts and matters upon which to evaluate the evidential picture and base its conclusions. The situation in this case is that the extensive medical evidence does not come up to proof and the threshold criteria are not met.  Neither L’s parents nor anyone in his family harmed him and there is no available route on all the evidence to come to any different conclusion.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I have had no hesitation in granting the application, and I shall give my reasons for doing so in full.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in"> At the hearing Mr Sachdeva applied on behalf of the Trust to be joined as party to the proceedings, for the court to direct a freestanding Human Rights Application to be issued by the parents, and for disclosure. It was opposed by the parents and the Guardian, the local authority’s position being that if the Court were to make the findings sought on behalf of the parents it should accede to the Trust’s application to be joined.. The experts’ reports had already been supplied to Dr Kabole pursuant to a direction of 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> March 2015 and I gave a judgment on the application on that day, dismissing the application.  They wished to be joined in essence to defend the factual issues raised in this case, but in my judgment that was inappropriate. They are a matter of fact and record. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This is not a claim in clinical negligence, nor is it an application for damages pursuant to the Human Rights Act 1989. This judgment is focussed upon the care case from which it arises and the specific application for permission to withdraw. I do not know whether ultimately such applications will be made, but this judgment is not supportive of either: it is my duty in what are highly unusual circumstances to record the matters which have given rise to the application to withdraw and to provide my own analysis  and conclusions, relevant to the application, of the evidence which has emerged. </p>

He was admitted to Worthing Hospital on several occasions over a period of days and underwent some tests. The result was that the injuries seen were thought by the team at Worthing to have been non-accidental head injury – a “shaken baby” case. Luckily he appears to have recovered fully from this trauma. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in"> A strategy discussion was held on 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November attended by the medical team and social workers, with input from the family GP, on the basis that L was suspected to have suffered non-accidental head injury, and it appears that part of the information (from an unidentified source and without any evidence in support) was that the father was believed to have caused it.  The parents were arrested and interviewed that day, and he was placed with his paternal aunt, under an interim care order when he was later discharged from hospital. After a period of time with his aunt, he was placed in foster-care, where he has been ever since, separated from his parents and extended family. On 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2015 he went back to the care of his mother, having spent over half his life to date with others.  L is a little boy who has not been very well, in fact to add to the anxieties about him, he was admitted into hospital with respiratory problems during the course of this hearing, but thankfully has made a good recovery.</p>

I make it plain that there can be no criticism of the fact that the Local Authority issued proceedings here where there was clearly a <span style="font-style:italic">prima facie</span> case from the time L fell ill on the basis of the medical information which was supplied to them.</p>

There were gaps in the information available to the experts, and gaps in their own expertise as regards being able to come to clear understanding about what happened to L medically. There was, however, less uncertainty amongst the treating clinicians at Worthing Hospital as regards the cause of L’s head injuries at the critical point in time when life-changing decisions were to be made as regards his future, and I have concluded on all the evidence that this is something which requires careful exploration and recording in this judgment. </p>

Hindsight offers the court the opportunity to develop a counsel of perfection, but I am the first to acknowledge that this is unlikely to be achievable and practices vary and will always vary, and may be resource-specific. I can only do the best I can on what I have to go on in this matter with its very unusual features. The information about L which the experts had to go on was undoubtedly insufficient, and that in turn has left the court in the position where it cannot simply bypass their powerful evidence and return without more to the clinical picture available at Worthing Hospital to make findings, because such doubt has been cast upon L’s case as it was dealt with there. The information that there was what now appears to have been a very relevant differential diagnosis in relation to the cause of L’s injuries was available to the hospital, but it was not provided to the Local Authority at the outset of the case. The fact that there was a later differential diagnosis with a recommendation for further investigations related to L’s treatment was not fully conveyed to anyone in this case until the matter got to court. </p>

This is a baseline measurement which in a case of this kind would have proved very valuable in assessing L’s condition.

It may be that the note from earlier that day by Dr Ruffles who had spoken to St George’s accounts for the view advanced that the abnormal blood vessel at the back of the brain was not the cause of haemorrhage, but the consultant there had yet to report. In addition the view of the local radiologist ran very much counter to the singular proposition of subdural haemorrhage. </p>

On the evidence I have, there was incomplete representation of the findings from the CT scan. The differential diagnoses were clearly not available at that meeting which had such catastrophic consequences for L. Assuming that Dr Kabole had chosen to base her opinion on the note from St George’s as I do, she (and the other doctors who had been involved, I assume) advanced the single opinion that this was a case of non-accidental head injury. </p>

He later suffered language delay, learning difficulties and motor function issues, and at 7 there was a history of episodes thought to be representative of seizures.

	      <span style="font-style:italic">In cases where children are admitted with unusual neurological findings and are suspected to potentially having had an unexplained head injury there is a series of investigations that would usually be performed by the investigating team. The CT scan and initial blood tests performed in this case were to aid initial diagnosis of treatment; however, once a child has been stabilized they would usually undergo more detailed investigations including extended clotting profiles to look for more unusual abnormalities of clotting screen, tests for inbuilt metabolic and genetic disease, which are rare, but may present with unusual neurological findings and indeed with subdurals in certain very rare conditions such as  glutaric aciduria With the finding of suggestion of the thrombosed vein or even veins on the initial CT scan consideration of more widespread cortical vein thrombosis or abnormal venous architecture of the brain needs to be considered. This would unusually be investigated with a CT venogram or an MRI scan including MR angiogram and venogram studies.

This does work on these occasions as the child goes quiet, not because they have become better, but because they have had dysfunction of the brain which can lead to them decreasing the conscious level and therefore stopping crying and going quiet.

She also kept an eye on the fact that the mother has a heart condition; she referred her to Time to Talk for her anger issues. At the first pregnancy appointment the mother had by then been “in a good place”. Later she had told Dr Hazell she would never harm her baby. Where the mother had been referred to an obstetrician because of her heart condition on 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November, she had included the reference to anger management just in case there were any safeguarding concerns. My impression is that this was for completeness sake rather than because there were on-going concerns at that time.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The experts who looked at L’s case are of course highly experienced experts in differing fields of paediatric medicine, and I am careful to remind myself that their expertise was not readily available to L at the time he fell ill. Where they shine their intense beams of insight onto what happened to L, and through the holes in the information available, their collective evidence comes close to a counsel of perfection, something which I have been acutely aware of in the context of this case. Neither their degree of expertise, nor their individual areas of specialisation were available to L when he was admitted to Worthing. What follows is no more than a very brief overview of their oral evidence which in each case was explored in considerable fine detail, however the emergent reasons why this case could not continue in terms of the uncertainties and gaps are what I have focussed on, and in my reasons for acceding to the application below I have separated out the salient problems. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Dr Cartlidge refined his conclusions in his oral evidence and those refinements appear above. I was appreciative of his observation that this is an unusual case, and in any unusual case one has to be very cautious about being dogmatic, which was why he had been so cautious about drawing a single conclusion. That wisdom has been reflected by the other experts. He told me that there were parts of the evidence which will “forever be deficient”. Whilst he was clear that he thought trauma to be the most likely explanation, he described the case as a conundrum which should not be shoehorned into something convenient, and where it would be wrong to pretend to understand what had happened.  In particular he highlighted the crucial difficulty of distinguishing between the chronic or acute nature of the fluids seen due to the lack of an MRI scan. Dr Cartlidge’s skill at cross-referencing all the difficulties in the case was of great assistance, and I am left with no doubt about what conflicts he has identified which go to creating the underlying difficulties.</p>

For example he was clear that L’s symptoms as recorded on 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> October were not typical of gastroenteritis- the rigid arms which were described were more typical of a neurological dysfunction. This chimed with the view of Mr Jayamohan who was also of the view that L was presenting with a neurological problem at that time. </p>

Dr Williams was very careful to remain well within his speciality. He was able to tell me that practice as regards the taking of the full spectrum of blood tests is variable. He referred to the Royal College of Paediatricians Safeguarding handbook in relation to cases of suspected non-accidental head injury. He thought that most paediatricians would be aware of it.  He recognised that while not all hospitals can do the full range of tests laboratories attached to haemophilia centres can undertake them.</p>

It would have given information as regards the significance of the abnormal blood vessel. There is significantly more information in relation to the brain itself and imaging of the spine can be done. Where there was evidence of injury or bleeding in the spine, that would have been possibly a significant factor in support of non-accidental injury.  The loss in this case is of information about the abnormal blood vessel and whether it was thrombosed or whether just a clot was adhering to it. It would have distinguished the two types of fluid collection seen here. </p>

A key limb of his argument is that had those matters been dealt with differently, L would not have been lost to his parents for all this time. He argues that had an entirely truthful, fair, alternative report to that which Dr Kabole produced that was before the court on 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November been available to the court, the court would have seen the exemplary record of the parents’ care and the extensive recording of their attention to his health needs, and the appropriateness of their behaviour in reporting L’s condition, In addition the report of the differential diagnosis and the “air of mystery” around the three radiologists’ reports. If the case had been properly conducted after that, it would have had an MRI scan which would have allowed the unresolved question of whether there was membrane formation and allowed the court to give early consideration to a birth-related subdural and a spontaneous re-bleed, or alternatively to the question of unknown cause. </p>

This tends towards a focus upon blaming staff and professionals closest in time to the incident. Outcome bias occurs when the outcome of the incident influences the way it is analysed. For example when an incident leads to a death it is considered very differently from an incident that leads to no harm, even when the type of incident is exactly the same.

As between Mr Jayamohan and Dr Sprigg, the issue of whether the vein was a thrombosed vein or a clot from the subdural haemorrhage which had adhered to the vein is unresolved. This vein, from its appearance, whether thrombosed or not, was identified by the CT scan and was a highly unusual finding. Had an MRI or MRV scan been carried out at the relevant time, the issue may well have been determined. I add that as between the two differing views, a court is in an unenviable position in terms of establishing likelihood, given the lack of potentially determinative and reliable evidence. Both experts have clearly articulated this dilemma. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Further, two different types of fluids were seen on L’s brain from the CT scan. The two competing possibilities are that there was chronic subdural fluid, which may have collected from two weeks to two months previous to the scan, or acute blood, together with an acute traumatic effusion. If there had been a chronic subdural bleed, there was the potential for a re-bleed with minimal trauma and normal handling, or which could even have occurred spontaneously, explaining the acute bleeding. However this would not have explained the retinal haemorrhages. Had an MRI scan been performed, that may have allowed for the important differentiation between the two types of fluid seen to have been made. As the evidence stands there is no way of determining the significance of what was seen in the CT scan with any degree of certainty.</p>

They were doing well as first-time parents and had very good support from the Health Visitor and GP. The index of concern rises from a baseline of zero only marginally in my view on what is known about their past history. What is evident is that mother was rightly dogged and persistent in her pursuit of medical assistance for L. She twice pursued his re-admittance on the same day when he continued to appear unwell to her. She asked that he be kept in on the night of 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> to 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> November when medical staff felt he was fit for discharge. Her instincts about her son and his condition appear to have been more attuned than those professionals dealing with L – it is clear that she really knew that something was wrong with him. She made notes at the time and requested additional testing, and it is fair to say that her protective instincts appear to have kept her alert to the possibility that there was something more going on with her baby than was being diagnosed at the time. </p>

The balance tips well away from the pivot of probability in this case and on the basis of the medical evidence there is no available safe route for the court to tread. Faced with the real possibility of an unknown cause. I fully accept Mr Jayamohan’s reservations about the available evidence (describing it as shaky) and the difficulties caused by the missing information.  I am precluded in the circumstances from accepting the initial view of Worthing Hospital that this was a case of non-accidental injury because that opinion has been seriously undermined by the expert evidence, and in any event that is not a course which I have been invited at any time to follow by the Local Authority who accept the weight of the expert evidence.</p>

If that is the case, then potentially parents would be entitled to be present at every strategy discussion, and the essentially confidential nature of the discussions would be lost. </p>

All I know is that the wheels had been set in motion prior to that meeting because there was a plan to arrest the parents and the social workers were going to refer the case to their legal department. It was technically not a decision to separate the parents from L, as far as I can tell from the notes. They are not likely to reflect the whole of the discussions. However I do not have the benefit of the evidence of those present: they have not been required to set out their evidence as to what occurred and why.</p>

Despite the view from St George’s in the notes, Dr Rich gave a clear and concerned differential diagnosis and recommendation which was available and known to Dr Kabole well before the date she received the paper report. The recommendation was known only to her and Dr Rich until the start of this hearing. It ran contrary to the previous note. </p>

Even if they had by that time obtained an interim care order, an MRI scan could have been sought long before April on the basis of the clear recommendation. Had that scan been done it would have allowed for an earlier view of what had occurred and the presence or absence of membranes would have been known.</p>
