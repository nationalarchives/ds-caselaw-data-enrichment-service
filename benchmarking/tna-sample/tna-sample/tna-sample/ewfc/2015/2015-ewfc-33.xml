	      <span style="font-size:12pt">On 27 June 2014, the local authority issued care proceedings in relation to C, a baby boy born in February 2014.  His parents had brought him to hospital on 16 June with a swollen right arm.  X-rays identified several old and new fractures of the arm and shoulder.  A full skeletal survey was carried out.  This showed that C had suffered no fewer than 26 fractures, affecting all four limbs, the ribs and the shoulder blades.  The fractures had occurred on at least two separate occasions.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">The purpose of this hearing is to establish whether the local authority has proved that C’s injuries were inflicted by his parents.  They both strongly deny this and rely on expert medical opinion that the injuries may have been the manifestation of a condition as yet unknown to medical science that caused transient fragility in C’s bones.  Against this, other expert medical opinion considers it much more probable that the fractures and other appearances were the result of C being assaulted. </span>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">All the doctors agree that extensive investigations have not shown C to have any known medical condition that might explain the fractures.  At the same time they all agree that the radiological appearances seen in the skeletal survey are highly unusual.  It is also agreed by everyone that C’s mother and father have been consistently observed to be caring parents, both before and after the hospital admission.  The basis for intervention in this case rests on the origin of the fractures, and nothing else.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">Where an allegation is a serious one, there is no requirement that the evidence must be of a special quality.  The court will consider grave allegations with proper care, but evidence is evidence and the approach to analysing it remains the same in every case.

Whether a man was in a London street at a particular time might be of no great consequence if the issue is whether he was rightly issued with a parking ticket, but it might be of huge consequence if he has been charged with a murder that occurred that day in Paris.  The evidential standard to which his presence in the street must be proved is nonetheless the same.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">The court takes account of any inherent probability or improbability of an event having occurred as part of a natural process of reasoning.  But the fact that an event is a very common one does not lower the standard of probability to which it must be proved.  Nor does the fact that an event is very uncommon raise the standard of proof that must be satisfied before it can be said to have occurred.</span>

The inherent improbability of a devoted parent inflicting such widespread, serious injuries is high, but then so is the inherent improbability of this being the first example of an as yet undiscovered medical condition.  Clearly, in this or any other case, the answer is not to be found in the inherent probabilities but in the evidence, and it is when analysing the evidence that the court takes account of the probabilities.</span>

Possibility C is only proved if, on consideration of all the evidence, it is more likely than not to be the true explanation for the medical findings.  So, in a case of this kind, the court will not conclude that an injury has been inflicted merely because known or unknown medical conditions are improbable: that conclusion will only be reached if the entire evidence shows that inflicted injury is more likely than not to be the explanation for the medical findings.</span>

Five days later, her mother died while she was caring for her in her father's absence.  In the immediate aftermath of that blow, she decided to continue with the pregnancy (she had begun the process of arranging a termination) and in October she and the father moved into their first home together.

The family received twice-weekly visits from the CCNT team of specialist nurses until they were discharged from that service on 22 May.  There were also visits from health visitors (HV) and visits to the GP and hospital.  C was therefore seen by health professionals every few days: nine times in April, nine times in May and four times in June before his last admission.  The father exhibits a list showing the frequency of these contacts.  To this I have added the dates on which the maternal grandfather cared for C, and also three lines.  The first two lines bracket the window of time during which the majority of the fractures are thought to have been sustained (5 May to 2 June) and the third line shows the beginning of the window for the more recent fractures (6 to 16 June). </span>

During the course of the hearing, the question arose as to whether whole exome genetic sequencing (analysis of all the protein-coding genes in a genome) would be likely to provide further information.  Dr F advises that this was not clinically indicated and that a genetic bone disorder would be unlikely to be associated with transient changes of the kind hypothesised in this case.  Even if some genetic variant was identified, it would be difficult to show that it was relevant to C’s history without finding the variant in other patients with the same history.  The process of analysis would be a lengthy one and likely inconclusive.  In the light of this advice, no party to these proceedings advocated further genetic investigation for forensic purposes.</span>

Less likely as a cause of extensive PR is rapid growth, though this may contribute. </span>

They are principally based on assumptions.  Research evidence (Farrell and others, 2011) shows that 9% of children of up to 6 years old with normal bones were not recorded to cry after a fracture.  The evidence relating to Baby S reinforces that it is not safe to infer a ‘standard’ pain response in the case of a child with bone pathology.  It is not safe, therefore, to use the absence of any identified causative event and acute pain response as a basis for undermining the mother’s credibility.</span>

In that case, the allegation was that a mother was responsible for causing bilateral leg fractures to a child of just under a year of age.  Accepting the evidence of (as it happens) Dr Allgrove, the judge found it possible that excessive use of a mid-strength topical eczema cream might have led to bone demineralisation and a propensity to fracture in a child with some degree of hypotonia and hypermobility of her joints.  He concluded that the local authority had not proved its case and dismissed the proceedings.  </span>

She gave full weight to her view that there may have been a mild degree of osteopenia of prematurity, something that Dr Allgrove discounted.  As to Dr Ng’s process of reasoning, I understand the origin of the concern expressed by Miss Grocott.  Dr Ng at times appeared to suggest that if you could exclude other known diagnoses but could not exclude non-accidental injury, then the conclusion was that this was non-accidental injury, thus overlooking the possibility of an unknown cause.  However, this concern is in my view more apparent than real and may arise from the rather definite way in which Dr Ng sometimes expressed herself.  In fact, she did give full consideration to the possibility of an unknown cause.  I accept her medical findings and her conclusions.  </span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">Dr Allgrove brought a wealth of experience to his consideration of C's case.  I accept his evidence in relation to potential known alternative diagnoses.  However, I find that his core opinion that </span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">overstates the matter.  I accept that there is clinical evidence (such as the absence of external injury or of a complete failure to thrive) and radiological evidence (numerous broadly symmetrical fractures and exuberant PR).   These features should, as Mr J has put it, prompt us to ask the question </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">"Are we missing something?"</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">  However, they do not in themselves provide an answer.  Dr Allgrove’s thesis that this child may suffer from an as yet undiscovered condition cannot be rejected with absolute certainty – the unknown can never be conclusively disproved – but on my assessment of the medical evidence it is extraordinarily unlikely.  Further, his analysis elevates the unusual features of the evidence mentioned at the expense of other features that are not only consistent with but in some cases associated with inflicted injury, for example the numerous metaphyseal fractures, the substantially normal biochemistry, the normal November x-rays, and the significance of fractures apparently occurring only at home.  Accordingly, and with full acknowledgement of Dr Allgrove’s expertise, I prefer the evidence of Dr Halliday and Dr Ng where opinions diverge.  </span>

His view that one should be 100% sure that all reasonable metabolic conditions have been excluded before arriving at a diagnosis of non-accidental injury is a proper one for a clinician and I respect his lingering doubts.  However, the court's task is not performed by reference to certainties or to lingering doubts, but by reaching factual conclusions on the balance of probability.  Dr J sounded a valuable cautionary note but his evidence does not undermine the opinions of Dr Halliday and Dr Ng as to the probable cause of C’s injuries.</span>

Given that the injuries to the other bones were the result of assaults, it is entirely possible that the PR seen on the clavicles was the result of force applied by adult thumbs that disrupted the periosteum without causing any identifiable fracture.  Likewise, the PR seen on the metatarsals can be explained as being the result of an application of force, perhaps by a twisting of the feet, with or without fracture.</span>

This would indeed be to reverse the burden of proof.

The absence of any history of a memorable event where such a history might be expected in the individual case may be very significant.  Perpetrators of child abuse often seek to cover up what they have done.  The reason why paediatricians may refer to the lack of a history is because individual and collective clinical experience teaches them that it is one of a number of indicators of how the injury may have occurred.  For example, in the research article relied upon by the mother in this case, carers said that 91% of the 206 young children in the sample had cried when they sustained a fracture.  Whether or not that is true for the population at large, medical and other professionals are entitled to rely upon such knowledge and experience in forming an opinion about the likely response of the individual child to the particular injury, and the court should not deter them from doing so.

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">C was a much observed baby.  Family, friends and professionals were in and out of his life on an almost daily basis.  Even so, C spent the vast majority of his time in the sole care of one or both of his parents.  The episodes in which he was injured will have lasted moments and may, at least on some occasions, have occurred when one parent was out.</span>

	      <span style="font-size:12pt">C's fractures were not apparent to the many adults who saw him, including during medical examinations and in intimate family situations.  While this is on the face of it surprising, it does not take the matter much further forward.  If the issue was whether C had fractures at all, it might.  But he did have fractures and the fact is that they were not noted by anyone outside the home.</span>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">Of course, if one parent was injuring C, the first line of protection would be the other parent.  In assessing the opportunity for C to be injured in the home, I have considered the degree of protectiveness that each of them has shown.  Unfortunately, they both demonstrated an unquestioning loyalty to the other, to the extent that neither has even asked the other the obvious question: </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">"Have you done something</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">?</span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">"</span>
	      <span style="font-size:12pt">  In contrast, they have shown an inexhaustible curiosity for investigating alternatives (rare conditions, unknown conditions, doctors) that might place responsibility elsewhere.  This would be understandable if each parent was in a position to know with absolute certainty that C had not been injured by the other.  But they cannot both be certain, and however emphatically they protest, such claims amount to little more than blind faith.  An innocent protective parent in this situation would, at whatever cost, confront the other parent.  That has not happened here and the conclusion that I draw is that the dynamic between these parents has deprived C of a level of protection when he was at home as well as depriving the court of their best assistance in finding out what happened to him.  It may be that in the overall circumstances, asking such questions of each other represents too great a risk to the parents' relationship and to their rather idealised image of family life. </span>

He too has had a very difficult time in recent years.  He is clearly devoted to C.  He came across as concerned and well-meaning, but he was similarly incurious about what may have happened in the home, particularly in the period leading up to C’s admission to hospital. </span>
