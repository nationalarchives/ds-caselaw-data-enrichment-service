	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.52in;text-indent:0.5in">This has been an exceptionally difficult case to manage due to the complexity of the facts relied upon by the LA, the extensive disclosure of documents (as a result of the parallel criminal proceedings) and the fact that none of the defendants speak English. The logistics of ensuring the documents have been seen and understood by the lay parties has not been straightforward. The court is enormously grateful to the industry of the respective legal teams who have co-operated and worked very well together to keep this hearing effective. Ensuring this hearing has remained on track in a way that has been fair has been the common aim of all parties, as well as the court.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.52in;text-indent:0.5in">First, the LA is to be commended for the resources they have made available to keep on top of the disclosure. They have been assiduous in making sure disclosure from the police has been made in a timely fashion. The necessary resources have been available so that documentation was quickly paginated and distributed to the parties. It is almost unique in my experience that a case with over 12 lever arch files of documents (nearly half of which came in just before the start of this hearing) should have experienced no difficulties in pagination. The credit for that is due to the efficiency of this LA.</p>

They have all worked together to maintain the effectiveness of this hearing. All parties have had the benefit of representation by experienced counsel and solicitors. All parties have been anxious to avoid this hearing being adjourned and have worked together to avoid that happening. The children who are the subject of these applications have been in foster placements for over seven months, any further delay in the court being able to determine the factual issues in their cases would have been detrimental to their welfare. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.52in;text-indent:0.5in">This fact finding hearing has taken four weeks. Its purpose has been for the court to consider whether the LA can establish there is an evidential foundation, on the balance of probabilities, that each of the children concerned have suffered, or are likely to suffer significant harm and that harm is attributable to the care given to the child, or likely to be given to him if the order were not made, not being what it would be reasonable to expect a parent to give to him (section 31 CA 1989).  This is a necessary requirement for the court to determine before the LA can seek any substantive orders under section 31 CA 1989. The facts relied upon by the LA are serious and include allegations of child exploitation, drug taking, prostitution and serious failure to protect older children.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.52in;text-indent:0.5in">One of the major difficulties has been the logistics of this case and the parallel criminal proceedings. The mothers in each of these three related cases were arrested on 7 May as a result of a lengthy police investigation into allegations of child sexual exploitation. Care proceedings were issued shortly after their arrest and the LA obtained emergency protection orders, followed by interim care orders relating to all the children.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.52in;text-indent:0.5in">These cases were first listed before me in July 2014 and I have dealt with all case management hearings since then. It is not necessary, in this judgment, to set out all of those hearings, save to say that it was agreed by all parties that I would deal with issues relating to police disclosure. No party took issue in principle with that at any stage, or the structure of those hearings. In the event, virtually all the material I have seen has been disclosed, in places redacted by the police in relation to non relevant third party information. The only material that has not been disclosed I have, with the agreement of the parties kept under review during this hearing and remain satisfied that it is not relevant to any of the issues in these proceedings. Where material has been redacted that has been done by the police. I was asked in relation to Z’s medical records to review those redactions, with the agreement of all parties, at the start of this hearing. I have carefully considered at each stage whether any material I have seen that has not been disclosed impacts on my ability to determine this case. I am satisfied it doesn’t as the material is not relevant, either way, to any issues in the case.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.52in;text-indent:0.5in">Whilst the court has endeavoured to ensure the timing of the police disclosure has not been delayed, there has inevitably been slippage. This resulted in a significant volume of disclosure coming in during the first week of this hearing (approximately 4 lever arch files). With the agreement of all parties the oral evidence was delayed until the second week to enable the parties to consider the material. The police disclosure now runs to 8,000 pages and the combined care bundles are in excess of 1,000. On any view this has been a vast amount of material to absorb, particularly for the lay parties who don’t speak English.</p>

That judgment was given on 7 November 2014 and has not been challenged by any party.

For the reasons set out at paragraph 46 of my November judgment I concluded this hearing should proceed.</p>

One of the difficulties in doing this has been the volume of material and the way the documents are prepared. Many of the documents repeat the history over and over again, often in a slightly different way and in a different format. It has been necessary for the court to keep reminding the LA of the need to get the raw material and contemporaneous documents and not rely on the repetition of material. Repetition of an event many times over does not enhance its evidential status, in fact if often weakens it, as frequently there are inaccuracies in the re-telling. A frustrating feature of this case has been the way social work assessments and records of meetings are recorded, it has frequently been very difficult to determine the source of the material within them.</p>

Z – KD described her as being a girl with black hair who had whirls on her face, she said she was a teenager who came around her house and that her mum would take her out but she did not know where. She described her as a bad girl as she smoked weed and that she had seen her roll it outside their house. SS – KD said she is her mum’s friend and that SS is nice, she would come to the house lots of times and would always be hanging out with AD as well as her mum and they would all go out to see M. She gave a description of SS and said her mum liked SS. E – she gave a description of E who she described as her mum’s best friend, she thinks he has two children called K and E and a wife called E. IE – she said IE’s mum is her mum’s friend, she is called ‘I’. KD highlighted that IE wouldn’t go to her house but ‘I’ would. She named ‘I’s children (LE, SE &amp; VE). KD said ‘I’ and her mum are good friends and she would come round and they would go out together. KD said ‘I’ knew Z and when asked how said her mum had introduced them. KD said Z didn’t like ‘I’ but she did not know why, she said her mother and N were no longer friends but she did not know why. KD was asked if she knew any anyone else who was friends or family with ‘I’, she said J who would come outside their house and give mum stuff but didn’t know what this stuff was. KD did not know the name M. KD was asked about JC, she said that was ‘I’s sister and was also called ‘I’. She had not met JC’s children. KD was asked about REB, she said he was a man who came to the home to sell stuff to her mum. KD knew a girl called PF, she was called PF and hung around with Z. KD did not know anyone called A.</p>

KD said she didn’t want to be the one who caused mum to be sent to prison and she is worried it is her fault. The record notes that KJ explained to KD <span style="font-style:italic">‘that other girls had come forward and said that mummy has done some naughty stuff and this is why the police are talking with mum so none of this is her fault’.</span> The foster carer called later to say that KD does not want to have a video conversation as she said if she was to say anything wrong she might get her mum into trouble and she will go to prison.</p>

From February 2010 until about January 2013 there were 3 monthly plans by social services to monitor the family environment with regular reports being sought from Z’s school.

In relation to allegations regarding taking drugs she stated <span style="font-style:italic">‘I started using drugs about 1 year 9 months ago. I took drugs for the first time when I was at my sister’s home. I took crystal meth but have not taken any drugs whatsoever for nearly two months. I feel a lot better physically. I managed to stop without getting any help from anybody else or any organisation. I did not take any drugs in the home. I did not take any drugs in front of the children. I used to go out in the night time after they had gone to bed. My mother lived with us until she died in December 2013 and she was there to look after the children. I used to just walk around the streets. I tricked some men out of money by pretending that I would give them sex if they gave me money to buy drugs. I asked for the money first and as soon as they gave me the money I ran off…I did not give any sexual favours in return for money or drugs. My partner LF knew that I was taking drugs, but he did not know I had tricked anyone to get money for drugs.’</span></p>

She says LF was not aware of her drug use. If she had drugs left over she would hide them away from the house. She does not accept her drug use affected the children. She said LF started working nights in 2011 so he was not aware she was going out at night. She said she used to attend the home of JE and JS to take drugs. She went there daily and got the drugs initially from JS for free, he then started to charge and they fell out. She then went out to take drugs outside and obtained them from someone else. She said she limited her use to Wednesday to Saturday evenings.<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>When she went out she said the children were either left in the care of her mother or LF when his shift pattern changed.

You could even speak to my daughter, before my daughter, you could ask her this and she would tell you this stuff that I just told you…And she would actually pass messages through some strangers and pass messages to me saying she would go and report me.’</span> A little later she was asked about the time AK referred to when Z sold herself to lots of men at the same time AK responded <span style="font-style:italic">‘</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">She didn’t sell herself, she just did it like that because they provided her with cannabis and some other stuff’.</span> When asked about how she knew about this event she said <span style="font-style:italic">‘I don’t know, it’s only just now that other people started talking about it and her mother started making a hoo hah about the whole thing saying that they went to a disco in Town B and there were some men. And that’s why her mother must have reported me..’</span> AK said Z had confirmed to her that everybody had slept with her and she had something injected into her back, meaning drugs. At the end of her interview AK states <span style="font-style:italic">‘Do you actually know that this girl is supposed to be perhaps mentally unstable, that she has some, disabled in some way, that she has some medical confirmations certificates about that.’</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.52in;text-indent:0.5in">Although on the documents from Slovakia ZM is recorded as being present when Z made the allegations in 2011 when she gave evidence during this hearing she had remarkably little memory of it, other than in very general terms. She suggested that Z was actually spoken to by the social worker on her own for some of the time.  In her oral evidence she displayed a somewhat puzzling blank emotional response to the allegations Z had made, and Z’s behaviour around that time. It was very difficult to tell whether this was due to the effects of her previous ill health, the fact that she was seeing Slovakian documents for the first time giving details of serious allegations made by her daughter, the fact that everything was being translated and she was somewhat overwhelmed about coming to court. The suggestion is made in the papers, and by the submissions made on behalf of AK and JE, that I cannot rule out that she and/or her husband may be implicated in some way in what has happened to Z. She denied that in the witness box. There are a number of references in the papers to occasions when Z has alluded to her parents’ involvement in her abuse. For example, the reference in October 2012 to them whoring her which she then denied, what she said to DCV and KJ on their visit on 26 March 2014, CC reference to Z’s parents knowing what she was doing as Z was picked up from home.   This evidence would need to be balanced with the references to Z’s parents being traumatised about what happened in Slovakia to Z, ZM’s reports to the police when Z went missing and the evidence of JK about ZM’s distress when Z returned from periods when she had been missing. There was a somewhat defeatist tone to some of her answers, for example when asked about Z stealing from her purse she replied <span style="font-style:italic">’Yes, she did it more than once, when she got the opportunity she took. I didn’t want to argue with her I just wanted her to be around the house’.</span></p>

Not making time to speak to Z when she wanted to talk to her, instead carrying on with her preparations to return to this country. However, as has been pointed out by the LA ZM has co-operated with these proceedings. If she was in any way implicated in Z’s abuse she may have been more reluctant to attend to give evidence.</p>

The point is made that in the light of the way the recorded interviews were carried out, in particular the interview on 24 October, there is an iZerent risk that the material recorded in the notes came about through leading questions or in a way that is not a free narrative. The oral evidence from DCV was that during the visit on 13 February it was Z doing most of the talking, although she agreed it was highly likely she would have asked some questions. She thought that meeting lasted about 1 ½ hours.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The focus of the criticism of leading questions was on the last ABE interview on 24 October. Mr Larizadeh very effectively pointed out in cross examination of DCV the dangers when DCV was correcting Z (as DCV considered she was making mistakes) and of not stopping the interview when Z was clearly tired. When the leading questions were put to DCV when she gave evidence she did not accept they were leading, as she considered Z had already given the information in earlier interviews. She described this as‘re-capping’, but effectively she was putting a series of leading questions to Z in relation to information she had given some months previously. On occasion this was done in a quite insistent way. On any view that must have iZerent risks in undermining the value of the evidence. The most graphic example was when the intermediary considers Z has had enough, but DCV continues with a series of leading questions about the occasion when there were 15 men and corrects an answer given by Z relating to PF. After that Z appears to be getting very confused <span style="font-style:italic">‘How do you mean? I don’t understand now’</span>. Another example, is earlier in the 24 October interview when DCV suggests <span style="font-style:italic">‘Do you mean IE’s mum?’</span> rather than asking it in a more neutral way ‘Who do you mean?’. In oral evidence DCV responded that she was giving Z a <span style="font-style:italic">‘frame of reference’</span> but she could see the dangers. She also saw the dangers that in helping to clarify matters, as she did in the part of the interview where she introduced ‘.. ‘<span style="font-style:italic">I’ being IE’s mother’</span> she risked contaminating the evidence. It is right to record that Mr Storey Q.C. has made criticism of the leading questions, in particular in the second part of the first ABE interview and the second interview on 16 April.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In cross examination of DCV Mr Storey Q.C. drew out the dangers of confabulation. In the first part of the 6 March ABE interview Z alleges that when she went to AK’s address it was RB who was there and he assaulted her, whereas in the second interview because DCV in her question suggested (inaccurately re-capping) it was AK who assaulted her, Z agreed and the questions continued on that basis. This was arguably a false basis which had been introduced by DCV. He also refers to the different account given in the interview on 24 October about the first time she had met AK JDI had taken her there whereupon AK went out to get some pika and injected it into her. He submits Z has given three versions about how she first met AK and they are completely irreconcilable with each other.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.00in;text-indent:0.5in">DCV was asked why Z was not challenged about any inconsistencies. DCV said the decision had been taken not to do so. So Z was not asked about the stay in hospital for 2 weeks (which there is no corroborative evidence) or the number of men (15 or 20).</p>

The length of time between the interviews is also relevant. The ABE on 24 October was 7 months after the first one.</p>

She was asked about the dangers of giving the child the impression you believe what she says, DCV said she was only praising her for her effort, not what she was telling them. Various parts of the interview were put to her, for example <span style="font-style:italic">Z: You know me very well Kirsty what I said err and what I knew I did tell you the truth; DCV: I know, I, I, I know you have.</span> DCV said it was a difficult balance due to Z’s volatility and if she had prefaced any question with ‘you say’, Z would respond that DCV didn’t believe her.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Those conducting the ABE interviews did not have the important material from Slovakia as to her Z’s psychological functioning. Whilst that is correct and DCV fairly and realistically conceded in questions put to her by Mr Storey Q.C. that if they had known confabulation is an issue they would probably not have undertaken a re-capping type interview on 24 October. However, it is an issue raised in Ms Hope-Borland’s report at paragraph 3.2 (aLFeit on a wrong factual basis). Whilst the 2012 psychological report is important, it has to be seen in the context that (save in the case of Mr H) it did not prevent criminal proceedings being pursued and in one case admissions being made, Z was 13 years old at the time of the assessment, it expresses an opinion as to credibility and whether the allegations are made out. It is of note that Ms Hope-Borland referred in her report (paragraph 3.2) to the issue of confabulation in the context of events that Z had told her that she questioned their accuracy (her brother dying and being pregnant). It is clear from the papers that are now available that Z’s brother did die in January this year and there are references in the papers to Z being pregnant. Ms Hope-Borland suggests ways are found of managing Z giving evidence in a way that avoids stress and distress. Finally, the Slovak report needs to be seen in the context of the recent CAMHS assessment that Z presented as articulate and well kempt and they did not see any signs of mental health problems.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.52in;text-indent:0.5in">A further criticism of the evidence gathering from Z was the process used for the section 9 statements signed by Z. The focus was on the statement dated 7 May 2014. It was suggested to DCV that because of the similarity between her notes of what she recorded on the 5 March regarding JE’s involvement with the 15 men the 7 May statement read as if DCV <span style="font-style:italic">‘had fed her the lines’,</span> she denied that. She denied she prompted her. She said the statement was first written down in Slovak, it was then read through to her and Z made any corrections and then signed it. That statement was then translated into English. The time recordings were put to her on that day. Her statement records that she took the statement between 12.30 to 2.06 pm yet the handwritten notes record her arrival at 10.10, she said she couldn’t recall what happened between 10.10 to 12.30 pm.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.52in;text-indent:0.5in">  It is also necessary for the court to factor in that Z’s memory may be distorted by the drugs she has taken. There is little dispute that she has taken drugs and they are likely to have had an impact on her ability to recall matters. I also need to take into account Z’s general level of dishonesty; she is someone who in a range of circumstances has lied. The false allegation of assault against her father is but one example. The other matter relied on, in part, by AK and JE is that there is evidence that she was able to sell herself. The references to Birmingham and Manchester in the papers are relied upon, as is her behaviour outside the school on the 14 May when she was thrusting herself provocatively to passing cars and a schedule is produced on behalf of JE of evidential references. Z was a child at the relevant time and was not capable of consenting. There is a considerable body of evidence that she was being sold for sex by others.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.52in;text-indent:0.5in">Against these considerations it is important to consider the other evidence that may support what Z says.The fact that Z was missing during the three periods, once in early April and twice in May and may be the victim of sexual exploitation is supported by what was being reported by others. From her school by JA, in the descriptions given of her condition when she returned by ZM in her statement dated 7 March and JK in her statement dated 28 March 2014 and what she told PC Kerr on 5 May. On each occasion in May she is reported to be deeply distressed, dishevelled, and traumatised and to have evidence of injection marks on her body. These contemporaneous and subsequent third party accounts lend weight to Z’s account that she provides to the police in her ABE interviews. These descriptions of her presentation and behaviour are entirely consistent with a young girl who has been subjected to rape and sexual abuse, who has been drugged and injected and who has been taken away by others to do so. </p>

JK in her statement described ZM’s distress at Z’s condition.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.52in;text-indent:0.5in">The fact that Z was sold for sex is supported in a number of respects. In her ABE interview on 20 June 2014 CC gives a detailed and coherent account of how she witnessed Z being sold for sex on 3 separate occasions by JDI. On one occasion to a house in Town B, on another occasion in a kebab shop in Town A and a third time to Indian people who came in a car. She describes Z having money and being distressed. CC has not been cross examined, her evidence has been available and no party made any application to do so. The LA rely on what she says. It is clear having seen the DVDs of these interviews that there is concern that she too may have been sold for sex, which she denies, although she does give accounts of being given money by men for them to be able to talk to her. SS in her ABE interview on 8 May 2014 describes Z selling her body and going with guys for money. She was required for cross examination but the LA have been unable to locate her. In a visit to JC on 11 April KJ records JC referring to a 14 year old girl called N hanging around with IE who were selling themselves for sex. SF is also recorded as giving a similar view about Z on 12 May 2014.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.52in;text-indent:0.5in"> Z was able to identify a number of key addresses where (unknown to her) there was police intelligence about drug use and prostitution. She was able to identify both AK’s address and JE’s address which bearing in mind the passage of time supports her having been at those addresses on more than one occasion. In relation to JE’s she not only identified the building but was able to pick out the actual flat. At the joint visit on 20 February she identified JE’s address as where she and others went to buy pika. She identified where ‘E’ lived and she alleged she was taken there and they injected her with crystal meth. In his police interview RB confirms that is where his nephew RVB lives. Z is unlikely to have known that without personal experience. RVB’s id card was in JS’s wallet in September 2013 when he was arrested in connection with the allegation of rape by JC. A hotel in Town B was identified by Z as one of the places where she was sold, Z is recorded as having been seen there on 10 May 2013 during a period she was missing. Z identifies the kebab shops she was sold at in Town C, Town B and Town A. The account given by CC on 20 June 2014 supports Z being sold in a kebab shop.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.52in;text-indent:0.5in">It is also important to consider the significance of Z referring to two ‘I’s. Z identifies there are two ‘I’s. She is clear that one is IE’s mother (see joint visit 15 April 2014 in the context of being shown SF’s photograph) and JE in her statement agrees she is known as ‘I’. However it becomes apparent that there are two women known as ‘I’. In the joint visit on 13 February 2014 the ‘I’ referred to is linked to being IE’s mother, although she is referred to as being Albanian. During the drive round on 5 March 2014 Z points out a woman named ‘I’ <span style="font-style:italic">‘who sells herself child sells her daughter’</span>, KJ identified this woman as JC. During the joint visit on 15 April when Z identifies a picture of SF she is clear <span style="font-style:italic">‘her mother is JC (who she said also goes by the name of ‘I’)….Z was asked whether this ‘I’ is the ‘I’ she has disclosed about previously as being involved in her abuse, to which she said no and explained that the ‘I’ she has disclosed about previously is IE’s mother’.</span> I agree with the analysis relied upon by Mr Larizadeh in his closing submissions that there is some significance that it is J ‘I’ who Z places with herself and IE in the street who she claims was standing there while Z was being taken away by MC, JDI, RB and RK. In cross examination of DCV he questioned why JC had not been included in an identity parade. JC denies she has ever been known as ‘I’ although in her oral evidence she said she is also known as Sophie/Sophia. I reject JC’s evidence on this and consider it more likely than not that she does use the name ‘I’. This is supported by what KD said on 3 July 2014 and JE confirmed in her oral evidence that PF had told her JC went by the name ‘I’. JC’s denial is a lie to seek to distance herself from Z.</p>

This is a very different from the picture AK sought to portray in the statements filed in these proceedings, where she states that she only knew them to say hello in the street. That was how her case was clearly put in cross examination by Mr Storey Q.C. However under cross examination from Mr Feehan she (eventually) conceded JC came to visit her twice a week in the evening and into the early hours of the morning, she initially sought to suggest that it was to offer her some clothes and she tried to rely on the cultural considerations, that it was impolite not to ask someone to your house for coffee. It was very clear to me that her relationship with JC was more likely to be as JC described in that she visited AK twice a week. AK reluctantly accepted she took drugs with JC on these occasions (although JC said it was only to ask about drugs and lending of money to buy drugs), they saw each other regularly and knew each other well in the context of them both living near each other in a relatively small community. </p>

She was asked about the relatively detailed description given by KD to KJ on 3 July 2014 when she was able to give a description of Z, in particular referring to the whirls on her face. KD is also recorded as saying <span style="font-style:italic">‘Z was a teenager who came round her house and that her mum would take her out but she did not know where’</span>  AK said this was KD describing seeing Z in the street or when Z went to see the black man next door. AK said <span style="font-style:italic">‘I don’t believe KD is saying that…it must have been said to her to say’.</span> She was asked about the description given by KD on the same day of AK’s relationship with JE, AK had maintained in her statements they only knew each other in passing when JE was on her way to visit her sister. KD described them as <span style="font-style:italic">‘good friends’</span>, AK said in evidence they were not very good friends. AK sought to explain KD’s detailed knowledge about JE’s children as being through a common friend who she could not name. KD is recorded as saying JE knew Z, was introduced to Z by AK and Z did not like JE but didn’t know why. AK’s response was KD had been made to say these things. KD’s account is supported by the fact that at the police station AK told the interviewing officer she knew it was JE’s birthday, more consistent with being close friend than a passing acquaintance. KJ was not challenged about this discussion with KD when she gave oral evidence. Mr Storey Q.C. took great issue with this; he questioned how he could challenge that account when his client had not been present. That had not prevented him cross examining witnesses who had spoken to Z. I have carefully taken into account that KD has not given oral evidence, that this information was not obtained through an ABE interview and is second hand hearsay.</p>

They amounted to her suggesting she had been left three bank cards by someone who she could give little or no details about, who had visited her only once (in connection with mending a computer) and when she contacted him did not seem to want them back. The explanation in relation to the passport was equally implausible, she sought to suggest she was keeping it for AD’s husband who had never lived there and who she disliked so much she didn’t even know his name. She admitted a document also found at her house with details on it relating to a fake marriage was a document for that purpose. She denied that she had arranged a fake marriage for her daughter, but seemed unable to give any further explanation for this document. There can be no other rational explanation for this document other than it contained details of a fake marriage which AK had some involvement in, possibly relating to either her husband or her daughter’s marriage. It is of note, in passing, that a phone number written on it is a phone number used by JE and JS. AK was asked about the police intelligence reports, all prior to the police speaking to Z,  regarding AK’s involvement in prostitution, her address being used to prepare and sell drugs and her involvement with stolen property, she suggested that these reports were due to people being paid by the police to give information. She accepted she knew the individual named in one of the police reports, that she was having a relationship with him and the details regarding his wife and children were correct. I am rightly reminded by both Mr Storey Q.C. and Mr Samuels Q.C. that unattributed police intelligence reports are not reliable evidence, by their nature they are little more than suspicion even if they have some information in them that may be correct.</p>

It was notable that when she was asked about this there was a very long pause whilst she thought what to say. It was very apparent she was struggling to think what the best answer to give was and could only fall back on the one visit she had referred to. When it was pointed out that this information was in a different part of the police interview, she then said she had heard this and asked Z if it was true as they were walking up the stairs to her flat, on her case this was the first time she had met her. On AK’s account that discussion is highly unlikely to have taken place then, it is more likely to support Z’s account of her being a friend. Whilst I take on board the point made by Mr Storey Q.C. about the lack of any phone records to support Z’s assertion that they constantly called each other in my judgment it is much more likely AK had gained this information through a much closer involvement and relationship with Z than she has sought to portray.</p>

Whilst I consider many of the criticisms of the ABE interviews made by Mr Storey Q.C. have some foundation no criticism is made of the first part of the 6 March ABE interview where Z gives an account of AK not tainted by leading questions. I have to consider whether that account is fatally undermined by her subsequent inconsistent accounts and the wider canvas of her unreliability. I don’t consider it is as those later accounts were caused, in part, by a mistake of the interviewer and a series of leading questions. I have to consider Z’s account in the context of the wider canvas of her lies and inconsistencies and the fact that she has not been cross examined, but also the material that is available to support the core credibility of her account that she was being sold for sex. Whilst I have considered the lack of any phone records to support what Z says about she and AK constantly calling each other I do consider it is of note, in the context where on AK’s version of events they only ever met once (apart from passing in the stret when JC and Z were arguing) that there are records of phone communication between AK and Z around the time she was going missing.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.52in;text-indent:0.5in">This view is supported by the unconvincing explanation she gave for her contact with JDI and MC who had been named by others, including Z and CC, in connection with selling girls for sex. I reject the suggestion by her that she only knew them in the context of being put in touch with someone about furniture. Both Z and SS connect these men with selling women for sex. AK accepts SS is a friend of hers who would visit regularly to take drugs with her. Her regular visits are confirmed by KD as she describes the closeness of AK’s relationship with SS. It is iZerently improbable in these circumstances that AK would not know about them in that context. In that context the evidence of telephone contact with them on a phone that is attributed to her some at times when Z is reported missing is support for her involvement in what was happening to Z at the time. All she could say when pressed about these calls was that she was lending her phone, but gave no details of who she had lent it to, when and in what circumstances. She could give no explanation why the phone records show communication between her and Z. For example, the table at P7874 shows the following from Z’s phone to AKs on 14 May 2014: texts at 00.58 and 01.48; voicecalls at 13.46 (lasting 35 seconds) and at 20.18 (lasting 1min 34 seconds); texts at 22.36 and 23.15. This was the day after Z came back from a period when she had been missing for 5 days. This telephone contact is wholly at odds with AK’s case. The significance of that is supported by the evidence from the school about AK’s phone number on Z’s phone as ‘A’. </p>

If she had only been there once, as AK suggests, it is much less likely she would have been so readily able to identify it. This also applies to the fact she identified KD, who on AK’s account she had only met once some 10 months previously. I have carefully considered whether this knowledge and communication could be explicable by the fact that they are all in a small community, that they may be communicating for other reasons as set out in Mr Storey’s written closing submissions but having considered all the evidence it is more likely to be knowledge that was acquired by direct contact between Z and AK rather than general knowledge when on AK’s case they had no other dealings. On AK’s case there is no rational explanation as to why Z would have her phone details on her phone and why she would be contacting her.</p>

Since then they occasionally met up or would say hello in the street or she would see AK to say hello when she visited an Uncle in a neighbouring flat. However, at the police station when they were arrested AK gave a different account of significantly more contact which JE was asked about; JE’s response in her oral evidence was to say she <span style="font-style:italic">‘hated’</span> AK, which she had not said before. JE was pressed about the significant amount of telephone/text contact shown on the records between JE and AK from April 2013, she could not account for that other than to say either JS or IE used her phones too. This was in the context of JS having what has been described as a flirty relationship with AK and IE being a regular user of their phones if her credit ran out. That has to be looked at in the context that JE said she spoke to AK about her suspicions when they lived at <span style="color:#FF0000">a </span>previous address, which they left in February 2013, some months before the records show a significant amount of telephone contact.</p>

She had also remained in regular contact with JC, even after the alleged rape in July 2013, and they still operated together, as was demonstrated by the events in early April this year. Until she gave her oral evidence she had denied being with her sister in April when they were reported as going to a man’s flat in the early hours of the morning. In her oral evidence she agreed she had been there. When pressed she could give no explanation as to why she went with her sister to a man’s home who she did not know in the early hours of the morning. The only credible explanation is that she was operating with her sister, as it was very likely she had done so before, whereby they would take money from men. This was precisely the complaint made by the man when he reported the matter to the police. This behaviour by the sisters had been observed by others. In this context it is also very difficult to accept JE’s evidence that she had no knowledge of JC’s drug use bearing in mind the frequency they were in contact (certainly up until July 2013) and JC’s own admissions as to how she was during that period.</p>

She was referred to what Z, CC and KD had each said independently about AK and JE being friends, and that Z and KD each said AK had introduced Z to JE. All JE could say was it was not like this. She was pressed about her knowledge of RVB, whose identity card was found on JS when he was arrested in relation to the rape allegation in September 2013; she denied any knowledge of him. The only explanation she could give for the phone records for her phones having regular phone and text messages with JDI and MC, both of whom had been named by Z, SS, CC as being involved in selling people for sex, were that the phones were also used by JS and IE. The only explanation she could give for Z identifying her flat, including the precise number, was that Z was friends with IE. She could give no explanation as to why Z would recognise a photograph of SE.  It became increasingly clear, that whilst there may be an alternative explanation for some of these matters (for example the possibility of someone else using the phones) when looked at all together it was more likely than not that JE’s knowledge of Z was significantly more than she was revealing and that this was due to more direct contact she had with Z that she was saying. </p>

The picture she painted during that period was that she was out walking the streets all the night on many nights of the week; she could not sleep and was in a desperate state trying to secure further drugs. She accepts she approached men as if to offer them sex and then took money from them before running away. She admits she did this and there is police evidence that supports her doing that, even as recently as January and early April this year. It became a recurring feature of her oral evidence that when she was pressed for more detail she responded with ‘<span style="font-style:italic">I do not remember’</span> or <span style="font-style:italic">‘I don’t remember’,</span> even to relatively simple questions about when she alleges she was still being supplied drugs by JS. It is clear JC was a regular visitor to AK’s home; she would go there late at night or in the early hours to take drugs 2 to 3 times a week. That is now accepted by AK, although AK’s case as put to JC was that they were not friends and JC only knew AK to say a passing hello to. It is also clear that prior to July 2013 she saw JE regularly; their relationship was described by each of them as close. It is also clear that whilst there may have been a period around July 2013, at the time she made the allegation of rape against JS, when she did not see as much of her sister JE, it is very likely that their relationship resumed and they saw each other regularly again; for example in early April 2014 they were together in the early hours of the morning and it was not suggested by either of them this was an unusual or one off occasion. </p>

JC sought to maintain that culturally it was impolite to not ask someone in if they asked politely. Even making all due allowance for cultural considerations it seems iZerently improbable that this is a credible explanation that JC, who denied being involved in prostitution, would allow someone who she did not know and who had confessed to being involved in prostitution the night before into her home for a shower. It is much more likely that Z went there as she had been there before and her relationship with JC was much closer than JC has sought to suggest. JC’s version of events becomes increasingly improbable when considered in the light of what she says was a subsequent chance encounter with Z when she challenged Z about her taking some belonging of JC’s when she had come in for a shower. According to JC this ended up with her being asked by Z to take her home, which JC did. According to JC she went in to Z’s home and spoke to her mother ZM. All of this is inconsistent with her suggestion that Z had stolen items from her, they had had an argument and she didn’t know her. If these were the only 3 occasions JC has seen Z it is unusual that Z would seek help from JC unless she knew her better than JC has said or that JC would feel inclined to offer it. JC denied she was, on occasion, referred to as ‘I’, as described by Z and KD, she said she called herself a different name, Sophie/Sophia. Although she accepts she saw IE regularly she denied informing the social worker who undertook an assessment in April 2014 that IE and her friend are sold to men for sex. She denied that she knew or suspected Z was under the age of 17 years even though LF stated he thought Z was between 14 – 15 years and she is recorded as informing the social worker, during a visit on 11 April 2014, that she had concerns about IE and a 14 year old girl called Z and they were selling themselves for sex. I have no hesitation in accepting the LA records of their discussions with JC; they are detailed and specific, two social workers were present as well as an interpreter. She could not explain why CC would say that she knows Z. </p>

That would explain why she let Z come and use the shower; that is consistent with her having a close relationship with IE who she saw regularly; it is consistent with Z seeking her help to take her home; it is consistent with what she said to the social worker about IE and Z being sold for sex; it is consistent with Z’s date of birth being give on 5 September. It is possible there were occasions when JC and Z sought to sell themselves for sex together and that one of the people with JC on 5 September was possibly Z. She was fully aware what was going on with Z, she operated within that world most nights and she was closely involved with JE and AK who also knew what was going on with Z.</p>

Whilst some of the matters may be capable of an alternative explanation (for example JE and JS’s phones being used by someone else, possibly IE) but when looked at in the wider context of the other evidence available the gravitational force of all the evidence together, and the inferences that can reasonably be drawn from them, pulls the court back towards the conclusion that these women during the relevant time were closely and intimately connected with each other, were in regular contact with each other, they were each closely connected with IE and SS and this was all within a relatively small community. This is supported by the accounts given independently by KD, CC, SS and IE. I am also clear that as a result of the close connection between them AK, JE and JC were also in regular contact with Z and were fully aware of what was happening to her, namely that she was being sold by others for sex and that, at the very least, JDI and MC were involved in that. The phone records show phones attributed to JDI and MC are in regular contact with mobile phones used by AK and JE and others in their household at a time when Z is missing. With each piece of the jigsaw the accounts given by AK, JE and JC become iZerently more improbable and the only inference that can be drawn is that they were each involved to some extent in what was happening to Z in terms of her being sold for sex. </p>

He submits none of the papers in the criminal case provide a connection between AK and RB; that none of the defendants implicate AK as being involved with them in any arrangements relating to selling Z for sex and the telephone records do not support AK constantly calling Z. It is also right that some of the allegations that Z makes about others (such as IE, SF and CC) are not accepted by them. But that has to be balanced with the information they give that is broadly supportive of the truthfulness of Z’s account of being sold for sex.

That mistake, in my judgment, fatally undermines the foundation for that specific finding that AK assaulted Z but does not undermine the general finding as to AK being complicit in the arrangements for Z. It is clear in the detailed answer Z gave in the early stage of her first ABE interview that AK was involved; she gives a clear unprompted account of AK’s involvement on page 6 of the interview, a description of AK on pages 27 – 30 and 32 (including details regarding AK’s children).</p>

The involvement of AK is more specific in the context of the allegations made by Z. In relation to JE it is less specific but I am satisfied she had a closer relationship with Z than she has stated, that she was fully aware that Z was being sold for sex by others as Z clearly had a more detailed knowledge of her than is consistent with only been seen at a distance on two or three occasions leading to the clear inference that she was complicit in Z’s sexual exploitation.

I consider he has greatly underplayed his drug taking and the circumstances in which he gets drugs. He came across as a confident person, a person who would know what was going on around him and I consider it is more likely than not that he introduced JC to, and supplied her with, drugs from his home address. The way he sought to back track in his oral evidence from what he said in his interview in September 2013 (pages 20 – 21 of the interview) about JC having crystals after they first had sex (<span style="font-style:italic">‘What I saw it was after sex she took’)</span> is supportive of his knowledge and involvement with drugs with JC is far greater than he has said<span style="font-style:italic">. </span> Equally I don’t accept JE’s denial of taking drugs. She is clearly not telling the truth when she denies any knowledge of someone who was living with her being arrested for drugs and not knowing JC was taking drugs. She was seeking to distance herself from any connection with drugs, which were clearly all around her. It is more likely than not, that she was aware of JS taking drugs. That conclusion is supported by her being involved in the incident in April 2014 with JC which, according to JC, was because the man they went back with had some drugs.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.52in;text-indent:0.5in"> The finding sought is JC offered herself to men for money in return for sex. JC accepts she did this; there are a number of reports of her doing so (5 September, 11 January and 6 April). The driving force for her was in order to obtain money for drugs. I am satisfied she did this on more occasions than there are contemporaneous records for and is likely to have been doing this since at least early 2013 in order to fund her drug addiction. It is very likely on occasions she did this with others, in particular JE. This conclusion is supported by JE’s involvement on 6 April and the fact when JC was arrested on 5 September others were present and Z’s date of birth was given.</p>

The only credible explanation for that was that she was part of plan to take money from him. That is what the man alleged took place and JE could give no other explanation for why she went there. It is very likely this is not an isolated occasion and that she has probably done this before with JC. This has been observed by others, for example SS.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.52in;text-indent:0.5in"> A close analysis of the circumstances of the alleged first rape do not support it being non consensual. In particular, JE being in the home at the time, JS wanting to leave the door open of the room they went into the other room where they had sex, no one hearing the screams/shouts JC alleges she made and the fact that JE did not notice anything untoward when she came back down the stairs. Nor was it suggested to JE that she noticed any noticeable change in frequency of JC visiting the E home afterwards. Their sexual relationship is more likely to be bound up with JC’s increasing dependency on drugs and the fact that they are more likely than not to have taken drugs together. That is supported in part by what JS said in his police interview that JC took drugs after they had sex.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.52in;text-indent:0.5in">The alleged second rape also does not stand up to close analysis. This is said to have taken place in the early hours of the morning when JC was visiting the E household, leaving at a time JE said she had gone to bed. This was at a time when JC said she mainly saw JE out of the E home.  JC is said to have taken drugs outside the home and accepted a lift home with JS. She said she only did so as there was another person in the car. It is difficult to see how that made any difference as it is not suggested she knew whether that person would be present in the car for the journey home, or even checked that was so. As she got in the back of the car, the other person got out and for some inexplicable reason she failed to get out of the car as well. She said the doors were locked. If what she had said about the first rape was true it is difficult to see how she allowed herself to get into the situation she found herself in. It is more consistent with her having a consensual sexual relationship. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.52in;text-indent:0.5in">JC’s suggestion that these occasions were non consensual are further undermined by two further matters. First, the information she gave in her police interview about further visits to the E home after they moved to their home address in May 2013 when JS is alleged to have sexually assaulted her. This is inconsistent with her position that she only met JE out of the E family home after the second rape in late January early February 2013. Second, what LF said in his oral evidence about his position when he was told about this by JC. It appears she initially asked him by text what he would think if she had had sex with another person, he admitted there was an argument between them and his ultimatum was clear; either she had to report the matter to the police (as rape) or he would leave. It was in those circumstances she reported the rape. This ultimatum by LF is referred to in her police interview.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.52in;text-indent:0.5in"> JS’s position is supported by the police enquiries made immediately after he was interviewed in September. The police officer saw JC’s sister and niece who confirmed they were told by JC of the relationship with JS but denied being told it was forceful or without her consent, as JC stated. Whilst I can’t rule out the possibility that JS may have spoken to them before he was interviewed, there is no motive given for them to protect him and give an untruthful account against their sister. JC has been staying with her sister for a number of months and did not suggest this, so the likelihood is their accounts were correct.</p>

There was an air of indifference by JS when he was answering questions about this issue by Mr Feehan Q.C., there was no sign that he understood the historical concerns about his and JE’s  failure to protect IE. Both he and JE seemed fixed on the fact that as IE had not admitted she had a sexual relationship with PD there was nothing they could do about it. When it was put to them that the fact that she had been away from their home for a month when only 15 years of age may suggest she was more than dating her boyfriend, they both fell back on the response that she had not admitted a sexual relationship with her boyfriend, thereby effectively absolving them of any responsibility to take any steps. JE denied that she had told the social workers who had visited that she feared IE was in a sexual relationship with her boyfriend and may be taking drugs.</p>

This is perhaps best illustrated by JE’s evidence to Judge Murdoch QC when she disputed her previous reports about IE and PD arguing when they spent time in the family home. The historical evidence clearly points to a different conclusion.</p>

It was revealing in his oral evidence about this matter that whilst he considered RV as a paedophile for his convictions for sexual offences in relation to a child he did not regard his conviction for a similar offence as being in the same category. This attitude chimes with his answers to questions relating to the indecent images of child like people as itemised in the schedule prepared by DC Brightman. In terms of protecting his children from the risk of future significant harm this is a matter that will require further investigation to assess JS’s ability to protect in the future.</p>

The position in relation to drug dealing and prostitution has been dealt with above. The basis upon which possession of a previous address was obtained is far from clear. The suggestion of rent arrears is disputed. I have not seen any documents relating to the possession proceedings or any findings made by the court. There is an issue about the reliability of ‘W’ who has been reluctant to come to court to give evidence. In the context of the other findings the court has already made I do not consider sufficient evidence has been made available to establish this findings to the required standard.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.52in;text-indent:0.5in">It is clear AK has been involved in arranging marriages in the past. She accepted in her evidence the document found in her home supported this, although she stated in her response to threshold that it had been prepared by AD’s husband’s mother. In relation to the three bank cards found in her home in the name of others she gave an account in her oral evidence that she had not given before relating to a man whose name she did not know who had come once to mend her computer, who she had not seen again and who for some inexplicable reason had left these bank cards with her. When she contacted him he did not want them and had returned to the Country A. That account is simply not credible, she had not given it before and it is unsupported by any other material. It is quite clear these were bank cards that were not hers and she has failed to give any proper account as to why they are there. After AD’s separation from her husband AK’s rationale for keeping the man’s passport in her freezer does not stand up to any kind of close scrutiny. She could give no reason why it had not been returned to him and in the light of her conduct in relation to the arranged marriage and bank cards one is left with the inevitable conclusion that this passport had been kept by her for other reasons unrelated to the owner of the passport. What these matters show is that AK was participating in criminal behaviour that was very likely to put KD at risk of significant harm either from the people who AK was associating with or that she would be likely to be arrested and be the subject of a criminal investigation.</p>
