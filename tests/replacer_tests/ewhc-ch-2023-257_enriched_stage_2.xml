<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The trial before me of the Part 8 claim form in this matter concerns a short point of statutory construction.  Put broadly, it is whether one of the conditions for transitional tax relief under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2004/12" uk:canonical="2004 c. 12" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Finance Act 2004</ref> applies in the circumstances of this case to a pension that the First Defendant would like to take under the pension scheme that applies to him.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Claimant is the Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Authority (the “Claimant” or the “Fire Authority”). It is a body corporate established by The Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Authority (Combination Scheme) Order 2006 (SI/No 2790 of 2006).  </p>

<content>
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Fire Authority is also a relevant “fire and rescue authority” for the purposes of the Firemen’s Pension Scheme Order 1992 (SI No. 129 of 1992) (the “FPSO”).  The FPSO, in broad terms, sets up a pension scheme for the benefit of (among others) “fire fighters, their spouses and civil partners and dependents” (see FPSO, Schedule 2,  rule A3(1)) (the “Scheme”).   The Scheme is set out in Schedule 2 to FPSO.  For the remainder of this judgment, I refer to the relevant rules of the Scheme by reference to FPSO without necessarily identifying the schedule of FPSO.  The Fire Authority has various responsibilities, duties and discretions under the Rules in FPSO.</p>

<content>
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Although described before me and in the heading to the court documents as “trustee” there is a dispute between the parties as to whether the Fire Authority is a trustee of the Scheme in the true sense of that term.  On the limited material before me and submissions made to me, there is a real question as to whether the Fire Authority actually holds any trust property (rather than making records in its books of account as to sums received and sums expended in relation to the Scheme).  As I go on to explain, that is but one dispute among a number that I do not consider that I need to resolve for the purposes of determining the real matter in issue between the parties.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Fire Authority employs the First Defendant, Mr Lee Howell. He is currently the Chief Fire Officer of the Authority. It is accepted that the Scheme applies to him.  The question before me concerns the application of relevant transitional provisions of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2004/12" uk:canonical="2004 c. 12" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Finance Act 2004</ref> to his pension rights under his employment contract and the terms of FPSO.  The question of transitional provisions arises because the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2004/12" uk:canonical="2004 c. 12" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Finance Act 2004</ref> raised the age at which pensions could be taken on retirement without losing certain favourable tax conditions. </p>

A number of separate tax regimes for different types of scheme were brought within the umbrella of one type of scheme, the “registered” pension scheme.  In particular, under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2004/12" uk:canonical="2004 c. 12" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">FA 2004</ref> “registered” pension schemes are subject to a favourable tax regime.

The increase to age 57 will not apply to members of the various firefighters, police and armed forces public service pension schemes (commonly referred to as uniformed services pension schemes).

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The question in this case is whether in April 2006, Mr Howell had relevant rights which are protected under the transitional provisions contained in Schedule  <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2004/12" uk:canonical="2004 c. 12" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">FA 2004</ref>.  If his rights are protected then payment of his pension may be made to him without suffering tax charges.  If they are not protected then a number of tax charges may arise if he receives pension payments before the age of 55.</p>

The surcharge arises on a calculated basis depending on the proportion that the unauthorised payments made within a specified period bear to the member’s “crystallised” and “uncrystallised” rights (in each case valued according to a methodology set out in the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2004/12" uk:canonical="2004 c. 12" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">FA 2004</ref>). Finally, under sections 239 and following sections a scheme sanction charge, being a charge to income tax, may fall on the scheme administrator where in any tax year one or more scheme chargeable payments are made by a registered scheme. There are other potential consequences of making unauthorised payments under section 242 <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2004/12" uk:canonical="2004 c. 12" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">FA 2004</ref>.</p>

The question is therefore whether the transitional provisions set out in Schedule 36 apply so as to prevent this consequence.</p>

Paragraph 21 provides (among other things) that if paragraph 21 applies in relation to a registered pension scheme and a member of the pension scheme, then save in respect of two provisions, the relevant part of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2004/12" uk:canonical="2004 c. 12" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2004 Act</ref> containing the provisions that I have dealt with, has effect as if references to “normal minimum pension age” were references to “the member’s protected pension age”.  Where the relevant conditions spelled out in paragraph 21 apply, then the member’s protected pension age is the age from which the member had “an actual or prospective right to any benefit under the protected pension scheme on 5 April 2006, or, where condition B is met, under the original pension scheme on that date” (see paragraph 22(8)). However the paragraph does not operate so as to give the member a protected pension age of more than 50 at any time before 6 April 2010 (see paragraph 22(9)).</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">To be a “protected pension scheme”, conditions A or B have to be met (paragraph 22(2)).  Condition B does not apply in this case. It relates to block transfers between pension schemes.  Condition A requires two conditions to be met. The first is that the pension scheme falls within any of the categories of pension scheme which became registered pension schemes on 6 April 2006 as set out in paragraph 1(1) of the Schedule.  That condition is met here. The second condition is that “the entitlement condition” is met in relation to the member and the pension scheme (paragraph 22(3)).  The “entitlement condition” contains three elements: (a) on 5 April 2006, the member must have had an “actual or prospective right under the pension scheme to any benefit from an age of less than 55” ; (b) the rules of the pension scheme on 10 December 2003, must have included provision conferring such a right on some or all of the persons who were then members of the scheme and (c) such a right must then have been conferred on the member or would have been if he or she had been a member of the scheme on that date.  It is condition (a) of the entitlement  condition which arises in this case and where there is a dispute as to whether it does or does not apply.  Elements (b) and (c) of the entitlement condition are met in this case.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As regards the “retirement condition”, there is a dispute as to whether I should make any determination as to the construction of the relevant paragraphs or their effect in the current factual situation.  Two conditions apply.  First the member must become entitled to all the benefits payable to him (or her) under arrangements under the scheme (to which he did not have actual entitlement on or before 5 April 2006) on the same date.  Secondly, in a case where on 5 April 2006 the member had an actual or prospective right under the pension scheme to any benefit from an age of less than 50, condition 1 must be met or, in any other case, condition 2 or 3 must be met. Conditions 1 to 3 relate to requirements that the member is not employed by certain types of employer after he or she becomes entitled to all the relevant benefits and that the becoming entitled to the benefits must not be a part of an arrangement the main, or one of the main purposes, is to avoid tax or national insurance contributions.</p>

<p class="FootnoteText"> Applicable in England. There are now different provisions of the SI applying to each of England, Scotland and Wales.</p>
</authorialNote> that I was referred to as applying to Mr Howell are those of the pension scheme itself as set out in Schedule 2 to the statutory instrument.  They were A3 (dealing with the persons to whom the Scheme applies), A13 (setting out the normal pension age of 55) and B1 setting out an entitlement to take an ordinary pension at the age of 50 (calculated in accordance with Part 1 of Schedule 2) in certain cases of long service. That entitlement will not apply in certain circumstances whose existence can only be determined in connection with or at or shortly before actual retirement. For present purposes, the key condition is that the entitlement to a pension at the age of 50 will not apply to a Chief Fire Officer, if the Chief Fire Officer retires before the age of 55, unless notice of retirement was given with the permission of the fire and rescue authority.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Unfortunately, the parties were unable to agree, as directed, a statement of facts and issues.  Somewhat unusually, the parties rather than awaiting or seeking a relevant court order, decided that they would adopt the route of having “particulars of claim” and a defence (rather than, if ordered by the court, points of claim and points of defence) in these part 8 proceedings.  The status of these statements of case is somewhat uncertain.  Written witness evidence was served and HMRC agreed that there should be no cross-examination nor any disclosure.  In its defence, HMRC in large point put the claimant to proof of the facts as pleaded.  In reaching trial, HMRC sought to maintain the position that certain of the facts were not proved but that HMRC was prepared to accept the facts for the purposes of the hearing before me only.   </p>

Deferred members may take benefits before age 55 but only with the consent of the trustees or the employer. The active members as at 5 April 2006 who were also active members on 10 December 2003 or who joined the scheme after that date therefore have a protected pension age but the deferred members do not. On or after 6 April 2006, the employer decides that it will close its defined benefits section in the scheme and instead in future will provide benefits on a defined contributions basis in a new section of the existing scheme. As a result, those members who were active members of the defined benefits section on 5 April 2006 become deferred members of that section and active members of the defined contributions section (with a reserved right, qualified or unqualified) to take benefits before age 55. However, these members still retain their protected pension age as this is unaffected by any changes in scheme rules made from 6 April 2006 onwards. So, they are still able to take their benefits before age 55 after 2010 provided that consent to taking the deferred benefits (and their defined contribution section benefits if the right to them is qualified) is given and that they become entitled to all their scheme benefits under both the defined benefits and defined contributions sections on the same date</span></p>

On HMRC’s case, the condition would have to have been met back on 5 April 2006.</p>

<intro>
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I should add that a great deal of the written skeleton arguments was taken up with the issue of whether the court could or should make a declaration and if so on what jurisdictional basis. Some of this related to other relief apparently being sought by the Claimant, as I shall refer to later in this judgment.  As regards declaratory relief in relation to the “entitlement condition” Ms Brown submitted that such relief should be granted to her as a trustee seeking directions.  Mr Oakes submitted that Ms Brown’s client was not a trustee and therefore that any declaration could only be granted under the court’s general discretionary power and not in the context of its role in relation to trustees.  At the end of the day, Mr Oakes (and as I understood it, Ms Brown) accepted that, even under the general jurisdiction of the court, there was both jurisdiction and, as a matter of discretion, it would be appropriate for the court to make a declaration regarding the point of law arising with regard to whether or not, on the facts, Mr Howell fulfils the “entitlement condition” of paragraph 22 of schedule 36, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2014/26" uk:canonical="2014 c. 26" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">FA 2014</ref>.

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The second issue that surfaced during the hearing was whether or not the “retirement condition” was met.  As I have pointed out, whether the retirement condition is met appears largely to depend upon future events.  However, Ms Brown submitted that there were matters that were capable of being determined now. Her submission is that, first, all benefits payable under the Scheme will be payable at the same time, so that paragraph 22(7)(a) of schedule 36 <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2004/12" uk:canonical="2004 c. 12" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">FA 2004</ref> is met. Secondly, she submits that paragraph 22(7)(b) does not apply in the circumstances here.  That is because, she says, paragraph 22(7)(b) does not apply at all unless on 5 April 2006 Mr Howell had an actual or prospective right under the Scheme to any benefit from an age of less than 50.  If he did then condition 1 has to be met and if it is not then conditions 2 or 3 have to be met.</p>

<content>
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Oakes’ position was that HMRC had not come prepared to deal with this issue.   As regards 22(7)(a), HMRC needed more time to consider the Scheme as a whole and the benefits potentially payable under it which might go wider than simply a pension at age 50.  As regards paragraph 22(7)(b), he did not agree that as a matter of construction paragraph 7(b) was dealing solely with a situation where the member had, on 5 April 2006, an actual or prospective right to any benefit from an age of less than 50.  Rather, if that was the case then condition 1 had to be met.  If that was not the case (ie there was no such entitlement), then conditions 2 and condition 3 came into play and one at least had to be satisfied.  The words “in any other case” were a reference to any other case than where on 5 April 2006 the member had the relevant right, not a reference to a case where, in such circumstances, condition one was not met. I note that Ms Cullen KC’s opinion seems to proceed on the basis put forward by Mr Oakes.</p>

<content>
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ms Brown referred me to the particulars of claim and the defence. She said that the statements of case prevent HMRC from now raising a contrary case that the “retirement condition” is, or may, not be met.  True it is that the particulars of claim assert, for example in paragraphs 3.7 and 3.8, that the “only point of concern” was whether paragraph 22(4) of schedule 36 <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2004/12" uk:canonical="2004 c. 12" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">FA 2004</ref> applies and that the Claimant’s position was that the  “other conditions” (that is of paragraph 22) are met. Further, the Defence simply “noted” these paragraphs.  Nevertheless I am not satisfied that the Second Defendant is prevented from raising the issue.  The hearing before me concentrated almost entirely upon the paragraph 22(4) point and the “entitlement” position. I heard very limited argument indeed on the retirement condition under paragraph 22(7), most of it directed to whether HMRC were prevented from denying the assertion that the condition was met.  The hearing as it was overran its time estimate by a substantial margin.  I do not consider that I should deal with the retirement condition issue without it being clearly formulated and relevant evidence and proper full submissions being made.  If it is necessary to allow HMRC to amend their statement of case I would allow them to do so but I do not consider that it is.  I would not be prepared to make any declaration in the particular circumstances based upon some form of pleading point that HMRC are not permitted to raise any counter arguments.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As is clear to me from the statements of case and the draft list of issues, the key question before me was whether as a matter of law the “entitlement condition” was met (and more narrowly whether the first element of that condition was met).  However, in her skeleton argument for the hearing, Mr Brown commenced by saying that the Claimant had applied for an order that it is able to <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">and should</span> make a payment to Mr Howell prior to his attaining the age of 55 (emphasis supplied).  In fact directions as to what the claimant “should” do (and in particular whether it should make a payment even if it did amount to an unauthorised payment) had never been raised before.  In her supplemental skeleton, Ms Brown suggested that the Claimant was seeking declaratory relief as to whether it would be within its powers to make a payment to Mr Howell before he attains the age of 55 without making provision for unauthorised payments.  This again seemed to be relief relating to the scope of the Claimant’s powers and how it should exercise them.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As I understood it Ms Brown ultimately accepted that she was not seeking the directions of or declarations by the court as to what the Claimant should do (which would involve consideration of a lot more evidence than that which was before me and might involve the need for joinder of other persons to the extent that for example, the making of an unauthorised payment might have an effect upon the relevant Scheme). The Claimant really needs to know what the legal position in relation to the entitlement condition in the case of Mr Howell and will then have to consider what course it is appropriate for it to take. Its current position, as I understand it, is that it is not prepared to make an early payment of pension (ie before Mr Howell attains the age of 55) if that would be an unauthorised payment under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2004/12" uk:canonical="2004 c. 12" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">FA 2004</ref>.    I note however that, as I go on to explain later in this judgment, part of Ms Brown’s submissions seemed to be to the effect that the claimant had to make an early relevant payment in any event.</p>

<intro>
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There was a debate before me as to the meaning of “ambiguity” in this context.  Ms Brown submitted that “ambiguous” meant something more than “capable of bearing more than one meaning”.  In this respect she focussed upon the passage of the speech of Lord Browne-Wilkinson in <span style="font-style:italic">Pepper v Hart</span> as set out below (with her emphases):</p>
</intro>
<subparagraph>
<content>
<p style="margin-left:0.78in"><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">“Statute law consists of the words that Parliament has enacted. It is for the courts to construe those words and it is the court's duty in so doing to give effect to the intention of Parliament in using those words. It is an inescapable fact that, despite all the care taken in passing legislation, </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman'">some statutory provisions when applied to the circumstances under consideration in any specific case are found to be ambiguous</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">. One of the reasons for such ambiguity is that the </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman'">members of the legislature in enacting the statutory provision may have been told what result those words are intended to achieve</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">. Faced with a given set of words which are capable of conveying that meaning </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman'">it is not surprising if the words are accepted as having that meaning. Parliament never intends to enact an ambiguity. Contrast with that the position of the courts. The courts are faced simply with a set of words which are in fact capable of bearing two meanings</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">. The courts are ignorant of the underlying Parliamentary purpose. </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Unless something in "other parts of the legislation discloses such purpose, the courts are forced to adopt one of the two possible meanings using highly technical rules of construction</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">. </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman'">In many, I suspect most, cases references to Parliamentary materials will not throw any light on the matter. But in a few cases it may emerge that the very question was considered by Parliament in passing the legislation. Why in such a case should the courts blind themselves to a clear indication of what Parliament intended in using those words? The court cannot attach a meaning to words which they cannot bear, but if the words are capable of bearing more than one meaning why should not Parliament's true intention be enforced rather than thwarted?”</span></p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ms Brown’s submission was that nowhere does Lord Browne-Wilkinson “explain that ambiguous means capable of bearing more than one meaning”. I have difficulty with that proposition.  However, as I ultimately understood her submission, it was to the effect that if (without reference to the relevant Parliamentary statement sought to be adduced into evidence) relevant words used in a statute are words that the court considers to be capable of having more than one meaning (she would say “plausible meaning”) then the words will be “ambiguous” for the purposes of the rule in <span style="font-style:italic">Pepper v Hart.</span>  In this case, she says, the relevant words are not ambiguous.  If I am correct in my understanding then I do not consider Ms Brown’s submission to be contentious. </p>

The deal between the Government and the pension saver is that that favourable tax treatment is conditional on using most of the savings built up in that way to generate retirement income, and not for other purposes. As part of the reform of tax rules for pensions, we intend to set the minimum age at which tax-privileged pensions can be drawn at 55 from 2010. That minimum benefit age will apply to all pensions that qualify for tax relief. Moving the minimum benefit age to 55 is not designed to prevent people from stopping work when they are younger than 55, if they can afford to do so using resources other than pensions, but they will not be able to use pensions built up with tax relief until the age of 55.</span></p>

People with such rights may well have planned for their future on that basis, or even taken redundancy from their employer in the expectation that their occupational pension would become payable before they reached the age of 55. Because of that, provisions in the schedule protect the rights of employees in occupational pension schemes to retire before 55, provided certain conditions are met: first, that the right was in place before 10 December 2003 and, secondly, that the right is an absolute right and not subject to any conditions such as the consent of the employer.</span></p>

Finally, the provisions of rule B1 of Schedule 2 FPOS, did not fall within the description given by the Explanatory Notes or Ms Kelly MP as to the matters excluded from “actual or prospective rights”.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">First of all, it seems to me that Ms Brown is wrong to say that the meaning of the relevant constituent elements of the entitlement condition can be determined simply by looking at a dictionary of the English language.  I will come onto the meaning of “actual” separately but, leaving that aside, the “likelihood” of something happening, for the prospective test, is an uncertain test. One of the dictionary examples is a “prospective mother” but one can see that in some contexts that might be limited to a pregnant female whereas in others it might extend to a female who is hoping and planning to become pregnant.  Clearly as at 2006 a firefighter who was, say 38 years old, might be said have a prospective right to a pension at some age, even that were contingent on the firefighter achieving the relevant pensionable age under the relevant scheme.  Further, as well as what might be said to be naturally occurring contingencies, that right might be conditional on the firefighter not then taking up certain sorts of employment. Such a condition would be within the firefighters’ control.  However, the more the contingencies depend not on actions of the firefighter or the occurrence of natural events, the more questionable it becomes as to whether the right is a “prospective” right.  Further, if the test is “likelihood” does the answer depend on the factual position in relation to the individual concerned?  If they are diagnosed with a condition in 2006 that at the time is likely to lead to death shortly and is incurable, but the firefighter in fact survives, would he not have had a prospective right as at 2006 on the basis that as regards him it was then very unlikely that he would survive to pension age?</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Further, it is clear that in other areas of the law, “prospective” may be contrasted with “contingent” (see e.g. debts under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/45" uk:canonical="1986 c. 45" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Insolvency Act 1986</ref> and <span style="font-style:italic">Stonegate Securities Ltd v Gregory </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1980] 1 Ch 576" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1980">[1980] 1 Ch 576</ref> at 579E-F).</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In short, it seems to me that the meaning of “actual or prospective right to benefits” is not one that can be answered solely by looking at a dictionary definition.  In any event, as I go on to consider, the Explanatory Notes can, in my judgment, be relied upon to identify that there is indeed an ambiguity in the terms in question.   I do not consider that the words are not capable of bearing the meaning that the Explanatory Notes give, that is one which excludes a right which is contingent on some third-party consent.  </p>

However, that is to ignore the point that the courts have said that Explanatory Notes or background information may in fact identify an ambiguity in the language.  Even if I am incorrect that the language is ambiguous, then the Explanatory Notes in this case fulfil exactly that function.  I also reject Ms Brown’s submission that Explanatory Notes should not be taken into account, alternatively given no weight, on the basis that they are “technical, difficult to find and difficult to understand” and are not therefore “readily available”.  Indeed, I also note that, as Mr Oakes pointed out, the Explanatory Notes were themselves expressly considered by Parliament at various stages of the passage of the Bill (although not the provisions I am dealing with).  </p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I accept Mr Oakes’ submissions to the effect that an “actual right” to a benefit in this context is to be equated with the concept of unconditional “entitlement to payment” rather than having any element of prospectivity about it.  This is supported, by example, by the Explanatory Notes to what was clause 205 of the Finance Bill 2004 and which is now section 216 of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2004/12" uk:canonical="2004 c. 12" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">FA 2004</ref>.  Section 216 identifies benefit crystallisation events and the amount crystallised in the context of the lifetime allowance charge.  It draws a distinction between persons becoming entitled to certain benefits (eg a pension or an annuity) and the individual reaching a certain age when “prospectively entitled” to various benefits.

Inevitably a relevant ministerial statement will express the intention of the Minister (or the Government) as to what words in a Bill are to mean if enacted but if that intention is expressly set out to Parliament and Parliament accepts the relevant wording then the intention of the Minister/Government is adopted by and becomes the intention of Parliament.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ms Brown also submitted that the statement of Ruth Kelly MP was unclear and contradictory because it cuts across her (Ms Kelly’s) earlier statement that it would be unfair to introduce a change which cuts across people’s rights to take a pension at an earlier age. I disagree with both propositions. In my judgment the statement is clear.  Further it does not contradict her earlier statement, rather it explains what amount to rights that cannot be cut across and other “rights” which can be. </p>

However, a condition that requires consent or permission of a third party before there is any right to a pension will be a contingency that will result in there not being a “prospective right to a benefit” within the meaning of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2004/12" uk:canonical="2004 c. 12" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">FA 2004</ref>, schedule 36 paragraph 22.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As I have said, I do not consider that there is anything in the point that the Explanatory Notes give an example of a third party consent (a trustee) and not that of an employer.

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ms Brown’s submission is that, even if necessary consent of a third party to the grant of a pension right is outside the protection of the transitional provisions, because it does not meet the meaning of an “actual or prospective” right to a benefit, the requirement of permission within rule B1 of FPSO does not fall foul of this principle.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">First,  she submits that “permission” is different to “consent” and that in this case “permission” does not operate as a “consent”. She also submits that rule B1 does not have words such as “subject to trustee consent”.  I do not accept these submissions. Whether called “permission” or “consent”, in effect the Claimant has to take the further step of agreeing that a retirement notice can be given if the right to an early pension is to be activated.  Mr Howell did not as at April 2006 have a right to an early pension dependent only upon his own actions or the happening of natural contingencies (such as attaining the relevant age). He was then dependent on receiving permission (or consent) of the Claimant in the future.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Secondly, she submits that the Claimant, whether as manager of the scheme (or, she would say, trustee) or as employer would not in practice be able to refuse permission, the only right to refuse permission being confined to matters of “timing and form”.  As regards inability to refuse consent she submitted that the employer could not realistically refuse permission to give notice of retirement because the contract of service would not be enforceable because specific performance would not be granted (citing cases such as <span style="font-style:italic">Lumley v Wagner</span> (1843-60) ALL ER Rep 368; <span style="font-style:italic">C H Giles &amp; Co.

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As regards the latter point this seems to me to confuse ability to refuse consent to retirement and ability to refuse consent (or permission) to give notice of early retirement which triggers the right to an early pension. I was unclear on what basis Ms Brown said that the right to refuse permission was confined to timing or form and indeed what that meant.  She suggested that a notice might be refused where the services of the chief fire officer were required to enable time to arrange a successor but accepted that if refused that could prevent any right to an early pension.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ms Brown also suggested that there was no ability to refuse permission under rule B1 FPSO because this would amount to a refusal to allow an early pension and amount to constructive dismissal.    I accept Mr Oakes’ submission that this submission was not made out on the facts.</p>

<content>
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Accordingly, I consider that as at 5 April 2006, Mr Howell did not have an actual or prospective right to benefits under the Scheme, in terms of a right to an early pension, within the meaning of the entitlement condition set out in paragraph 22 of schedule 36 <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2004/12" uk:canonical="2004 c. 12" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">FA 2004</ref>.  This is because although he was within the Scheme, any right he had was contingent upon and did not arise unless and until the Claimant gave its permission for him to serve a relevant (early) notice of retirement for the purposes of the Scheme. The need for such third party consent means that he did not satisfy the entitlement condition as properly construed.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my judgment, such contingent right as Mr Howell had, as at 5 April 2006, under rule B1 of the FPSO to an early pension, that is one to be received under the age of 55, was not an “actual” or “prospective” right to benefits under paragraph 22 of Schedule 36 <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2004/12" uk:canonical="2004 c. 12" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">FA 2004</ref>.  Accordingly, the entitlement condition laid out in that paragraph was not met. It follows that any payment to him of a pension under the Scheme under FPSO prior to him reaching the age of 55 will amount to an unauthorised payment under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2004/12" uk:canonical="2004 c. 12" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">FA 2004</ref>.</p>
