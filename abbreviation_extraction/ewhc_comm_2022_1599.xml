However, the judge overwhelmingly used the language of the criminal standard (of being sure, or of rejecting the possibility that something may be as suggested), and he uniformly did so when reaching his conclusions on any essential plank of the bank’s case.

For reasons discussed below, in my view the assets of the Trust and Beatrice are significant and cannot be said to be "<span style="font-style:italic">peripheral or minor</span>" in the context of Mr Vik's life and business. The significance of the alleged contempts to the identification of the destination/ location of the assets of SHI in my view provides an answer to the rhetorical question posed by counsel for Mr Vik as to why there would have been deliberate non-compliance set against the "<span style="font-style:italic">extensive compliance</span>".</p>

He is, as referred to above, a highly educated man with a long and successful background in finance. Although counsel for Mr Vik repeatedly stressed that Mr Vik was not a lawyer and should not be assumed to have acted as a lawyer would have done, it is inconceivable in my view given the financial significance of this transaction both to him and his family, that he was unaware of the terms on which the trust assets had been placed in the Trust and the rights which he had retained over those assets. Further the allegations against him relating to Beatrice and assets transferred to the Trust are and have been central features to this litigation and are a major plank of the committal application which Mr Vik now faces. Accordingly, it is inconceivable in my view that he would have now forgotten the major features of the basis on which the assets were placed<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>in the Trust.

I am sure that this was a deliberate attempt by Mr Vik to mislead by his disclosure and his evidence to this Court that he did not know anything about the different versions and merely disclosed what he was given by Mr Johansson is a deliberate lie. Whilst this allegation is not before the Court on this Application, it is highly relevant to the credibility of Mr Vik generally and to the plausibility of arguments put forward concerning Mr Vik's actions.</p>

I do not consider that the subsequent reference in [53] to “legitimate motive” is a reference to subjective motive but rather a reference to legitimate purpose in the sense identified in [47], where Briggs J had identified the two “legitimate ends” of committal proceedings, namely enforcement or bringing to the court’s attention serious rather than technical breaches. The words “ends” and “motives” were being used interchangeably, but <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">the clear thrust of [47] is that proceedings which are hopeless or relate to purely technical contempts are the signs to look for when searching for abuse, not questions of subjective motive.</span>” [emphasis added]</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my view Mr Matthews sought to put a gloss on the answers of Mr Vik and to draw a distinction between knowledge of the class of assets and the precise assets which is not warranted. In support of this conclusion, it is important to read the transcript of the XX Hearing and to see the development of the points which were put to Mr Vik concerning Beatrice and the Trust. The answers given by Mr Vik which are alleged to be false must be interpreted in context. Once the questions are read in context it is apparent that the answers which are alleged to be false were in response to questions which were of a general nature concerning Mr Vik's knowledge of the assets in Beatrice and the Trust and it is wholly implausible that the distinction now being advanced for Mr Vik that the substance of his answers was that he had given answers about the asset class but could not provide the detail was how Mr Vik could reasonably have understood the questions or did understand the questions. </p>

It is apparent from the transcript that the questions which were put at this stage of the XX Hearing were directed at the assets in Beatrice and the Trust and were put as a logical progression from the initial transfer of assets to Beatrice and of Beatrice to the Trust in October 2008 through what had happened thereafter. This elicited Mr Vik's evidence that he had resigned as Protector in 2015 and then questions were put about what Mr Vik knew at that point and thereafter in particular what Mr Vik knew from Mr Broquen who was then trustee.</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>I infer from the history of the proceedings that Mr Vik understood only too well why the Bank was asking questions about the assets in Beatrice and the Trust. In this context the issue is not whether the findings of Cooke J are binding on this court as amounting to a form of issue estoppel or whether the Connecticut court was right when it found that Mr Vik did not transfer the assets out of SHI to Beatrice in order to prevent the Bank from getting those assets. The significance lies in that Mr Vik knows that the Bank's case is that the relevant assets were transferred out of SHI to Beatrice "<span style="font-style:italic">with a view to depleting SHI's assets</span>" and to make it more difficult for the Bank to seek recovery. The Bank has therefore been keen to establish what assets were and are in Beatrice and the Trust in order to assist it in enforce the outstanding Judgment Debt. I am satisfied that this provides a clear motive which explains why Mr Vik would (and did) lie to the Court at the XX Hearing about the assets of Beatrice and the Trust. </p>

          <content>
            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I note in support of that conclusion the evidence from the XX Hearing that Mr Vik had not mentioned in his earlier witness statements any funds transferred from Beatrice to pay litigation costs. Mr Vik's explanation at the XX Hearing [p55-58] was that this was the fault of his lawyers in drafting the witness statements and/or Mr Johansson was responsible for managing this. Whilst Mr Vik did say at the XX Hearing that Mr Johansson, was in charge of the "<span style="font-style:italic">day-to-day operation, the day-to-day litigation and operations of the company from 2008 on</span>", this was challenged by the Bank at the XX Hearing by reference to his own solicitors’ evidence. Further and in any event it does not address the issue of knowledge and overall supervision by Mr Vik. Given the significant sums involved, and the significance of the issue to the proceedings (such that Mr Vik would, as referred to above, have had a motive for wishing to conceal the true position), this explanation for the failure to mention previously the transfers from Beatrice was not credible. </p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my view the significance of Mr Vik acting as Protector lies not in his legal powers under the Trust Deed (as to which the Court has no evidence other than the Trust Deed itself) but in asking who in reality was looking after the interests of the Trust and whether Mr Vik's evidence that he distanced himself from the Trust is credible. Whatever the legal position, the evidence of Mr Vik when asked who was looking after the interests of the Trust, was that he was relying on Ms Esparrago as Protector and I infer that Mr Vik regarded himself as carrying out that function (at least) until 2015 whilst he held the role of Protector. </p>

It was submitted for Mr Vik (paragraph 48 of his Closing Submissions) that it is "<span style="font-style:italic">perfectly normal for fund managers having a discretionary mandate to manage much more complex investments [than those of Beatrice] without the need to consult the legal or beneficial owner of the funds"</span>. However, there is no evidence to suggest that there were fund managers appointed to manage the assets of Beatrice. Insofar as this is intended to be a reference to Zimmerman &amp; Gauch, the evidence of Mr Vik (as discussed below) is that they were appointed to manage drawdowns under the credit line and there is no evidence that they were appointed to discharge any wider discretionary management role.</p>

It seems to me self-evident that US$700m of assets even in the form of cash and "cash equivalents" could not be left without any management or supervision over a period of years by someone who had, at least some, investment experience and when one considers the considerable financial experience of Mr Vik and contrasts this with the lack of experience of the various trustees, the inference is clear that Mr Vik would be the person with knowledge and control of the assets. </p>

Her evidence as referred to above, was of someone who lacked any real knowledge of firstly, the assets for which she was responsible as trustee and secondly, of who became trustee upon her retirement in her stead (and on Mr Vik's case would thus be responsible for managing the family trust and protecting the family's interests).

It is not therefore necessary for me to consider whether the findings of Cooke J give rise to an issue estoppel (paragraph 42-45 of Mr Vik's Closing Submissions) or to consider the findings of the Connecticut Judgment as to Mr Vik's intent when he made the transfers form SHI to Beatrice in October 2008 (paragraph 43 of Mr Vik’s Closing Submissions).</p>

No documentation has been disclosed in support of any such arrangement described by Mr Vik and in my view it is wholly incredible even with a pre-existing credit line that US$80m would be transferred between SHI and Beatrice without any oversight by Beatrice or any request from SHI. </p>

I am strengthened in my conclusion by the evidence before Cooke J who stated at [661] that Mr Vik had “a <span style="font-style:italic">keen eye for the numbers</span>” and noted that one of Deutsche Bank Suisse employees (Mr Brügelmann who was Mr Vik’s point of contact for trades) “<span style="font-style:italic">held Mr Vik in awe because of his extraordinary faculty for retaining details of his trading positions in his head and his ability to conduct his business on a blackberry, without detailed records in front of him.</span>”</p>

However, if you start from the wholly different premise, which is that this was an agreement between father and son, by which the father wished to advance cash to SHI to assist his son in exchange for the release of essentially illiquid assets, these are things that are entirely to be expected.

In this regard the absence of any documentation to support the existence of a sale (other than the Sale Agreement itself), the belated disclosure of the Sale Agreement at a time when it was used to support SHI’s position in the litigation and the even later disclosure of a detailed schedule all support an inference that the Sale Agreement was not a bona fide agreement.</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Matthews for Mr Vik objected in oral closings (transcript day 10, p63) to the submission in the Bank's written closings (paragraph 12(c)) that Mr Vik "<span style="font-style:italic">received distribution notices from Devon Park (which he suppressed) long after the supposed transfer to Universal</span>" on the basis that receipt of the distribution notices was not part of the allegations of contempt. In my view the significance of the contemporaneous evidence now before this Court concerning the distribution notices does not found an additional allegation but is evidence which the Court can take into account in drawing inferences as to whether Mr Vik had a connection to Universal and whether Mr Vik had "<span style="font-style:italic">nothing to do with SHI</span>" in 2015.  </p>

There is however no correspondence in response to that letter which supports the submission that it was an error on the part of Devon Park. Mr Vik was unable in my view to provide a satisfactory explanation to this Court as to why he/SHI was apparently going to receive a distribution of US$2.5m in May 2015 to which he was not entitled and why none of Mr Vik, Mr Johansson or Ms Féliz (who was according to Mr Vik the contact for Universal) apparently raised any objection even though in other correspondence Mr Johansson chased for payment of distributions to Universal.</p>

It seems to me likely that a man of 87 who (according to Mr Vik's evidence) did not involve himself in detail would at the very least have given this information to his son and Mr Vik would have sought this information.</p>

Although Mr Vik disputed whether it occurred in 2008 or 2009 and Mr Vik also disputed that the assets were transferred for “<span style="font-style:italic">no consideration</span>” (on the basis that there was an ongoing liability transferred), it is an example of assets being transferred by SHI to a company owned by Mr Vik's father when it suited Mr Vik:</p>

Counsel for the Bank identified that there were individuals named as being entitled to exercise the voting rights and the clear thrust of the questions was whether Mr Vik was connected to these individuals: he was asked whether he had a relationship with the individual and then when he denied knowing him and denied that any of his companies engaged him was asked the follow up question of whether he had any connection with either New Invest or Universal. Read in context it was clearly intended to be a broad question which was not limited to whether he was a director of Universal or whether he was the owner of Universal. In my view the limited interpretation for which Mr Vik contends is not credible when the question is read in context and I do not accept that Mr Vik's evidence of his understanding is credible in this regard. </p>

Accordingly, the crux of the additional evidence in relation to the Sale Agreement and whether the IFA Shares were transferred to Universal on the instruction of VBI lie in the need to reconcile Mr Vik's evidence that he held the IFA Shares personally and not for SHI with the purported position under the Sale Agreement that the assets were held by SHI on trust for VBI and this evidence stands independently of the regulatory notifications. </p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Whilst it is possible to mount a plausible argument as to why certain emails may not have been regarded as necessary to preserve, the Court has to consider the allegation of the failure to disclose electronic documents in the round and not merely by reference to the particular Devon Park emails which the Bank has managed to obtain from Mr Johansson. In this regard it is significant that the Part 71 Order required disclosure of, amongst other documents, documents for the period from January 2008 to 2015 in the following categories:</p>

          <content>
            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Thus, the order covered both the period when Mr Vik said he had in effect suspended his deletion policy and the period when he said he had resumed deleting emails.</p>

          <content>
            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Further as referred to above, the deletion policy was not in respect of all emails: Mr Vik appears to have accepted that he did retain some emails. This seems to be consistent with his evidence to the Court that when carrying out the exercise to respond to the Part 71 Order he searched his emails; self-evidently there would have been no need for him to have conducted such a search if all emails were deleted and none had been preserved.</p>

          <content>
            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Given that on Mr Vik’s evidence some emails were preserved, the stark overriding point is that there were no emails disclosed which were responsive to the Part 71 Order. </p>

          <content>
            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Whilst it can be argued that the failure to disclose older emails can be explained by the disposal of the old computers/laptops this is difficult to reconcile with the evidence that documents relevant to the litigation (at least until July 2012) were preserved. Mr Vik had lawyers advising him throughout and I infer that continuing steps would accordingly have been taken to preserve documents which had been identified as to be preserved given that thereafter an appeal was lodged in the UK proceedings and US proceedings were ongoing.</p>

I note that the documents which were subsequently disclosed include communications in 2013 concerning the arrangement for Mr Vik to hold the voting rights personally so were only 2 years before the Part 71 Order. Further as referred to above, a number of events happened in 2013 according to Mr Vik's evidence in his Affidavit:</p>

However, at around that time, SHI and Vik Beteiligung had settled litigation against IFA, a condition of which was my appointment to the board of IFA. In order to hold that position, I was required to be a shareholder of IFA, and so it was decided that I should be designated to hold the IFA Shares personally - albeit on trust for VBI - and VBI did not object to that arrangement."</p>

I infer that the subject matter of the emails would have been of interest to Mr Vik since they related (at least in part) to the transfer to Universal and the distributions.
