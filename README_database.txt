I have a local postgres database "tna":
  with table "manifest"
    with a "pattern" column of type character varting (varchar?),
  and a table "ukpga_lookup"
    with "candidate_titles" and "ref" columns of type character varying (varchar?),
    a "year" column of type bigint,
    and a "for_fuzzy" column of type boolean.
