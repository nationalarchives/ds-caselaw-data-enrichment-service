	    <p style="margin-left:0.87in;margin-right:0.01in">Heathrow is a major international airport – the busiest in Europe, and the busiest in the world with two runways. Each year it handles about 70% of the United Kingdom’s scheduled long-haul flights, 80 million passengers, and up to 480,000 air traffic movements. Gatwick is the busiest single runway airport in the world and each year handles about 11% of the United Kingdom’s scheduled long-haul traffic. If the United Kingdom is to maintain its status as a leading aviation “hub”, it is argued that its aviation capacity must increase. Whether this increase in capacity should be supported in national policy, and in particular whether it should involve the construction of a third runway at Heathrow, has long been a matter of political debate and controversy, intensified by concerns over the environmental cost of achieving it, and more recently by the concerted global effort to combat climate change by reducing carbon emissions. These judicial review proceedings, which have reached us in the form of an appeal from the Divisional Court (Hickinbottom L.J. and Holgate J.) and two applications for permission to appeal, do not draw us into that political debate. They do not face us with the task of deciding whether and how Heathrow should be expanded. That is not the kind of decision that courts can make, and is ultimately a political question for the Government of the day. Rather, we are required to consider whether the Divisional Court was wrong to conclude that the Government’s policy in favour of the development of a third runway at Heathrow was produced lawfully. That is the question here. It is an entirely legal question. </p>

Four of them came before the Divisional Court in March 2019 at a “rolled-up” hearing over seven days – as applications for permission to apply for judicial review, together with the claim itself if permission were granted. The fifth (Claim No. CO/3071/2018), brought by Heathrow Hub Ltd. and Runway Innovations Ltd., which raises issues of a different kind from the other four, is also the subject of an appeal before us. That appeal is dealt with in a separate judgment, also handed down today. One of the other four claims (Claim No. CO/2760/2018), brought by Mr Neil Spurrier, is no longer pursued. The three claims we are dealing with here are these: Claim No. CO/3089/2018 brought by seven claimants, five of them local authorities – the London Borough of Hillingdon Council and the councils of four adjacent London boroughs – Greenpeace Ltd.

Three options were selected for further consideration: first, the Heathrow north-west runway scheme proposed by HAL – a new runway, 3,500 metres in length, constructed to “the north-west of the airport” (paragraph 6.67 of the Airports Commission’s Interim Report); second, the Heathrow extended northern runway scheme proposed by Heathrow Hub – extending the existing northern runway to at least 6,000 metres to allow it to operate as two separate runways (ibid.); and third, the Gatwick second runway scheme – a new runway over 3,000 metres in length, south of the existing runway (ibid.).  </p>

It concluded that the Heathrow north-west runway scheme was the most appropriate way to meet the need, if combined with measures to address environmental and community impacts, including “[incentivisation] of a major shift in mode share for those working at and arriving at the airport”; a requirement that additional operations at an expanded Heathrow “must be contingent on acceptable performance on air quality”; a ban on all scheduled night flights in the period between 11.30 p.m. and 6 a.m.; and the ruling out of a fourth runway at Heathrow (paragraph 13.3). It also concluded that the Heathrow north-west runway scheme performed “most strongly” in the “Strategic Fit appraisal module” because “[it] would deliver the greatest increase in connectivity, particularly with regard to strategically important long-haul connections, [and] would provide a world-class passenger experience and support growth in airfreight more effectively than expansion at Gatwick” (paragraph 6.91). Conversely, it concluded that the Gatwick second runway scheme was directed more towards “short-haul European travel, with significant changes in industry structure needed to see a substantial increase in longhaul connectivity” (paragraph 6.92).

If it is properly assessed as not qualifying as an “alternative solution” before an HRA has been conducted, it is not necessary for Habitats Directive purposes to consider that plan or scheme in any later HRA or otherwise at all. It was also common ground that articles 6(3) and (4) involve an iterative process, certainly for policy-making as a plan proceeds from an initial draft through consultation to its finally adopted form; and, in that iterative process, something which is considered by the competent authority to be an “alternative solution” at one stage may, in the light of further information and/or assessment, properly cease to be so regarded subsequently.” </p>

Heathrow Airport is one of the world’s major hub airports, serving around 180 destinations worldwide with at least a weekly service, including a diverse network of onward flights across the UK and Europe. Building on this base, expansion at Heathrow Airport will mean it will continue to attract a growing number of transfer passengers, providing the added demand to make more routes viable. In particular, this is expected to lead to more long haul flights and connections to fast-growing economies, helping to secure the UK’s status as a global aviation hub, and enabling it to play a crucial role in the global economy. </p>

At the UK level, there would be significantly fewer long haul flights in comparison to the preferred scheme, with long haul destinations served less frequently. Expansion at Heathrow Airport is the better option to ensure the number of services on existing routes increases and allows airlines to offer more frequent new routes to vital emerging markets.” (our emphasis). </p>

It saw no “arguable justification for a different standard of review to be adopted” when the court is assessing whether a project or plan meets core policy objectives under article 6(4) as opposed to article 6(3). Indeed, it went on to say that, “if anything, the assessment of whether a policy meets the core objectives of a policy-maker, assigned by Parliament with the task, is … even more essentially a matter for that policy-maker, and not the court which is peculiarly ill-equipped to make such assessments” (paragraph 351).   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.89in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.5in">We accept those submissions of Mr Maurici and Mr Banner, for two reasons. First, although the Advocate General in <span style="font-style:italic">Craeynest </span>indicated that in some cases a more intensive standard of review will apply, this was especially – as she put it (in paragraph 43 of her opinion) – “where they are particularly serious interferences with fundamental rights”. The Hillingdon claimants have not shown how any fundamental EU rights have been interfered with in this case, let alone seriously interfered with or made “impossible in practice” to exercise. Secondly, as the court said in <span style="font-style:italic">Craeynest</span>, there is a clear strand of EU case law that respects the discretion of Member States to lay down procedural rules for the protection of EU law rights. “Wednesbury” irrationality is the normal standard of review applicable in judicial review proceedings in this jurisdiction where interferences are alleged with rights of various kinds, including rights arising in domestic environmental law. And it seems to us appropriate in principle, and not less favourable, to apply the same standard to rights under EU law. Nor does it render the exercise of EU rights virtually impossible or excessively difficult in practice. In our view, therefore, there is no justification for applying a more intense standard of review than “Wednesbury” to the operation of the provisions of article 6(4) of the Habitats Directive. Neither the court’s decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Craeynest</span> nor the Advocate General’s opinion supports a different conclusion. </p>

The Gatwick 2R Scheme was not ruled out as an alternative at the beginning of the SEA process. An opportunity was given for the case for it to be advanced.

But these documents are not to be construed as if they were legal instruments. Moreover, they plainly state that they are to be read together with the ANPS, and so the passages relied upon should be read compatibly with the policy statement unless that is made impossible by the language used. That is not the case here. The documents referred to by Mr Jaffey state that, even with a second runway, Gatwick would largely remain a point-topoint airport. In other words, as paragraph 3.10 of the ANPS states, Gatwick would attract “very few transfer passengers”. That is an assessment by the Secretary of State that is justified on the evidence.

Mr Jaffey’s main submission on this issue is that the “hub argument” was adopted by the Secretary of State at a late stage in the evolution of the ANPS, with the aim – or at least with the effect – of avoiding the need to consider expansion at Gatwick as an alternative and then potentially having to select that option.

It cannot be said that this objective was constructed with “deliberate” and unlawful “narrowness” to exclude other options. Given that a central purpose of the ANPS was to promote the United Kingdom’s status as an “aviation hub”, we see no room for a submission that the Secretary of State acted unlawfully in rejecting the Gatwick second runway scheme on the evidence that it could not fulfil that objective. On the contrary, as we have said, since there was a clear and unassailable finding that expansion at Gatwick “would not enhance, and would consequently threaten, the UK’s global aviation hub status” (paragraph 3.19 of the ANPS), a scheme for the development of a second runway at that airport could not realistically qualify as an “alternative solution” under article 6(4).

It was inevitable that less information would be available at the plan stage. In the case of the ANPS, on the information available at the plan stage the Secretary of State, in agreement with Natural England, decided that the harmful effects of a second runway at Gatwick could not be ruled out, and Natural England had advised that more detailed work should be done at the project stage. But the Gatwick second runway scheme was conclusively ruled out as an alternative at that stage because it did not meet – and indeed was seen to threaten – the United Kingdom’s “hub status”. It follows, Mr Maurici submitted, that only if the Secretary of State was demonstrably wrong on the “hub objective” issue could the Gatwick second runway scheme be regarded as an alternative to the third runaway at Heathrow, at either stage.

This is not in dispute. If the Gatwick second runway scheme had not fallen decisively outside the range of “alternative solutions” to the expansion of Heathrow by the addition of a third runway because such development was incompatible with – and hostile to – the “hub objective”, it might well have been necessary to retain it as an alternative. If, in the course of the process leading to the designation of the ANPS, the Secretary of State had finally excluded the Gatwick second runway scheme as an alternative solely or principally on the ground of possible harm to the SAC, or to the priority species within it, his decision to do so might have been vulnerable to the criticism that it was premature and inappropriate.  </p>

As the Divisional Court rightly concluded (in paragraph 371 of its judgment), it was, in the circumstances, reasonable and lawful for the Secretary of State to exclude the Gatwick second runway scheme as an “alternative solution” because in his view the evidence before him clearly indicated that it did not comply with the qualifying conditions for an “alternative solution” under the Habitats Directive. So the requirements of article 6(4) effectively ceased to apply to that scheme. It had been validly excluded as an alternative for the project stage for reasons unrelated to, and unaffected by, any possible conclusions relating to harmful effects, or the absence of them, on the Mole Gap and Reigate Escarpment SAC. It follows that if the Secretary of State was in error in relying on such conclusions as an additional and separate consideration, this ultimately had no effect on his performance of the duties imposed on him by the Habitats Directive and the Habitats Regulations, or on the outcome of the designation process. The decisive reason for the exclusion of the Gatwick second runway scheme as an alternative was its failure to satisfy the central objective of maintaining the United Kingdom’s “hub status”.

It emphasized the “substantive” nature of the obligation in article 6(4) of the Habitats Directive, whose operation bears on the outcome of the process, in contradistinction to the requirement in article 5 of the SEA Directive, which is not “substantive” but “procedural”. This essential difference between the provisions for the consideration of alternatives in the two Directives enabled it to conclude (in paragraph 323) that it was lawful for the Secretary of State to rule out the Gatwick second runway scheme as an “alternative solution” under article 6 of the Habitats Directive while also treating it as a “reasonable alternative” under article 5 of the SEA Directive.

The result of this, they say, was that, before designating the ANPS, the Secretary of State did not fully and properly consider the comparative effects of the north-west runway at Heathrow against the second runway at Gatwick on European protected sites. Secondly, they contend that the Divisional Court was wrong to hold that the corresponding provisions on alternatives in the SEA Directive and the Habitats Directive can be distinguished on the basis that the provisions of the SEA Directive are “procedural” in nature and those of the Habitats Directive “substantive”. Mr Jaffey submitted that this false distinction led the Divisional Court to adopt an incorrect approach to the interpretation of the EU law concept of an “alternative”. He argued that the test for ruling out alternatives under the Habitats Directive is no less stringent than under the SEA Directive, because an “alternative solution” is necessarily a broader concept than a “reasonable alternative”.  </p>

In this case, that requirement made it necessary that consultees, including Gatwick Airport Ltd., were given the opportunity to submit to the Secretary of State their representations in favour of particular alternatives, including the Gatwick second runway scheme, and to explain how such alternatives would meet the essential objectives of government policy, of which the “hub objective” was one. </p>

The criticism levelled at the Secretary of State for adopting an inconsistent approach would amount only to a complaint that he undertook a broader and more burdensome assessment than the SEA Directive required. The Gatwick second runway scheme would have been included unnecessarily, and unjustifiably, as an alternative in the strategic environmental assessment for the ANPS. So as Mr Maurici and Mr Humphries submitted, under section 31(2A) of the Senior Courts Act 1981 (“the Senior Courts Act”) (see paragraphs 269 to 280 below), the court would have been right to withhold a remedy for an error of no real consequence in the ANPS process.  </p>

At the time of the hearing before us, “exit day” was to be 31 October 2019, but it was subsequently postponed to 31 January 2020. Mr Jaffey provided us with an outline of the likely effect of each of three scenarios for the United Kingdom’s departure from the EU on references under article 267. Subsequently, Parliament has enacted the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020, which, among other things, amends the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018. There is now to be an “implementation period” after exit day, until 31 December 2020.<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>Given the view to which we have come on the merits of the application for a reference, it is not necessary to discuss those scenarios here.  </p>

The Regulations are not based upon such an unrealistic expectation. They recognise that an environmental statement may well be deficient, and make provision through the publicity and consultation processes for any deficiencies to be identified so that the resulting “environmental information” provides the local planning authority with as full a picture as possible.

Whether this requirement has been met is a matter for the court. The effect of the Divisional Court’s approach, said Mr Pleming, is that if the authority responsible for the preparation of the plan or programme is able to point to some information that can be said to address the requirements of the SEA Directive, the court will not examine the adequacy or quality of that information. Mr Pleming submitted that the appropriate intensity of review for testing compliance with the SEA Directive should match the requirements it contains and the court’s obligation to give effect to the “precautionary principle”.

As he recognized in the same paragraph of his judgment, deficiencies in the environmental statement could, in principle, be overcome in the course of the process, so that, in the end, the “environmental information” in its totality – not merely the environmental statement itself – composed “as full a picture as possible”. </p>

It held that the absence of a reference to “cumulative effects” in paragraph (a) of Annex I to the SEA Directive “does not mean that an environmental report cannot deal with the relationship with a group of other plans in terms of “cumulative effects” rather than as impacts on individual plans” (paragraph 454). It saw no reason to reject the evidence given on behalf of the Secretary of State that “it would not have been appropriate in the SEA to analyse the effects of the draft ANPS on the policies of individual local plans and that even if that approach had been followed, the Appraisal Framework would not have changed (Stevenson 1, paragraphs 3.44-3.53)” (paragraph 455).  </p>

For example, the AoS states that the NWR Scheme is likely to generate a demand for 300 to 500 additional homes per local authority per year as well as support from additional schools, two additional health centres and two primary care centres per local authority to 2030. The AoS makes the judgment that overall impacts on housing demand will affect local authorities across London and the South East and that the demand will spread and be low in comparison to existing planned housing. Those effects were assessed as being negative in relation to the NWR Scheme (see paragraph 1.12.2 of Appendix A to the AoS).  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.87in;margin-right:0.01in">It is common ground that development provided for in local plans was taken into account in the Appraisal of Sustainability, but that this was done cumulatively – not individually, plan by plan. The issue therefore, as it was before the Divisional Court, is whether cumulative consideration of local plan policies and allocations was sufficient to satisfy the requirement under paragraph (a) of Annex I to the SEA Directive to provide “an outline of the contents, main objectives of the plan or programme and relationship with other relevant plans and programmes”. The Hillingdon claimants say the obligation to provide an outline of the “relationship” of the plan or programme “with other relevant plans” can only be satisfied if an outline of its relationship with each relevant plan is provided individually; it is not enough to provide a description of its relationship with all the relevant plans and an assessment of its cumulative effects in combination with them, taken as a whole. For example, the local plan for the London Borough of Hillingdon – “A vision for 2026, Local Plan: Part 1, Strategic Policies” adopted in November 2012 – provides for the development of new housing in the borough in the course of the plan period. But the expansion of Heathrow, if it proceeds, will itself generate pressure for additional housing, not planned in the local plan. The nature of the “relationship” between the local plan and the ANPS, therefore, is that the amount of development in the local area is likely to be more than has been identified and assessed in the SEA process. This should have been done, in accordance with paragraph (a) of Annex I, but it was not.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.87in;margin-right:0.01in">The simple answer to this argument, as Mr Maurici submitted, is that the total amount of development likely to come forward through local plans, including the Hillingdon Local Plan Part 1, together with the expansion of Heathrow by the development of a third runway, was sufficiently embraced in the scoping report and sufficiently assessed in the Appraisal of Sustainability to satisfy the requirements of the SEA Directive and the SEA Regulations. We share the conclusions of the Divisional Court (in paragraphs 457, 458 and 460 of its judgment). It is, we think, unrealistic to suggest that the assessment was invalidated by taking the effects of development in several local plans together, rather than separately. To do this, at least in the circumstances of this case, was not at odds with the requirement in paragraph (a) of Annex I. On a straightforward reading of that provision, the requirement to provide an “outline” of the “relationship” between the plan or programme under consideration and “other relevant plans and programmes”, in the plural, does not preclude such “relevant plans and programmes” being dealt with, as the words suggest, on their aggregate effects.  </p>

Mr Pleming submitted that the complexity of considering the relationship of the ANPS to each of a number of local plans does not excuse a failure to comply with paragraph (a) of Annex I. The ANPS provides policy support for a specific scheme at a specific location, and the effects of that scheme in combination with individual local plans should therefore have been assessed in the SEA. </p>

It does not offend either the letter or the spirit of the relevant provisions of the SEA Directive. Given the national policy context in which the ANPS takes its place, it was in our view appropriate to adopt a broad approach to cumulative effects. That was realistic, and, we think, perfectly lawful. It was not a culpable omission to leave out a consideration of cumulative effects with individual local plans in favour of a more comprehensive assessment, following the expert guidance the Secretary of State received.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.87in;margin-right:0.01in">Finally, the Hillingdon claimants take issue with the Divisional Court’s conclusion (in paragraph 499 of its judgment) that the interaction of the ANPS with local plans can be adequately addressed in the EIA at the development consent stage. The purpose of the legislative regime for SEA, they say, is to ensure that the strategic implications of development are known and considered at the plan-making stage, so that the Secretary of State, local authorities, those affected by the development, and the wider public are able to understand its effects. The counter argument from the Secretary of State is that the Divisional Court was right to recognize the inevitably more detailed assessment under the regime for EIA at the development consent order stage. As it accepted (in paragraph 463), the Mayor of London and local planning authorities will at that stage be able to make specific representations about the likely effects on the environment, including cumulative impacts, and those effects will have to be considered before a development consent order is granted.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.87in;margin-right:0.01in">Again, we agree with the view of the Divisional Court. The SEA regime and the regime for EIA will operate, at different stages of the process under the Planning Act, to ensure that the cumulative impacts of the development are fully assessed. Both at the policy-making stage in the preparation of the ANPS and in the subsequent process by which an application for a development consent order under section 103 of the Planning Act is considered, the cumulative effects of development at Heathrow and any other development with which it interacts, including development planned in local plans, will be assessed. The outcome of that process is not pre-determined by the strategic-level assessment of cumulative effects in the Appraisal of Sustainability. The strategic-level assessment informs an understanding of the strategic implications of the development envisaged in the ANPS. The degree of refinement required in that assessment, under the SEA Directive, is set by the terms of article 5 and Annex I. Those provisions are not unduly onerous. They do not stipulate a particular approach to cumulative assessment. They leave with the authority responsible for promulgating the plan or programme a reasonably generous discretion in deciding how it should go about that work. In our view, that discretion was not exceeded by the Secretary of State in the preparation of the Appraisal of Sustainability.  </p>

For practical reasons it becomes more difficult to estimate noise exposure accurately, and therefore population numbers affected, below this noise level. This is because it is difficult to measure aircraft noise levels at greater distances from an airport where aircraft noise levels are closer to those of other noise sources. Also, due to variability in aircraft position in the air at these greater distances from the airport, the absolute noise levels have a lower level of certainty.  </p>

This was, as the Divisional Court put it, “because Gatwick is in a more rural location and fewer people are affected by the impact there” (paragraph 467 of the judgment). It is quite clear, however, that the more harmful noise impacts arising from expansion at Heathrow were considered by the Secretary of State in making the decision to select the north-west runway scheme at Heathrow as the preferred development in the ANPS. Equally clear is that even if different flight paths had been assumed or a different noise threshold selected, the conclusion that the Heathrow schemes would result in worse and more widespread noise effects than a second runway at Gatwick would have been the same.

The court’s reviewing role does not stretch to determining disputed issues of technical, expert evidence. As the Divisional Court concluded (in paragraph 491 of its judgment), it was inappropriate to expect, in a claim for judicial review, a resolution of contentious matters of expert opinion on the question of whether the threshold ought not to have been set at 54dB, but at 51dB or some other level. This again was, obviously, a matter of judgment for the Secretary of State, having in mind the expert advice he was given. The judgment he reached might have been different.

This, he submitted, was inconsistent with the requirement under paragraph (c) of Annex I to identify the “areas” likely to be significantly affected. “Areas” would include, for example, schools, open spaces, hospitals and care homes. The impacts on them ought to have been considered in the noise assessment – but were not. Failure to do this went against the purpose of the SEA Directive to ensure that communities likely to be affected by a plan or programme are properly consulted and given an early and effective opportunity to comment. If, as here, only numbers of people and buildings are included in a noise impact assessment, communities are denied that opportunity.  </p>

It does not preclude an assessment that concentrates on the effects of aviation noise on the population of an area within particular noise contours, demonstrating the number of people and buildings likely to experience noise at given levels. This does not mean that an approach that goes further – for example, by bringing into the assessment the effects on particular land uses within the </p>

But, in any event, as we have described, whilst expressing international objectives – notably, to hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels – the Paris Agreement imposes no obligation upon any individual state to limit global temperatures or to implement the objective in any particular way. It expresses global objectives, and aspirations in respect of national contributions to meet those objectives; and it obliges each state party to “prepare, communicate and maintain successive nationally determined contributions that it intends to achieve”. Parties are required to pursue domestic mitigation measures, with the aim of achieving the objectives; and ensure they meet the requirement for successive nationally determined contributions to be progressive (article 4). But it clearly recognises that the action to be taken in terms of contributions to the global carbon reduction will be nationally determined “in the light of different national circumstances” (article 2(2)); and that, in that determination of national contributions, economic and social (as well as purely environmental) factors and the consideration of how other states are proposing to contribute will or may play a proper part.

Despite the fact that Government policy could of course be outside any statutory provisions – and despite Mr Crosland’s submissions that, in some way, the CCA 2008 cap has to be read with the Paris Agreement (see, e.g., Transcript, day 7 pages 112 and 116) – neither policy nor international agreement can override a statute. Neither Government policy (in whatever form) nor the Paris Agreement can override or undermine the policy as set out in the CCA 2008.

The defendant’s “concession” (if that be the correct description), or rather helpful narrowing of issues, arose in the context of submissions regarding the applications for disclosure by FoE and Plan B. A principal submission by the Defendant was that once the real issue under the grounds of challenge were correctly defined, then the disclosure sought was unnecessary. Para 29 of his position statement says that the only issue is whether the Defendant was entitled as a matter of law to consider matters as against existing legal obligations and policy commitments as given effect by the Climate Change Act 2008. If he was, then this particular ground fails. If he was not, and the matter had to be considered as against the Paris Agreement, then the ground of challenge would be made out. Leading counsel for the Defendant confirmed to the court that that was the issue and that any other references in the Defendant’s documents which might be taken to suggest otherwise could be ignored. He also said that if the Defendant lost on this issue (defined in this way) he would not raise any discretion points which would justify further specific disclosure. Instead discretion points would be “generic” in nature. The indication given for the Defendant at the hearing was that in so far as the Paris Agreement differs from the 2008 Act in any relevant, significant way, then the matter was not taken into account.” </p>

In terms what it requires is that the ANPS should explain how the Secretary of State has “taken into account” government policy. It is necessarily implicit in that obligation that the Secretary of State must indeed first have taken that government policy into account.

In our view, the debate that took place before the Divisional Court about the possible impact of an international agreement on domestic law that has not been incorporated by legislation enacted by Parliament was a distraction from the true issue. That debate, it seems to us, did not bear on the proper interpretation of a statutory provision deliberately and precisely enacted by Parliament itself, in the words of section 5(8) of the Planning Act. As we have said, those words do not require the Secretary of State to act in accordance with any particular policy; but they do require him to take that policy into account and explain how it has been taken into account. None of that was ever done in the present case. </p>

In our view, that was a clear misdirection of law and there was, therefore, a material misdirection of law at an important stage in the process. That misdirection then fed through the rest of the decision-making process and was fatal to the decision to designate the ANPS itself. </p>

Secondly, as we have explained, there were firm statements re-iterating Government policy of adherence to the Paris Agreement by relevant Ministers, for example the Rt. Hon. Andrea Leadsom MP and the Rt. Hon. Amber Rudd MP in March 2016.   </p>

After all, the acts of negotiating, signing and ratifying an international treaty are all acts which under the British constitution are entrusted to the executive branch of the State – the Crown. This distinction between the functions of the Crown and Parliament is what underlies the dualist character of our legal system (see, for example, the speech of Lord Oliver of Aylmerton in <span style="font-style:italic">J. H. Rayner (Mincing Lane) Ltd.,</span> at p.500) and explains why the ratification of an international treaty cannot, without more, change domestic law; if it could, the Crown would be able to change the law of this country without the consent of Parliament. But requiring the Crown to comply with what has been enacted by Parliament (in this case the obligations in section 5(8) of the Planning Act) is an entirely conventional exercise in public law. </p>

It was not submitted to us that in designating the ANPS the Secretary of State committed no error of law – or that, if he did, the error itself was immaterial – because the relevant consequences of meeting the targets already in place under the Climate Change Act would have been, or at least might have been, the same as those of implementing the United Kingdom’s commitments under the Paris Agreement. Such an argument, had it been put forward, would in our opinion have been mistaken. If the Secretary of State was to comply with his duty under section 5(8) of the Planning Act, the implications of the Paris Agreement for his decision, and whether they were different from the implications of meeting the targets under the Climate Change Act, were matters for him specifically to consider and explicitly address in that very exercise. But he did not do so. It is clear that, in deciding to designate the ANPS, he did not take the Paris Agreement into account at all. On the contrary, as we understand it, he consciously chose – on advice – not to take it into account. And in our view, as we have said, his failure to take it into account was enough to vitiate the designation.  </p>

Its benefits were assessed in the ANPS up to 2085 but, Mr Wolfe submitted, there was no assessment of the climate change impacts beyond 2050. Furthermore, he argued, aviation is one of the very few sectors for which there are no current or currently envisaged credible alternatives to fossil fuel, it was obviously relevant to consider whether it was sustainable in the long-term to expand aviation activity in the light of the foreseen need to move to net zero emissions during the lifetime of the new runway and the potential need to move to net negative emissions. </p>

He submitted, by reference to the witness evidence of Ms Low, that it would be sensible to assess the impact of airport expansion against current climate change targets and that, as and when carbon reduction targets are developed for the post-2050 period, all those concerned will have to comply with the obligations which result when, and to the extent that, they apply. This point is closely related to the fundamental submission made by Mr Maurici, that there was no obligation on the Secretary of State to take into account the Paris Agreement at all. For the reasons we have already given, we reject that submission. It follows therefore that these two additional aspects of the case, being closely bound, as Mr Maurici submitted they are, with the Paris Agreement issue, will need to be considered in the exercise that the Secretary of State must perform according to law. </p>

He pointed out that the question of non-CO<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">2 </span>effects was highlighted in the Airport Commission’s discussion paper on aviation and climate change (in April 2013) and in its interim report (on 17 December 2013).

Furthermore, Mr Maurici submitted that, as part of its assessment of the ANPS, the Appraisal of Sustainability considered non-CO<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">2</span> emissions but set out that these were not able to be assessed because of levels of scientific uncertainty. It was acknowledged in the Appraisal of Sustainability (at paragraph 6.11.11) that there are likely to be highly significant climate change impacts associated with non-CO<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">2</span> emissions from aviation, which are likely to be of a similar magnitude of the CO<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">2</span> emissions themselves, but which cannot be readily quantified due to the level of scientific uncertainty. </p>

In particular, courts should still be cautious about straying, even subconsciously, into the forbidden territory of assessing the merits of a public decision under challenge by way of judicial review. If there has been an error of law, for example in the approach the executive has taken to its decision-making process, it will often be difficult or impossible for a court to conclude that it is “highly likely” that the outcome would not have been “substantially different” if the executive had gone about the decision-making process in accordance with the law. Courts should also not lose sight of their fundamental function, which is to maintain the rule of law. Furthermore, although there is undoubtedly a difference between the old <span style="font-style:italic">Simplex </span>test and the new statutory test, “the threshold remains a high one” (see the judgment of Sales L.J., as he then was, in <span style="font-style:italic">R. (on the application of Public and Commercial Services Union) v Minister for the Cabinet Office </span>[2017] EWHC 1787 (Admin); [2018] 1 All E.R. 142, at paragraph 89). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.87in;margin-right:0.01in">In this case, as we have said, the Secretary of State does not contend that relief should be refused by this court if otherwise the grounds of challenge relating to the Paris Agreement succeed. In contrast, HAL does make that contention. On its behalf Mr Humphries submitted that it is unnecessary and inappropriate to grant a remedy in these proceedings because policy in the ANPS requires the applicant for development consent to provide evidence of the carbon impact of the project “such that it can be assessed against the Government’s carbon obligations” (paragraph 5.76 of the ANPS) and that carbon emissions alone may be a reason to refuse development consent if they would be “so significant that it would have a material impact on the ability of Government to meet its carbon reduction targets, including carbon budgets” (paragraph 5.82). Therefore, submitted Mr Humphries, the substance of the issues raised by the appellants can be considered by the Secretary of State at the stage of an application for development consent. And even that would not be the end of the matter. Even if a decision to grant development consent would be in accordance with the ANPS, the Secretary of State would not be bound to grant consent if to do so would lead to the United Kingdom being in breach of any of its international obligations (see section 104(4) of the Planning Act). This would include compliance with the Paris Agreement. Mr Humphries also pointed out, and emphasized, that the Secretary of State has agreed to consider a request from Plan B Earth to review the ANPS in light of the Committee on Climate Change’s advice of 2 May 2019. That request is being considered under section 6(3) and (4) of the Planning Act. Mr Humphries submitted that this development renders Plan B Earth’s proceedings academic.   </p>

In essence, we are of the clear view that it is incumbent on the Government to approach the decision-making process in accordance with the law at each stage, not only in any current review of the ANPS or at a future development consent stage. The stages of the decision-making process are interdependent. The formulation of the ANPS sets the fundamental framework within which further decisions will be taken.   </p>

In particular, in our view, it was a basic defect in the decision-making process that the Secretary of State expressly decided not to take into account the Paris Agreement at all.

The nature and degree of that public interest hardly needs to be set out here. The legal issues are of the highest importance. The infrastructure project under consideration is one of the largest. Both the development itself and its effects will last well into the second half of this century. The issue of climate change is a matter of profound national and international importance of great concern to the public – and, indeed, to the Government of the United Kingdom and many other national governments, as is demonstrated by their commitment to the Paris Agreement.   </p>

In our view, therefore, it would not be appropriate to refrain from granting a suitable remedy at this stage to ensure, at least, that the ANPS does not remain effective in its present unlawful form pending the outcome of its statutory review –  under section 6 of the Planning Act – in the light of the Paris Agreement (see paragraph 39 above).  </p>

In the event, however, the parties have been unable to reach agreement on that matter. We have in mind that the relief we grant must properly reflect our conclusions on all the issues before us, in their entirety, and not merely the conclusions we have reached on the climate change issues. The Secretary of State, in his submissions in the light of the draft judgment, has not resisted the granting of relief, but has not suggested any particular form of remedy. HAL and Arora have contended for a stay of the ANPS and a mandatory order requiring the Secretary of State to undertake a review under section 6 of the Planning Act. Friends of the Earth and Plan B Earth have contended for a declaration and a quashing order. The Hillingdon claimants have also submitted that the ANPS should be quashed.  </p>

We do not consider that in the particular circumstances of this case, given our conclusions on the issues of the SEA Directive and the Habitats Directive, it is necessary or appropriate to quash the ANPS at this stage. Nor do we accept that it is appropriate to make a mandatory order requiring the Secretary of State to undertake a section 6 review, bearing in mind that the Secretary of State has a discretion under section 6(1) to decide to undertake a review “whenever [he] thinks it appropriate to do so”.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.87in;margin-right:0.01in">To a substantial extent we agree with the analysis and conclusions of the Divisional Court. Like the Divisional Court, we have concluded that the challenges to the ANPS must fail on the issues relating to the operation of the Habitats Directive, and also on all but one of the issues concerning the operation of the SEA Directive. However, for the reasons we have given, we have concluded that in one important respect the ANPS was not produced as the law requires, and indeed as Parliament has expressly provided. The statutory regime for the formulation of government policy in a national policy statement, which Parliament put in place in the Planning Act, was not fully complied with. The Paris Agreement ought to have been taken into account by the Secretary of State in the preparation of the ANPS, but was not (see paragraphs 222 to 238, and 242 to 261 above). What this means, in effect, is that the Government when it published the ANPS had not taken into account its own firm policy commitments on climate change under the Paris Agreement.   </p>

Appropriate relief must therefore be granted. We have formulated a declaration that is, in our view, appropriate, necessary and proportionate in the light of our conclusions as a whole (see paragraphs 267 to 280 above). A declaration has binding effect.  </p>

That is not the outcome here. However, the consequence of our decision is that the Government will now have the opportunity to reconsider the ANPS in accordance with the clear statutory requirements that Parliament has imposed.   </p>
