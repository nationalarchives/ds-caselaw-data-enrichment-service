	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The Rank Group plc (“Rank”) is the representative member of a VAT group which operates a number of bingo clubs.  In the course of that business it made supplies of mechanised and cash bingo to members of the public.  Until 2009 these were treated as taxable supplies and Rank accounted to HMRC for the VAT at the standard rate after setting-off any associated input tax in respect of the relevant periods. </p>

Claim (iv) was, however, rejected as being out of time.  It was made more than 4 years after the end of the prescribed accounting periods comprised within claim (iv) which was the relevant date for the purposes of s.80(4) VATA.  Rank appealed against this decision on the ground that the statutory time limit in s.80 breached the EU principles of equivalence, effectiveness and equal treatment.  But its appeal was withdrawn following the decision of this Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Leeds City Council v Revenue and Customs Commissioners</span> [2015] EWCA Civ 1293, [2016] STC 2256 and Rank now accepts that claim (iv) was out of time.    </p>

What HMRC should, it is said, have done was to reduce the amount of input tax which was brought into account to determine their net repayment liability under claims (i)-(iii) by deducting from those sums the £67.05m of overpaid VAT which would have been repayable under claim (iv) but for it being out of time.  The gross amount of input tax credited to HMRC as part of the calculation of the amount repayable in respect of claims (i)-(iii) constitutes, it is said, an overpayment of VAT by Rank to the extent of the £67.05m and Rank contends that this sum is now recoverable under s.80(1B) VATA.  It made a claim for such repayment in June 2013 which was in time if the relevant date for the purposes of s.80(4) was the date or dates on which the amounts due under claims (i)(iii) were paid.  On Rank’s case, these were the dates when Rank “paid” an amount by way of VAT to HMRC for the purposes of s.80(1B). </p>

It is common ground that the Commissioners are not obliged to refund more than the net amount of overstated tax which they received, so that in a case where the taxable person has for a particular accounting period miscalculated the amount of output tax due, the input tax deducted from the gross amount of output tax in the relevant return or assessment will still be taken into account in determining the sum due to be repaid.  The same will apply, as in this case, where the relevant supply should have been treated as exempt so that no output tax was in fact payable nor was the taxable person entitled to deduct input tax as a set off.  In such cases, everyone agrees that the Commissioners’ repayment obligation extends only to the net amount which was accounted for and which they received.

This converts an obligation on the part of the Commissioners under subsections (1) and (1A) to credit the claimant with the amount of the overstated output tax VAT into an obligation to pay or repay so much of the relevant amount as remains after setting “any sums against it under or by virtue of this Act”.  Mr Macnab submits that these words can and should be read as referring to the right of the taxable person to deduct any input tax that is allowable under s.26 so that in a case where the supplies are taxable but the output tax is overstated, the repayment obligation under s.80(2A) falls to be calculated by taking into account the credit for input tax which the taxable person received.  If the amount of output tax that was in fact due is less than the amount of input tax properly deducted in the relevant accounting period then this will still produce a net repayment liability in favour of the taxable person under s.80(2A), just as it would have led to payment of a VAT credit by HMRC under s.25(3) if the claimant had correctly stated the output tax in his return.</p>

Mr Macnab, I think, accepts that the words I have quoted from s.80(2A) are more difficult to apply in a case where neither s.24 nor 25-26 VATA have any application to the supplies made.  But he says that such literal difficulties as exist must be overcome in favour of a construction which preserves the correct functioning of the Directive and recognises that those principles were applied when Rank accounted for the VAT that was wrongly thought to be due.  The right of the taxable person to recover overpaid VAT does not, he says, extend beyond the net amount which was in fact accounted for and paid. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.00in">“59.  The purpose of section 81 (3A) is, in my judgment, clear. It is that where a taxpayer makes a claim for repayment of VAT which has been paid owing to a mistake, all the consequences of the mistake are to be taken into account in assessing the quantum of his claim. That purpose is consistent with the overarching scheme of VAT under the Sixth Directive which treats the payment of output tax and the deduction of input tax as an “inseparable whole”. This is borne out by section 81 (3A) (b) which deals with amounts payable “to or by” the taxpayer. It is clear from this that section 81 (3A) was intended to allow HMRC to take into account both credits and debits. It is not, therefore, simply concerned with past claims by the taxpayer for credit of input tax. In evaluating those claims HMRC are also to look at amounts payable “by” the taxpayer: in other words output tax. Section 81 (3A) (b) is not limited to particular accounting periods. The main limiting factor is that the payment “to or by” the taxpayer must derive from the same mistake as that which gave rise to the claim. Section 81 (3A) is not part of the general scheme of VAT accounting, which requires a direct and immediate link between an input and an output. Rather it is a special provision, which seeks to undo the consequences (and all the consequences) of the same mistake.  </p>

There are in fact two limitations on the disapplication. The first, as mentioned, is that HMRC are confined to taking into account payments deriving from the same mistake. The second is that HMRC must credit the taxpayer with overpayments made by him. If section 81 (3A) is seen as a limitation on what would otherwise be HMRC's ability to set off rather than a disapplication of time limits in favour of the HMRC, then there is no difficulty with the grain of the legislation. Under the <span style="font-style:italic">Marleasing</span> principle there is no need for the national court to pinpoint the precise verbal interpolations needed to bring the national measure into conformity with EU law.

Although s.81(3) refers to a liability to pay VAT on the part of the taxable person, this is said to include the amount of wrongly deducted input tax which provided the relevant set-off in the case of claims (i)-(iii).  On Rank’s argument, these sums were set off against HMRC’s s.80 liability by the operation of s.81(3) and (3A) but the set-off was, it is said, wrongly calculated because it should have been further reduced by the deduction of the £67.05m.  The only sums therefore which HMRC were entitled to set-off against their s.80 liability under s.81(3) were the amounts of input tax actually deducted by Rank in the relevant period less the £67.05m.  The result, it is said, is that Rank has wrongly paid that amount which was not VAT due to HMRC and can now seek to recover it by a claim under s.80(1B). </p>

It is therefore perhaps striking that in this case claims (i)-(iii) were made in time by Rank for the net sums due after deduction of the input tax originally credited to Rank so that in each of these cases HMRC repaid the total amount of the claim.  Claim (iv) was similarly made for a net sum of £67.05m after taking into account input tax deductions but was out of time.  In each case therefore the claims made have assumed that HMRC’s s.80(2A) liability could not exceed the net amount of the claim and in each case the total amount of input tax has been brought into account as part of that calculation.   </p>

An amount is only due once it has become payable, which is the result of the set-off under s.80(2A)(b).  A reading of the reference to “under or by virtue of this Act” in that subsection as one to s.81(3) is inconsistent with what has always been the language and structure of that provision.  It requires one to read the word “due” as applying to the obligation under s.80(1) to credit the claimant with the amount of overstated output tax rather than to the liability to pay which only arises under s.80(2A) once the stipulated set-off has occurred.  It would also mean (as is contended in this case) that other tax liabilities of the claimant which may relate to different accounting periods are to be brought into account as part of the set-off to be performed under s.80(2A).  This seems to me to be not only inconsistent with the language of both s.80(2A) and s.81(3) but also with the provisions of s.80(1) and (1A) which impose the liability to credit the taxable person with output tax that was overstated in his return or an assessment made for particular accounting periods.

A liability to “pay a sum by way of VAT”, which is the language of s.81(3), is not an obvious way of describing the recovery of input tax that, as in this case, was set against an output tax over-declaration in relation to what was properly an exempt supply.  The set-off made by Rank in its original returns resulted in a reduction of the amount of net VAT that was wrongly paid to HMRC.  But it may be a permissible way of describing the recovery by HMRC of input tax that has been wrongly deducted in relation to other accounting periods where no output tax was over-declared by the claimant and where, consequently, a VAT credit has been wrongly paid by HMRC to the taxpayer under s.25(3).  In those cases the deduction of the input tax will have been credited to the taxable person and will have directly reduced the amount of output tax that would otherwise have been recovered as part of the supply chain leading up to the taxable person.  In such cases HMRC would need to raise an assessment under s.73(2) in order to recover the lost VAT. </p>

This is not a case where in calculating their s.80 liabilities under any of claims (i)-(iii) HMRC also sought to obtain a further credit by reference to the input tax which was deducted by Rank in the period covered by claim (iv).  HMRC accept that in order to have done that they would have needed to make an out of time assessment and rely on s.81(3A).  I think that Mr Macnab accepts that had they done that then the overpaid output tax for that period would also have had to have been brought into account.  </p>

There were no such claims in issue in <span style="font-style:italic">Birmingham Hippodrome</span> nor is that an issue in this case.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The result is that on a correct application of s.80(2A) Rank made <span style="font-style:italic">San Giorgio</span> claims for the refund of the net amount of VAT which it accounted for and paid in the four separate periods covered by claims (i)-(iv).  Of those claims, all but claim (iv) were in time and have been paid.  Claim (iv) has failed because it was made out of time but its rejection on those grounds is legally permissible under EU law.  In these circumstances, Rank had no entitlement under the <span style="font-style:italic">San Giorgio</span> principle to recover the net amount of claim (iv) (the £67.05m) as a set off in relation to one or more of the other accounting periods and the argument that this can be achieved via s.81(3) and (3A) (although ingenious) involves, in my view, a distortion of basic VAT accounting principles for which there is no warrant in the provisions of either s.80 or s.81.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal.  It is not therefore necessary to deal with the ground upon which both the FtT and the Upper Tribunal dismissed Rank’s earlier appeal, namely the applicability of s.80(1B).  But, in my view, even if the question of HMRC’s s.80 liability falls to be determined by reference to s.81(3) and (3A), the net result of the accounting exercise which Rank says should have taken place but did not has not been to make Rank pay anything to HMRC.  As the Upper Tribunal explain at [70] of their decision, all that would have happened is that HMRC would have paid too little in relation to claims (i)-(iii).  </p>
