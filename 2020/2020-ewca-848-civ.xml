	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The family’s evidence was that on 2 January 2020, G was in the care of her mother and maternal grandmother until the early evening and thereafter was looked after by the grandmother overnight and during the morning of 3 January. According to the maternal grandmother, it was in the early afternoon on that day she noticed a swelling on G’s head. She took her to the pharmacist, and then to the GP, and finally to hospital where they were joined by the parents. Medical examination of G’s head revealed that she had a small displaced oblique fracture of the right parietal bone with a 5mm subgaleal haematoma overlying the fracture site. At that stage, none of the adult family members could provide an explanation for the injuries and in the absence of such an explanation the treating doctors concluded that the injuries had been inflicted non-accidentally. </p>

A fact-finding hearing was listed for four days in July 2020. The findings sought by the local authority in its “threshold” document included “that the mother and/or the father are unable or unwilling to account for this injury and they are either responsible for causing this injury to G and/or know who was responsible for causing this injury and are withholding this information, thus failing to protect G whilst in their care or the care of another”.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">“The time to swelling becoming apparent is usually within an hour or two …. Nevertheless, the development of a haematoma on the head may sometimes take some hours and can occur very uncommonly more than 24 hours after impact but hardly ever after more than 48 hours…. The development of a haematoma the size of that recorded in G would be expected to be relatively rapid and be within a small number of hours and not exceptional as in more than 24 hours. This time at which the haematoma was first seen in G may not be a reliable indicator of the time when causative impact occurred. The haematoma was measured on imaging to be approximately 5mm depth which may not have been easily visible on cursory inspection. There was a changeover of carer responsibility that complicates timing: mother and her mother during the afternoon and early evening period of 02.01.20 — swelling not seen; maternal grandmother alone 02.01.20 evening to afternoon 03.01.20 period — swelling seen at the end of this period. There was no described accident during these periods …. As most haematomas reach their final swelling size within a few hours and almost all within 24 hours, a causative impact according to carer reports would seemingly have occurred in the period of 24 hours up to 03.01.20 afternoon, most probably on 03.01.20. The exception to this reasoning would be if the haematoma slowly accumulated which is uncommon, or if it were borderline size in terms of person recognition even by the same person on different occasions or that person in constant caring contact.” </p>

The likely hard object impacting surface would increase the likelihood of a resultant fracture a little. A small cross-sectional area of the impacting site, like an edge or small protrusion, would be likely to further increase the possibility of fracture.

In a skeleton argument filed on behalf of the authority for the full appeal hearing, however, Mr Jonathan Sampson QC, who did not appear at the hearing before the judge, conceded on behalf of the local authority that there were deficits in the judge’s analysis and application of the law and for that reason no longer opposed the appeal. The local authority now accepted that the expert evidence did not indicate that the threshold <span style="font-style:italic">could not </span>be crossed. Although an explanation had been provided which the experts considered plausible or possible, their views were subject to a number of significant caveats. The fact that the probable timeframe for the injuries had narrowed to a period when the child was largely, if not wholly, in the grandparents’ care did not mean that the threshold criteria could not be satisfied. The judge had failed to consider the application to withdraw on basis of the factors identified by McFarlane J in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">A County Council v DP</span>.

He accepted, however, that the medical evidence does not establish that it would be impossible for the threshold to be met. As a result, he conceded that the case falls into the second category identified in accordance with the guidance set out by McFarlane J in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">A County Council v DP</span>. He submitted, however, that there was nothing in the judgment to suggest that the judge had concluded that the case fell into the first category. He argued that the judge carried out a proper analysis of the factors identified by McFarlane J and her conclusion that a fact-finding hearing was unnecessary in all the circumstances cannot be said to be wrong. She was entitled to place significant weight on the local authority’s assessment of the evidence and the social workers’ wider experience of the family and on their evidence that the parents were willing to work with the local authority by completing a parenting assessment as part of the child in need plan. She was also entitled to find that the likely result was that the threshold under s.31 would not be satisfied. This was a legitimate exercise of judicial discretion and could not be said to be wrong, even if another court may have reached a different conclusion. </p>

Applying those factors to this case, it is clear that the fact-finding hearing must go ahead. The outcome is plainly of enormous relevance to the future care plans for the child. If the court finds that the injuries were inflicted non-accidentally, and either identifies one or other of the child’s principal carers as a perpetrator, or alternatively is unable to exclude the carers from the pool of possible perpetrators, such findings will inevitably have a significant impact on the future care plans for the child. Equally, if the court concludes that the local authority has failed on a balance of probabilities to establish that the injuries were inflicted, such a finding will also impinge significantly on the child’s future. Accordingly, the fact-finding hearing is necessary in the child’s best interests.  </p>
