He referred to passages in the decision letters which, looked at in isolation, suggest that the decision-maker on behalf of the Secretary of State failed to make any finding of dishonesty at all or at least on the basis of the correct burden of proof; or, having made such a finding, failed to go on and perform the discretionary balancing exercise inherent in paragraph 322(5).  I accept that the decision letters were not as focused as they no doubt would have been had the decisions been made after <span style="text-decoration:underline">Balajigari</span>; but, when the letters are looked at fairly and as a whole, I consider that the decisionmakers clearly concluded that, in making differential declarations of income, the First Appellant in each case had been dishonest, that dishonesty being the basis of the conclusion that the criteria in paragraph 322(5) were met.  For example, in each decision latter, the decision-maker expressly concluded that the earnings declared in the earlier application for leave to remain were not “genuine” (see the decision letter of <span style="text-decoration:underline">Baldha</span> dated 15 December 2017 at page 3, and that in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Dhamodharan</span> dated 2 December 2017 at page 5).  It is in my view noteworthy that, not only did each of the Upper Tribunal Judges treat the essential ground of challenge a <span style="text-decoration:underline">Wednesbury</span> challenge to the Secretary of State’s entitlement to make that finding of dishonesty on the evidence before her; but that was also the essential basis of the initial grounds of appeal to this court.

They wish to pursue an entirely different case than that which they pursued at first instance, abandoning the current case and replacing it; but under the umbrella of the same case number and in this court.

If this claim proceeds, the best that the Applicant can achieve is to have that application redetermined by the Secretary of State under a procedure giving that opportunity.

Upon their applications having been refused, and whilst their judicial review claims were being considered, they (voluntarily) left the UK as the law required them to do.  They should not be penalised for complying with the law in this way: they ought to be allowed to return to the UK pending determination of their claim for leave to remain.  Indeed, the draft revised grounds include, by way of relief, an application for a mandatory order requiring the Secretary of State to allow the Applicants to return to the UK prior to the challenged decisions to refuse being quashed, which would have the effect of reviving the Applicants right to remain under section 3C of the Immigration Act 1971.   </p>

For example, once removed, an applicant may be “lost”; continued, effective legal representation may be difficult; being out-of-country would involve an applicant in substantial disadvantage in obtaining not only advice but documents and other evidence from within the UK; and the individual may lose the ability to give oral evidence which might be crucial.  Their right to access to justice would be compromised.    </p>

However, section 3C(3) of the 1971 Act provides that the leave extended by that section lapses if the applicant leaves the UK, as the Applicants here have.  As a result of that statutory provision, the Applicants currently have no leave to remain as at present and consequently no right to be in the UK as a result of any such leave.  Their position is dealt with in the Secretary of State’s published guidance, “Leave extended by section 3C (and leave extended by section 3D in transitional cases”, which (at page 7) provides: </p>

This is because section 3C leave can arise and exist only where there is s seamless continuation of leave, either extant leave or section 3C leave.  Where there is a break in leave, such that section 3C leave comes to an end, section 3C leave cannot be resurrected. </p>

This means that the outstanding application should be considered as if the person still had section 3C leave (meaning they should not be refused on grounds they are an overstayer).  Where on reconsideration of the withdrawn decision leave is then granted, the break in the person’s leave between section 3C leave coming to an end and the grant of new leave should not be held against them in any subsequent application.” </p>

That guidance appears to be in line with the statutory provision which brings leave to an end when an applicant leaves the UK; indeed, in my view, a crucial point is that the bringing to an end of leave in these circumstances is the will of Parliament as expressed in section 3C(3).  It brings leave to an end even where the withdrawal of leave has been legally erroneous. </p>

However, he submits that, if the court or the Upper Tribunal were to direct the Secretary of State to allow the Applicants to return to the UK and then (once the Applicants were in the UK) quash the refusal decisions, that would enable the Applicants to take the benefit of section 3C leave and be in the UK whilst their applications for leave are being determined.  By that means, the consequences otherwise flowing from section 3C and the guidance, unfairly adverse to the Applicants, can be avoided.  However, I am not persuaded that the court should take that course in the circumstances of these cases. </p>

However, the cessation of section 3C leave in the manner contemplated by the statutory provisions is clearly not sufficient in itself to amount to disadvantage which would require leave to be reinstated and a person who has left the UK to be allowed to return.  What matters is the disadvantage that the relevant person has in practice, in the circumstances of his or her particular case.  </p>

If real issues arise, then, as and when they do, they can be the subject of representations to the Secretary of State and, if necessary, to the court.  As Mr Malik submitted, the First-tier Tribunal have a specific rule and procedure for ensuring that out-of-country applicants are allowed to return to the UK to prepare for and conduct any appeal hearing f justice requires it.  Both the Secretary of State and, of course, the courts and tribunals are committed by the common law and article 6 of the ECHR to ensure proper access to justice.  But I am entirely unpersuaded that it is necessary for this court, at this stage, to grant any relief in this regard or to maintain the current appeal/claim to allow for judicial consideration of such relief. </p>
