	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">This is an appeal from a judgment of Teare J on two preliminary issues which it was hoped would determine which of two contending claimants is entitled to give instructions to financial institutions within this jurisdiction on behalf of the Central Bank of Venezuela ("the BCV"). The Bank of England holds gold reserves of about US $1.95 billion for the BCV, while Deutsche Bank is obliged to pay the proceeds of a gold swap contract to the BCV in the sum of about US $120 million, which sum is currently held by court appointed receivers.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The preliminary issues reflect the widely publicised dispute as to who is the President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro Moros or Juan Gerardo Guaidó Márquez. Mr Maduro claims to be the President of Venezuela on the ground that he won the 2018 presidential election. Mr Guaidó claims to be the Interim President of Venezuela on the ground that the 2018 presidential election was flawed, that on that account there was no President and that, under the Venezuelan Constitution, the President of the National Assembly, Mr Guaidó, became the Interim President of Venezuela, pending fresh presidential elections.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The two competing claimants to the funds held by the Bank of England and the court appointed receivers have been referred to in these proceedings as the “Maduro Board” and the “Guaidó Board”. It is convenient to use these terms, although the Maduro Board does not accept their accuracy. It claims to be the only validly appointed board of the BCV, appointed by Mr Maduro as President of Venezuela and, as such, authorised to give instructions on its behalf. The Guaidó Board, on the other hand, claims to be an <span style="font-style:italic">Ad Hoc</span> board of the BCV, appointed by Mr Guaidó. It does not claim any right to control of the BCV’s assets in Venezuela, but it does claim to be authorised to give instructions on behalf of the BCV in relation to the assets of the BCV in this jurisdiction. The Guaidó Board claims that Mr Guaidó was entitled to make these appointments by virtue of a statute known as the Transition Statute. The Maduro Board has challenged the right of Mr Guaidó to make these appointments, contending that they are null and void (and have been held to be so) under Venezuelan law. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The dispute as to which of these claimants is entitled to give instructions on behalf of the BCV concerning the assets held in England therefore involves at least two issues: whether Mr Maduro or Mr Guaidó is the President of Venezuela; and, if the answer is that Mr Guaidó is the President and Mr Maduro is not, the validity of Mr Guaidó’s appointment of the Guaidó Board and Special Attorney General Hernández. This has led to the two preliminary issues which are now before us.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The first issue is concerned with recognition. The Guaidó Board maintains that the authority of Mr Guaidó to appoint the members of the board of the BCV is established, so far as the English court is concerned, by the recognition by Her Majesty's Government ("HMG") of Mr. Guaidó as the “constitutional interim President of Venezuela”.

These include the appointment of Mr Guaidó as Interim President, the Transition Statute, the appointment of Mr Hernández as Special Attorney General and the appointment of the Guaidó Board. It has also ruled that the BCV is not a “decentralised entity”, the term referred to in the Transition Statute. However, it is the case of the Guaidó Board that the decisions of the STJ should not be recognised in England because they were issued in violation of principles of due process and because the members of the STJ are not impartial and independent but were acting corruptly to support Mr Maduro.  </p>

As I understand it, the Guaidó Board accepts that in practice Mr Maduro’s government does exercise at least a degree of effective control in Venezuela, although the extent of such control is disputed, but submits that this is irrelevant to the preliminary issues. </p>

The word ‘recognises’ denotes a formal statement of consequence. Counsel for the Guaidó Board submitted that it is a word which HMG would not use casually but would use deliberately. I agree. There was now, it was submitted, a recognition of the legal status of Mr Guaidó as President as opposed to a mere expression of political support. I agree.

For that reason the judge regarded the continued maintenance of diplomatic relations with Mr Maduro as irrelevant. What mattered was that Mr Guaidó was recognised as President and it was for the President of Venezuela to make the appointments to the board of the BCV: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.00in;text-indent:0.00in">“36. The argument advanced on behalf of the Maduro Board assumed that the argument being advanced on behalf of the Guaidó Board was that the statement of 4 February 2019 recognised a new government. It was submitted that such an argument could not be right because HMG continued to have full diplomatic relations with Mr. Maduro's government which, it was said, supported by learned authorities in the field of public international law, is compelling evidence that HMG recognised Mr Maduro's government as the government of Venezuela. The difficulty with this argument is that counsel for the Guaidó Board did not submit that there had been a recognition of another government. Their argument concerned, not the government of Venezuela, but the President of Venezuela, albeit that, as is common ground between the parties, the President, as Head of the National Executive, directs the action of the government. The reason counsel for the Guaidó Board concentrated on the President of Venezuela was not only the language used by HMG but also that the appointments which are challenged in the [Bank of England] and [Deutsche Bank] actions by the Maduro Board are appointments made by Mr Guaidó as President of Venezuela. Thus, although there may have been no change in the full and formal diplomatic relations between HMG and the government of Venezuela and although there may have been no change in the exercise of effective administrative control in Venezuela (as alleged by the Maduro Board but denied by the Guaidó Board) there has been, on the case of the Guaidó Board, a change in the person recognised by HMG as the President of Venezuela. It is unnecessary for the Guaidó Board to say there has been a change of government and they have not said that. Counsel for the Guaidó Board accepted that the question of ‘government’ in Venezuela is ‘difficult’ because some parts of the state of Venezuela support Mr Maduro and, they submitted, some parts of it support Mr Guaidó.” </p>

It was not permitted for the court to investigate whether the statute was a valid legislative act in accordance with the Venezuelan constitution; that would be to adjudicate upon the lawfulness and validity of the statute, which is what the act of state principle prohibits. Nor was the rule confined to legislation concerning property and (perhaps) personal injury. It extended to legislation conferring power upon a head of state to make appointments. While the rule applied only to legislation taking effect within the territory of the state concerned, the Transition Statute was so confined because the power to make appointments took effect within Venezuela notwithstanding that the Guaidó Board and the Special Attorney General thus appointed would have power to deal with assets situated abroad. Accordingly challenges to the validity of the Transition Statute were not justiciable in the English court. </p>

As to this, the judge held that, leaving aside cases where the issue of lawfulness arises only incidentally (cf. <span style="font-style:italic">Attorney General v Buck</span> [1965] Ch 745), the act of state principle applies regardless of whether the act concerned is unlawful or null and void under the law of the state concerned. </p>

The Transition Statute was not such an act because the National Assembly had no power to legislate under Venezuelan law, in particular as decided by the STJ, and because it had not been published in the Official Gazette; and the BCV was not a “decentralised entity” within the meaning of the Transition Statute, which accordingly did not purport to authorise the appointment of Mr Hernández or the Guaidó Board, again as decided by the STJ. In any event the act of state doctrine is subject to three relevant limitations: it does not apply to purported legislative or executive acts which are unlawful under the law of the state concerned (the lawfulness issue), or which take effect outside the territory of that state (the territoriality issue), and it does not extend beyond acts affecting property or personal injuries within the territory of that state (the subject matter issue).  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The Guaidó Board’s submissions began with a procedural objection, which was that the Maduro Board’s assertions about Mr Maduro’s day-to-day control within Venezuela and diplomatic relations between Venezuela and the United Kingdom were contentious and outside the scope of the preliminary issues. Those issues were irrelevant, they had not been addressed in the Guaidó Board’s evidence and no conclusions could be drawn about them, not least because to do so would be contrary to the “one voice” principle. The decisions of the STJ were likewise irrelevant although, if they would otherwise have carried weight, it would be necessary to take account of the fact that the STJ judges were not independent of Mr Maduro and were subject to United States and European Union sanctions for having supported the Maduro regime. Investigation of such matters was not precluded by the act of state principle (<span style="font-style:italic">Yukos Capital Sarl v OJSC Rosneft Oil Co (No 2) </span>[2012] EWCA Civ 855, [2014] QB 458). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">As to the substance of the recognition issue, the Guaidó Board submitted that the Foreign Secretary’s statement recognised Mr Guaidó as the legitimate President of Venezuela, without saying or needing to say whether this was recognition <span style="font-style:italic">de jure</span> or <span style="font-style:italic">de facto</span>, these being terms which HMG no longer used in making statements of recognition. What mattered was that HMG had unequivocally recognised Mr Guaidó and not Mr Maduro as President of Venezuela. But even if the statement was to be understood as recognising Mr Guaidó as President <span style="font-style:italic">de jure</span>, it left no room for any recognition of a rival <span style="font-style:italic">de facto</span> President.

Accordingly the English court has no jurisdiction to entertain the various Venezuelan law challenges raised by the Maduro Board as to the validity and effectiveness of these official acts. The acts in dispute were appointments made by an individual who claimed to be and was recognised as the President of a foreign state and who made them acting in that capacity. In order to establish whether his actions were attributable to the foreign state the only question was whether he was indeed the President, which question was answered by the “one voice” principle. HMG’s recognition of Mr Guaidó as President of Venezuela bound the court regardless of any constitutional unlawfulness under the law of the foreign state. </p>

Paragraphs 25 to 27 of that document set out various issues relating to recognition of the government, head of state and/or head of government. Paragraph 26 set out the issue which with minor modification became the first preliminary issue, namely whether HMG formally recognised Mr Guaidó and, if so, in what capacity, on what basis and from when. The three sub-issues which became sub-issues (i) to (iii) of the preliminary issue were then set out. Paragraph 27 identified issues which would arise if there was no conclusive recognition by HMG of any person as head of state or head of government, including factual issues as to HMG’s dealings with the government of which Mr Maduro is the head, whether and to what extent Mr Maduro and his government continue to exercise administrative control in Venezuela, and whether the STJ has concluded that Mr Maduro is the President of Venezuela as a matter of Venezuelan law. Paragraph 29 set out the act of state issues which became the second preliminary issue, while paragraphs 30 and 31 identified a number of issues as to the status of the STJ rulings and the effect, if any, which ought to be given to them by an English court. Paragraph 32 identified issues as to the status of the National Assembly, including in particular whether its acts were null, void and of no legal effect because the National Assembly was constituted in breach of the judgments and orders of the STJ, while paragraphs 34 to 36 identified similar issues relating to the legal status of the Transition Statute. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">From this summary of the List of Issues it is apparent that the issues selected for trial by way of preliminary issue were narrowly focused. The first preliminary issue, concerned with recognition, was exclusively concerned with the express statement made by the Foreign Secretary on 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2019 and its confirmation in the FCO’s letter to the court dated 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2020. That is clear from the terms of the issue itself, in particular its emphasis on “formal” recognition and the three sub-issues. It is also clear from the fact that other issues which might arguably have a bearing on wider issues of recognition, including whether HMG continued to recognise Mr Maduro or his government by implication, did not form part of the selected issue. Thus the issue as to the significance of the maintenance of diplomatic relations formed part of paragraph 27, not paragraph 26. It is, perhaps, understandable that the first preliminary issue should have been narrowly focused on formal recognition in this way in circumstances where the principal issue between the parties was whether the Foreign Secretary’s statement amounted to a statement of recognition at all.  </p>

Implied recognition takes place through acts which, although not referring expressly to recognition, leave no doubt as to the intention to grant it. Implied recognition has taken on greater significance with the adoption by several states, including the United Kingdom, of a policy of no longer expressly recognising a new government, but instead leaving the answer to the question whether it qualifies to be treated as a government to be inferred from the nature of their dealings with it, and in particular whether these dealings are on a normal government-to-government basis.” </p>

This shows that, if nothing more is said, <span style="font-style:italic">de jure</span> recognition presupposes effective control in fact. It is consistent with this approach that Mr Secretary Gordon Walker, when asked what states or governments are recognised as (a) entitled to exercise or (b) exercising governing authority, answered only the first question: after doing so there was no occasion to go further. That in doing so there was no intention to deny effective control in fact to the <span style="font-style:italic">de jure</span> sovereign is shown by the fact that the reply relates, without distinction, to the whole period from 1945-1964. For at any rate for some years after 1945, it would not be possible to dispute that the U.S.S.R. was directly governing the Eastern Zone, which must dispose of any conjecture that in the words he has used for the period as a whole the Secretary of State is distinguishing between what could be done and the actuality of the situation.

The third, and perhaps most important, is that no notice was given by the Maduro Board to HMG that this court would be invited to hold that HMG had acted contrary to international law by recognising Mr Guaidó. That was to say the least regrettable. It would have been fundamentally unfair for this court to reach such a conclusion without HMG having the opportunity to defend its position.

As regards the first problem – that of the content of the principle of non-intervention – the Court will define only those aspects of the principle which appear to be relevant to the resolution of the dispute. In this respect it notes that, in view of the generally accepted formulations, the principle forbids all States or groups of States to intervene directly or indirectly in the internal or external affairs of other States. A prohibited intervention must accordingly be one bearing on matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty, to decide freely. One of these is the choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system, and the formulation of foreign policy. Intervention is wrongful when it uses methods of coercion in regard to such choices, which must remain free ones. The element of coercion, which defines, and indeed forms the very essence of, prohibited intervention, is particularly obvious in the case of an intervention which uses force, either in the direct form of military action, or in the indirect form of support for subversive or terrorist armed activities within another State.  …” </p>

The Guaidó Board does not suggest that Mr Guaidó was entitled, as a matter of Venezuelan law, to appoint members of the board of the BCV or to appoint a Special Attorney General by virtue of his position as interim President. Rather its case is that the National Assembly was entitled to and did pass the Transition Statute, which was a legislative act of the state of Venezuela; that the Transition Statute authorised Mr Guaidó to make the appointments in question; and that these facts engage the first two rules stated by Lord Neuberger in <span style="font-style:italic">Belhaj v Straw</span> (which appear to have commanded the support of a majority of the judges of the Supreme Court), concerned respectively with legislative and executive acts: </p>

But the STJ, the highest constitutional court in Venezuela, has held that it is not. That is the result of its 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> August 2016 judgment holding that all decisions taken by the National Assembly would be null and void for so long as the Assembly was constituted in breach of the judgments and orders of the STJ, a judgment issued well before the Assembly’s appointment of Mr Guaidó as interim President and the passing of the Transition Statute. On the face of things, therefore, Lord Neuberger’s first rule has no application in this case, because there is no relevant Venezuelan legislation. The position would be different if English public policy requires that the STJ judgment should not be recognised or given effect, but that is an issue outside the scope of the preliminary issues which has yet to be determined. </p>

Mr Fulton for the Guaidó Board sought to meet this difficulty by disclaiming reliance on the Transition Statute, taking his stand on the fact that the appointments were executive acts made by Mr Guaidó in his capacity as interim President of Venezuela and that it made no difference that the appointments were (and had been held by Venezuela’s highest court to be) unlawful under Venezuelan law. There is, it may be noted, a certain irony in this stance given that the essence of Mr Guaidó’s claim to be the President is that he was appointed and is acting in accordance with the Venezuelan constitution.  </p>

In relation to immovable property within the jurisdiction of the state concerned, there appear to be good practical reasons for a foreign court recognising what may amount to a de facto, albeit unlawful, transfer of, or other exercise of power over, such property. So far as movable property or other property rights are concerned, if by an executive, but unlawful act, the state confiscates such property within its territory, the same point applies so long as the property remains within the territory of that state. And there is practical sense, at any rate at first sight, if when the property is transferred to another territory following a sale or other transfer by the state, the transferee is treated as the lawful owner by the law of the other territory. However, there are potential difficulties: if the original confiscation was unlawful under the laws of the originating state, and the courts of that state were so to hold, or even should so hold, it is by no means obvious to me that it would be, or have been, appropriate for the courts of the subsequent state to treat, or have treated, the confiscation as valid. </p>

A rule of recognition which treats any executive act by the government of a foreign state as valid, irrespective of its legality under the law of the foreign state (and logically, it would seem, irrespective of whether the seizure was being challenged before the domestic courts of the state in question), could mean ignoring, rather than giving effect to, the way in which a state's sovereignty is expressed. The position is different in successful revolutionary or totalitarian situations, where the acts in question will in practice never be challenged.

One might ask why an English court should shrink from determining the legality of the executive acts of a foreign state by its own municipal law, when it routinely adjudicates on foreign torts and foreign breaches of contract. The answer is that the law distinguishes between exercises of sovereign authority and acts of a private law character. It is fair to say that the decided cases on this point generally involved internal revolutions or civil wars leading to a breakdown of law of a kind which could ultimately be resolved only by force. Other countries implicitly recognise the outcome diplomatically with retrospective effect, and their courts follow suit. Similar problems can arise in relation to the acts of totalitarian states where there may be no rule of law even in normal times. But I do not think that the act of state doctrine can be limited to cases involving a general breakdown of civil society or states without law. Quite apart from the formidable definitional problems to which such an approach would give rise, the basis of the doctrine is not the absence of a relevant legal standard but the existence of recognised limits on the subject-matter jurisdiction of the English courts.” </p>

Whether or not the act of state doctrine requires the English court in the former case to treat such executive acts as valid and effective without further enquiry, I can see no justification in the latter case for holding that it extends so far as to require the English court to treat them as valid and effective if they have already been held to be null and void under the law of the foreign state concerned.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I recognise that there are other issues which will need to be determined before the second preliminary issue can be answered. These include whether Mr Guaidó’s appointment of the members of the Guaidó Board took effect outside Venezuela (the territoriality issue) and whether the act of state doctrine extends to the making of such appointments (the subject matter issue). However, as a definitive answer cannot at this stage be given to this preliminary issue, I see no useful purpose in extending this judgment by embarking upon these issues. </p>
