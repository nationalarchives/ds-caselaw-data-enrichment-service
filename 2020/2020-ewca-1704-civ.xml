Mrs Bailey, who granted the 2002 Option, inherited her interest in the land to which the 2002 Option relates from her husband, Mr Roger Bailey. She died in 2014 and her interest has passed to her daughter, Mrs Anne Stephens, who is the Respondent to this appeal. Mr Saunders’ interest as grantee under the 2002 Option was assigned to Serviced Land No 1 GP Ltd in 2006 and then to the Appellant, Fishbourne Developments Limited (“Fishbourne”) in 2013.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The claim before HHJ David Cooke and this appeal turn on the proper meaning of the term “Planning Permission” in the 2002 Option. The term is of such importance because the exercise of the option is conditional upon the grantee (defined as the “Purchaser”) obtaining a “Planning Permission”. Fishbourne contend that a planning permission granted in July 2016, to erect a new pitched roof on an agricultural building at the Property, which has since expired, (the “Roof Permission”) was a “Planning Permission” for the purposes of clause 3.5 of the 2002 Option and, therefore, was sufficient to trigger the process culminating in its right to acquire the entirety of the Property at a discount. On that basis, it served a notice on 22 May 2018 (the “Notice”) confirming that a “Planning Permission” had been obtained and containing its proposals as to the Open Market Value of the Property and calculations of the Price. All of the terms to which I have referred are defined in the 2002 Agreement.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Greenhill QC, on behalf of the Respondent, seeks to uphold the judge’s decision. However, if we consider that the judge was wrong and that the 2002 Option is capable of being triggered by the grant of planning permission for development of only part of the Property, the Respondent’s alternative case is that it must be interpreted only to entitle Fishbourne to purchase that part of the Property to which the planning permission relates and not the whole. This was referred to before the judge as “Interpretation C”. It was not necessary for him to consider it and he declined to express any view upon it. See judgment at [88].  </p>

Accordingly, Mr Bailey agreed in 1990 and 1991 to grant Mr Saunders options for a ten-year period over Bethwines Farm and two further plots which were nearby, known as the “Football Field” and “Flat Farm”. </p>

Mr Bailey agreed to grant an option “to purchase the freehold property situated and known as Bethwines Farm . . . comprising of approximately 100 acres at a price of 70% of current market value per developable acre”. Mr Bailey went on to state that he confirmed: “[our] agreement that you should put in a planning application for housing on this land at your expense as soon as possible”.

Rather, the lawyer and the judge, when interpreting any contract, can use them as tools to ascertain the objective meaning of the language which the parties have chosen to express their agreement. The extent to which each tool will assist the court in its task will vary according to the circumstances of the particular agreement or agreements. Some agreements may be successfully interpreted principally by textual analysis, for example because of their sophistication and complexity and because they have been negotiated and prepared with the assistance of skilled professionals. The correct interpretation of other contracts may be achieved by a greater emphasis on the factual matrix, for example because of their informality, brevity or the absence of skilled professional assistance. But negotiators of complex formal contracts may often not achieve a logical and coherent text because of, for example, the conflicting aims of the parties, failures of communication, differing drafting practices, or deadlines which require the parties to compromise in order to reach agreement. There may often therefore be provisions in a detailed professionally drawn contract which lack clarity and the lawyer or judge in interpreting such provisions may be particularly helped by considering the factual matrix and the purpose of similar provisions in contracts of the same type. The iterative process, of which Lord Mance spoke in <span style="font-style:italic">Sigma Finance Corpn</span> (above), assists the lawyer or judge to ascertain the objective meaning of disputed provisions. </p>

It seems to me that the reasonable reader of clause 1.9 with all the relevant background available to the parties at the time, having read the clause in the context of the 2002 Option as a whole, would not conclude that the natural and ordinary meaning of word “development” in the context of that clause encompasses each and every one of the activities set out in the detailed provisions of section 55 of the 1990 Act. Such a reader would not have the breadth and technicality of section 55 in mind at all. He would have in mind that the land subject to the 2002 Option is a farm and approach the meaning of “development” in that context. The fact that reference is made in clause 1.9 to the grant of planning permission by the local planning authority, which would be within section 55, does not mean that the natural and ordinary meaning of “development” includes all or any of the activities outlined there. Although any development within the definition in clause 1.9 would require permission under section 55, it is a non sequitur to conclude that “development” encompasses all or any of the activities in section 55.  It seems to me to be quite clear, therefore, that the judge was right to reject the submission that “development” in clause 1.9 of the 2002 Option has the meaning given to it in section 55 and to conclude that it has more than one meaning.  </p>

It was concerned with the interpretation of a conditional option agreement in similar terms to the 2002 Option. In that case, this court considered whether a planning application by the purchaser, Hallam, to build an office block covering 2.5 acres of the 45-acre plot constituted “a planning application or applications for the development of the Property”. If it did, Hallam would be able to exercise its option to purchase the entire property at a price to be calculated at £100,000 for each acre of the property over which planning permission had been granted, in other words, 2.5 acres, and thus £250,000. </p>

Moreover, the possibility that a planning application for development of the whole site would fail did not mean that the option agreement must contemplate a planning application for development of any part of the property. Further, Rix LJ stated at [51]: “The purchaser had paid only £5,000 for his option. He buys a mere spes for a small price.

As Mr Greenhill QC, on behalf of Mrs Stephens, pointed out, if Fishbourne’s interpretation is correct, Mr Saunders could have obtained the option for £1 and exercised it very shortly thereafter having obtained an inconsequential planning permission which neither changed the use of the Property nor increased its value. If the purchaser/grantee were entitled to do so, he would be able to purchase the whole of the Property at a 30% discount and keep it in his “land bank” until an opportunity arose to sell it at a substantial profit. The owner/grantor would have parted with the land for 70% of its market value without having gained any advantage whatsoever. I agree with Mr Greenhill that this does not make commercial common sense and that the inclusion of a 30% discount on the Open Market Value is indicative of an expectation that the purchaser/grantee would take steps to enhance the value of the land in order to be able to exercise the option. In other words, the planning permission which triggers the 2002 Option cannot be entirely inconsequential. If that were the case, there would be no reason to give a discount. In fact, there would be little point in granting an option at all and certainly no reason to include all of the detailed provisions which appear in the 2002 Option.  </p>

In this regard, Mr Litton referred us to the determination of the Open Market Value of the Property undertaken by the independent expert, Mr Brogden, and relied upon the fact that Mr Brogden had decided that only 46 acres of the Property had development potential within 10 to 20 years.  </p>

He valued 46 acres on the basis of development within such a time frame and the remainder of the land on the basis of its agricultural value with a small element of long term development potential. See the determination at clauses 4.6, 5.5, 5.7, 5.8, 7.7 and 7.8. He made no reference to physical constraints when determining whether the land had development potential.  </p>

He referred us to the evidence of Mr Margott, a director of Fishbourne. In his witness statement of 24 September 2019, Mr Margott referred to the “Local plan Examination-in-Public” which took place in the autumn of 2014. He stated that Fishbourne “were hopeful that the Site could yet be identified for development through the Local Plan Review, as the council were not meeting their full housing need and development of the Site and other similar sustainable locations along the east-west railway line to the west of the District were obvious, sustainable and constraint free locations”.  See paragraph 12 of his witness statement. In my judgment, such a general and unfocussed comment is of little assistance. In any event, it seems to me that there is nothing in this point.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">What of the judge’s interpretation of clauses 1.9 in the context of clause 1.8? In essence, Mr Litton says that clause 1.9 should be read with clause 1.8 which contains the definition of “Planning Application” and should be interpreted to mean that planning permission could be applied for and granted for the Property or “any part thereof” for the purposes of obtaining a Planning Permission for the purposes of clauses 1.9 and 3.5. He submits, therefore, that the judge’s interpretation of clause 1.8 as indicating that multiple applications might be made for different parts of the Property in order to develop the whole was a departure from the plain and ordinary meaning of the words used and was mere artifice.    </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I disagree. If clause 1.9 is construed in the context of the 2002 Option as a whole, it seems to me that it is clear that “Planning Permission” in clause 1.9, and, therefore, a Planning Permission for the purposes of fulfilling the condition in clause 3.5, must relate to the whole or substantially the whole of the Property. Despite the use of the phrase “or any part thereof” in the definition of “Planning Application” in clause 1.8, the term “Property” is used in clause 1.9 without qualification. It is clear from an examination of clauses 1.8 and 1.9, therefore, that the draftsman was capable of distinguishing between the property as a whole and part of it and did so. There are other examples throughout the 2002 Option both of the unqualified use of the term “Property” and to references to “any part thereof”. Those references both in the unqualified and qualified versions make sense in the contexts in which they appear.   </p>

Fourthly, Fishbourne itself seeks to construe the references to the “Property” in clauses 3.5 (the trigger for the option) and in clause 4.1 (the determination of the Open Market Value and the Price and ultimately, the purchase) as a reference to the whole rather than part of the Property. That is because the term makes sense in those contexts if it is construed as a reference to the whole or substantially the whole. Fifthly, such an interpretation is also consistent with the acceptance of the Open Market Value under clause 3.6 and the first of the matters to be taken into consideration when determining Open Market Value set out at clause 1.3(i). One is required to have regard to “the physical characteristics of the Property”.  </p>

The use of the phrase in clause 5 makes sense in the context of that clause. A planning permission, a tenancy agreement, licence or agreement for the occupation or use of part of the Property would inevitably have consequences in relation to the efficacy of the 2002 Option.   </p>

For example, as Mr Greenhill points out, the use of “of” in the phrase “any development of the Property” in clause 1.9 is also consistent with a development of substantially the whole rather than any part of the Property. If the latter were the proper interpretation it would be more apt, perhaps, to have used the preposition “on”.   </p>

I do not see how the parol evidence rule can exclude prior contracts, as distinct from mere negotiations. The difficulty of course is that, where the later contract is intended to <span style="font-style:italic">supersede</span> the prior contract, it may in the generality of cases simply be useless to try to construe the later contract by reference to the earlier one. Ex hypothesi, the later contract replaces the earlier one and it is likely to be impossible to say that the parties have not wished to alter the terms of their earlier bargain. The earlier contract is unlikely therefore to be of much, if any, assistance. Where the later contract is identical, its construction can stand on its own feet, and in any event its construction should be undertaken primarily by reference to its own overall terms. Where the later contract differs from the earlier contract, prima facie the difference is a deliberate decision to depart from the earlier wording, which again provides no assistance. Therefore a cautious and sceptical approach to finding any assistance in the earlier contract seems to me to be a sound principle. What I doubt, however, is that such a principle can be elevated into a conclusive rule of law.  </p>

Either the later contract is intended to supersede the earlier, in which case the above principles apply. Or, the later contract is intended to live together with the earlier contract, to the extent that that is possible, but where that is not possible it may well be proper to regard the later contract as superseding the earlier. Or the later contract is intended to be incorporated into the earlier contract, in which case it is prima facie the second contract which may have to give way to the first in the event of inconsistency.

It is artificial to seek to characterise Mr Westhorpe’s recollection of what developers may have said at the time as objective fact and to differentiate that from Mr Westhorpe’s and Mr Saunders’ motivations and subjective intentions when asking Mrs Bailey to enter into the 2002 Option. At best, it is the basis for Mr Saunder’s subjective intention.
