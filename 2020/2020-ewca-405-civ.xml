	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">On five occasions between December 2013 and February 2014, the UK Border Force at Purfleet seized a container owned by the appellant. On each occasion, the container was transporting goods on behalf of the same customer, a Romanian company called Giesse Bev Trade (“GBT”). The first container seized was manifested as containing wine but was not accompanied by a valid Administrative Reference Code (“ARC”) required for the import of excise goods on a duty-suspended basis, nor had there been any prepayment of duty. The consignment documents for the four subsequent containers each stated that the container was carrying pallets of foodstuffs. In each case, the container was in fact carrying a substantial quantity of wine. None of the documents included an ARC code and no duty had been paid on any of the loads.  </p>

The consignment documents described the load as thirty pallets of foodstuffs, when in fact the container also contained wine on which duty had not been paid.  According to the UT decision, the volume of wine seized on this occasion was over 168 hectolitres. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It is not disputed that in Italy the wine had been “released for consumption”, within the meaning of that phrase in EU and UK law, and that, when it arrived in this country, it was not in the course of a duty suspended movement. The FTT heard and accepted evidence that, by the time of the first seizure, the second, third and fourth containers were already in transit. The tribunal found, however, that the appellant knew of the first four seizures before it accepted the order to transport the shipment that was subject to the fifth seizure. The FTT accepted that the appellant was unaware that the container was carrying excise goods but concluded that after being notified of the first seizure, had failed to check the location of the loading point and, had it done so, it would have discovered that it was a winery.  </p>

Save for the appellant, all correspondence was returned to Border Force unopened. No challenge was made to the legality of the seizures by the appellant or any other party and the wine was condemned as forfeit to the Crown by the passage of time under Schedule 3 to the Customs and Excise Management Act 1979 (“CEMA”). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In the course of correspondence with the appellant, HMRC initially issued the appellant with an assessment to excise duty and a penalty in respect of the seized goods. After further correspondence, HMRC concluded that GBT should be assessed for the excise duty instead of the appellant and, on 13 February 2015, withdrew the assessment and penalty, whilst reserving their right to take further action against the appellant. On 23 October 2015, however, they informed the appellant that they intended to issue an “excise wrongdoing” penalty under paragraph 4(1) of Schedule 41 to the Finance Act 2008. Having concluded that the appellant’s wrongdoing was not deliberate, HMRC applied a penalty percentage of 20% of the lost revenue, calculated at £45,000 and therefore, on 17 December 2015, issued a penalty assessment of £9,000.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The FTT rejected these arguments and dismissed the appeal. On the first ground, it concluded that an excise duty point was established when the goods, having been released for consumption in Italy, arrived in the UK and so were held for commercial purposes in this country. The subsequent destruction of the goods did not prevent the conditions for imposing a penalty being satisfied. On the second ground, the FTT rejected the argument that the appellant was an “innocent agent” and therefore could not be liable for a penalty. It concluded that there was no requirement for the company to know that it was arranging the transport of excise goods before a penalty could be imposed. Furthermore, the FTT found that the appellant had failed to establish a reasonable excuse because it had not performed any or any sufficient checks about the fifth consignment after receiving notice that the first container had been seized. On the third ground, the FTT decided, for reasons which it is unnecessary to set out here, that the penalty had been issued in time. </p>

In that case, tobacco and the taxpayers’ car in which it had been transported were seized by HMRC. The taxpayers did not challenge the seizure in the magistrates’ court and therefore, under the relevant statutory provision, the tobacco and car were “deemed to have been duly condemned and forfeited”. Subsequently, the taxpayers asked for the car back on the grounds that the tobacco had been for personal use. The proceedings reached this court which had to determine whether it was open to the taxpayers to pursue this argument having decided not to challenge the seizure. It was held that the deemed effect of the taxpayers’ failure to contest condemnation of the goods was that the goods were being illegally imported by them for commercial use.

Up until the very point at which the wine was destroyed or irretrievably lost, there was still the possibility that it might be restored and continue to its destination with the result that, in Mr Thornton’s submission, the destruction or irretrievable loss of the wine took place ‘during [its] transport’.  </p>

	      <span style="font-size:11.5pt">Article 37 deals with two situations. (1) In the first situation, there will be a ‘total destruction’ or ‘irretrievable loss’ …. In that case, as of right, the goods are not chargeable with excise duty (provided the proof required by Article 37 is given). No permission of the authorities is required for this aspect of Article 37 to apply. (2) However, Article 37 recognises that there may be other situations, connected with the natural hazards of the transport of goods, in which a taxpayer may want the authorities to agree that, provided goods are destroyed, no excise duty will be chargeable. Article 37 therefore gives flexibility to authorities and taxpayers to agree such arrangements on a case by case basis.  </span>

	      <span style="font-size:11.5pt">The ‘authorisation of the competent authorities’ referred to in Article 37 is a reference to the second situation set out at [66(2)]. Like the first situation (set out at [66(1)]), this is concerned with the natural hazards of transportation of goods. So, for example, excise goods might be so badly damaged during transport that, while they could technically still be used as excise goods, they are unsaleable in practical terms. Even though such goods would not be ‘totally destroyed’ or ‘irretrievably lost’ (and so the first situation is not applicable), the competent authorities are allowed to permit the goods to be destroyed on terms that no excise duty is payable. We see no justification for the broad reading of Article 37 which Mr Thornton advanced under which any lawful destruction of goods by a Member State’s competent authorities prevents excise duty being chargeable. In particular, since Article 37 is concerned with the natural hazards of transporting goods, we see no reason why it should be read as giving rise to the extraordinary result that smuggled goods cease to be chargeable with excise duty simply because the vigilance of the competent authorities results in the smuggling attempt being foiled and the goods seized and destroyed.  </span>

Moreover, the Excise Duties Directive cannot be intended to produce distortions in the single market. If the Company’s interpretation of Article 37 is correct, the consequence would be that, if the UK authorities seize and destroy smuggled intra-EU goods, they would lose any right to assess those involved in the smuggling. Such an interpretation might mean that those involved in smuggling face a limited ‘downside’. That might serve to increase distortions in the single market with economic operators in Member States that levy comparatively low rates of excise duty having an incentive to try to smuggle excise goods into the UK.  </span>

As a result of the failure to initiate condemnation proceedings, the wine was deemed to have been duly condemned as forfeited. Deeming this to be the case carries with it the fact that excise duty has not been paid. A corollary of the fact that excise duty has not been paid is that excise duty was chargeable and excise duty could only be payable if an excise duty point had arisen. He submitted that the UT had been wrong to conclude otherwise and had gone astray in its analogy with ivory. The present case is dealing not with non-excisable goods (such as ivory) but with excisable goods. The wine was seized because it was excise goods which had been held for a commercial purpose but in respect of which no duty had been paid. It was therefore submitted that a failure to challenge the seizure does not merely deem the seizure to be lawful. In the context of a seizure of excise goods, if, as Lewison LJ held in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">European Brand</span><span style="font-style:italic"> </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Trading</span>, a corollary of the deeming provision is that the excise duty has not been paid, it is inconsistent with that “fact” that the goods were not liable to excise duty because no excise point had been reached.

The wine in the fifth container had been “released for consumption” in Italy. At the point of arrival at Purfleet, it was being “held for commercial purposes … in order to be delivered here”. Accordingly, it was subject to excise duty here and excise duty became chargeable here. At that point, under regulations 5 and 6 of the HMDP Regulations, an “excise duty point” arose and the appellant, being a person “concerned in carrying … the goods”, became liable to a penalty under paragraph 4 of schedule 41 to the Finance Act 2008. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Did Article 37 apply so as to prevent excise duty being chargeable on the wine?

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I agree with the UT that “transport” should be given its ordinary meaning. For my part, I derive no assistance by comparing and contrasting the use of the word “movement” in Article 38. The wine in the appellant’s container was being transported from the ship to its ultimate destination in the UK. Had it continued on its journey, it would have been “transported” until it reached its destination. But it did not continue on its journey. It was seized by Border Force and held by that agency until it was destroyed following forfeiture. At the time of its destruction, it was not being “transported”. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">As for the second phrase, I do not accept the submission that the ultimate destruction of the wine by or on behalf of Border Force following forfeiture falls within the scope of the phrase “as a consequence of authorisation by the competent authorities”. The destruction of the wine following forfeiture took place on the orders of Border Force. The word “authorisation” means the granting of official permission. The plain and obvious purpose of including that phrase in Article 37 is to cover the destruction of goods which are partially, but not totally, destroyed in transit. Article 7(4) provides that, for the purpose of this Directive, goods shall be considered totally destroyed or irretrievably lost when they are rendered unusable as excise goods. But there will be other cases where the goods are substantially damaged while being transported but have not become totally unusable (for example, where a proportion of a consignment of wine bottles are broken but the remainder are intact). Article 37 allows for circumstances where the competent authorities may formally agree to the destruction of the remainder so as to remove them from the scope of the duty. </p>

Article 37 was a new provision. There was no equivalent in the earlier directive. In the circumstances, cases about the construction of the earlier Directive such as <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Dansk</span>, (which was in any event concerned with goods smuggled into the EU) do not in my view provide any assistance when construing the new Article 37. </p>

Article 33 of the Excise Duties Directive is crystal clear about when goods become chargeable to duty. There is to my mind nothing unfair about an outcome in which goods are liable to forfeiture in circumstances where a liability for duty and a penalty also arise. As the Upper Tribunal observed in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Kevan Denley v HMRC</span> [2017] UKUT 340 (TC) at paragraph 74, these are all consequences prescribed by law.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">First, as I have just concluded, I consider the UT’s decision as to the construction of Article 37 was correct. On behalf of the appellant, Mr Khan in effect accepted at the outset of the hearing before us that, subject to its being subsequently removed by Article 37, an excise duty point arose under Article 33, and it must have persisted. The two factors which HMRC are seeking to have “deemed” from the failure of the appellant to contest the condemnation of the wine – that excise duty was chargeable and an excise duty point had arisen – are therefore conceded by the appellant. The “deemed duty” point is therefore of academic interest only in this appeal. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Secondly, it is clear from the UT’s judgment that their approach to this question was significantly influenced by what they regarded as a “concession” made by HMRC in its supplemental written submissions. We were taken to those supplemental submissions by counsel and addressed on this issue at some length. Mr McGurk sought to persuade us that it was not in fact a concession at all and that, if it was, he should be entitled to resile from it. Mr Khan (who did not appear in the substantive appeal hearing below) insisted that it was a concession and to allow HMRC to resile from it would be wrong in principle. For my part, I think the UT may have been misled into thinking that HMRC’s submission included a concession. But that is what they did and this interpretation plainly narrowed the scope of their analysis of the deemed duty issue. With hindsight, it was probably a mistake to allow this issue, which is by no means straightforward, to be canvassed purely in supplemental written submissions, rather than with the benefit of full argument. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The third reason for my reluctance to venture further into this issue is that we have not had sufficiently comprehensive submissions on the point. I mean no disrespect to counsel in making that observation. For various reasons, including the matters mentioned above, the full ramifications of HMRC’s argument were not explored at the hearing before us. It is plain, however, that any decision of this court on the point, or any expansive dicta on the subject, could have consequences for other areas of tax law. In those circumstances, it seems prudent to refrain from comment. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In the light of what we have heard, however, I do feel able to say, with due respect to the UT, that we have heard sufficient argument to conclude that the UT’s comments on the interpretation and application of <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Jones</span> in this context, in particular at paragraphs 50 to 57 of the decision, should not be regarded as authoritative. Just as we did not receive sufficient argument on this complex issue, I am confident that the argument before the UT, made largely in the supplemental written submissions without oral argument, was insufficient to enable the UT to reach a conclusive view. Accordingly, the UT’s decision on this aspect of the case should not be regarded as authoritative without further argument in an appropriate case. </p>
