The removal was opposed by the parents and it was not supported by the Children’s Guardian.  At the end of the hearing, which took place by video conference, the judge was asked by counsel for the mother to grant a short stay to allow for an urgent application to be made to this court.  This was refused and the children were taken into foster care that evening.   </p>

There are three children: two boys aged 12 and 5, and S, a girl aged 7.  S has global learning difficulties.  The family came to the attention of the local authority in November 2019, when the older boy came to school with a mark on his face, saying that he had been slapped by his father.  He also spoke of being hit on other occasions, including with a cloth belt.  A neighbour reported that the mother had visited her for help in March 2018 after being assaulted by the father.   </p>

An application for interim care orders was made.  The local authority plan was for the children to stay in foster care pending assessments, but at a hearing before a Circuit Judge on 15 November 2019, it agreed that the children should be returned to their mother on the basis of a working agreement.  The parents accepted that the interim threshold under s. 38 Children Act 1989 was crossed, and an order was made under s. 38A of the Act excluding the father from the home. </p>

Its care plan provided for indirect contact only due to the lockdown, and thereafter supervised contact with the mother twice a week.  The evidence relied upon this time was: the social worker having seen a pair of adult sandals in the garden of the family home and S asking what time her father was coming over; the mother saying through an interpreter during an assessment that the father had removed a games console from the oldest child as he was using it too much; S saying during a social work visit on 20 April that she had been to the park on Sunday and daddy took them in his taxi.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The hearing, which was again before HHJ Watson, sitting as a Deputy High Court Judge, could not take place that day for lack of time and of an appropriate interpreter.  It was adjourned to a one-day remote hearing on 6 May 2020.  The parties had collectively asked for a longer hearing to allow for evidence to be taken from the main witnesses.  However, when adjourning the matter, the judge directed that the only witness to give evidence would be the social worker.  The parents were directed to file sworn statements which the judge stated that she would take "at face value."  She also made clear that she would need to have "robust" evidence from the social worker.  She also noted that the Guardian, who was unable to attend the adjourned hearing, did not support the removal of the children on the basis of the evidence filed.  We were told that the impression left on the parties was that the local authority’s evidence was going to be scrutinised to see whether it was capable of sustaining its revised care plan. </p>

She agreed that she had spoken to the father about the eldest child using his computer too much and that the father had told her to remove it, which she did: he did not remove it himself.  Likewise, she did take the children to the park, but with another adult, and not with the father.  Whenever S sees a taxi she thinks it is her father driving it.   </p>

The mother’s advocate was at something of a disadvantage in that the remote hearing was being interpreted to the mother by an interpreter connected via the judge’s laptop and there was no ready means of taking instructions during the hearing.  During the course of the evidence, the solicitor for the father applied for him to be allowed to give evidence, at least in relation to the games console.  The judge refused, confirming that she had read the father’s statement and understood that he disputed what the social worker said.  During closing submissions, the request was repeated for the parents to be allowed to give evidence if the judge was considering removal of the children. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The judge set the scene, noting that the safety of the children was dependent on the exclusion order and the written agreement.  She set out at some length the local authority’s case and remarked that the ability to monitor during the stressful period of lockdown was limited.  She reminded herself that the court was only entitled to make an order for removal where it was both necessary and proportionate and that there was no more drastic step than to take children from their mother and place them with strangers.  She continued:  </p>

It is submitted that the children have not been in the unsupervised care of their father, nor have the children seen their father in the family home.  It is said on behalf of the parents, supported by the Guardian, that the social worker has brought the case to court on two earlier occasions and the local authority has not pursued removal of the children notwithstanding having concerns that there had been breaches of the safety agreement and that the evidence supporting removal on this occasion, the third occasion the matter comes to court, is insufficient to pass the test of necessity and proportionality that I have referred to. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.00in;text-indent:0.00in">11. I do not agree with that analysis of the current situation.  I look at a pattern of behaviour which begins with the events leading to the first attendance at court and brings us right through to the three specific concerns that have been raised in March/April of this year.  It is that pattern of behaviour which builds up a body of circumstantial evidence which individually could be ignored, but together demonstrates a concerning persistent pattern of breaches of safety agreements, flouting a court orders and failure to implement the safety plan put in place for the protection of the children.” </p>

It is not accepted that the judge made findings of fact, nor was she required to do so at an interim hearing.  She was required to make an assessment of risk, and it was not necessary for evidence from the parents to be heard for that purpose.  Their likely denials would add little.  She expressly considered necessity and proportionality, and concluded that interim removal was justified.  Read as a whole, the judgment carefully describes the basis for the judge's decision that the risk matrix had changed and that the children could no longer be safe from their father in their mother’s care.  This court should not interfere with that exercise of discretion.  Finally, Mr Vine stated in his skeleton argument that the local authority’s case is that the children had “revealed further relevant information in foster care about the threshold events and whether their father continued to live at home”.  He submitted that if the appeal succeeds the case should be therefore be remitted for a rehearing. </p>

However, once she had decided to do that, fairness required that in this situation she should hear from both the accuser and the accused.  There will be cases, for example where the court needs to hear and evaluate professional opinion, where it will be proper to hear from witnesses from one side only.  This was not such a case.  The investigation was a factual one into events where the parents were primary witnesses.  It is no answer to say that the court would not have been helped by hearing their denials.  They were not making bare denials but giving possible explanations for much of the evidence brought against them and, at least on paper, those explanations were not self-evidently implausible and deserved proper consideration.  However, instead of taking them at face value (whatever that might be taken to mean), the judge largely left them out of account.

In my view the judge’s characterisation of the risks as ‘grave’ was not in keeping with the evidence and her evaluation of the children’s welfare was at a level of generality that was inadequate to underpin an order for their interim removal.  Nor did she factor in that the evidence that she did hear was, truth be told, a relatively flimsy basis for such a disruptive order.  Though mindful of the limited role of this court, I consider that the test for interim removal could not reasonably have been met on the evidence that the judge received.   </p>

We therefore maintained the interim care orders on the basis that the children would return home on the following day, with the s. 38A exclusion order in respect of the father remaining in full effect and subject to a written agreement with the mother. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">A short term stay to enable an application to be considered by an appeal court before an order is put into effect is to be distinguished from a stay pending a decision on permission to appeal or a stay pending appeal.  Applications for stays of the latter kind will be considered in accordance with the principles set out in <span style="font-style:italic">Hammond Suddart Solicitors v Agrichem International Holdings Ltd. </span>[2001] EWCA Civ 2065.  By contrast, a short term stay is a purely practical remedy, distinct from the decision about permission to appeal.  The correct approach for the court to take to an application of this kind was described by Wilson LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Re A</span> [2007] EWCA 899 at [27], where he confirmed that the judge should always give serious consideration to allowing an applicant “a narrow opportunity” to approach this court so that the opportunity for a successful appeal is not unfairly eroded: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.00in;text-indent:0.00in">“27.  When a judge considers that a significant change in the arrangements for a child needs to be made in effect forthwith and learns that there is an aspiration to appeal to this court, he should in my view always give serious consideration to making an order which affords the aspiring appellant a narrow opportunity to approach this court for further, temporary, relief before his order takes effect. No doubt the welfare of the child remains paramount; but, subject thereto, the judge needs to consider whether a refusal to afford a narrow opportunity for such an approach unfairly erodes the facility for effective appeal. If he decides to afford it, he can do so either by directing that the change in the arrangements should occur only at the end (say) of the following working day or by directing that the change should occur forthwith but that execution of his order be stayed until the end (say) of the following working day. The difference seems to me to be immaterial. When, however, a judge declines to take either of these courses, there remains the facility for the aspiring appellant to approach this court by telephone and no doubt usually on notice to the other party.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In this case, I consider that the request for a short term stay should have been granted, particularly where the mother was at a disadvantage in instructing her lawyers. The reasons given by the judge fell short of justifying refusal.  The nature of the risks involved in the children remaining at home for a further very short period can be measured by the fact that the court itself had sanctioned them remaining there between 27 April and 6 May for procedural reasons.  Further, as the judge herself acknowledged, there was no real risk to the children being taken out of the country and, bearing in mind that the family had not disappeared in the previous six months when it could have done, the prospect of internal flight was hardly likely either. </p>
