	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Farm-out agreements are used in the oil and gas industry across the world.  They borrow their name from historical practices in the agricultural sector where undertaking work on farmland would entitle a person to a legal or beneficial interest in that land.  A farm-out agreement operates as a type of sale and purchase agreement under which a seller agrees to transfer part (but not all) of its interest to the buyer in exchange for that buyer agreeing to undertake (or fund) work obligations such as acquiring seismic data or drilling wells in respect of that asset.  In the context of the oil and gas industry, the upstream "asset" being transferred is usually an interest in a licence, production sharing contract, or other concession, granted by a government to a company to explore for and produce oil and gas. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Farm-out agreements do not typically exist in a vacuum.  Where there is more than one owner, the parties will regulate their relationship in relation to that asset under a joint operating agreement.  Farm-out agreements need to take account of and interact appropriately with those joint operating agreements to avoid inconsistencies and minimise the prospect of dispute.  This appeal arises out of a dispute relating to the interaction between a farm-out agreement and a joint operating agreement.   </p>

The relevant licence for present purposes is Licence P. 1998 ("the Licence") and relates to an area described as "Val d'Isere" ("the Licence Area").  By way of consideration, under clause 2 of the FOA, EEL agreed to pay ANSL (subject to the terms of the FOA and in accordance with the provisions of clause 3.1 of the FOA) a price consisting of a proportion of ANSL's historic incurred survey and licence costs ("Back Costs") and 26.25% of ANSL's total costs (other than "Back Costs") including for drilling the well in the Licence Area. </p>

The FOA is a bilateral sale contract with a price agreed which the purchaser is liable to pay.  The JOA on the other hand is a multilateral joint venture contract with a joint venturers' account.  ANSL wears different hats at different times, depending on which contract is being considered. Under the FOA it is the seller, whilst under the VJOA it is the operator and a participant.  The multiple references to the VJOA in the FOA do not mean that the accounting rules in the VJOA are imported into the FOA.  </p>

The exercise of interpreting a provision involves identifying what the parties meant through the eyes of a reasonable reader, and, save perhaps in a very unusual case, that meaning is most obviously to be gleaned from the language of the provision. Unlike commercial common sense and the surrounding circumstances, the parties have control over the language they use in a contract. And, again save perhaps in a very unusual case, the parties must have been specifically focussing on the issue covered by the provision when agreeing the wording of that provision. </p>

That is simply the obverse of the sensible proposition that the clearer the natural meaning the more difficult it is to justify departing from it. However, that does not justify the court embarking on an exercise of searching for, let alone constructing, drafting infelicities in order to facilitate a departure from the natural meaning. If there is a specific error in the drafting, it may often have no relevance to the issue of interpretation which the court has to resolve. </p>

The mere fact that a contractual arrangement, if interpreted according to its natural language, has worked out badly, or even disastrously, for one of the parties is not a reason for departing from the natural language. Commercial common sense is only relevant to the extent of how matters would or could have been perceived by the parties, or by reasonable people in the position of the parties, as at the date that the contract was made. Judicial observations such as those of Lord Reid in <span style="font-style:italic">Wickman Machine Tools Sales Ltd v L Schuler AG</span> [1974] AC 235, 251 and Lord Diplock in <span style="font-style:italic">Antaios Cia Naviera SA v Salen Rederierna AB (The Antaios)</span> [1985] AC 191 , 201, quoted by Lord Carnwath JSC at para 110, have to be read and applied bearing that important point in mind. </p>

The purpose of interpretation is to identify what the parties have agreed, not what the court thinks that they should have agreed. Experience shows that it is by no means unknown for people to enter into arrangements which are ill-advised, even ignoring the benefit of wisdom of hindsight, and it is not the function of a court when interpreting an agreement to relieve a party from the consequences of his imprudence or poor advice. Accordingly, when interpreting a contract a judge should avoid re-writing it in an attempt to assist an unwise party or to penalise an astute party. </p>

While commercial common sense is a very important factor to be taken into account, a court should be very slow to reject the natural meaning of a provision as correct simply because it appears to be a very imprudent term for one of the parties to have agreed.  The meaning of a clause is usually most obviously to be gleaned from the language of the provision.

Recital B is "on and subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement".  It correctly reflects the fact that EEL is to pay "certain costs" that would otherwise be borne by ANSL.  What those "certain costs" are must be found elsewhere.  The words "whensoever incurred" correctly reflect the fact that ANSL is entitled to recovery of costs (whenever) incurred.  The word “whensoever” appears to be a timing point, although I accept that it is not clear what the timing issue was.  (It perhaps reflected the fact that the Upfront Payment was in respect of anticipated costs.)  As for the word “incurred”, there is of course no suggestion that ANSL is entitled to costs that it has not incurred.

Those costs (if incurred by the Operator) had to be costs incurred by the Operator when acting as Operator (not as a private supplier).  The "no loss, no gain" principle only applied to the Operator's activities qua operator (although the very fact that the cost of equipment leased or hired by the Operator could be capped at all shows that in its capacity as supplier of equipment the Operator could make a loss); it did not prevent the Operator suffering a loss in a personal capacity.   </p>

		  <span style="font-size:12pt">This is reflected in an ANSL interoffice memo dated 22 August 2017 where Mr Vaughan and Mr Griffith of ANSL wrote as part of a submission recommending the drilling of the Licence Area the following: </span>
		</p>
		<p class="footnotedescription" style="text-align:justify;margin-right:0.09in">“After the commitment well is drilled, the working interests in the licen[c]e will be [ANSL] 60%, DNO 22.5%, and [EEL] 17.5%. [ANSL] has a carry on the exploration well of 60% for 51.25% which reflected in the AFE.” <span style="font-size:12pt">This was an acknowledgment that the additional 8.75% payable by EEL under the FOA would directly</span><span style="font-size:12pt"> subsidise ANSL’s contribution under the VJOA by that amount. </span></p>
	      </authorialNote>  By contrast, ANSL's construction can be said to lead to the very uncommercial proposition whereby EEL would have agreed to take on an open-ended exposure under the FOA by reference to costs incurred by ANSL over which it had no meaningful control.     </p>

EEL wished to argue that the "total costs…incurred" were not ANSL's incurred payments under the lease for the rig, but rather costs at a level "no more than the loss of the use of the rig for other drilling operations which might have been scheduled for the same time" or at the level of "the price which a third party might have paid to sub-lease [the rig] from [ANSL]".  </p>

It would not have been fair or appropriate to allow EEL to rely on it for the first time on appeal.   </p>

The Judge ordered the Respondents to pay ANSL's costs of the action up to 16 May 2019, to be assessed if not agreed, and the Claimant to pay the Respondents' costs of the action thereafter to the conclusion of the trial, again to be assessed if not agreed.  It will be remembered that 16 May 2019 was the date of the case management conference and that a few days earlier, on 13 May 2019, EEL had paid over the sums which were on its case due to ANSL. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The Judge exercised his discretion in this manner on the basis that ANSL had been forced to commence proceedings in order to recover anything from EEL at all.  ANSL was successful down to the date when EEL agreed to pay what it was liable to pay as opposed to insisting on a judgment.  It was not obviously the case that the costs exclusively attributable to that part of the claim that was conceded by EEL were trivial or overwhelmed by the costs attributable to the issue on which ANSL ultimately failed.  An issue-based costs order (limiting the costs in favour of ANSL to those attributable to the element of the claim on which EEL paid out) would be impracticable.  In any event such an order would ignore a dispute between the parties as to when interest under clause 11.2 of the FOA ran.  That dispute remained live throughout the trial and was resolved in ANSL's favour. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Permission to appeal the costs order was refused at the full appeal hearing.  There was no real prospect of appellate interference with the Judge's exercise of discretion (and no other compelling reason for an appeal against the costs order to be heard).  The Judge had presided over the trial, understood the merits of the parties' positions, been referred to interparty correspondence and appreciated the significance of the payment ultimately secured by ANSL.  He had ruled in ANSL's favour on the question of interest (against which ruling there is no appeal), stating at [42] of the Judgment that it had been open to EEL to make a payment on account if necessary: the fact that EEL was not in a position to work out what sum was due until much later was immaterial.  The costs decision was "pre-eminently a matter for the discretion of the trial judge " (see <span style="font-style:italic">Britoil plc v Hunt Overseas Oil Inc</span> [1994] CLC 561 at 575); it could not be said that it "exceeded the generous ambit within which  reasonable disagreement is possible" (see <span style="font-style:italic">Tanfern v Cameron-MacDonald</span> [2001] 1 WLR 1311 at [32]). </p>

I reject ANSL's submission to the effect that it would have any industrywide impact by setting a general precedent.  Neither the FOA nor the VJOA was on a standard or model form; rather each was bespoke.  The proper construction of a farmout agreement and analysis of its interplay with an associated joint venture agreement will always turn on the precise terms of agreement between the parties. </p>
