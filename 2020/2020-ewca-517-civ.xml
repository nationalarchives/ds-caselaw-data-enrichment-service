	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">On 19 November of last year, we allowed an appeal by Mrs Siu Lai Ho against His Honour Judge Wulwik’s reversal of a decision made by Deputy District Judge Harvey, sitting in the County Court at Central London, on 7 February 2018 (see [2019] EWCA Civ 1988, [2019] Costs LR 1963). It is common ground that, in consequence, it is appropriate for us to make a costs order in the appellant’s favour. The parties differ, however, over whether the respondent, Miss Seyi Adelekun, should be ordered to pay the appellant’s costs of the hearing before the Deputy District Judge and, more importantly, over whether the appellant should be able to set off the costs due to her under our order against her liability to the respondent for the costs of the claim generally. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">As I mentioned in my previous judgment, the respondent notified the appellant’s insurer of a claim arising from a road traffic accident in accordance with the PreAction Protocol for Low Value Personal Injury Claims in Road Traffic Accidents (“the RTA Protocol”) on 15 January 2014. The appellant not having admitted liability, the claim left the RTA Protocol and the respondent issued proceedings on 7 January 2015. However, on 19 April 2017 the appellant’s solicitors offered to pay the respondent £30,000 in settlement of her claim in what was described as a “Part 36 Offer Letter”. On 21 April 2017, the respondent’s solicitors emailed the appellant’s solicitors to accept the offer and a “<span style="font-style:italic">Tomlin</span>” order was subsequently made by consent on 24 April. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The principal issue in the appeal to this Court was the extent of the appellant’s liability for the respondent’s costs of the claim. The appellant contended that the fixed costs regime for which Section IIIA of CPR Part 45 provides is applicable, but the respondent argued otherwise. We preferred the appellant’s submissions, concluding that the letter of 19 April 2017, correctly construed, did not offer to pay conventional rather than fixed costs and, accordingly, that the parties had not contracted out of the fixed costs regime. Absent any application by the respondent pursuant to CPR 45.29J for a higher amount by reason of “exceptional circumstances”, the respondent will thus be entitled to £16,705.15 in respect of her costs of the claim. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The main point that we now need to decide relates to the availability of set-off. The appellant asks us to direct that she may set off her entitlement to costs from the respondent against her liability for the respondent’s costs of the claim. The respondent, on the other hand, contends that we have no jurisdiction to sanction such set-off and that, even were that wrong, it would not be appropriate to order set-off here. </p>

In that report, Jackson LJ recommended that after-the-event insurance premiums and conditional fee agreement success fees should no longer be recoverable from an opposing party under a costs order but that “[t]hose categories of litigants who merit protection against adverse costs liability on policy grounds should be given the benefit of qualified one way costs shifting” (paragraph 7.1(ii) of chapter 9 of the <span style="font-style:italic">Final Report</span>). More specifically, Jackson LJ proposed that a regime of QOCS should apply in personal injury litigation (chapter 19). By that, he meant that the claimant in such a case should “not be required to pay the defendant’s costs if the claim is unsuccessful, but the defendant will be required to pay the claimant’s costs if it is successful” (paragraph 2.6 of the executive summary). He noted, however, that a claimant “must be at risk of some adverse costs, in order to deter (a) frivolous claims and (b) frivolous applications in the course of otherwise reasonable litigation” (paragraph 4.6 of chapter 19). </p>

A defendant may recover costs from the claimant where the proceedings have been struck out on the grounds set out in CPR 44.15 or, with the permission of the Court, where the claim is found to be fundamentally dishonest or CPR 44.16(2) applies. Those exceptions apart, a defendant can enforce a costs order, whether by set-off or otherwise, only up to “the aggregate amount in money terms of any orders for damages and interest made in favour of the claimant” in accordance with CPR 44.14. CPR 44.14, which McCombe LJ described as “enshrin[ing] the core principle of the QOCS regime” in <span style="font-style:italic">Brown v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis </span>[2019] EWCA Civ 1724, [2019] Costs LR 1633 (at paragraph 14), means that orders for costs against a claimant can be the subject of set-off or other enforcement “only to the extent that the aggregate amount in money terms of such orders does not exceed the aggregate amount in money terms of any orders for damages and interest made in favour of the claimant” unless CPR 44.15 or CPR 44.16 is applicable.

The judge in that case was construing a contract rather than a rule and the reference in 44.14 is enforcing against the defendant and specifically limits that by reference to damages and interest. ‘Enforcement’ there means enforcement in accordance with all the rules of the court, which would include the various powers that the court had as to compel compliance with its orders. Secondly, Part 44.14 enables enforcement without the permission of the court, whereas 44.12 requires the permission of the court or at least a court order in order for one set of costs to be set off against another.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.00in;text-indent:0.5in">[Counsel for the claimant] also submits that as a matter of discretion the court should not permit set-off. In the old days of Legal Aid, the claimant would not have had any liability to pay his lawyers. The Legal Aid fund would have borne the costs. If, therefore, a set-off of costs had been ordered against a legally aided claimant he would not have been out of pocket at all because he would not have been liable to pay his lawyers. That may well be true as a matter of reality, although one must not forget that under s.11 of the Access to Justice Act 1999 costs could be awarded against a legally aided litigant, so long as they did not exceed what it was reasonable for him to pay. As pointed out in the substantive judgment, Sir Rupert Jackson envisaged that costs protection similar to Legal Aid’s cost protection should be given to claimants with QOCS. The law in force at the time permitted set-off of costs against legally aided litigants and Sir Rupert made no recommendation to change that. Moreover, Sir Rupert also envisaged that claimants would pay their own disbursements, so that, at least to some extent, unsuccessful claimants might end up out of pocket. To allow set-off of costs would not, in my judgment, go against the thrust of his recommendations, and I do not consider that there is anything in the detailed rules setting up the QOCS regime which disapplies the court’s power to order set-off.  </p>

In that connection, he submitted that QOCS was intended to protect claimants bringing personal injury claims in good faith from facing personal liabilities as a result of costs orders in favour of defendants. Such a claimant will typically have entered into a conditional fee agreement (“CFA”) with his solicitor and so will owe the solicitor nothing if the proceedings fail. Where, on the other hand, the defendant is ordered or agrees to pay damages, a claimant with a standard CFA is likely to be personally liable for his solicitor’s fees irrespective of the extent of the recoveries from the defendant. Allowing the defendant to set off his costs liability against costs due to him from the claimant would, Mr Mallalieu said, leave the claimant with personal liability to his solicitor while depriving him of the fund from which payment is invariably made in personal injury cases. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">As, however, was pointed out by Mr Andrew Roy, who appeared for the appellant, a claimant could potentially find himself owing more to his solicitor than he had recovered from the defendant regardless of whether set-off of costs is permissible. Suppose, for example, that a defendant to a personal injury claim makes a very early Part 36 offer of £50,000 and that the claimant having none the less proceeded to trial is awarded only £40,000. Were the defendant’s post-offer costs to be in excess of £40,000 and the claimant’s own costs similar, there would be no question of the claimant being able to meet his liability to his solicitor from recoveries from the defendant irrespective of any order for costs set-off. While, therefore, QOCS is plainly intended to prevent a claimant from having to make a net payment to the defendant where CPR 44.15 and 44.16 do not apply, it can never have been expected to remove any risk of a claimant owing more to his solicitor than he had received from the defendant. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">However, there seems to me to be more force in other arguments advanced by Mr Mallalieu. In the first place, I find it hard to see how costs set-off can be justified on the basis that CPR 44.14 deals with set-off without the permission of the Court while CPR 44.12 authorises set-off with such permission. As I see it, CPR 44.14 is designed to bar <span style="font-style:italic">any </span>enforcement of costs orders against claimants in excess of damages and interest unless CPR 44.15 or CPR 44.16 applies, not merely to bar enforcement without the permission of the Court. Were the position otherwise, the protection afforded to claimants by QOCS would be severely curtailed. There would be no evident restriction on the circumstances in which costs orders against claimants could be enforced against them with the Court’s permission. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Secondly, there are, as it seems to me, compelling reasons for interpreting “enforced” as extending to set-off in the context of CPR 44.14. Mr Mallalieu acknowledged that set-off is not as a general rule regarded as a species of “enforcement”. It is plain, moreover, that CPR 44.14 encompasses conventional methods of enforcement such as are described in Practice Direction 70 - Enforcement of Judgments and Orders. Supposing, therefore, that a defendant wished to recover costs from a claimant who had already received sums he had been awarded by way of damages and interest, CPR 44.14 would allow him to use the ordinary mechanisms of enforcement to the extent of the award. On the other hand, those responsible for the QOCS regime will surely also have intended it to be possible for a claimant’s costs liability to a defendant to be set against the defendant’s liability for damages and interest so that the claimant simply receives a net sum. In fact, it would appear far preferable to adopt such an approach where possible. Yet it is hard to see where authorisation for such a course is to be found unless it is in CPR 44.14. CPR 44.12 could not be in point as it is concerned with the setting-off of mutual costs obligations, not with setting off a costs entitlement against a liability for damages and interest. </p>

Two classes of decisions per incuriam fall outside the scope of our inquiry, namely, those where the court has acted in ignorance of a previous decision of its own or of a court of co-ordinate jurisdiction which covers the case before it - in such a case a subsequent court must decide which of the two decisions it ought to follow; and those where it has acted in ignorance of a decision of the House of Lords which covers the point - in such a case a subsequent court is bound by the decision of the House of Lords.” </p>

This definition is not necessarily exhaustive, but cases not strictly within it which can properly be held to have been decided per incuriam must, in our judgment, consistently with the stare decisis rule which is an essential feature of our law, be, in the language of Lord Greene M.R., of the rarest occurrence. In the present case it is not shown that any statutory provision or binding authority was overlooked, and while not excluding the possibility that in rare and exceptional cases a decision may properly be held to have been per incuriam on other grounds, we cannot regard this as such a case. As we have already said, it is, in our judgment, impossible to fasten upon any part of the decision under consideration or upon any step in the reasoning upon which the judgments were based and to say of it: ‘Here was a manifest slip or error.’ In our judgment, acceptance of the AttorneyGeneral’s argument would necessarily involve the proposition that it is open to this court to disregard an earlier decision of its own or of a court of co-ordinate jurisdiction (at least in any case of significance or complexity) whenever it is made to appear that the court had not upon the earlier occasion had the benefit of the best argument that the researches and industry of counsel could provide.

Submissions to the effect that such set-off is inconsistent with the principles underlying QOCS cannot therefore avail Mr Mallalieu, as it seems to me. To the extent that such contentions have force, they tend to suggest that set-off should not be possible at all, not that the Court should decline to exercise its discretion to direct set-off in this particular case. Once it has been determined that set-off can be ordered in principle, the arguments lose their potency. Since (a) it is to be assumed that those responsible for the QOCS regime intended the Court to be able to order costs set-off regardless of whether the claim was unfounded or the claimant has misconducted himself in some way, (b) there is no evidence of anything specific to the respondent’s circumstances which could render costs set-off unjust and (c) the appellant has herself incurred substantial costs in vindicating her rights and will be left with a large shortfall even with the benefit of costs set-off, we should, I think, exercise our discretion to order set-off. </p>

He thought it right to depart from the general rule that the unsuccessful party will be ordered to pay the costs of the successful party on the footing that the appellant had been the author of her own misfortune. The application had arisen, he said, because of the “ambiguity or irregularity in the wording of a consent order which was signed by the [appellant] [viz. the <span style="font-style:italic">Tomlin </span>order of 24 April 2017]”.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">That said, I see considerable force in Mr Mallalieu’s submission that, in the specific context of CPR 44.14, the term “enforced” should be understood as extending to the exercise of a right of set-off, with the consequence that set-off of costs orders against each other is precluded. The rule deals with the situation where a claimant has succeeded in her claim and has obtained, by judgment or agreement, an order for damages (and perhaps also interest), but the defendant has also obtained an order for costs in its favour during the course of the proceedings. In that situation what will typically happen is that the defendant will deduct from the damages payable the amount of costs awarded to it and will pay the net balance to the claimant. That in my view is what the rule contemplates and is likely to be what the rule-maker had in mind as constituting enforcement of the order for costs in the defendant’s favour. The alternative situation where the defendant pays the damages in full and then seeks to enforce an order for costs in its favour is likely to be an exceptional case and is unlikely to be what the rule-maker contemplated. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">There is no difficulty in reading CPR 44.14(1) as authorising the set-off of costs payable to the defendant against damages payable to the claimant but, if that is so, it can only be because such a set-off is included within the concept of enforcement within the meaning of the rule. Conversely, if the rule does not authorise such a setoff, it is relevant to ask pursuant to what provision the set-off of costs against damages which typically occurs is permitted. The answer cannot be CPR 44.12, as that applies only where a party entitled to costs is also liable to pay costs to the other party. It would therefore be necessary to invoke principles of legal or equitable set-off under the general law. But that seems most unlikely to be what the rule-maker intended, not least as the QOCS rules are intended to form a self-contained code within the sphere of their application.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The view that “enforced” in CPR 44.14(1) includes the exercise of a right of set-off receives some support from the terms of the Explanatory Memorandum, as Newey LJ has explained. In my judgment it is legitimate to take this into account in interpreting the QOCS rules. I note that in <span style="font-style:italic">Brown v Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police</span> [2019] EWCA Civ 1724, [2019] Costs LR 1633, Coulson LJ at [30] expressed a contrary view, because the Explanatory Memorandum was not a document seen or approved by the Civil Procedure Rules Committee. However, I find persuasive the submission of Mr Mallalieu that, in the case of a Statutory Instrument, the Explanatory Memorandum is the document by which the proposer of the legislation explains to Parliament the purpose and effect of the proposed amendments, on which Parliament can be taken to have placed weight in deciding to approve (or not to reject) them. The fact that the amendments were first drafted by the Rules Committee does not diminish the fact that in order to become law they had to become part of a Statutory Instrument, proposed by the Ministry of Justice, whose purpose and effect would be explained to Parliament by the Explanatory Memorandum.  </p>

That will leave the claimant with a potential liability in costs to her own solicitors, which (bearing in mind that the challenge to the fixed costs regime was in large part for their benefit rather than the claimant’s) the solicitors may or may not choose (or be entitled) to enforce. But the claimant will in no circumstances have any net liability to the defendant and, in that respect, the order made will not be contrary to the QOCS regime.
