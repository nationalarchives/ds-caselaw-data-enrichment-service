The process of assessing “death by neurological criteria” (“DNC”) is described in two documents. Firstly, “<span style="font-style:italic">A code of practice for the diagnosis and confirmation of death</span>”, dated 2008, produced by the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges.

The second test was conducted by the same two clinicians on 2 October 2019. Each element observed by each of the two doctors during each of the two tests indicated brain stem death. In accordance with the Code of Practice and the guidance, the date and time of death were therefore fixed at the conclusion of the first DNC test as 20:01 on 1 October. </p>

He will eventually develop ventilator associated pneumonia. He will start to develop muscle wasting and joint contractures. It is likely that internal homeostasis will be disturbed as he no longer has central control of endocrine or autonomic functions. It may be possible to manage some of these complications by medical intervention. This is likely to require repeated reintubation of the trachea, chest physiotherapy and airway suction, repositioning and nursing care to maintain skin integrity, multiple blood tests, repeated venous cannulation and antibiotic administration, escalation of ventilator settings and oxygen administration and an increasing number of drugs to be administered. </p>

It will however, be an undignified and unkind way to allow his death to take place. It will also place a significant burden of distress onto his family and onto those who are caring for him given the futility of these interventions and the associated unkindness.” </p>

The 2008 Code endorsed and built upon a 1991 “report of a working party of the British Paediatric Association on the diagnosis of brain stem death in infants and children” together with an earlier code published in 1998. On its publication the 2008 Code was welcomed and endorsed by the then Chief Medical Officer (Sir Liam Donaldson) as providing “clear, scientifically rigorous criteria for confirming death”. The authors of the Code stress that it is a statement of current practice which does not (and could not) seek to provide guidance for every single clinical situation where a doctor is required to diagnose death. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.79in;text-indent:0.00in">“First, the irreversible loss of the capacity for consciousness does not by itself entail individual death. Patients in the vegetative state (VS) have also lost this capacity (see section 6.9). The difference between them and patients who are declared dead by virtue of irreversible cessation of brain-stem function is that the latter cannot continue to breathe unaided without respiratory support, along with other lifesustaining biological interventions. This also means that even if the body of the deceased remains on respiratory support, the loss of integrated biological function will inevitably lead to deterioration and organ necrosis within a short time.  </p>

	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.79in;text-indent:0.00in">Second, the diagnosis of death because of cessation of brain-stem function does not entail the cessation of all neurological activity in the brain. What does follow from such a diagnosis is that none of these potential activities indicates any form of consciousness associated with human life, particularly the ability to feel, to be aware of, or to do, anything. Where such residual activity exists, it will not do so for long due to the rapid breakdown of other bodily functions.  </p>
	  </content>
	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.79in;text-indent:0.00in">Third, there may also be some residual reflex movement of the limbs after such a diagnosis. However, as this movement is independent of the brain and is controlled through the spinal cord, it is neither indicative of the ability to feel, be aware of, or to respond to, any stimulus, nor to sustain respiration or allow other bodily functions to continue. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.79in;text-indent:0.00in">In short, while there are some ways in which parts of the body may continue to show signs of biological activity after a diagnosis of irreversible cessation of brainstem function, these have no moral relevance to the declaration of death for the purpose of the immediate withdrawal of all forms of supportive therapy. It is for this reason that patients with such activity can no longer benefit from supportive treatment and legal certification of their death is appropriate.” </p>

This is because, as a result of developments in modern medical technology, doctors no longer associate death exclusively with breathing and heartbeat, but it has come to be accepted that death occurs when the brain, and in particular the brain stem, has been destroyed. …There has been no dispute on this point in the present case, and it is unnecessary for me to consider it further. The evidence is that Anthony’s brain stem is still alive and functioning and it follows that, in the present state of medical science, he is still alive and should be so regarded as a matter of law.” And, finally, by Lord Browne-Wilkinson (page 878E): </p>

In medicine, the cessation of breathing or of heartbeat is no longer death. By the use of a ventilator, lungs which in the unaided course of nature would have stopped breathing can be made to breath, thereby sustaining the heartbeat. Those, like Anthony Bland, who would previously have died through inability to swallow food can be kept alive by artificial feeding. This has led the medical profession to redefine death in terms of brain stem death, i.e., then death of that part of the brain without which the body cannot function at all without assistance. In some cases it is now apparently possible, with the use of the ventilator, to sustain a beating heart even though the brain stem, and therefore in medical terms the patient, is dead; “the ventilated corpse”.” </p>

There are studies that demonstrate that you can have electrical activity in some areas of the brain after brain stem death is established. The key point, he said, is that no patient has ever regained consciousness or awareness following brain stem death. Dr Playfor went on to explain the reason for that in language which I found to be simple and accessible. The nerves which generate the breathing mechanism and maintain the integrity of the heartrate are all connected to the brain stem. In simple terms, when the brain stem dies, it is impossible for a patient to breath unassisted.” </p>

In my view this argument is wrong for a number of reasons. Firstly, the parents were aware that the tests were going to be carried out probably that day, as is shown by the transcript of the conversation with Dr E, and the Father did ultimately accept this. The transcript does not suggest that the Father or Mother said the tests should not go ahead. Further, the parents were fully informed as to the purpose of the tests, so in my view the issue about “informed” consent goes nowhere on the facts of the case.  Secondly, I do not think there is any requirement for written consent from the parents, or for the information to be written down. There is no such requirement in the Code. <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Glass</span> is dealing with a very different situation, where the issue was the withdrawal of certain treatment. It is not clear to me that consent would necessarily have to be given for a test at all. But, I do not have to decide that issue because the parents undoubtedly knew that the test was to be carried out, and knew what the test was about. Therefore they were given the appropriate information, and on the facts of the case their consent can be inferred from their conduct. Thirdly, and in any event, even if the tests should not have taken place because of lack of consent that does not mean that the outputs of the test would not be admissible before me. I am being asked to decide a factual question as to whether Midrar is dead, and lack of consent would not vitiate the evidence that goes to that issue.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly Lord Brennan submits that, for that approach to be both responsible and reasonable, regard should be had to the medical practice in relation to brain stem injury and death in other countries.  In seeking to make good that submission, the court was taken to detail relating to the approach adopted in the USA which differs from the UK 2008 Code in at least two significant respects.  Firstly, rather than relying on a diagnosis of brain stem death, in America clinicians are required to identify the death of the “whole brain”.  Secondly, the authoritative document in the USA on this issue, mirroring the status of the 2008 Code in the UK, is a White Paper by the President’s Council on Bioethics “Controversies in the determination of death” published in December 2008.  As well as advocating diagnosis by “whole brain death”, rather than brain stem death, the White Paper requires the administration of “confirmatory tests” which “go beyond the bedside checks for apnoea and brain stem reflexes” represented by the UK DNC Code.  Lord Brennan has assisted the court by referring to various articles in the medical literature and we have been provided with a copy of the 2008 US White Paper. </p>

Firstly, in relation to additional tests that might have been undertaken over and above the bedside DNC assessment required by the 2008 Code, Lord Brennan referred to Appendix C of the Code which lists some nine additional tests.  In the present case Midrar had in fact undergone two MRI scans and an EEG and Lord Brennan submitted that if the doctors thought it was alright to undertake an MRI, why was it not reasonable </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly, Lord Brennan submitted that the DNC test for apnoea was seen as controversial in the medical literature and it was therefore necessary to determine the degree of brain tissue perfusion by administering one or more of the three relevant mechanical tests listed in Appendix 3 of the Code.  Lord Brennan asked, rhetorically, “why not?” undertake these tests for brain perfusion. </p>

In addition, for the benefit of the parents, a second opinion was sought by Dr Y who, while he did not conduct her own specific DNC tests, confirmed the validity of those undertaken in early October.  Finally, at the parents’ express request, a third DNC test was undertaken in their presence on 4 November. The parents plainly consented to these further tests. In the circumstances, I would, therefore, refuse permission to appeal on Ground 2. </p>

Whilst Mr Davy firmly argues against that approach, he invited the court to consider the position if a best interests analysis was required.  In circumstances where the clinical diagnosis of brain stem death is not challenged by any of the grounds of appeal, and where the child has irreversibly lost consciousness and irreversibly lost the capacity to breathe, there could only be one outcome to any best interests assessment.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">Firstly, as a matter of law, it is the case that brain stem death is established as the legal criteria in the United Kingdom by the House of Lord’s decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Bland</span>.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">Secondly, as, I think, Lord Brennan accepted, it is, in reality, impossible for this court now to embark upon an assessment of whether a different test, namely that adopted in the USA, should replace the long established UK criteria represented, in modern times, by the 2008 Code and the 2015 guidance. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">Thirdly, for the reasons given by Mr Davy, tragically the medical evidence demonstrates that this is not a case in which such difference as there is between “brain stem death” and “whole brain death” is relevant.  It is not necessary to repeat the graphic descriptions of Dr G and Professor Wilkinson that have been given on the basis of the November MRI scan and the January EEG.  The position is that, awfully, Midrar’s body no longer has a brain that is recognisable as such. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">Fourthly, there is no basis for contemplating that any further tests would result in a different outcome.  The 2008 Code is plain that, medically, no further tests are normally required.  In this case, further tests have, indeed, been undertaken and they not only confirm the DNC diagnosis but, as I have described, they take matters further by providing clarity as to the disintegration of the brain tissue. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">Fifthly, the factual and medical evidence before the judge was more than sufficient to justify her findings.  Indeed, no other conclusion was open to Lieven J on that evidence.  Even if there had been room for doubt, that must surely now have been removed following Professor Wilkinson’s intervention on 30 January.  Given his great expertise on this particular issue and his role as an expert instructed by the parents for the purpose of considering a potential appeal, his opinion, which is 100% on all fours with that of each of the other doctors and with the conclusion of the judge, must remove any basis upon which the diagnosis of death can be challenged. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">Lastly, the judge said at [32] that “If a patient is brain stem dead then there are no best interests to consider. Once those criteria are met the patient has irreversibly lost whatever one might define as life…” I agree. Once a court is satisfied on the balance of probabilities that, on the proper application of the 2008 Code (and where appropriate the 2015 Guidance), there has been brain stem death there is no basis for a best interests analysis, nor is one appropriate. The court is not saying that it is in the best interests for the child to die but, rather that the child it already dead. The appropriate declaration is that the patient died at a particular time and on a particular date without more.  </p>

The manner in which social media may now be deployed to name and pillory an individual is well established and the experience of the clinicians treating child patients in cases which achieve publicity, such as those of Charlie Gard and Alfie Evans, demonstrate the highly adverse impact becoming the focus of a media storm may have on treating clinicians. The need for openness and transparency in these difficult, important and, often, controversial cases is critical but can, in the judgment of the court, be more than adequately met through the court’s judgments without the need for identifying those who have cared for Midrar with devotion since September 2019. </p>

But the judge was entitled to be satisfied that there was a basis for this application being made in this particular case.

The court has now been given a detailed explanation for this passage of time.  It is in part due to the Trust taking a number of steps, one after the other, aimed at engaging with the parents and achieving their consent, in order to avoid the need for court proceedings.  Once the proceedings were issued, MacDonald J gave directions by email within twenty-four hours.  He expressly took the view that this case should not come on for hearing urgently.  In contrast to <span style="font-style:italic">Re A</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Oxfordshire NHS Trust v AB</span>, where the parents were unrepresented in each of those two cases, MacDonald J gave time for an application for legal aid to be made, for the child to be joined, for Cafcass to become involved and, should they wish, for the parents to identify and seek leave to instruct an expert.  Thereafter, the case was set down for hearing on the first available date following the Christmas vacation before Lieven J.  It was heard in the North West in order to limit, at least to a degree, the practical difficulties for the parents. </p>
