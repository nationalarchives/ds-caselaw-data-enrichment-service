There were four allegations of contempt, and the Judge found three of them (Counts 1, 3 and 4) proved.  She sentenced Mr Moore as follows: on Count 1, no order; on Count 3, eight weeks’ imprisonment; and on Count 4, four weeks’ imprisonment to run concurrently, making a total of eight weeks, suspended for one year on condition that Mr Moore file and serve a witness statement by 27 September 2020 answering various questions concerning his financial position.  Mr Moore appeals as of right and does not need permission.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.41in;margin-right:0.03in">2.<span style="font-family:Arial"> </span>There is a long history to the litigation which it is not necessary to recount in any detail.  In summary, the Claimants are a firm of solicitors who were retained by Mr Moore in January 2018 in relation to proceedings brought against him by his ex-partner seeking an order for sale of a property which they jointly owned.  The Claimants proposed that payment of their costs should be deferred to the end of the matter on the basis that they would be paid out of Mr Moore’s share of the proceeds of sale.  An order for sale was made by consent in July 2018, and the property was ultimately sold in early 2019, sale being completed on or about 1 February 2019.  Mr Moore received his share of the proceeds of sale, which we were told amounted to some £79,000-odd, but did not pay the Claimants, who claimed to be owed the sum of £13,862 for work done.  That led to the Claimants bringing the proceedings against Mr Moore for recovery of £13,862.  They obtained a freezing order from HHJ Simpkiss in that sum on 21 February 2019, initially on a without notice basis and continued at the return date on 27 February 2019, and a number of further orders including orders for costs in their favour.  Then on 20 April 2019 judgment was entered in default against Mr Moore for £14,752.  Mr Moore applied to set aside the default judgment, but that was dismissed by Deputy District Judge Ashley in July 2019.  Further costs orders have been made </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.42in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.00in">since.  Mr Moore had paid £13,862 into court, and that has been paid over to the Claimants, but there remain due to the Claimants various sums under costs orders which had been made.  The precise sum does not matter for present purposes but is put by the Claimants at over £16,000.  In January 2020 the Claimants applied to the Court for the oral examination of Mr Moore as a judgment debtor.   </p>

Various details of that are given and that has been further elaborated in other documents which Mr Moore has provided us with during the course of the hearing.  What it comes to is that Mr Moore complains that the Claimants have not provided proper disclosure.  There is in my judgment nothing in this complaint.  It is very doubtful if the Claimants ever came under any disclosure obligations in these proceedings, as they obtained judgment in default and usually that would take place before any obligation to disclose had arisen.  But even if they had been, it would make no difference to Mr Moore’s liability for contempt.   </p>

Disclosure is not usually likely to be relevant to the issues whether the respondent knew of the order, whether he has complied with the order and whether he knew of the facts that made his conduct a breach of the order, and there is no general obligation of disclosure in a committal application.  Rather, the obligation on the applicant is to serve the evidence which he relies on in support of the application, and that is also dealt with in CPR r 81.10, in this case in r 81.10(3)(b), which at the relevant time provided that the application notice must: </p>

I should make it clear that the Claimants naturally do not accept this, but even if it were the case, again it does not in my judgment affect the liability of Mr Moore for committal.

The uncompromising nature of this obligation is shown by the fact that it extends even to cases where the person affected by an order believes it to be irregular or even void. ‘A party who knows of an order, whether null and void, regular or irregular, cannot be permitted to disobey it. ... It would be most dangerous to hold that the suitors, or their solicitors, could themselves judge whether an order was null and void – whether it was regular or irregular. That they should come to the court and not take upon themselves to determine such a question. That the course of a party knowing of an order, which was null and irregular, and who might be affected by it, was plain. He should apply to the court that it might be discharged. As long as it existed it must not be disobeyed.’  Such being the nature of this obligation, two consequences will, in general, follow from its breach.

I may add that of course, as the background shows, Mr Moore did apply to set aside the judgment which the Claimants had obtained against him and that application was unsuccessful and indeed, as a result of that unsuccessful application, a limited civil restraint order was, we are told, made against Mr Moore, although we have not seen its terms.</p>

Mr Moore says that Tuckers (his solicitors) said that they were not paid by legal aid to raise civil issues, even though they realised and were warned that the Respondents were misleading the court, and that a solicitor should be ready to raise matters when it comes to solicitors misleading the Court rather than just saying they cannot deal with it because they are not being paid to raise those issues.  This, if anything, seems to me to be a complaint against Tuckers, but I will say at once that it does not surprise me that solicitors acting on legal aid in a committal application (for which legal aid, which is criminal legal aid, is available) should decline to deal with other aspects of civil litigation for which legal aid is not available and which they would not usually be instructed on.  But in any event, again, it does not affect the question, which was the question before HHJ Brown and is the question before us, whether Mr Moore did or did not commit the contempts with which he was charged.   </p>

That is not something which is accepted by the Respondents, and we, as I have said, have not seen evidence of any settlement.  But in any event, on Mr Moore’s own account, all that he says it did was to discharge the orders up to February 2020.  I </p>

I will assume he might be right that there were deficiencies in compliance with that order, but I do not see that that explains or excuses or takes away from the fact of Mr Moore’s own failure to comply with the orders listed under Count 4 and in particular the Order of 12 March 2020.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.42in;margin-right:0.03in">Going back to his skeleton argument, the next head relied on by Mr Moore is CPR Part 81.  Here he says that to be convicted of contempt of court, the conduct must be a voluntary act.  He says that his conduct was not voluntary: this all happened because there were so many things wrong all the way through to the lead up to the hearing of 27 August 2020 and that it was an unfortunate circumstance that the very dominant behaviour of the Respondents misled everyone and created complete breaches of the Rules.  No breaches of the Rules are here specifically identified, and in any event the clear finding of HHJ Brown was that the failure of Mr Moore to comply with the various orders was in each case deliberate.  That is sufficient to amount to voluntary conduct within the meaning of the authorities.  We have not been shown anything to suggest she was wrong to reach that conclusion.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.42in;margin-right:0.03in">So far as the point on duplicity is concerned, Mr Snow, who appeared for the Respondents to the appeal, put forward as his primary submission that there was in fact no failure to comply with CPR r 81.10(3)(a) because the conduct alleged was all the same conduct, namely the failure to provide the relevant documentation.  I have already indicated that I have difficulty accepting that.  It is well established that a mandatory order which requires a person to do something by a particular date is broken once and for all when they fail to do it on or by that date: see <span style="font-style:italic">re Jones </span>[2013] EWHC 2579 (Ch) at [20]-[23] per Sir James Munby P, and my own judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Kea Investments Ltd v Watson </span>[2020] EWHC 2599 (Ch) at [71]-[73].  That means that the three orders, as I referred to earlier, did contain different obligations, each requiring Mr Moore to provide the documents on different occasions, and there were in my judgment three separate acts of contempt, and they should have been charged as three separate acts, although it may be noted that the failure to comply with paragraph 2 of the first order, that of 27 January 2020, had already in effect been charged as Count 1 and should not in my view have been charged again.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.42in;margin-right:0.03in">The question is what we should do in those circumstances.

That does not seem to me to be unfair or to cause any prejudice or difficulty to Mr Moore, specifically for two reasons.  Firstly, although all three orders are recited, the allegation is that he had failed to comply with them by failing to provide the documentation by 4 pm on 26 March 2020, that is a breach of the third order; and secondly, because of the way in which HHJ Brown dealt with this in her judgment at paragraph 28, where she said: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.42in;margin-right:0.03in">I agree with the judgment of Nugee LJ and simply add a few observations of my own.  This case has been listed to come on for a hearing in this court for some time.  In the preceding week, Mr Moore has submitted a number of written requests and applications seeking a stay or an adjournment or a ground rules hearing and things like that, all of which requests were declined by this court.  Today Mr Moore, appearing in person, has further sought a stay, which this court refused.  One reason which he advanced for needing a stay was, as he said, that he had not a chance to digest all the relevant documentation and, what is more, there was much more documentation to be obtained.  That is completely by the way.  This appeal hearing is not designed to be an opportunity for Mr Moore to reargue his case all over again.  The position is to be assessed as it was before Judge Brown.  Indeed, Mr Moore’s requests for documentation underline how flawed his whole approach is.  He clearly bitterly resents the conduct of the claimant firm.  He has taken the view that they were negligent or misconducted themselves in the original transactions on which he had instructed them, and he has taken the view, it seems, that they have been evasive, lacking integrity, lying to the court and so on in the proceedings to recover the debt due to them and in the proceedings thereafter.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.42in;margin-right:0.03in">But that, as my Lord has pointed out, is nothing to the point.  The point is that orders of the court were made.  It is not for Mr Moore then to refuse to comply with them simply because he does not himself agree with those orders.  Those orders having been made, and they have never been successfully appealed, he has to comply with them.  As Judge Brown found on the evidence, applying the criminal standard, she was sure that he had deliberately not complied with them.  That answers virtually all the criticisms which Mr Moore now seeks to pursue, which in truth are irrelevant to what really matters now.  Mr Moore ought clearly to understand his position.  He must comply with those orders.  It is no good him saying that he does not agree with those orders.  If he does not comply with those orders, and if he continues to maintain his current stance, not only will he continue to incur further costs liabilities but in addition he may find that the suspended sentence is activated and he may go to prison.  He should be very careful to avoid such a consequence. Therefore he should even now comply with what he is required to do under the relevant orders.   </p>
