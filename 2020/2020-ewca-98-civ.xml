The CJEU held that she was not required to do this and that the United Kingdom was not entitled to impose such a requirement as a general measure under Article 35 of the Directive, without regard to the circumstances of the individual family member, because of a concern about widespread abuse by those wishing enter this country, for example sham marriages. </p>

There is nothing in the decision to suggest that a family member whose residence in another member state is not “genuine” has a right to enter or reside in the Union citizen’s home state merely because of possession of a residence permit and [60] of the judgment is inconsistent with any such suggestion. </p>

Undoubtedly it conferred some rights, for example (subject to any question of abuse) a right to reside with Mr Singh in Bulgaria while he was exercising Treaty rights there. But it did not confer on them a right to reside in the United Kingdom, Mr Singh’s home state, because (as I have explained) Articles 6 and 7 do not confer any such right.
