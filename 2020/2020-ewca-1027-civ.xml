In 2018, their mother started to live together with Mr B, who had the care of two children of his own and one stepchild.  One of Mr B’s children is T, a girl aged 8.  On 4 November 2019, she went to school with significant bruising and other marks to her face and body.  The explanation for the injuries is disputed.  The local authority alleges that they were caused by the mother or by Mr B.  They deny this and say that the injuries were inflicted by T herself. </p>

The court started to hear live evidence that day, the previous week having been taken up with the question of whether T should give evidence.  Between the Monday and Wednesday, evidence was given by T’s foster carer, the paediatric expert, another doctor and a schoolteacher.   Evidence in chief was given by Mr B.  The evidence yet to be heard was the cross-examination of Mr B, evidence from a police officer and the evidence of the mother.  Unfortunately, the transcripts were not provided as promised due to an error on the part of the local authority.  They were considered to be essential and on the Wednesday the judge granted an application by the local authority for an adjournment.  The court and the parties were understandably extremely concerned about the delay that this would cause.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">On Thursday, 16 July, an application was made on behalf of the mother for the discharge of the interim care orders to allow the children to return home.  It was said that there were no welfare concerns about these children and that the evidence was that they had been well cared for.  It was argued that continued placement in foster care was not appropriate.  The application was opposed by the local authority, Mr S, and the Children’s Guardian.  Mr B was neutral. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The judge gave an ex tempore judgement in which he granted the mother’s application.  He noted that the proceedings were supposed to be concluded within 26 weeks and that this would have been expected when the interim care orders were made.  The hearing had already been put back from April and now it was being put back even further, with the earliest possible date for resumption being November.  He said that even if the mother was found to be responsible for T’s injuries, the consequence would not necessarily be that E and S could not return to her care.  He noted that the evidence had not changed significantly since the original order was made.  The question was whether the threshold under s. 38 Children Act 1989 was still met and whether continued separation was necessary and proportionate.  He recorded that the local authority and the Guardian opposed the mother’s application, the Guardian arguing that the test for removal had been met before and that the passage of time had not diminished the risk to the children.  The judge remarked: </p>

If at the initial ICO, it had been known that to obtain a decision in relation to the facts alone would take so long, I wonder whether the decision would have been the same but that decision is the background to this matter. At the time that decision was made, anticipation of the court was that the case would be concluded within 26 weeks. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The grounds of appeal, in summary, are that the judge's decision to discharge the interim care orders was premature when the fact-finding process was incomplete and there had been no parenting assessments.  He did not consider the gravity of the allegations.  He could not and did not balance the risks.  The hypothetical question of whether removal would have been sanctioned if the length of separation had been known at the outset, was the wrong question.  Ms Savage notes that the judge did not have any evidence that the children were suffering harm in foster care.  She submits that delay had no impact on the assessment of risk and that there had been no new evidence or change of circumstances to alter the risk assessment.  She submits that the judge fell into the error identified by Davis LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Re O (A Child: Interim Care Order)</span> [2019] EWCA Civ 583 at [26]:  </p>

Indeed, he probably was in no position to do so on the state of the evidence before him. The judge also does not explain precisely what the harm was that O was suffering whilst in foster care and being apart from his mother.  Indeed,  he was again not really in a position to do so on the state of the evidence before him; and in fact his view departed from the view, on the face of it perfectly reasonably held, by the guardian and the local authority.”    </p>

The judge was not in a position to balance the risks.  Further, the judge was wrong to say that E and S have come to no harm in their mother’s care, as the issue of emotional harm from witnessing T’s alleged treatment remains undecided. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.75in;margin-right:0.00in">There is no doubt that the court has the power to review the continuation of interim measures that it has put in place and that it may decide to exercise that power where the balance of the evidence significantly changes during the proceedings.  This may lead to the removal of children previously at home or the return of children previously in foster care.  If the court considers it appropriate to revisit its previous decision, the essential question is likely to be whether the further information changes its original assessment of risk.  Delay in making a decision is presumed to be detrimental to children but where children have been removed from home for their own protection it is not on its own likely to affect the risk assessment.  </p>

The children had rightly been placed in foster care and there had been no significant change in the evidence.  The judge was not in a position to assess the risk of returning the children to their mother and he did not in fact attempt to do so.  He no doubt considered the factors set out in Ms Wilson’s list, but he was not yet in a position to assess their weight or to balance them without an understanding of how T’s injuries had come about.   </p>
