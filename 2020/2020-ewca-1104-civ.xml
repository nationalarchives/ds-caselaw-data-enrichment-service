	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The Loveridge family own and operate a very successful caravan park business in Worcestershire, Warwickshire and Shropshire.  They do so in part through five companies and in part through three oral partnerships at will.  The appellants, referred to for convenience of identification as “Ivy” and “Alldey”, started the business, but the next generation, including the respondent “Michael” and his brother “Audey” became involved in the business over time.  Regrettably, from May 2019 onwards, irreconcilable differences have arisen within the family between Michael on the one hand and Ivy, Alldey and Audey on the other.  So much so that the judge, HHJ McCahill QC, sitting in the Business and Property Courts in Birmingham, found that it was “now utterly impossible for both sides to work together for the common good of the businesses”. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">This appeal arises out of interim orders made by the judge in two sets of proceedings.  The first in time (“the partnership proceedings”) related to the winding up of the three partnerships.  The second in time (“the company proceedings”) related to the five family companies.  In the company proceedings Michael sought orders under sections 994 and 996 of the Companies Act 2006 (unfair prejudice) and for the winding up of the company on the just and equitable ground (section 122(g) of the Insolvency Act 1986).  In the broadest possible outline, the judge made orders until trial in the partnership and company proceedings designed to place Michael in sole charge of all the partnerships and all the companies, and restraining any interference in the businesses of those legal entities from Ivy, Alldey and Audey.   </p>

The reason for the suspension of the order was to enable the parties to agree the necessary undertakings and cross undertakings to be included in the replacement order. </p>

Steps were subsequently taken to call a meeting of the company to remove Cognitor as accountants of Kingsford and Sales, and to replace them with a new firm, Haines &amp; Watts.  In the result the meeting was restrained by a without-notice order made by HHJ Barker QC, and continued by the judge’s order below.

Michael says that he ran the partnerships and the companies on a day to day basis.  He downplays the role of his parents and Audey.

There is a dispute as to the manner in which the opportunity to purchase this site arose, and in particular whether it was an opportunity belonging to the partnership, which Michael would not be free to exploit in his own name.  The purchase price was £3.15 million.  According to paragraph 50 of Michael’s Petition, “Ivy was particularly vocal in her opposition to the purchase in [Michael’s] own name”.  To fund the purchase, Michael decided to withdraw £1.25 million from the account of Sales to which he had access.  These sums were removed in December 2019 and January 2020 in two separate tranches of £650,000 and £600,000.  Michael claims that he did so because Ivy had refused to release to him funds from the partnerships to which he was entitled.  He says that he intended that the sums taken from Sales would be properly accounted for in due course, and that he notified Mr Warman of what he was doing. He relies on the fact that, according to him, other members of the family had in the past withdrawn money from the accounts, and duly accounted for them in year-end reconciliations. </p>

He made no mention of his subsequent decision to use funds withdrawn from Sales to finance his purchase of Weir Meadow.  In paragraphs 10 and 11 of his second witness statement in the partnership proceedings, in response to Ivy’s accusation that he had misappropriated these funds, he said that he had withdrawn the money because Ivy was denying him access to capital to effect the purchase.  He stated further that he believed that Ivy was trying to prevent the purchase out of resentment and spite. In consequence he had withdrawn the money from Sales. A similar account was given by Michael in his witness statement in the company proceedings, at paragraph 15, adding that the withdrawal had been notified to Sales’ accountant, Mr Warman.  </p>

First, it is said (at paragraph 14) that Ivy and Michael learned of the Weir Meadow opportunity at or about the same time.  It is alleged that, originally, Weir Meadow was to be purchased by a corporate vehicle to be owned 50% each by Michael and Ivy, and that a company, MLIL Limited had been incorporated for that purpose in early 2019. At the time, Ivy and other members of the family had been interested in the purchase of a </p>

It is said that it was then agreed that in order to leave more partnership funds available for any such purchase, Michael would buy Weir Meadow on his own.  Ivy then transferred her 50% interest in MLIL to Michael but remained a director. She then made it clear that she wanted no part of Weir Meadow, and tried to stop Michael buying it by refusing him access to funds in the partnership.  On any view, therefore, the purchase of Weir Meadow in Michael’s own name was something which Ivy strongly opposed. </p>

No notice was served on Lesa who was a partner in Oversley Mill.  If Michael was a partner of Oversley Mill, however, the commencement of the partnership action by claim form dated 19 March 2020 would have been an effective notice.  Michael made a without notice application for injunctive relief which came before the judge on 20 March.  The application was supported by a witness statement from Michael, and by witness statements from the two wardens at Redstone, namely Richard Waite and Linda Brierley.  These witnesses said that they predominantly dealt with Michael in their roles at Redstone, and recounted incidents at that site which they attributed to the conflict within the family.  There was also video footage of lively encounters between the family members, which the judge examined, which showed Ivy and members of her faction in a bad light. </p>

A part of the argument heard on that day concerned the non-disclosure of the removal of the £1.25 million from Sales. There was also argument about whether the injunctions should be maintained.  The judge gave an oral judgment on 7 April 2020, of which we have only an unapproved note prepared by the appellants’ solicitors.  The judge held that the non-disclosure of the removal of the £1.25 million from Sales was material, not only because it was a large amount, but also because Michael had made allegations against his parents and Audey in his witness statement amounting to accusations that they had themselves used partnership money without his consent.  Nevertheless, he rejected the argument based on material non-disclosure because “it was merely a different facet of the same conflict”.   Had the matter been disclosed it would not have affected his overall assessment of the case.  He mentioned the video evidence in particular as explaining why Michael was not being allowed access to funds by Ivy. </p>

Accordingly, the question for him was “which of the two factions had to have sole control”.   He recognised that Ivy and Alldey had created the business and had nurtured it into a thriving business.  The business they had created before Michael’s involvement was however a different order of business from where it was now.  He considered it necessary to decide “who was the driving force behind this business and growth”, because if he did not decide that question, “there is a real risk that I could put the wrong party in control and damage the business more than allowing them to run it together”.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.00in">“28. The Petition is based upon the attempts by Ivy and Alldey to appoint new accountants and to remove Michael as a director, the service of the statutory demand on Michael by [Sales] in respect of the £1.25m he withdrew and upon an alleged failure by Ivy to provide cheques to pay outstanding corporation tax liabilities of £198,551.14 in relation to [Sales] and £153,467.37 in respect of Kingsford, despite requests to do so by Michael’s solicitors and Cognitor. It is alleged that this failure has exposed those companies to the risk of a fine or potentially of being struck off. Ivy’s case is that she is willing to issue cheques for those tax bills, but first wants Haines Watts to check them. Those sums said to be owed by way of Corporation Tax to HMRC feature specifically in the draft accounts (dated February 2020) of Bewdley Sales and Kingsford to 31 July 2019.  </p>

The corollary of that freedom is, however, absent some agreement or understanding to the contrary, that they accept the legal principles which the law applies to the entities which they have chosen.  In deciding a dispute of this nature it is necessary, therefore, to consider separately the partnerships at will and the companies, and to distinguish further between the individual partnerships and the individual companies insofar as there are relevant differences between them.

The way forward for these partnerships is therefore relatively clear, and the interim remedy must be tailored in the light of that fact.  In the case of Oversley Mill and of the companies, in contrast, one must have in mind the range of possible outcomes of the litigation, and tailor the interim relief with the likely outcomes in mind. </p>

In those circumstances it had not been open to the judge to hold, as he had done at paragraph 75 of his judgment, that the family members operated on the assumption and expectation, shared and relied on by Michael, that he was and would remain in charge of operations, and exercise sole management and control.    </p>

I am, however, entirely unpersuaded that the petition or evidence did support the existence of such a constraint.  First, it is to be noted, as Lewison LJ pointed out in the course of argument, that the equitable constraint is said to arise from the history and the circumstances set out in the petition.  We asked Mr Stockill to identify the paragraphs of the petition on which the equitable constraint was founded.  He pointed us to paragraphs 43 to 49.  These paragraphs recite the history of the development of the business.

Further, Michael ran the companies on a day to day basis, including the organising, maintenance and servicing of the sites, liaising with staff, employees and contractors and arranging for the collection of rents.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">All this is of course the subject of challenge.  What matters for present purposes is whether, taking these allegations at their highest, they are capable of supporting the existence of the right to continue to carry on these functions if a company, acting through its constitutional rules, wishes to change those arrangements.  Mr Stockill accepted that there was no express agreement or understanding that Michael would have that right, but submitted that such an understanding was to be inferred.  In my judgment, no such agreement or understanding or any form of equitable restraint can properly be inferred from these facts.  It is not the law that progressive and energetic managers, however well they perform their duties to the benefit of the company, acquire entrenched rights not to be removed from their positions if the constitution of the company permits their removal.  Such a principle would act as a significant but unjustified restriction on countless companies with dynamic executives from operating their companies in accordance with their constitutions. </p>

I agree that the fact that an individual has had such a role is not a sufficient indication that he is entitled to maintain it in the face of constitutional rules which permit it to be terminated. </p>

As I have said, a petitioner under section 994 must show that there is something in the conduct of the affairs of the company which is prejudicial to the interests of the petitioner as a shareholder, and that the prejudice is unfair.  Apart from the attempts (in one case successful) to change the accountants, in the case of three of the companies concerned, Breton Park, Quatford and Riverside, Stourport there is no allegation at all of anything done by the majority which consists of the conduct of the affairs of the company.   </p>

Given that a company may, by a decision taken in accordance with its constitution, change its accountants without justification, I cannot see how the decision in the present case unfairly prejudices Michael’s interests as a shareholder, even if the decision was taken for the reason given by the judge.  I cannot refrain from observing, however, that it would be surprising if Ivy did not feel she had ample justification for changing accountants when Mr Warman had not notified her of the removal from Sales of the £1.25 million to fund a personal transaction by Michael which she vigorously opposed.  </p>

Taking that course was, however, was frustrated by the grant of the injunction.  She has made it clear that she has never had any intention of preventing these payments from being made, and it is impossible to see why she would.

It is no answer, therefore, for Michael to say that there was a culture of abstracting moneys from companies and partnerships without prior authorisation. He needs to establish that the culture extended to abstracting moneys in direct contravention of the wishes of his fellow shareholders and board members.  I regard that hurdle as insuperable.</p>

The proposition that his removal as director could possibly amount to <span style="font-style:italic">unfairly</span> prejudicial conduct is therefore, in my judgment, unarguable. I would add that I find it difficult to understand how a shareholder can be prejudiced by the action of its board in seeking to restore its assets after a misappropriation.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The judge went further and held that the presentation of the statutory demand should be restrained, largely because of Michael’s importance to the business and the consequences of a possible bankruptcy.  The judge said (see paragraph 117 quoted in paragraph 32 above) that it was not in Sales' interest to pursue the statutory demand. But the court's view of what is in the company's best interests is irrelevant unless the directors are acting in bad faith; and he could not make such a finding on an interim application.  He considered that he was in as good a position as any other judge to consider the setting aside of the demand.  In the light of Michael’s clear breach of fiduciary duty, which the judge failed to find, I would leave any question of restraining the taking of steps on, or setting aside the statutory demand to any application which Michael may choose to make to that end at first instance. </p>

He submitted that, whichever way the petition was decided the overwhelming likelihood was that the majority would remain in control of these companies.

The company’s business was that of a specialist tour operator in Finland for customers from the British Isles. Mr Collins was in charge of the operations in Finland, operating through Finnish companies as subsidiaries, whilst his wife managed the business from its headquarters in England. Prior to the falling out they were both directors with an accountant as a third director.  The couple fell out, and Mrs Collins secured a majority on the Board by making new appointments and by the resignation of the accountant.  Mrs Collins then proposed resolutions to remove Mr Collins from the boards of the Finnish subsidiaries and appoint herself and her daughter instead. Mr Collins sought to restrain these meetings by interim injunction.  Briggs J, as he then was, considered a range of possible interim regimes before concluding at [29] to [30]: </p>

Either Mrs Collins succeeds on the petition in which case she will resume, if injuncted in the meantime, or otherwise continue, undisputed majority shareholder control of the companies and their businesses, or Mr Collins wins, but with the prospect of obtaining most likely a remedy not of being kept indefinitely in control of the Finnish business, but of being given proper compensation.  In other words, whichever way the matter were to turn out in the Companies Court, the overwhelming likelihood is that Mr Collins would not be left in control of any part of the business, whether that of the company itself or its subsidiaries.  It follows that if that is the overwhelmingly probable final outcome whether Mr Collins succeeds or fails on his petition, an interim regime designed to prolong the opposite state of affairs namely that he does remain in control of the business, is on the face of it not a very attractive one.” </p>

The distinction which the judge is making is therefore a theoretically valid one.  Where I part company with the judge is how, on the evidence before him, he could conclude that a business of this nature, in which Ivy and Alldey had been involved for many decades, could be so seriously damaged by their retaining control of it, as to justify the conclusion that Michael could not be compensated properly in damages for any loss in value of his shares. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Oversley Mill is run, on a day to day basis by Lesa.  Michael makes no complaints about the conduct of Lesa in his pleadings or in his evidence.  Michael has at most a 25% interest in the Oversley Mill partnership, if indeed he is a partner at all.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Ashworth submitted that the judge had failed to have regard (both in the case of this partnership and Riverside and Redstone) to the principle of majority rule.  He submitted that absent exceptional circumstances, and if the court is not going to appoint a receiver or manager, an order which placed a minority partner in charge of a business pending its winding up was wrong in principle.  The reason for such a principle would be that the majority partners, by definition, have the most to lose from mismanagement of the partnership.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I cannot accept that submission in its full breadth.  Nevertheless, there is force in what Mr Ashworth says is the underlying rationale.  For the reasons he gives, the court needs to take account, in fashioning an interim remedy, of where the majority share in the partnership lies.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Ashworth goes on to submit that the judge was wrong to create a requirement for unitary control which he extended not only to the partnerships but also to the companies.  I have, of course, come to a different conclusion from the judge as to where interim control of the companies should lie, so the unitary control point, if it is a good one, would assist the majority partners, and not Michael.  However, I think the judge was wrong to start from the assumption that unitary control was a given.  The three partnerships are treated as very separate businesses, arrangements which seem to have worked satisfactorily before the unhappy events of the recent past.    </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Ashworth also focused on the judge’s use of the driving force fallacy (see above) to guide his selection of who should run the partnerships.  As Riverside and Redstone were inevitably to be wound up, there could be no question of their businesses expanding.   In the case of Oversley Mill, there was no evidence that its management pending trial required someone with particular expertise in driving the growth of businesses, and it too would be wound up if Michael establishes his case that he is a partner.  Its business, like the business of the companies, is not complex.  There was no reason to disrupt the <span style="font-style:italic">status quo</span> by taking all control away from Lesa, Ivy and Alldey.  Whilst Michael’s skills as a businessman were not irrelevant, it was wrong in my judgment to single him out as the only person capable of running any individual partnership, based on his historical role in growing the businesses.  His historical role had at most tangential relevance.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Ashworth also submitted that Michael had shown himself to be wholly unsuited to managing a partnership by reason of his breach of fiduciary duty in relation to Sales, which he submitted this court should characterise as dishonest.  I have already explained why I could not decide that Michael’s conduct was dishonest.  It remains material that he had removed a very large sum of money from one of the companies against the express wishes of his fellow directors and shareholders, and displayed a distorted and self-interested approach to the principles of corporate governance, but I do not think it would be fair to say that the judge did not appreciate this.  The upshot is that both sides would appear to have valid criticisms of the general conduct of the other.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I would add that the judge appears to have discounted altogether the potential outcome in which Michael fails to establish that he has an interest in Oversley Mill at all, in which case he would have no say in the future of that partnership.    In those circumstances a regime which places Michael in sole control of Oversley Mill pending the trial of the partnership proceedings would be, to borrow Briggs J’s phrase from <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">re Canterbury Travel Limited</span>, not a very attractive one. This is of course not a case where one can say that that outcome is overwhelmingly likely, but the judge ought to have borne it in mind. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">For all these reasons I think the judge’s approach to the management of Oversley Mill pending trial was flawed. I would therefore set aside his order so far as it related to Oversley Mill.  Looking at the matter afresh, to my mind, of the available options, by far the most attractive is to put Lesa in sole day to day control of the site pending trial of Michael’s claim. </p>

The judge was strongly influenced here by the unitary control approach in placing the same person in charge of all the partnerships and companies and, in selecting that person, relied on the driving force fallacy.  He should have had regard to the separate nature of the two partnerships.   </p>
