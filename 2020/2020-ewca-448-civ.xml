Consequently, it is important in this case.  however, the added incentive of guaranteed confidentiality is not given by the words of the section and cannot be given; </p>

If the contrary were the case, Mr Moloney's submissions might begin to gain traction, but without some indication that the relevant material might incriminate either parent, their counsel's legal argument must fail.

First and foremost, these are decisions taken by a judge in the context of a trial of factual issues with which he/she will have become particularly familiar. This court is most reluctant to interfere with judge’s decisions made in such circumstances. Secondly, they are dealt with, as was this application, at a case management hearing, hearings which often require decisions to be made under considerable pressure of time in relation to a significant number of issues including (for example, in this case a Part 25 FPR application for the instruction of an Independent Social Worker).  It is, therefore, only to be expected that save in exceptional circumstances, the judge’s rulings will be given by way of a short, ex tempore judgment, dealing with the essential issues by brief reference to the relevant law or rules. It follows that in cases involving disclosure to the police, the judges are considerably assisted in that exercise by the Re<span style="font-style:italic"> EC</span> factors now ratified by the President in <span style="font-style:italic">Re M</span>.   </p>

In an ex tempore judgment such as this, it is of particular importance to look at the judgment as a whole in order to see if the judge in fact limited her consideration of confidentiality in the way Mr Miller asserts. In my judgment, she did not.  The judge said (see paragraph [22] above) that on the facts of the case before her, the issue of confidentiality was “more apparent than real”. That was an unsurprising comment given that there had already been considerable disclosure both as provided by the Annex A disclosure and in the detailed analysis identified by the judge in her judgment of the significant inconsistencies in the accounts given by the parents as to just how J came to suffer such terrible head injuries whilst in their care.  </p>

Factor (5) requires consideration of “The public interests in the administration of justice” and observes that “barriers should not be erected between one branch of the judicature and another as this may be inimical to the overall interests of justice”. </p>
