	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The appeal arises from care proceedings about a little boy, T, who was born in July 2019.  At the age of around two weeks he was taken to hospital, where he was found to have bruising to his face and was admitted for tests.  Four days later, on 12 August, there was an incident when the father was seen to be mishandling the baby in a hospital cubicle.  The local authority obtained an emergency protection order and T was placed in foster care in mid-August.  An application for a care order was issued and on 20 August an interim care order was made.  After proceedings that became unfortunately protracted, a seven day remote final hearing took place in April/May 2020 before Ms Clare Ambrose, sitting as a Deputy High Court Judge.  The local authority’s case was that at the relevant date T was suffering and was at risk of suffering physical harm, emotional harm and neglect, the most significant allegation relating to the incident in the hospital.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In a judgment given on 1 May, the judge made detailed findings of fact but she found that those facts did not satisfy the threshold for intervention under s.31 Children Act 1989 (CA 1989) and she dismissed the proceedings.  In a separate judgment given on 7 May, she refused the local authority’s application for a holding interim care order under s.40 CA 1989, with the consequence that T would have had to be returned immediately to his parents unless they agreed to him being accommodated for a transitional period.  She also refused the local authority’s application for permission to appeal and for a stay, with the consequence that an urgent application for a stay was made.  That was granted that evening by Lady Justice King and on 18 May I gave permission to appeal. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The outcome of the appeal is that the proceedings revive on the basis of the substituted threshold findings set out below and the interim care order that was previously in force is restored.  The matter is remitted to the Family Court for a welfare decision and an early case management hearing will take place before the Designated Family Judge on 4 June.    </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Before embarking on the substance of the matter, I note that the state of the proceedings up to the point of the hearing was very far from satisfactory.  The original intention had been for there to be a single final hearing, but two 10-day listings had been vacated and the local authority, whose social worker had become ill, had not filed the necessary assessments.  By 1 April, its position was nonetheless that T should not be placed with his parents but with an aunt under a special guardianship order.  It recognised that it was not ready for the welfare stage of the proceedings and the hearing conducted by the judge was therefore limited to fact-finding and determination of the threshold.  These difficulties in the preparations for the hearing were compounded by the need for the hearing to take place remotely during the lockdown.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It is to the credit of the parties and the judge that the hearing was able to be completed, but it need hardly be said that it is troubling that a child who had been taken into care at the age of 3 weeks was still waiting for a decision about his future 9 months later.  The situation was also extremely difficult for the parents, who are on any view vulnerable individuals.  It is clear that T has not been well-served by the proceedings so far, and it is important that every attempt is now made to make up for lost time. </p>

He was removed from the care of his parents due to neglect at age 2 and placed initially in foster care and then with his grandmother and then he moved in with his father aged 16.  Both parents suffer from  anxiety.  The cognitive assessments place the mother in the 45<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> percentile for IQ and the father in the 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> percentile.  Neither parent uses drugs nor abuses alcohol.  This is  credit to them as both have grown up in an environment where there has been  significant abuse of alcohol.  The father’s father has been a chronic alcoholic for many years with very serious drinking habits, and the mother’s mother works as a carer but  has a history of heavy drinking.  </p>

Following the birth the mother had sepsis and both mother and child were put on antibiotics for around five days.  They stayed in hospital until they were discharged on 30 July.  On discharge the parents and T returned to their home, a flat that they had shared as a couple for a year or so with the paternal grandfather.  A health visitor had attempted a visit to the home on 7 August 2019.  She reported that no one was in and the parents reported  that she had called at the wrong flat in the building.  </p>

The parents took T down to their flat at around 6, stayed briefly and then left T with them at around 6.30.  T did not settle, and Mrs G and the mother continued  to exchange messages over the evening until around 1 am when Mrs G said he was too unsettled and the mother went to collect him. At that point the maternal grandmother was present in the parents’ flat as she had come to visit and another  relative had also visited.  </p>

On arrival at the hospital T was seen in triage by Nurse W and was then referred to the paediatric registrar, Dr K.  Nurse W recorded that initially Dr K thought that the bruises on his face were birth marks, but he then agreed they were bruises and admitted the baby to a paediatric ward at around 4am for safeguarding.  He reported seeing blue bruises on the left side of T’s face.    </p>

T was seen by the paediatric consultant Dr M and staff nurse B on the ward round the next morning.  Dr M made a body map and recorded two bruises on T’s check, one that was .5 centimetres by .5 centimetres and another larger bruise marked as a very faint blue bruise that had less demarcation.  Dr M immediately made a plan for T to undergo a skeletal survey, CT scan, and ophthalmology assessment.  These were done later and revealed no injuries.  </p>

PC L and Miss McK, the social worker, visited the parents’ home shortly afterwards on 8 August and also visited the home of neighbours, Mr and Mrs G, who had offered to take the couple and T to stay in their home.  T remained in hospital for tests and was being cared for by his father on the night of 11 August 2019.  At around 5.50am in the morning of 12 August Nurse P, a staff nurse on the night shift on the ward, reported that she had seen the father turn T in a 360 degree turn.  </p>

A further strategy meeting took place at around 11am that day and a DC B attended.  The Local Authority applied for an Emergency Order on 12 August and on 13 August  T was placed with the foster carer. The strategy meeting records show that  following this incident the paediatricians considered that further scans should be avoided but T was examined on 15 August by a consultant ophthalmologist who reported no signs of injury.  </p>

In that interview the father gave an explanation of the turning and denied having thrown the baby up but accepted that he had rotated him but kept him supported throughout.  T was then placed with a foster carer.  The parents moved in with the Gs for a month and then moved in with the maternal grandmother, where they remain.

She reported that at around 5.50am on 12 August she had heard T crying for around five minutes and she was due to give him observations.  At that point she had approached his cubicle and had bent down to observe from the outside through the bottom glass window of the door to the cubicle.  She accepted that it was awkward to lean down but this was what she did sometimes rather than pulling the blind back on the top window of the door. She reported seeing the father flip T into the air causing him to rotate 360 degrees in the air before the father then caught him.  </p>

The father tried settling him with cuddling and cradling him and putting him on his chest and using the dummy with no success.  At that point he was sitting on the bed and he tried to rotate T in a 360 motion as a last resort with the baby’s head supported throughout.

I have looked critically at his opinion as I [am] assessing whether the action caused harm and also the likelihood of harm to T at the time or in the future.

He was obviously influenced by the gentle manner in which the flip was demonstrated and correctly emphasised that the risk of brain injury was directly related to the force used.  Similarly, he suggested that the frequency of the action was relevant.  These are clearly relevant considerations in assessing the likelihood of significant harm.  A situation  where a newborn baby is thrown up vigorously or on repeated occasions represents a very different risk to that arising out of a single occasion where that baby is thrown up  gently by a well intentioned parent, especially where the baby has come out unscathed.

The Local Authority relied on Dr Rahman’s evidence to suggest that T was at risk of significant physical harm from this manoeuvre even if it was a  gentle one.  Dr Rahman suggested that this manoeuvre was not an ideal thing to do and was risky, presenting similar risks to the flip but noted it was done gently.  </p>

The judge considered the concerns of the local authority to be legitimate and noted Dr Rahman’s advice about the great rarity of bruises in non-mobile children.  She stated that bruises on a new-born baby are evidence of physical harm.  The existence of facial bruising on T together with a lack of any explanation for the bruising was troubling and warranted investigation, including consideration of neglect, even if there was no evidence of deliberate or inflicted injury.   </p>

The  bruises could have been sustained accidentally while handling the child.  I conclude that the most probable cause of the bruising was that a parent or the grandfather accidentally bumped into something while holding the child or dropped or knocked something near the baby’s face and this followed Dr Rahman’s evidence.

It is not intended to enable the Court to exercise control over the manner in which the child returns to his parents when a care order is  discharged. It would not be correct use of the power to make directions for a staged  transition of care so as to mitigate risk from an abrupt return, and the Local Authority did not suggest that this would be an appropriate order under section 40.  </p>

Where there is a split hearing, the first limb being for fact-finding and determining threshold, the court should identify the issues for that hearing.  In a case of the present kind, the local authority will normally be required to present its core case in relation to the family history, and, so far as it concerns the threshold, will necessarily focus upon harm or likely harm.  It is therefore to be expected that the court will make its historic findings in the course of that hearing, including but not necessarily limited to issues of past harm or risk of future harm.  Those findings will significantly inform later assessments and decisions.  Importantly, in both the private law and public law spheres the court is required to identify and assess any issues of domestic abuse that may bear upon the welfare of a child or the capacity of a parent.</p>

In my judgement, the judge’s specific findings about the flipping incident at hospital and the previous incident at home, and the unexplained accidental facial bruising in such a young baby, in each case taken in the context of her general findings about the parents’ personal circumstances and the home in which they had been living, lead inexorably to the conclusion that all three of these elements were satisfied.  The father’s bizarre handling of a baby of T’s age plainly gave rise to a real possibility of future harm that could not sensibly be ignored; the harm that might result was not merely significant but serious; the treatment of the child was undoubtedly not what was reasonable for any parent, however inexperienced.

It was not just the incident itself, but the implications for T’s future safety of being in the care of a parent, however well-intentioned, who could even consider such handling to be appropriate, let alone act it out.  Taken together with the unexplained bruising, the inevitable conclusion that the threshold for protective intervention was crossed is reinforced.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Next, instead of looking at the whole picture that her findings painted, the judge treated each individual finding in a compartmentalised manner.  Threshold allegations are separated out for forensic purposes, but there is only one threshold and the court must measure the effect of all of its findings against it.  To take a crude example, the threshold may not be crossed in a case of a parent who has weak parenting skills or in the case of a parent who is an alcoholic, but it may well be crossed where the same parent has both characteristics.  Each piece of information affects the calculation of risk.  This is quite different to the position of findings of primary fact, where unproven facts cannot be aggregated to form proven facts.  As ever, the position has never been better expressed than it was by Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead, who said this in <span style="font-style:italic">Re H and R (Minors) (Child Sexual Abuse: Standard of Proof)</span>  [1996] AC 563: </p>

I must now put this into perspective by noting, and emphasising, the width of the range of facts which may be relevant when the court is considering the threshold conditions. The range of facts which may properly be taken into account is infinite. Facts include the history of members of the family, the state of relationships within a family, proposed changes within the membership of a family, parental attitudes, and omissions which might not reasonably have been expected, just as much as actual physical assaults. They include threats, and abnormal behaviour by a child, and unsatisfactory parental responses to complaints or allegations. And facts, which are minor or even trivial if considered in isolation, when taken together may suffice to satisfy the court of the likelihood of future harm. The court will attach to all the relevant facts the appropriate weight when coming to an overall conclusion on the crucial issue.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Further, the exact nature of the judge’s conclusions regarding the flipping incident and the bruising are not clear.  Although she directed herself clearly at paragraph 121, it is unclear from paragraphs 118-123 whether she found that the harm that might be caused by flipping was not significant, and/or that it was not likely to be repeated, and/or that it was parenting that did not fall below what was reasonably to be expected.  She certainly did not make any finding, express or implied, that supports Ms McGrath QC’s submission to us that the father’s behaviour was “a one-off” so that the prospect of recurrence could sensibly be ignored.  Nor does the reference to Dr Rahman’s evidence give any support to the submission that any harm that might be caused would not be significant.  As to the cause of the bruising, the only statement about that is at paragraph 107, where the judge says: </p>

	</paragraph>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.01in">“I conclude that the most probable cause of the bruising was that a parent or the grandfather accidentally bumped into something while holding the child or dropped or knocked something near the baby’s face and this followed Dr Rahman’s evidence.”   </p>

I reject that and prefer to read it as the judge finding that accidental bumping was more likely than not to be the explanation (and not just the most likely explanation) for the bruising, but it is not clear why she did not view T’s bruises in the context of his chaotic living conditions and, in particular, his father’s approach to handling him.  Bruising, even accidental, in a newborn baby has a quite different significance to bruising in a mobile child, and the judge was bound to consider the likelihood of repetition where no satisfactory explanation had been given. </p>

I accept the parents’ submission that the judge found that they had already decided not to return from hospital to the grandfather’s flat, and that the specific risk of harm from living with him in those premises had come to an end.  However, that does not impact upon the risks arising from the father’s notions of handling T.  As the judge said at paragraph 118: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Also, the judge herself expressed surprise at paragraph 116 at some of Dr Rahman’s evidence as she understood it.  Yet at paragraph 121 she adopted as her own what she described as “his assessment of the risk of harm taking account of Nurse P’s demonstration of what happened”.  The simple fact is that a court does not need expert evidence on the question of whether a two-week baby, flipped in the air through 360 degrees three times by an inexperienced parent, is likely to suffer significant harm.  The presence of an expert for one reason does not mean that he or she has to be asked about everything.  In this case, Dr Rahman’s advice was needed in relation to the bruising and T’s overall health status, but he was also asked about the possible medical consequences of handling of this kind.  His broad answer concerning the risks from shaking or dropping could scarcely be controversial, but he then became drawn into a detailed discussion about different kinds of handling.  Those were matters that are well within the competence of a specialist court.  The consequence of involving an expert unnecessarily is shown in this case, where the judge in her decisive paragraph 123 analysed the risk of harm through the lens of opinions expressed by Dr Rahman, whose own source of information was a remote viewing of a video clip of the witness doing her best to re-enact the incident with a doll.  The judge had accepted the evidence of Nurse P in preference to the evidence of the father and she should have applied her own assessment to it.  I have little doubt that the elaborate thought process that instead occurred contributed to a situation in which the wood was lost behind the trees. </p>

I note her perplexity about the position that had been reached on 7 May, even to the extent that the parents’ position “somewhat reinforced [her] view that the Local Authority have legitimate concerns about the risk of harm to T.”  She was right to say that she had no general power to require a gentle staged transition once proceedings have been dismissed.  She was also right to say that the very purpose of the section is to enable a court to hold the status quo for a very limited period pending appeal, but she was wrong to add in paragraphs 50 and 56 the words “in circumstances where the judge considers that [the] decision may be wrong.”  That was to conflate the power under s.40 with the refusal of permission to appeal.  The power under s.40 is, like the power to grant a stay, a protection pending appeal in case the court has inadvertently gone wrong.  Of course, if the proffered basis for appeal seems entirely groundless, that will speak against a s.40 order or a stay, but that was not the position here.  Unfortunately, the judge had apparently been told by counsel then acting for the local authority that a stay would not normally be granted when permission to appeal was being refused (see paragraph 46); that is not correct and it may have led her to make a similarly incorrect link between a s.40 order and her refusal of permission to appeal.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">When considering whether to make a s.40 order, the court will consider the welfare of the child, and the rights of the parents and the child, in the particular circumstances of the individual case, taking account of its findings and the appeal rights of the parties.  In this calculation there may be factors pointing both ways, but a prominent consideration will be whether an abrupt cessation of the previous order may have undesirable welfare consequences so that a limited delay until the application for permission to appeal can be urgently considered is sensible and proportionate.  Such an order entails no significant breach of rights as these applications can be considered by this court on an urgent basis in a matter of days at most.   In <span style="font-style:italic">Re M</span>, Ward J made a s.40 order until this court could consider the matter, which it did twelve days later.  The same could have happened here, and did indeed happen when a stay was sought and granted.  Had the judge applied the correct test, she would have been likely to have granted either a short-term order under s.40 or, to the same effect, a short stay.  Apart from being correct in principle, that would have resolved the practical difficulties arising from the stance taken by the parents on 7 May. </p>
