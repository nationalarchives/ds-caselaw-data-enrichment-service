In particular, I will consider the key question of whether vaccination is to be considered a serious or grave matter and also make some reference to whether it is to be regarded as medical treatment. Further, consideration needs to be given to whether there is a difference in parental responsibility as it arises in public law proceedings as opposed to in private law proceedings. </p>

Whilst, for the reasons rehearsed in the report of Dr Douglas and referred to below, it cannot be doubted that it is both reasonable and responsible parental behaviour to arrange for one’s child to be vaccinated in accordance with the Public Health England guidelines, there is at present no legal requirement in this country for a child to be vaccinated. It follows that, <span style="font-style:italic">taken in isolation</span>, a failure to arrange for an otherwise healthy child to be vaccinated would be unlikely to amount to ‘significant harm or the likelihood of significant harm’ such as to satisfy the threshold criteria necessary in order for a care order to be made pursuant to s.31 CA 1989. By contrast, a failure by parents to obtain vaccinations for their children may feature as one of a series of wider threshold allegations in support of a more generalised case of neglect. </p>

It followed that the “risk of significant harm” criterion necessary to invoke s.100 by the local authority could not be satisfied in that case.

This issue was between two parents. Sumner J heard from a number of experts in paediatric immunology and infectious diseases and he concluded that the benefits of having the vaccinations outweighed the risks. He made it clear that each case was fact specific. In the Court of Appeal Thorpe LJ rejected the ‘repeated categorisation of the course of immunisation as non-essential invasive treatment.

It is important not to treat vaccination as comparable with the ‘serious medical treatment’ cases discussed above. Routine vaccinations are carried out all over the world and are a facet of the right of a child to “enjoy the highest attainable standard of health” pursuant to Article 6(2) of the UNCRC. However, I would not on reflection go so far as Thorpe LJ in identifying a dichotomy between medical treatment and preventative health care. It seems to me that the concepts overlap. There must be a place for preventative medical treatment and for preventative health care and for our purposes vaccination might be described in either way.  </p>

In private law, by s.2(7) CA 1989, where more than one person has parental responsibility, each of them may act alone and without the other. Section 2(7) does not however give one party dominance or priority over the other in the exercise of parental responsibility. Each parent has equal parental responsibility, even though the day to day realities of life mean that each frequently acts alone. This applies particularly where the parties live in separate households and one parent is the primary carer.

In other words, the child in question has suffered (or was likely to suffer) harm as a consequence of the care given to him or her by a person with parental responsibility. It is against that backdrop that the parent of a child in care holds parental responsibility.

In both situations it is the duty of the judge to allow the court's own opinion to prevail in the perceived paramount interests of the child concerned, but in cases at the latter end of the scale, there must be a likelihood (though never of course a certainty) that the greater the scope for genuine debate between one view and another the stronger will be the inclination of the court to be influenced by a reflection that in the last analysis the best interests of every child include an expectation that difficult decisions affecting the length and quality of its life will be taken for it by the parent to whom its care has been entrusted by nature.”   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.00in">The administration of standard or routine vaccinations cannot be regarded as being a ‘serious’ or ‘grave’ matter. Except where there are significant features which suggest that, unusually, it may not be in the best interests of a child to be vaccinated, it is neither necessary nor appropriate for a local authority to refer the matter to the High Court in every case where a parent opposes the proposed vaccination of their child. To do so involves the expenditure of scarce time and resources by the local authority, the unnecessary instruction of expert medical evidence and the use of High Court time which could be better spent dealing with one of the urgent and serious matters which are always awaiting determination in the Family Division. </p>
