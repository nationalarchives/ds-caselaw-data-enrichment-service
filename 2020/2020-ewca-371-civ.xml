Qualifying tenants of Queen Court, Queen Square, London WC1 (“Queen Court”) have claimed to exercise that right. The issues raised by these appeals concern the question whether the qualifying tenants are also entitled to acquire certain leasehold interests in or connected with Queen Court.

The main entrance to the building is on Queen Square in Bloomsbury, with a second entrance at the opposite end of the building on Guilford Street. At the northern end of the building it has a frontage to Guilford Street from which external steps lead down to a basement containing the water tanks, boilers, oil tanks and electrical switchboards which serve the whole building. A second entrance to the basement is available by a set of steps leading from a small external courtyard on the west side of the building which is assessible only from the ground floor hallway. The basement boiler room occupies about a third of the building's total footprint and there is no basement under the remainder. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">On 7 October 2015 West End &amp; District Properties Ltd granted a lease of about two thirds of the basement to Regal Estates Ltd. The basement is a relatively open area with two large rooms and a corridor running the width of the building at one end. The lease envisages further sub-division and the area demised is therefore represented by red lines on the lease plan rather than by any existing physical feature. Planning permission has been granted for the conversion of the area into a one-bedroom flat. The lease excludes the area for the time being occupied by two boilers, two hot water tanks and a number of electricity meters but includes areas occupied by an oil storage tank, a gas meter, a water pump and other service installations. Those installations are not confined to one part of the basement, but are arranged around the perimeter of the rooms, with various substantial pipes and conduits rising up the walls and across the ceiling. The basement lease also includes the staircase leading down from Guilford Street, but not the staircase from the internal courtyard. It, too, confers full rights for the lessee to develop the demised part of the basement in compliance with any planning permission which might be obtained, including the right to alter or remove any structural part of the building and full rights of access to and from the remainder of the building to facilitate such development. Rights of access are reserved to the landlord for emergency purposes or for the proper performance of its obligations to other lessees in similar terms to the reservation in the airspace lease. It contains a covenant against alterations without the lessor’s consent; but that covenant does not apply to the carrying out of works in accordance with the planning permission. That lease is now owned by Mr and Mrs Emore. </p>

Once again the term was 999 years. The sub-soil supports Queen Court. Like the other two leases, this lease also included full rights to develop the demised premises in compliance with planning permission, similar reservations of rights of access; and contains no covenant against alterations.

It is theoretically possible to create a flying freehold; but they are fraught with problems, and it seems unlikely that Parliament intended to do so. The basic proposition of English law is that the owner of the surface of land is also entitled, within limits that are irrelevant for present purposes, to the airspace above it, and the subterranean strata below it: Megarry &amp; Wade: The Law of Real Property (9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> ed para 3-013); <span style="font-style:italic">Bocardo SA v Star Energy UK Onshore Ltd</span> [2010] UKSC 35, [2011] 1 AC 380. </p>

In the first place, the basement areas are within the built envelope of the building. Second, the sub-soil will pass on an ordinary conveyance of Queen Court.

And be it never so unlikely that Holroyd intended to include the cellar, it was not in terms excepted from the property conveyed.

The qualifying tenants were entitled to have the freehold of the building. Although the building included the area comprised in the basement lease (because it was within the built envelope), it included neither the airspace nor the sub-soil. Nor did those areas fall within the categories of property referred to in section 1 (2). They were not demised by a lease held by a qualifying tenant of any flat within the building; nor were they property which such a tenant is entitled to use in common with other occupiers. The result would therefore be that the qualifying tenants were entitled to have only the filling in a sandwich, with the two outer slices being the airspace and the sub-soil respectively. </p>

Full rights of access over the basement itself were reserved to the lessor by paragraph (c) of the Schedule 5 for the proper performance of the lessor's obligations including the repair and maintenance of the equipment and services. If Mr and Mrs Emore were to develop the premises comprised in the basement lease as a flat (as their lease entitles them to do) access would still be available.

Thus, I consider it will cover the boiler room or a room housing the lift machinery, although those rooms may be kept locked and no resident ever goes into them. It will encompass a covered atrium that all the residents can use, and also a sunken garden in the centre of the building to which the residents do not have access but which is a common amenity that is to be regarded as part of the building; or a banked rockery at the front of the building over which the residents do not pass but which is maintained for their common benefit and should be considered as part of the “exterior” although not part of the structure. Furthermore, there is no requirement that the part must actually be used by all the residents: for example, the fact that the residents on the ground floor may never use the lift does not prevent it from being a common part.” </p>

In the first place, as I have said, the test is a functional test, not a matter of title. Section 2 (3) is, to my mind, explicit on the point. One of its avowed purposes is to enable the qualifying tenants to acquire a leasehold interest which “consists of” common parts. If the grant of a lease of common parts were to remove it from the ambit of common parts, section 2 (3) would be fatally undermined. Moreover, in the <span style="font-style:italic">Cadogan</span> case the caretaker’s flat in issue was the subject of a separate lease, but that did not prevent it from being within the common parts.

Each of the three leases reserves to the landlord the right to enter the demised property either for emergency purposes or for the proper performance of the lessor’s obligations to the owners or occupiers of the flats. In addition, the basement lease contains an additional right for the lessor to access the boiler room (whether in its current position or a different location) so as to connect into, repair, maintain or renew any plant or equipment.

There was no suggestion that any physical alteration of the lightwell was proposed. In the case of the lightwell, Roth J considered that the freeholder would require access to the floor of the lightwell (and the airspace immediately above it) for the purpose of maintenance and repair of those systems and media, as well as of the exterior walls of the structure facing towards the light-well. But he held that there were sufficient rights reserved in the lease under which it was held as to negate the necessity for acquiring the leasehold interest in the lightwell itself. The latter point did not arise for decision in this court. </p>

I agree. This submission is, to some extent, reflected in section 19 (1) (ii) of the 1993 Act which prohibits the grant of a lease of common parts after the date when an initial notice exercising the right of enfranchisement has been registered.

They found the <span style="font-style:italic">current </span>access to the basement through double doors on the Guilford Street side of the building was "designed for, and [was] essential to the maintenance of the boiler equipment". They regarded the alternative access through the communal ground floor hallway (and then down into the internal courtyard) as inappropriate for the transfer of large pieces of boiler equipment or for regular maintenance. They found that it was not reasonably possible for works of repair and replacement to the boiler to be undertaken in the area which Mr and Mrs Emore intended should remain available; nor would there be any space for the spare parts and equipment currently stored in the basement and which are reasonably required to ensure the smooth running of the boilers and the electrical apparatus. In summary the FTT found that the proposed development of the basement by Mr and Mrs Emore would significantly interfere with the reasonable maintenance and upkeep of the communal heating and electrical supply provided to the individual flats and the common parts.  </p>

The Deputy President considered that this was in itself a sufficient reason for the acquisition of the sub-soil lease. It is (to put it no higher) also possible, that if the lightwell is created on the eastern side of the block it will prevent access to one of the staircases leading into the area where the boilers etc are located.

Convenient access to the structure would become impossible because of the presence of an additional flat or flats on top of it, and any change in the structure would be unnoticed and difficult to monitor. In my judgment the risk of these consequences makes it reasonably necessary for the proper management of the airspace that the airspace lease be acquired. If the lease is not acquired the airspace will be incapable of being managed as it currently is. It does not matter that the respondent will presumably still have access to a new roof over the Building, or that it will have access to the existing structure in the exercise of the rights reserved in the airspace lease, since the former will relate to a different structure and the latter will involve a very much more complex and inconvenient operation than is currently possible.” </p>
