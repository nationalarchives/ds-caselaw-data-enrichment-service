Relations between them remained difficult.  The mother says that the father continued to be aggressive and abusive towards her.  The mother was found to be HIV positive, the source of which was a matter of dispute between them.  G continued to reside with her mother, but the father had regular contact.  Following a divorce in 2018 and a report by a family counsellor, the South African equivalent of a child arrangements order was made.  The father and the mother shared full parental rights and responsibilities in relation to G, who continued to live with the mother but had extensive contact with the father on alternate weekends and for half the school holidays, and he regularly picked up G from school.  The father paid the mother maintenance, and also for items such as school fees.  </p>

In December 2019, with the mother’s consent, the father took G to the EUMS to spend time with his extended family.  During that period, the mother visited the UK, from where she messaged the father to say that she had made contacts and found employment in England, and intended to remain here.  She suggested she could collect G from the EUMS, and take her directly from there to live in England.  The father objected, pointing out that he had parental rights, he did not think that being schooled in England was in G’s best interests, and the South African courts should make any decisions in relation to G.   </p>

However, following her separation from the father, she had told her friends that she was lesbian.  As a result, she had been threatened by members of her family and, in May 2019, subjected to a very painful and frightening “cleansing ceremony” at her family’s home.    After that episode, she continued to receive threats from her family including death threats; but the police, to whom she reported them, did not take the threats seriously and said they could do nothing about them.  While she was in England in December 2019, her car in South Africa was vandalised; and, on her return to South Africa in February 2020, someone she believed to have been her brother tried to force her off the road whilst she was driving, writing off her car in the process.  She believed that this victimisation by her own family was as a consequence of her sexual orientation.  </p>

The Preamble to the Convention declares that the signatory states are ‘Firmly convinced that the interests of children are of paramount importance in matters relating to their custody’ and ‘Desiring to protect children internationally from the harmful effects of their wrongful removal or retention…’.  This objective is, of course, also for the benefit of children generally: the aim of the Convention is as much to deter people from wrongfully abducting children as it is to serve the best interests of the children who have been abducted.  But it also aims to serve the best interests of the individual child.  It does so by making certain rebuttable assumptions about what will best achieve this: see [the 1980 Hague Convention Explanatory Report by Professor Elisa Pérez-Vera, the rapporteur to the 1980 sessions of the Hague Conference which produced the Convention (‘the Pérez-Vera Report’)], at paragraph 25.” </p>

The best interests, not only of children generally, but also of any individual child involved are a primary concern in the Hague Convention process.  We agree with the Strasbourg court that in this connection their best interests have two aspects: to be reunited with their parents as soon as possible, so that one does not gain an unfair advantage over the other through the passage of time; and to be brought up in a ‘sound environment’, in which they are not at risk of harm.  The Hague Convention is designed to strike a fair balance between those two interests.  If it is correctly applied it is most unlikely that there will be any breach of article 8 or other [European Convention on Human Rights (“ECHR”)] rights unless other factors supervene.  </p>

In this way, the Directive covers not only compliance by Member States with their obligations under the 1951 Geneva Convention, but also under articles 2 and 3 of the ECHR.  This judgment focuses on the provisions relevant to asylum; but this parallel scheme may have a part to play in the mother’s claim for international protection because she claims that, even if on return to South Africa she would not be subject to relevant persecution, she would be at risk of suffering treatment contrary to articles 2 and/or 3 of the ECHR; and thus, even if not a refugee, she is eligible for subsidiary protection.    </p>

Article 11(1) sets out circumstances in which a person shall cease to be a refugee, including (at (e)), “if he or she… can no longer, because the circumstances in connection with which he or she has been recognised as a refugee have ceased to exist, continue to refuse to avail himself or herself of the protection of the country of nationality”.  In considering this, by virtue of article 11(2), Member States are required to have regard to whether the change in circumstances “is of such a significant and non-temporary nature that the refugee’s fear of persecution can no longer be regarded as well-founded”.  By article 14, Member States are required to revoke refugee status where, amongst other things, the relevant individual “has ceased to be a refugee in accordance with article 11”.  Again, under the Directive, the cessation of refugee rights is linked to the issue of recognition of refugee status by the Member State.  There are parallel provisions for the cessation and revocation of the subsidiary protection status (articles 16 and 19). </p>

Consequently, a person admitted to the UK by the Secretary of State as a dependant of someone who is recognised as having refugee status does not, by dint of that dependency alone, acquire the status of a refugee under the Convention, even if, under </p>

That appears to us to have been the simple answer to the claim in <span style="text-decoration:underline">JS (Uganda)</span>: the Secretary of State could not have granted JS “refugee status” in its usual sense of status as a refugee.  Insofar as the Secretary of State seeks to use “refugee status” in two different senses – one to reflect status as defined in article 1A of the Geneva Convention, the Qualification and Procedures Directives and the Qualifications Regulations, and the other somewhat wider – that is, at best, unhelpful and unnecessary, and can only lead to confusion.  It led to the somewhat surreal arguments considered in <span style="text-decoration:underline">JS (Uganda)</span>.  It seems to us that it could only be helpful if the Secretary of State were to abandon the use of the phrase “refugee status” as meaning anything other than status as a refugee under the 1951 Geneva Convention.  In the meantime, we touch upon the difficulties of the granting of “refugee status” to child dependants who are not refugees below (paragraph 126).   </p>

Equally, it is impossible for a return order to be made while an asylum claim is pending.  Such an order would place this country in direct breach of the principle of nonrefoulement.  It is impossible to conceive that the framers of the 1980 or 1996 Hague Conventions could have intended that orders of an interim procedural nature could be made thereunder in direct conflict with that key principle.

The mother and new partner were granted refugee status, as was the child.  It is unclear whether the child was granted that status under the 1951 Geneva Convention or simply under the API (see paragraphs 90-94 above); but all parties appear to have assumed it was the former, although (as we note below) Cohen J in any event appears to have equated the two.  The judge held that (i) the procedure before the Russian court was deficient because, in violation of fundamental principles of procedure in England and Wales, the child was given no opportunity to be heard before the order was made; (ii) following Hayden J’s judgment in <span style="text-decoration:underline">F v M</span> (2017), the court was absolutely barred from ordering the return of a child who was a refugee to the country from which the Secretary of State had recognised he required refuge; and (iii) in any event, even if there had not been such a bar, the balance overwhelmingly fell in favour of the child not being returned to Russia.  Despite the apparent assumption that the child had been granted refugee status because she was in fact a refugee, at [58], Cohen J appears to have included, within the scope of the principle that children with refugee status cannot be returned to their country of nationality, “a child with refugee status… as a dependant” as well as a child who has refugee status on his or her own behalf. </p>

First, as we have described (paragraph 56 above), any bar to refoulement is a bar to return to a country of nationality (or to another state with the risk on onward refoulement to the country of nationality).  Consequently, where the country of habitual residence from which a child has been taken is not a country of nationality of the child, and there is no risk of further refoulement to that country, then there is no refoulement bar.  Therefore, when Hayden J said that refugee status is a bar to an order to effect the return of a child “to an alternative jurisdiction”, that is too wide if he meant to <span style="font-style:italic">any</span> alternative jurisdiction.     </p>

As we have described (see paragraph 99 above), in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Re S</span> (2002), the terms “remove” and “required to leave” in this context (then section 15 of the Immigration Act 1999) were construed as terms of art in immigration law, so that the prohibition did not apply to removal in the exercise of other statutory powers such as those under the wardship jurisdiction and the 1980 Hague Convention.

The UK, he submits, has given effect to that obligation by granting an in-country right of appeal where the claim, although refused, is not considered by the Secretary of State to be clearly unfounded under section 94 of the 2002 Act (see paragraph 75 above).  Under the statutory scheme, whether an asylum claim is clearly unfounded is entirely a matter for the Secretary of State.   </p>

In particular, (i) a child who is returned to his or her country of nationality could not meet the definition of “refugee” under article 1A of the 1951 Geneva Convention because that requires the person to be “outside their country of nationality”; and (ii) a child who is not in the UK would not meet the criteria for the grant of refugee status if he or she is not in the UK and therefore the asylum claim could not be granted (paragraph 334 and 336 of the Immigration Rules: see paragraph 71 above).  Furthermore, if the appeal were allowed, there would be no means to require the left-behind parent to or otherwise enforce the return of the child to the UK.  So, Mr Payne submitted, where an incountry appeal is pending (as defined in section 104 of the 2020 Act: see paragraph 78 above) – but only, post-determination of an asylum claim,  in those circumstances – a return under the 1980 Hague Convention is barred.

That issue will have to await clarification from Parliament or the Secretary of State; or, failing that, a case in which the issue is live.

In argument, Mr Payne accepted that the High Court could determine an application for and even order the return of a child who has been granted refugee status, even though he submitted that that order cannot be implemented whilst that status is maintained; and <span style="font-style:italic">a fortiori</span> where an application for asylum remains outstanding.  In our view, he was right to accept that the only bar is to actual return – although the precise course the court should follow in a particular case (including the stage of the proceedings when any stay should be imposed) is a different question which we consider below (paragraphs 157-158).  The duty of non-refoulement and the article 7 duty to allow asylum applicants to remain involve a prohibition on returning a person to his or her country of nationality: they do not prohibit either (i) the return of a child to the country of his or her habitual residence which is not the country of nationality; and (ii) the taking of decisions which are preliminary or ancillary to actual return.  Nothing in the domestic provisions impose any such prohibitions.  Indeed, sections 77 and 78 of the 2002 Act make the line in (ii) clear, by prohibiting any act of removal of an asylum applicant whilst expressly allowing “interim or preparatory action” up to and including the giving of removal directions (see paragraphs 77, 78 and 79(iii) above).   </p>

On the other hand, whilst the evaluation of evidence in a Convention application has to be made “within the confines of the summary process” (<span style="text-decoration:underline">Re K (1980 Hague Convention: Lithuania)</span> [2015] EWCA Civ 720 at [52]), the court will have the benefit of the evidence adduced by and the submissions of the left-behind parent, who will almost certainly play no part in any asylum claim.

Indeed, it became apparent during the hearing of this appeal that, over and above section 55, the part of the asylum and immigration structure and system with which we are concerned does not appear to have provisions reflecting the specific interests and needs of abducted children.

They are in different positions and performing different functions: which decision-maker is in the “better” position to determine a common or overlapping issue (and, if so, whether the decision-maker should await determination of that issue elsewhere) will depend upon the circumstances of the particular case (including the matters to which we refer in paragraph 161 below).  </p>

Despite the summary nature of 1980 Hague Convention proceedings, it is possible for a child who has been found by the Secretary of State to have a “well-founded fear of being persecuted” in his or her country of nationality, and for the High Court to conclude (perhaps having regard to a different risk and on different evidence) that, for example, he or she does not fall within the scope of article 13(b) of the 1980 Hague Convention.  Equally, it is possible that, even where the High Court has concluded that there is a grave risk that his or her return to that country would expose the child to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place the child in an intolerable situation, the Secretary of State (perhaps on different evidence) may conclude the child is not a refugee and return would not breach his or her human rights etc.   </p>

Although we accept that in these circumstances the court may well decide not to make a return order, we do not agree that that course is impossible; nor, in this regard, do we see any difference in principle between a case where there is an asylum application pending and a case where an appeal on the merits is pending.   </p>

As we have indicated, the court does not have any part to play in the assessment of whether an individual is a “refugee” for the purposes of the 1951 Geneva Convention; but, for the reasons we have given (see paragraphs 143-147 above), an application for a return order under the 1980 Hague Convention does not require the court to make any such assessment.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.00in">Nor do we accept Mr Setright’s submission that, as the mother’s allegations in the asylum claim are apparently made primarily against her family, it would be entirely inappropriate (and contrary to the confidentiality in the asylum process) for the nature of those allegations to be disclosed to them as the alleged perpetrators or for them to be asked to answer those allegations.  He prays in aid the cloak of confidentiality that generally encompasses an asylum claim.   Therefore, he submits, the court will not be able to evaluate the mother’s allegations against any other evidence.  But that, in our view, misses the target.  In the application for a return order, the burden of establishing an exception falls upon the mother as the taking parent who opposes return (<span style="text-decoration:underline">Re E</span> at [32]).  She has, in general terms, indicated the nature of those allegations.   Given that burden of proof, the court must do its best within the confines of an essentially summary procedure, to ascertain whether the grounds relied upon have been made good, e.g. if appropriate, by taking the allegations at their highest and considering whether the risk to the child that they pose can be mitigated by protective measures (<span style="text-decoration:underline">Re E</span> at [36]).  In any event, whatever the response of the Secretary of State may be, the mother’s asylum claim will not (or, at least, will not necessarily) provide an answer to the return order application.  </p>

We reiterate that a return order only requires the return of the child; it does not require the taking parent to return (see paragraph 115 above).  We recognise, of course, that whether the taking parent will be returning with the child can be a significant factor itself in the determination of the application.  We also recognise that the taking parent will typically wish to return with the child.  However, the order does not <span style="font-style:italic">require</span> the parent to do so.

However, even in those circumstances, there are additional reasons why it could well be appropriate for the court substantively to determine the application.  In summary, this is because of the differences between the two processes, as set out in paragraph 144 above, in particular, the participation of the left-behind parent and of the child.  The 1980 Hague Convention is expressly designed to give the left-behind parent access to justice and to ensure that the voice of the child is heard.

However, there may be reasons why it would be more appropriate for all the issues connected with the terms of any return order to be adjourned pending the resolution of the outstanding asylum issues.

This is of critical importance for three reasons.  First, absent the prompt determination of any asylum application, the state will potentially be failing to comply with its obligations under the 1980 Hague Convention promptly to determine any application under that Convention.  Second, again absent the prompt determination of any asylum application, the making of such an application would have the potential significantly to undermine the efficacy of the 1980 Hague Convention and the attainment, in the interests of children, of its objectives.  We are only too aware of the potential for tactical asylum applications to be made by taking parents on behalf of themselves and/or a child, and pursued through appeals, with a view to their own position so far that the child is concerned being enhanced by the passage of time.  The Secretary of State, any appeal tribunal and any court dealing with immigration challenges or appeals will not doubt be vigilant to prevent the abuse of the asylum process to the detriment of prompt and effective remedies in respect of child abduction.  Third, any delay caused to the determination of any application under the 1980 Hague Convention and/or to the implementation of any decision that a child should be returned, has the potential to be contrary to the interests of the child who is the subject of the application and detrimental to their welfare.

The refusal or inability of a parent to return to the child’s home country, and the reasons for this, including allegations of domestic violence, will be taken into account when the court is determining whether one of the exceptions to return under the 1980 Hague Convention has been established.  Equally, the court will take into account the fact that the taking parent has made an asylum claim when determining, in particular, whether the article 13(b) exception has been established.  Even if return would not directly expose the child to physical or psychological harm, as we have described, he/she might otherwise be placed in an intolerable situation (<span style="text-decoration:underline">Re S,</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">DT and LBT (Abduction: Domestic Abuse)</span> [2010] EWHC 3177 (Fam); [2011] 1 FLR 1215, <span style="text-decoration:underline">Re W (Abduction: Intolerable Situation)</span> [2018] EWCA Civ 664; [2019] Fam 125 and the cases cited at paragraph 38 above).  Whilst we accept that the taking parent might be put into a difficult position, that is the result of the focus on (and the weight given to) the interests of the child in the 1980 Hague Convention process.
