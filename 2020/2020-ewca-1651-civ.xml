DET does not challenge the transfers as such, but it alleges that the decision not to pay it compensation in respect of part of the property, referred to as “the Leisure Centre Land”, was unlawful.

Following the abolition of ILEA in March 1990, Lambeth assumed responsibility for maintenance of the school and the site was transferred to it by operation of law without any payment of consideration. Also in 1990, the governors of the school received a grant of £100,000 from the London Residuary Body, which had been established to distribute funds of the Greater London Council after its abolition. At least part of the grant was used to construct an all-weather sports pitch and a swimming pool on the Hackford Road Site.  </p>

That section provided for land used or held for the purposes of a school to be transferred to, and vest in, its governing body on its becoming grant-maintained.

But the views of the local authority are bound to carry less weight where the local authority has made no attempt to address that question. Had the Belfast City Council expressly set itself the task of balancing the rights of individuals to sell and buy pornographic literature and images against the interests of the wider community, a court would find it hard to upset the balance which the local authority had struck.

Moreover, the conduct and expenditure of DET contributed to the value of the Leisure Centre Land. The money invested came from commercial exploitation of the land and is appropriately to be seen as private. To regard funds derived from a profit-making commercial enterprise such as LHL as anything other than private merely because the enterprise’s initial capital expenditure emanated from public funds would strain proper use of language. For Lambeth to acquire the Leisure Centre Land without paying anything for it would be to confer a windfall, Mr Sharland argued. Further, anxious scrutiny must be applied since the Secretary of State did not consider Convention rights when making his decision, and it is of significance that the Secretary of State accepted in correspondence in 2010 that the Leisure Centre Land had been “privately enhanced by DET”. </p>

It was transferred to it in 2010 subject to a trust “for the purposes of the school” pursuant to the School Organisation (Prescribed Alterations to Maintained Schools) (England) Regulations 2007. Mr Sharland submitted that that trust came to an end when Durand Academy replaced Durand Primary School later in 2010, but it will not have been as simple as that. Mr Jonathan Moffett QC, who appeared for the Secretary of State with Mr Matthew Smith, suggested that the trust continued beyond the closure of Durand Primary School, on the basis that the relevant <span style="font-style:italic">purposes </span>survived and could be served by use of the land by Durand Academy and, more recently, Van Gogh Primary. Supposing, however, that that analysis were wrong, it seems to me, as Mr Moffett argued in the alternative, that a cy-près occasion would have arisen and that DET should have been asking for a scheme to be made (see section 61 of the Charities Act 2011 and, before that, section 13(5) of the Charities Act 1993). Such a scheme could be expected to have provided for the Leisure Centre Land to be held on trust for Durand Academy or, later, Van Gogh Primary, as Durand Primary School’s successors on the Hackford Road Site. </p>

LHL’s profits may have helped to fund the improvements there, but it had no external funding. Its earnings derived from exploitation of land held by the Governors/DET, of which it was essentially an arm. As mentioned earlier, the company’s accounts confirm that it was set up to undertake trading activity on behalf of Durand Primary School and had the Governors and, later, DET as its parent. The intention was that profits should be transferred to the Governors in a tax-efficient way, but the company itself was to belong to the Governors. Latterly, moreover, LHL ceased to supply Durand Academy with any funds. The evidence indicates that, while LHL achieved profits of some £8.3 million between 2010 and August 2018, less than £1 million of this sum accrued to the benefit of Durand Academy and neither LHL nor DET transferred any money at all to Durand Academy Trust or Dunraven Academy Trust after 2015. </p>

The land has passed from one owner to another with changes in the education system, but always without consideration and without any injection of private capital. The different title-holders can aptly be thought of, as Mr Auburn suggested, as custodians.

Procedural matters could, at most, bear on overall proportionality, but on the facts of this case the Secretary of State’s decision that there should be no compensation was plainly proportionate.

While procedural matters may be of significance in assessing proportionality, it seems to me that the principle of legality can also play an independent role in relation to the assessment of compensation as well as the deprivation itself. What, if any, compensation is to be paid will of course commonly be important in considering whether a deprivation is consistent with A1P1, but the contention that, because the bare deprivation is not at issue, the principle of legality is irrelevant to compensation strikes me as overly technical, the more so when it is remembered that the Convention “is intended to guarantee rights that are ‘practical and effective’, not theoretical or illusory” and that the Court “must go beneath appearances and look into the reality of the situation at issue” (see paragraph 31(i) above). It is noteworthy, too, that paragraphs 95-97 of the judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Vistiņš v Latvia</span>, which I have quoted in paragraph 45 above, are not included in the section headed “Proportionality of the impugned measure” but rather in one with the heading “’Subject to the conditions provided for by law’”. </p>

Exercise of the power was constrained by reference to the purpose for which it had been conferred and other conventional public law principles as well as A1P1.

Here, DET acquired the Leisure Centre Land, with the buildings on it, under regulations made under section 24 of the Education and Inspections Act 2006 (within paragraph A13(1)(d) of schedule 22 to the SSFA 1998) and the Leisure Centre Land, with the buildings on it, had also been acquired from the governing body of a foundation school which had itself acquired it under a transfer under section 201(1)(a) of the Education Act 1996 (within paragraph A13(2)(a)(i) of schedule 22).

She acknowledged that it was difficult to put herself back in the position she was in May 2019, but having “tried to exclude any element of prejudgement and to consider matters afresh” she concluded that her decision would not have been any different. She said that she did “not consider that any of the equalities implications identified in the EIA would have caused [her] to require Lambeth to use scarce public funds to confer what would have been, in [her] view, an unjustified windfall on DET”. </p>

He further submitted that the EIA was flawed because (a) it made no attempt to quantify the sum to be paid to DET, (b) the Secretary of State did not inquire sufficiently into how DET would use any compensation, (c) “the asserted link between Lambeth’s payment of any consideration and the diminution of resources from Lambeth’s existing budget … is neither necessary nor logical” and (d) the EIA “weighs in the balance” the “positive impact … that persons in the relevant groups would not .. be required to pay additional council tax” even though it was “judged more likely” that the resources would be taken out of existing budgets.

The ultimate question is whether it is “highly likely” that compliance with the PSED would have made no difference to the decision that DET should not be paid compensation. In my view, that is the case. In fact, I should have thought it extremely unlikely that compliance with the PSED would have altered the decision. After all, there were very compelling reasons not to award DET any compensation (see paragraphs 37-43 above) and no likelihood of a decision not to do so having significantly adverse equalities implications. I see no basis for doubting that Ms Milner would have seen a payment to DET as an “unjustified windfall”, as her evidence suggests.  </p>
