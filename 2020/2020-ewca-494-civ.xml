The majority in the camp were young men, but there were also hundreds of unaccompanied asylum-seeking children (“UASCs”) including, it was thought, at least 200 who had close relatives in the UK.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.00in">Under those criteria, the responsible state is generally the first Member State into which the applicant irregularly arrived (article 13 of Dublin III).  For an adult, however, under article 17, it is always open for a Member State in its discretion to examine and determine an asylum claim even if it is not responsible under the hierarchy of criteria for state responsibility set out in Chapter III of Dublin III.  Further, there is a specific provision for unaccompanied children.  Under article 8 of Dublin III, if the child seeking asylum is unaccompanied and has a sibling or other close relative in another Member State then, if it is in the child’s best interests, that other state is responsible for considering and determining his application for asylum; and the provisions in article 8 and Chapter VI relating to the uniting of the child and his relative in that other state to facilitate that consideration and determination apply.  In short, the Member State in which the applicant makes an asylum claim, after carrying out due enquiries, makes a take charge request to the other state and that other state, after carrying out any further enquiries it wishes, either agrees to take charge or refuses to do so.  A refusal to take charge by the other state may be challenged by way of court proceedings in the other state.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.00in">Dublin III has internal provisions designed to achieve appropriate procedural fairness and speed.  For example, the Member State in which the asylum claim is made has to provide legal and linguistic assistance to an applicant, where necessary (article 5); and a take charge request has to be made “as soon as possible and in any event within three months” and a response provided “as soon as possible and in any event within two months” (article 21(1) and 22(1)).            </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.00in">For one reason or another, however, most of the children in the Calais camp (including the Appellant) refused to make an application for asylum in France which would have triggered that Dublin III mechanism.  As a result, when the French Government announced on 7 October 2016, on only a month’s notice, that it proposed to demolish the camp, the UK Government, which had no legal obligation towards these children on French soil, decided to pursue a bilateral process agreed with the </p>

On 28 October 2016, the French authorities asked the Secretary of State to stop interviewing at the camp, to allow the remaining children to be dispersed to one of the 73 <span style="font-style:italic">Centres a’accueil et d’orientation pour mineurs isoles</span> (Centres for Unaccompanied Minors) (“CAOMIs”) throughout France, so that the camp could be demolished.  That dispersal gave rise to the second phase of the operation, in which 90 officers from the UK interviewed 1,872 children who had not been interviewed and accepted for transfer in the first phase, at the CAOMIs, in twenty minute sessions over three weeks in November 2016.  Again, interviews with asserted family members in the UK were then conducted over the telephone by UK-based officials.   </p>

Refusal decisions were not communicated directly to the children, but to the French authorities by means of a spreadsheet with a word or short phrase in respect of reasons which was then transmitted to the children by those authorities over the next few days.  The Secretary of State notified French officials that, based on legal advice, the UK would not be able to share detailed reasons for refusal due to concerns about vulnerability to legal challenge; and the French authorities raised some concerns about this.  The evidence was that reasons were very limited because of a concern that fuller reasons would lead to legal challenges.  </p>

In <span style="text-decoration:underline">Citizens UK</span>, this court held that the procedure adopted in the process was unfair and unlawful as a matter of common law, notably in failing to give adequate reasons for refusal of transfer which meant that the children affected (and those assisting them) had no meaningful way of knowing how to achieve a different outcome in the review process or realistically challenging a refusal (see [90]-[91]).  It also concluded that the Secretary of State had seriously breached her duty of candour and cooperation with the court by failing to inform the High Court that at least one of the reasons why the explanations for a refusal decision were very thin was because of the perceived risk of legal challenges to such decisions.   </p>

The fact is that, even though the expedited process was not one that arose under Dublin III…, it was a process which led to a decision: a person who benefited from it was transferred to the UK and this took place quickly without the need for the formal Dublin III process to be gone through.  It follows that a person who was not accepted for transfer in the expedited process suffered an adverse decision and this led at the least to a delay in their being able to join a family member in the UK. </p>

This court, allowing the appeal, held that a UASC who first arrived in one Member State but sought to apply for asylum in another Member State, must generally invoke Dublin III in the first state rather than resort to legal proceedings in the other state. </p>

This is subject to the point that, as I have stated, these cases are intensely fact-specific.  There will be cases of such urgency or of such a compelling nature because of the situation of the unaccompanied minor that it can clearly be shown that the Dublin system in the other country does not work fast enough.  The case of the Syrian baby left behind in France when the door of a lorry bound for England closed after his mother got onto the lorry… is an example.

Although the expedited process was designed to bypass some elements of the Dublin III process such as the making of an application for asylum prior to consideration of transfer, it was the Secretary of State, not the Respondent, who sought that bypassing.  The delay in the Respondent being reunited with his brother resulted from decisions taken by the Secretary of State, not the French authorities.  No French decision or action was in issue.  In the usual way, the Secretary of State must bear responsibility for her own decisions made here, and challenged here. Therefore, the very exceptional circumstances test in <span style="text-decoration:underline">ZT (Syria)</span>, which was focused on possible deficiencies in French authorities and/or courts, had no part to play. </p>

In particular, the tribunal found that the adverse findings made against the Respondent in the expedited process would likely have prejudiced any later Dublin III application and would likely have resulted in a refusal of a take charge request even if made under article 8 of Dublin III whilst he was still a child; so that (the tribunal said) “the fact that the [Respondent] had not made a formal application for asylum was not a factor which can be held against him when considering the procedural fairness of the expedited and/or filtration process” (see [68]-[69]).  The deficiencies in the expedited process had consequently fatally “infected” the Dublin III processes that would have been engaged if the Respondent had made a later asylum claim in France.  Therefore, Ms Kilroy submitted, even if (contrary to her primary submission) the very exceptional circumstances test applied in this case, the Respondent satisfied it on the (unchallenged) facts of this case as found by the tribunal.   </p>

Insofar as that suggestion was made, we would reject it.  By way of example, in the particular case of <span style="text-decoration:underline">AM</span> himself, it is clear that, as a result of the processes and delay to which he was subjected, he suffered very substantial depression and despair resulting in a dissociated state and potential risk of suicide (see [12] of the Upper Tribunal’s judgment). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.00in">Third, Ms Kilroy submitted that there was a substantial factual difference between the cases in that, in the <span style="text-decoration:underline">AM</span> cases, the claimants were each under 18 at all material times through to their actual transfer to the UK.  Further, whilst in France, they obtained advice from UK lawyers.  In the Respondent’s case, he did not receive any legal advice in France (e.g. on the application of Dublin III, and as to whether and when to make an asylum application in France with a view to triggering the Dublin III machinery) until he was over 18 years of age, by which time he had fallen out of the scope of article 8 of Dublin III (under which, as a child, he would have been entitled to transfer to the UK to be with his brother) and, for transfer, he could only then rely upon the general discretionary provision in article 17 (see paragraph 3 above).

In support, she relied particularly on the Upper Tribunal’s finding (at [67] of its determination) that the fact that the Secretary of </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.00in">It is clear, however, that, the Respondent was determined that he would not make an asylum claim in France, required to trigger the Dublin III procedures; and that remained his position unless and until he had received guarantees that, if he made such a claim, the French authorities would make a take charge request to the UK which the UK would accept.  Even given the Upper Tribunal’s factual finding with regard to the 30 December 2016 interview, we do not consider that there is any evidential basis for the proposition that, had he received earlier legal advice, he would have made an asylum claim in France to trigger those procedures.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.00in">Fourth and finally, Ms Kilroy submitted that, unlike <span style="text-decoration:underline">AM</span>, the Upper Tribunal in this case (at [68]-[69] of its determination) made firm findings in relation to prejudice suffered by the Respondent as a result of the flawed expedited process.  Notably, the tribunal found that even if, as a child, he had made an application for asylum with a view to being transferred to the United Kingdom under article 8 of Dublin III, it is likely that the adverse findings made in the expedited process would have led to a refusal of transfer.     </p>

In <span style="text-decoration:underline">Citizens UK</span>, a submission on behalf of the Secretary of State that a Dublin III process could be considered in isolation from a prior (defective) expedited process was rejected by the court, because the Secretary of State did in fact later take into account what had happened in the expedited process (e.g. when her officials were considering the review or “filter” stage).

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.00in">Whilst these findings were made in the context of the issue of whether common law fairness was required at all in the expedited process, they are material when considering the ambit of <span style="text-decoration:underline">AM</span> as a precedent because, as Singh LJ said at [2] of his judgment in <span style="text-decoration:underline">AM</span>, the issues in the two cases considerably overlapped and the judgments in both cases (handed down on the same day) were to be read together.  Read with <span style="text-decoration:underline">Citizens UK</span>, <span style="text-decoration:underline">AM</span> held that, even where a UASC had been rejected in the (defective) expedited process, there would be no breach of article 8 if, as a result of believing that the negative findings of the expedited process were either a Dublin III </p>

In coming to that conclusion, Singh LJ took into account that fact that the UASCs in France would have been in the care of the French authorities, which would themselves have had an article 8 obligation towards them which would have included an obligation to make an asylum application in France (including, if necessary, an application for transfer to the UK) on their behalf in appropriate circumstances; and the obligation to give proper legal and linguistic assistance required by Dublin III. </p>
