On 12 November 2020, HH Judge George placed Z in the interim care of the local authority on the basis of a care plan which provided that he should be removed from his father’s home and placed with foster carers as a bridging placement with a view to placing him in due course in the care of his mother. His father now seeks permission to appeal against that order. On 4 December, I listed the application for permission to appeal for a full hearing, with appeal to follow if permission granted. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The background can be summarised as follows. Z is the younger of two sons of parents who separated in 2016 following a long marriage. Both Z and his elder brother, D, now aged 19, had been diagnosed as being on the autistic spectrum. Following the breakdown of their marriage, the parents have conducted extensive private law proceedings concerning the boys. During that period, the boys have resided with their father and have had only limited contact with their mother. The mother remains living in the former family home while the father and the two boys live in small rented accommodation.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In December 2016, the mother filed an application for orders under s.8 of the Children Act 1989. The application was initially listed for a fact-finding hearing to determine cross-allegations by the parents. In the event, however, that hearing did not take place. A children’s guardian was appointed at that stage and has remained involved in the proceedings ever since. Her initial analysis in 2017 included the observation that the boys had aligned themselves with their father who was “unable emotionally to give his permission for the children to have a relationship with their mother”. She proposed a child arrangements order for the boys to live with both parents under a shared care arrangement, supported by therapeutic intervention and local authority support in the form of a family assistance order. On 3 October 2017, the court made a child arrangements order providing for the boys to live with both parents, spending alternate months with their mother. In addition, with the support of the local authority, the court made a family assistance order for 12 months. </p>

The boys continued to live with their father and their contact with their mother was only intermittent. In July 2018 the mother applied for the renewal of the family assistance order and in September 2018 for enforcement of the child arrangements order. In the course of those proceedings, a </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">report was commissioned from a child and adolescent psychologist, Ms Alice Rogers, who reported that Z was alienated from his mother and displaying signs of emotional harm. There were also concerns about his school attendance. This led the court, on the application of the guardian, to order a report from the local authority under s.37 of the Children Act. That report, completed in March 2019, concluded that Z was suffering significant harm as a result of the care provided by his parents. Despite this conclusion, the report did not recommend any proceedings under Part IV of the Act but, rather, a series of other measures under a child protection plan. At a hearing in April 2019, at which the guardian expressed the view that a supervision order was required, the court stated that it had grave concerns that no public law proceedings were being issued. Under the statutory scheme of the Children Act, of course, the court has no power to direct a local authority to issue proceedings, </p>

Face-to-face contact stopped in September 2019. Despite the guardian’s efforts, no progress was achieved and it seems the proceedings were drifting. Notwithstanding concerns about the father’s failure to promote Z’s relationship with his mother, and Z’s attendance at school, it was the local authority’s view that the child protection plan was sufficient intervention and that no court order was required. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">On the guardian’s further application, the court ordered a supplemental report from Ms Rogers. Because of restrictions imposed as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, her assessment was carried out via a telephone conversation with Z and a Skype call with his father. In her supplemental report, dated 16 April 2020, she summarised her opinion in these terms: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.00in;text-indent:0.00in">“Z remains extensively alienated from his mother; indeed, the situation is much worse than the last time I saw him, and he has had no contact with his mother for over six months now. He has attended school very little during year 10, which will have deeply damaged his educational prospects. Z’s presentation during clinical interview was somewhat improved, and he is no longer talking repeatedly of hurting other people or reporting suicidal thoughts …. </p>

Although he denies having influenced the boys, it was striking how similar his complaints are to Z’s; both use the same words …. It is quite possible that [the father] doesn’t have to say much now in order to alienate Z, but it is likely that he continues to say things, and to subtly reward rejection of [the mother]. I am absolutely clear in my opinion that he tries to obstruct the relationship …. </p>

It also means accepting that this 1- year-old-boy will not attend school or get an education. This is not tenable, and there should be a transfer of residence for Z to live with his mother. This will need to be done via a bridging placement; Z will need a chance to be parented effectively by trained carers, in order that he can learn that a typical boundary (you need to go to school even if you got a detention) is not abuse. He needs opportunity to reconnect with his mother, and develop a relationship with her. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">At a case management hearing in April following the filing of this report, the guardian supported Ms Rogers’ recommendation. The local authority acknowledged that the threshold criteria under s.31 of the Children Act were satisfied and indicated that it intended to instigate pre-proceedings procedures under the Public Law Outline in the Family Procedure Rules. A supplemental s.37 report was ordered to be filed by 20 July 2020 and the proceedings were listed for a final hearing in September 2020. In the event, the s.37 report was not filed on time and indeed not available when the matter came before the court for a pre-trial review. At that review, the father indicated he wished to pursue findings of fact against the mother and was directed to file a schedule of the findings he would invite the court to make. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Meanwhile, parenting assessments had been prepared by an independent social worker, Ms Francesca Serrette. Her report about the father had concluded that he remained fixated on historical issues about the marital relationship and had demonstrated that he was unable to separate his own emotional responses from the well-being of his child. He consistently cited the mother’s behaviour as the catalyst for the current situation and the harm allegedly caused to Z. Ms Serrette observed that Z had begun to make identical complaints about the mother and there was a view that he was being unduly influenced by his father’s views. It was considered that his diagnosis of autistic spectrum disorder left him more susceptible to influence and significantly vulnerable. The father’s own rigid thinking rendered him unable to understand or accept the impact of his parenting style. Ms Serrette concluded that, as a result, the father would be unable to support Z’s healthy growth and development. Although there were positive aspects of his parenting, in particular his basic care and his emotional warmth towards his son, he continued to find it difficult to separate his own feelings towards the mother from Z’s need to have a relationship with her. Ms Serrette also raised concerns about the father’s management of Z’s psychological development, specifically around the area of resilience, and noted that Z appeared to be under-stimulated and that there were issues around guidance and boundaries. Ms Serrette noted Ms Rogers’s recommendation but raised concern about the impact of such a significant change for Z and whether such a move would potentially generate further harm, given his current views and understanding of the world, his parents and his experiences. </p>

People try and make it better for families, but every family is different,  families  are not perfect  - they should not be stuck together.  I have made my point for so many years, I don’t want any contact, if I did change my mind I would let you know.  I don’t want to see her anymore. More and more people involved, but I don’t want to see my mum anymore and don’t want any contact with her at all”.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Secondly, it is argued that it was unfair of the court to make an interim care order having heard only the evidence of the professional witnesses and no evidence from the father. The judge was obliged to complete the evidence enquiry before making the draconian order of removing the child from his home and settled existence. The course adopted by the judge infringed the ancient principle <span style="font-style:italic">audi alteram partem</span><span style="text-decoration:underline"> </span>and the requirement to hear both sides which Mr Day described as a fundamental cornerstone of Article 6.

However, once she had decided to do that, fairness required that in this situation she should hear from both the accuser and the accused. There will be cases, for example where the court needs to hear and evaluate professional opinion, where it will be proper to hear from witnesses from one side only. This was not such a case. The investigation was a factual one into events where the parents were primary witnesses. It is no answer to say that the court would not have been helped by hearing their denials. They were not making bare denials but giving possible explanations for much of the evidence brought against them and, at least on paper, those explanations were not self-evidently implausible and deserved proper consideration. However, instead of taking them at face value (whatever that might be taken to mean), the judge largely left them out of account. The investigation that was carried out was therefore not fair and effective.” </p>

He argues that, contrary to Mr Day’s submission, there was an unusual abundance of evidence for a first interim care hearing on which the judge was entitled to rely. That evidence demonstrated that Z was continuing to suffer serious harm in his father’s care and the court’s intervention could not await a final hearing that was likely to be many months away. The judge specifically referred to a “balance of harm test” and there is ample evidence that she recognised the need for a balancing exercise and duly carried it out.  </p>

The fact that the oral evidence was stopped prior to the mother, father and guardian giving oral evidence at the discontinued final hearing did not render the process of the interim care order hearing unfair, confined as it was to an examination of interim threshold, whether an order should be made, and whether immediate separation was required. The decision was necessarily limited to issues that could not await the final hearing and the judge was careful not to make findings of fact at that stage. Mr Harris adds that, in any event, no application was made at the hearing on 12 November for the father or any other witness to give oral evidence </p>

As to capacity, it is submitted that the judge was entitled to rely on the recent assessment carried out by Z’s solicitor. Mr Harris draws attention to the judge’s observations in her judgment on 12 November that no one had challenged Ms Marsden’s assessment and that the question of competence would be kept under review. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Ms Magennis points out that no party invited the court to hear oral evidence at the hearing on 12 November and that is therefore surprising to find the father now suggesting that the court’s approach was procedurally irregular. The father had had six weeks between the adjournment of the private law proceedings on 30 September and the hearing of the application for an interim care order in which he could have filed a statement, but had not done so. The judge’s decision to refuse an adjournment was perfectly understandable given the urgency of the situation. The judge was obviously alive, as were the three professional witnesses and the guardian, to the ever-narrowing window of opportunity to effect any change in Z’s relationship with his mother and an equally narrowing window of opportunity to save his education. It was therefore entirely appropriate for the judge to proceed as she did on 12 November. The court was under no obligation to make any findings of fact at that stage. Such findings are not a “fundamental bedrock” for sanctioning the removal of the child. In fact, at the outset of proceedings when considering whether to make an interim care order, the court is usually not in a position to make any findings. Section 38 does not require the court make findings, nor to be satisfied that the s.31 criteria are proved but rather to be satisfied that “there are reasonable grounds” for believing that the threshold criteria are made out. Ms Magennis submitted that this case fell into the category identified by Peter Jackson LJ in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Re N</span> where the evidence adduced from Ms Rogers, Ms Serrette and Ms Alamutu consisted of professional opinion rather than factual matters. As a result, fairness did not in this case require the father to be given an opportunity to give evidence before a decision was taken as to whether or not the interim care order should be made.  </p>

Despite his age she was entitled to make a decision contrary to those expressed wishes and feelings if she considered it to be in his best welfare interests to do so. Criticisms of the judge’s approach to the question of Z’s capacity are misconceived because the court had before it the clear view as to competence expressed by the child’s very experienced solicitor. </p>

All the professionals involved with the family and the judge were rightly extremely concerned about Z’s extensive difficulties, in particular the breakdown in his relationship with his mother and his erratic school attendance, plus the growing evidence that the father was failing in a number of respects to provide him with appropriate care. The judge was understandably frustrated by the approach of the local authority which seemingly did not treat the case with the urgency it demanded. By the end of the hearing in September, and probably earlier, she had reached the conclusion that Z needed to be removed from his father’s care, but was unable to put that plan into effect until the local authority had identified a placement and started care proceedings. Once the local authority had taken those steps, the judge decided to act quickly to protect Z from further harm. Her judgment demonstrates that she considered relevant factors conscientiously, including Z’s wishes and feelings and the balance of harm which he would suffer depending on which course she took. </p>

There is also a further concern which was not expressly raised in the grounds of appeal but which troubled the Court on reading the papers. Although the judge was clear that she was making only an interim order, and not reaching final conclusions, the care plan she approved provided for the permanent removal of Z from his father’s care with the intention of placing him in the care of his mother within 3 to 6 months. </p>

In cases of more difficulty, the court will have to take a down to earth approach to determining the issue, avoiding too sophisticated an examination of the position and recognising that it is unlikely to be desirable (or even possible) to attempt to assemble definitive evidence about the matter at this stage of the proceedings. All will depend upon the individual circumstances of the case and it is impossible to provide a route map to the solution. However, it is worth noting particularly that, given the public funding problems, the judge will have to be sure to take whatever steps are possible to ensure that the child's point of view in relation to separate representation is sufficiently before the court. The judge will expect to be guided by the guardian and by those solicitors who have formed a view as to whether they could accept instructions from the child. Then it will be for the judge to form his or her own view on the material available at that stage in the proceedings, sometimes (but certainly not always) including expert opinion on the question of understanding (see <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Re H (A</span><span style="font-style:italic"> </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Minor)(Care Proceedings: Child's Wishes) </span>[1993] 1 FLR 440 at page 450). Understanding can be affected by all sorts of things, including the age of the child, his or her intelligence, his or her emotional and/or psychological and/or psychiatric and/or physical state, language ability, influence etc. The child will obviously need to comprehend enough of what the case is about (without being expected to display too sophisticated an understanding) and must have the capacity to give his or her own coherent instructions, without being more than usually inconsistent. If the judge requires an expert report to assist in determining the question of understanding, the child should be under no illusions about the importance of keeping the appointment with the expert concerned. It is an opportunity for the child to demonstrate that he or she does have the necessary understanding and there is always a risk that a failure to attend will be taken to show a failure to understand.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In this case, Z has been represented by a very experienced solicitor who has assessed his competence to give instructions at various stages of the private law proceedings. In July 2020, she reviewed the issue with the guardian and provided an updated report to the court prior to the hearing in September. The judge relied on this assessment in the private law proceedings and subsequently at the interim care hearing on 12 November. It is fair to say that no party challenged that course at the hearing. It might therefore be thought unfair of this Court to criticise either the judge or the child’s solicitor for the course that was taken. In my judgement, however, it was not appropriate for the court to rely on the July assessment at the hearing on 12 November, for three principal reasons. First, four months had passed since that assessment and, at Z’s age, the passage of such a period of time may be significant. Secondly, the distinction in the rules between specified and non-specified proceedings obliges the court to ensure that any assessment of competence in public law proceedings focuses on the issues arising in those proceedings which involve the statutory intrusion into family life and therefore inevitably an interference with Article 8 rights. Thirdly, on the specific facts of this case, the primary issues in the two sets of proceedings were different. The primary issue in the private law proceedings was whether Z should have contact with his mother. The primary issue in the public law proceedings at the interim stage was whether he should be removed from his father. If, as this Court observed in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Re S</span>, the level of understanding has to be assessed relatively to the issue in the proceedings, Z’s understanding of the issues surrounding the proposal that he be removed from the family home may be materially different to his understanding of the issues relating to contact with his mother. </p>

It extended to factual matters with which the father disagreed. It follows that, having regard to the distinction drawn by Peter Jackson LJ in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Re N</span>, I would accept the submission that, in the very specific and unusual circumstances of this case, fairness required the father be given an opportunity to adduce evidence before a decision was taken that the boy be removed from his care.

Rehabilitation to his father was expressly ruled out.

Further, as the judge had noted in the September judgement, there remain real doubts as to whether Z will ever be reconciled with his mother.

In my view, the case is sufficiently complex to justify allocation to a judge at High Court level.

It is essential that the rehearing of the interim care application be listed as soon as possible in January 2021.

It would have been open to the judge on 12 November to make a short-term interim care order for a few weeks and list the matter for further hearing at which evidence as to Z’s competence could have been filed together with a statement from the father and an appropriately-drafted care plan. In all the circumstances, satisfied as I am that the threshold under s.38 was plainly crossed in this case, I would now propose making a short-term interim care order to last until the next hearing. That order would be made on the basis of the revised interim care plan filed by the local authority this morning. In all the circumstances, I would not consider it in Z’s best interests to be returned to his father’s care for the next few weeks, when there is a real possibility that he may be removed again following the rehearing. </p>
