The Airports Commission’s brief was to evaluate and report on how any need for additional capacity should be met in the short, medium and long term.  The terms of reference of the Airports Commission required it to look, inter alia, at the environmental impact of meeting any capacity needs and required that the “Commission should base the recommendations in its final report on a detailed consideration of the case for each of the credible options. This should include the development or examination of detailed business cases and environmental assessments for each option, as well as consideration of their operational, commercial and technical viability”.

At the first of those meetings, which took place on 9 July 2015, the Department indicated that it wished the output of the meetings to be a “document that sets out commitments and gives confidence that parties can work together towards a successful project”. This document is what became known as the “Statement of Principles”, a final version of which was signed in June 2016. The HUB Statement of Principles was expressed to be a legally non-binding document containing the principles on which the Government and HUB intended to proceed “if the Government concludes no later than 31 October 2016 … that [HUB]’s Scheme is the preferred scheme” (see paragraph 1.5). It made clear that “at the date of signing this Statement of Principles … the Government has not yet formed a view on the recommendations in [the Airports Commission’s] Report as to how best to meet the need for more runway capacity in London and the south-east” (at paragraph 1.4). Similarly, the Statement of Principles stated that it “does not create any legitimate expectation, whether substantive or procedural, in relation to the exercise of functions of Government” (at paragraph 2.1.1). </p>

However, respite would decrease from one half to one third of the day. The Heathrow Extended Northern Runway scheme has much less potential for respite. It would use both runways for arrivals and departures for most of the day, although it may be able to ‘switch off’ one runway for a short time during non-peak periods with a corresponding reduction in capacity. </p>

It delivers greater capacity (estimated on a like for like basis by the Airports Commission at 740,000 flights departing and arriving per annum compared to the Extended Northern Runway scheme at 700,000),  accordingly higher economic benefits, and a broader route network.

However, the underlying rationale is that, where a public authority has given a promise or adopted a practice which represents how it is going to act in a given matter or area, in certain circumstances, the law may impose an obligation on the authority to honour that promise or practice unless there is good reason not to do so. An individual may then challenge a decision that breaches that promise, or fails to comply with that practice, even when he has no enforceable statutory, contractual or other legal right to call upon.  </p>

Whilst such categories cannot be seen as hermetically sealed or mutually exclusive, as we understand Mr Kingston’s submission, the alleged legitimate expectation here falls into category (4). Given that, but for his assurance or promise that he would not do so, the Secretary of State could quite properly have taken into account the unique deliverability risks in respect of the ENR scheme, the legitimate expectation arose as the result of particular assurances that he would deal with the selection of the preferred scheme in a particular way, i.e. by ignoring any deliverability risk that arises from the fact that HUB do not own/operate Heathrow and will not in any event implement the ENR scheme themselves.

As Mr Palmer QC pointed out, the Airports Commission Report was not part of any procurement process. The Airports Commission’s function was to look at possible technical solutions for the aviation capacity problem in the South of England. There was nothing in the Airports Commission’s terms of reference to suggest that the Secretary of State required the Airports Commission to consider promoterspecific issues.

The growing realisation of the difficulties of getting HAL to co-operate with HUB when they were competitors for the same prize did not amount to an unequivocal representation that HUB would not be required to get some sort of letter of comfort in advance of the Preference Decision. In any event, the process leading up to the Preference Decision was governed by the Statement of Principles.

First, that the Secretary of State accepted the recommendation of the Airports Commission that the NWR was to be preferred to the ENR.  Second, there were sound objective reasons for the conclusion that the NWR would deliver the greatest overall benefits, economic and otherwise, and there was no good reason to depart from the Airports Commission’s recommendation despite the extensive review which subsequently took place. Third, against that background, it was immaterial whether or not any Assurance was obtained by HUB from HAL in respect of delivering the ENR scheme.  The obtaining of an Assurance would only have been a material factor if good reason had been found for preferring the ENR over the NWR in the first place.  Manifestly this was not the case.  Furthermore, it is important to distinguish between the situation before and after the Preference Decision was made. The Secretary of State formally accepted the Airports Commission recommendation that the NWR was objectively the better scheme following the meeting of the Cabinet on 25 October 2016; thereafter, the question of the absence of an Assurance became irrelevant. </p>

The Department commissioned a technical report from York Aviation in order to provide reassurance as to the Airports Commission’s conclusions on the relative merits of certain aspects of the NWR scheme and the ENR scheme. The Divisional Court held that, although the operator of Gatwick Airport had improved the objective merits of its Gatwick Scheme, “the merits of the ENR scheme had remained exactly the same” ([138(vi)]).  Mr Kingston challenged this finding.  He relied upon an acknowledgment in the evidence of Ms Low that HUB were able to point to an aspect of the Commission’s findings on air quality which HUB successfully challenged.

The Divisional Court set out the note of the meeting in full (at [85]). We summarise the essence of the note as follows.  The Secretary of State was asked specifically whether the absence of an Assurance from HAL was “a factor” in his decision to designate the ANPS.  He explained that the matter needed to be looked at “the other way round”.  He said that the decision to designate the ANPS was based on the Government’s acceptance of the Airports Commission’s recommendations.  When he took over as Secretary of State, the only question was whether there was “anything new” to change the view that the Airports Commission had “got it right”.  Nothing had changed as regards the objective merits of the ENR scheme.  There had to be a good reason for departing from the recommendations of the Airports Commission.  The absence of an Assurance from HAL was simply an additional reason for not overturning the Airports Commission’s conclusions.

Secondly, the Scheme’s promoters could not ultimately provide the certainty that it would be built and adapted by [HAL], if we opted for it rather than for the main route.  Those, to my mind, are two strong reasons.  However, I pay tribute again to the promoters.  It was a very innovative concept, and we gave it very serious thought.

Third, although the provisions of the CAA 2012 acted as constraints on HAL’s ability to charge fees rather than the grant of special or exclusive rights, the history of Heathrow demonstrated that HAL had not accumulated its substantial market power in a competitive market ([182(iii-iv)].

HAL’s CAA licence does not grant it any special rights or geographical or other exclusivity.   The licence acts as a constraint.   Further, other companies with relevant airport facilities in the Heathrow area can also apply for a licence.  HAL’s licence gives it no power to restrict other persons carrying on airport operation activities at Heathrow.  The fact that HAL is the owner and operator of airport facilities in the Heathrow area is not the consequence of any licence but simply the result of historical circumstance to which the licensing regime applies. </p>

In order for the State Measure to constitute a breach, the “conflict” it creates would need to be liable to obstruct the achievement of the intended outcomes of Article 102 by producing, in a relevant economic market, anti-competitive consequences similar to those which Article 102 exists to prevent. </p>

Even on the premise that this competition took place within the relevant South East Market for airport services in the South East, there is no basis for suggesting the request introduced a structural feature in the South East Market. The request itself made no alteration to the structure of the South East Market or to the conditions under which competition was taking place in that market.  In any event, the Divisional Court’s factual findings do not show that the request was liable to distort even the “competition” between runway schemes to be selected as the preferred scheme, let alone that any supposed “conflict of interest” on the part of HAL was liable to distort or otherwise harm competition in the South East Market. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in">HUB finally argue by their Appeal Ground 2 that the Divisional Court was wrong to find that there was no distortion of competition because of the fact that a subsequent DCO application might be made.  Both HAL’s and HUB’s schemes involved the building of a new runway and associated airport facilities at Heathrow. The Preference Decision was concerned with the selection of a suitable runway scheme for national planning policy purposes.  The question of who - whether HAL or someone else - would build those facilities was a separate matter to be decided in due course.  Whilst it is likely to be HAL, the Divisional Court’s reference to and reliance upon the DCO was nevertheless a relevant consideration.  Even if and insofar as HAL had, as a result of the request for an Assurance, been placed in a position where it could have influenced the Preference Decision against the ENR scheme, this would not have sufficed to show that the request by the Secretary of State for an Assurance was liable to distort competition in the SouthEast Market identified by the Divisional Court. </p>

We should also make it clear, however, that our own observations on these matters do not bear on our reasoning on the decisive issues in the appeal before us. Nor should they be taken as resolving questions that may in the future have to be decided by another court, in different circumstances and on different evidence and argument. It follows, therefore, that the competition law issues themselves remain moot. </p>
