	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The right of an aggrieved party to seek judicial review of a planning decision is an important safeguard to prevent capricious or irrational decision-making. Too often, however, such challenges can depart radically from the original planning objections, and focus instead on what might be called generic failures to comply with statutory obligations which have never before been raised. Two regular candidates for such after-the-event challenges are the planning authority’s alleged failure to have regard to the Public Sector Equality Duty (“PSED”) and the failure to require a proper Environmental Statement (“ES”). Sometimes, these kinds of challenge can take on an arid quality, raising matters of form rather than substance. This appeal involves challenges on both these grounds, based on complaints which had not been raised by the appellant (or his predecessor, the relevant Parish Council) during the lengthy planning process. The respondent submits that this is an academic challenge because, even if the breaches are made out, the court can be confident that the same planning decision would have been taken. </p>

On 4 December 2018, Lakenheath Parish Council (“the PC”) applied for permission to bring judicial review proceedings of that decision. Although there were originally three grounds on which that application was made, permission was granted for ground 3 only, in respect of the adequacy of the ES.

In an <span style="font-style:italic">ex tempore</span> judgment ([2019] EWHC 978 (Admin)), the judge refused permission to apply for judicial review on grounds 1 and 2 and rejected the claim for judicial review in respect of ground 3. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The PC decided not to appeal further. However, the appellant, who said that he had worked alongside members of the PC during the planning process, was substituted for the PC in this appeal. He sought to appeal on all three grounds, although the skeleton argument produced on his behalf was limited to a third attempt to obtain permission to argue the PSED ground, and the ES appeal. Although Mr Streeten’s skeleton argument was silent as to why the appellant wished to prevent the building of a new school to meet the proposed expansion of Lakenheath, it emerged towards the end of the hearing that he favours an alternative site for the school, which was considered by the respondent but rejected for various reasons. </p>

Item 2.2.13 states that this would be a suitable site for the school and it was also described as being well located to the rest of Lakenheath but ruled out because of the access into the site being constrained and a concern of congestion to the local highway network, something the chosen site would cause too. Maids Cross Hill, owned by the diocese, was ruled out as it’s outside of the development boundary of Lakenheath and for being isolated. Just as the chosen site is. Sparks Farm again refers to the site being detached from the Lakenheath Settlement and having the potential of causing highway issues, again just as the chosen site will.

In my judgment, the officer's report and, therefore, the planning authority's decision in reliance upon it, can be demonstrated evidentially to have satisfied this requirement, despite the absence of explicit reference to it in literal terms. All concerned identified and reflected upon the excessive levels of noise that would exist in the outdoor areas surrounding the new school. Steps were taken either to remove the disadvantages for those with protected characteristics, in the conditions attached to the planning permission, by the requirements that would achieve quieter indoor sound levels in the new school than would be provided to those groups in the existing school or to minimise them by the provision in the outdoor areas of noise attenuation shelters designed and constructed to achieve an approved standard. By providing that removal or minimisation of the disadvantages, while also providing new school places, shows that regard was had to meeting the needs of children with relevant protected characteristics to be placed in mainstream education who would live in the new housing. The effect would be to encourage their participation in the activity of education to which, therefore, due regard was had.”   </p>

The question for the planning authority, therefore, was to decide whether the adverse environmental impact of excessive noise at the proposed site weighed in the scale of planning decision making so heavily as to require refusal of permission. That is to conduct an EIA, at least in substance, which is what the authorities require this court to evaluate. Moreover, it is material that at no stage has the claimant, or anyone else, identified yet further alternatives to be considered. The planning decision in this case proceeded upon the conclusion that even the adverse impact of excessive outdoor noise at the proposed site, balanced against the needs and benefits identified, justified the grant of planning permission, even though the environmental impact at alternatives sites considered was either no worse or in many, if not most cases, less severe or even absent. That is a matter for the planning judgement of the officers and the authority. I do not consider that the officer's report materially misled the planning authority in this respect. Accordingly, ground 3 of the challenge fails.”  </p>

On the contrary in this case, the promotors of the proposal were well aware of the PSED. I have already set out at paragraph 12 the relevant section of the ES which expressly referred to the PSED. That was accompanied by the clear statement that the design did not take into account the needs of students with protected characteristics. That was not picked up anywhere in the officer’s report, as it should have been, and there is nothing in the report or the subsequent decision to show that any regard was had to the PSED.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In my view, this analysis represents a complete answer to Mr Ground QC’s complaint that the failure to have regard to the PSED in respect of the outdoor areas was not something that was raised by the PC or the appellant during the planning process. Although that is correct as a matter of fact (the current headteacher of the primary school raised the point in her letter dated 27 July 2016, but it was not subsequently taken up by the PC or the appellant), whether or not it was raised by a member of the public was irrelevant, given that it was something which the promotors of the proposal themselves had referred to.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Secondly, although Mr Ground QC may have been right to submit that the mitigation measures for the outdoor areas identified in the ES would disproportionately help those who were sensitive to noise, that approach runs the risk of treating the PSED as a duty to achieve a result, rather than a duty to have regard to the needs of those with protected characteristics. I accept that this may be a relatively fine line in this case. I also accept that the mitigation measures are directly relevant to the second part of the judicial review exercise concerned with whether or not the decision should be quashed on the basis of a failure to have due regard to the PSED. But I am not persuaded that the existence of the mitigation measures alone can mean that the respondent somehow had due regard to the PSED, when the officer’s report made no mention of it, and the mitigation measures were generic, so were not targeted at those children with protected characteristics. </p>

At [63] the judge said, “I have come to the conclusion that the approach adopted in this case as a matter of form was not on its face adequate. Not to mention the existence or applicability of the duty makes it difficult to say that the evidential element of demonstration of regard to it has been discharged.” That came on top of his earlier concern about the lack of any reference to the needs, within the cohort of children generally, of those with relevant protected characteristics [58], and his observation that a potential relevant factor ignored in the balance were the needs of those with protected characteristics [60]. There is no appeal from those findings. </p>

We remind ourselves that our starting point here is not to consider the merit of Mr Streeten's argument on the scope of the duty in section 31(2A). We are not re-making the permission decision, or even at this stage considering whether there is a "powerful probability" that Rafferty L.J.'s decision to refuse permission was wrong. In our view, however, the proposition that the section 31(2A) duty applies only to "conduct" of a merely "procedural" or "technical" kind, and not also to "conduct" that goes to the substantive decision-making itself, is a surprising concept. The duty has regularly been applied to substantive decision-making across the whole spectrum of administrative action, including in the sphere of planning, both at first instance and in decisions of this court (see, for example, the judgment of Lindblom L.J. in <span style="font-style:italic">R.

Although we did not hear full argument on the point, we would be prepared to say that the narrow construction of section 31(2A) contended for by the parish council is, on the face of it, mistaken. It does not seem to us to gain any real support in the first instance decisions on which Mr Streeten relied. The concept of "conduct" in section 31(2A) is a broad one, and apt to include both the making of substantive decisions and the procedural steps taken in the course of decisionmaking. It is not expressly limited to "procedural" conduct. Nor, in our view, is such a qualification implied. But this, we must stress, is not a necessary conclusion for the purposes of our decision on the application to re-open… </p>

If, however, the court is to consider whether a particular outcome was "highly likely" not to have been substantially different if the conduct complained of had not occurred, it must necessarily undertake its own objective assessment of the decision-making process, and what its result would have been if the decision-maker had not erred in law. </p>

Mr Streeten highlighted Cranston J.'s use of the word "weighty" in paragraph 69 of his judgment to describe the factors seen by the district council's officer as going in favour of the grant of planning permission, and outweighing the harm to the conservation area. Rafferty L.J., however, was plainly unpersuaded that this was anything other than the judge's description of the officer's own planning assessment, supported, to the extent it was, by the conservation officer's response. She plainly also accepted that the officer's assessment had, quite legitimately, informed, but not dictated, the judge's own conclusion in performing the section 31(2A) duty.

The problem of noise for all children, including those with protected characteristics, cannot therefore be wished away: the only thing that can be done is to locate and design the school in a way that ensures that the effect of such noise is mitigated as well as it can be. The documents show that that is what has happened here: there can be no doubt that the issue of noise was carefully considered, first in the ES, and then in the officer’s report. </p>

As to the outdoor mitigation measures, they were the subject of the officer’s report, and included noise mitigating huts and sound-limiting pods. And as the report made clear, the design/specification means that the internal noise environment for the new school will be superior to that in the existing school. As a result, it is highly likely that the missing sentence or paragraph in the officer’s report addressing the PSED and noise, would not have made any difference to the decision.  </p>

Such a requirement would lead to major additional expense, and endless disputes between developer and objector about what is or is not a ‘main’ alternative. If, for example, alternative X would cost four times as much to develop as the proposed site, and there is also what the planning officer considers to be a sound environmental reason for the rejection of alternative X, capable of being stated in one line, then the authority is entitled to discount alternative X on that basis. Anything else would lead to a natural tendency on the part of developers to address as few alternative sites as possible in the ES – because of the cost and trouble of so doing - which would be the opposite of what the Directive was designed to achieve. </p>

Ground 1 in these proceedings is an example of the unduly legalistic approach to the requirements of Sch.4 to the Regulations that has been adopted on behalf of claimants in a number of applications for judicial review seeking to prevent the implementation of development proposals. The Regulations should be interpreted as a whole and in a common-sense way. The requirement that ‘‘an EIA application’’ (as defined in the Regulations) must be accompanied by an environmental statement is not intended to obstruct such development. As Lord Hoffmann said in R. v North Yorkshire CC Ex p. Brown [2000] 1 A.C. 397, at p.404, the purpose is ‘‘to ensure that planning decisions which may affect the environment are made on the basis of full information’’. In an imperfect world it is an unrealistic counsel of perfection to expect that an applicant’s environmental statement will always contain the ‘‘full information’’ about the environmental impact of a project. The Regulations are not based upon such an unrealistic expectation. They recognise that an environmental statement may well be deficient, and make provision through the publicity and consultation processes for any deficiencies to be identified so that the resulting ‘‘environmental information’’ provides the local planning authority with as full a picture as possible. There will be cases where the document purporting to be an environmental statement is so deficient that it could not reasonably be described as an environmental statement as defined by the Regulations (Tew was an example of such a case), but they are likely to be few and far between.” </p>

In <span style="text-decoration:underline">Blewett,</span> the complaint was that the environmental statement for a proposed extension to a landfill site contained no assessment of the effect of the scheme on groundwater protection. Instead, the minerals planning authority decided that that matter could be left to be assessed following the grant of planning permission, by assuming that complex mitigation measures would be successful. Sullivan J held that the starting point was that it was for the local planning authority to decide whether the information supplied by the applicant was sufficient to meet the definition of an environmental statement in the EIA Regulations, subject to review on normal <span style="text-decoration:underline">Wednesbury</span> principles (see [32]-[33]). Information capable of meeting the requirements in schedule 4 to the EIA Regulations should be provided (see [34]), but a failure to describe a likely significant effect on the environment does not result in the document submitted failing to qualify as an environmental statement or in the local planning authority lacking jurisdiction to determine the planning application. Instead, deficiencies in the environmental information provided may lead to the authority deciding to refuse permission, in the exercise of its judgment (see [40]). Thus, the statement in [41], that the deficiencies must be such that the document could not <span style="font-style:italic">reasonably</span> be described as an environmental statement in accordance with the EIA Regulations, was in line with the judge's earlier observations in [32][33].

He considered that the significance or otherwise of those matters had been a matter for the local authority to determine. The claimant's criticisms did not show that topics such as modal split or noise effects had not been assessed at all. Instead, they related to the level of detail into which the assessment had gone and hence its quality.

They also agreed with [434] of the Divisional Court decision, to the effect that “decisions on the inclusion or non-inclusion in the Environmental Report of information on a particular subject, or the nature or level of detail of that information, or the nature of extent of the analysis carried out, are matters of judgment for the plan-making authority.” This court also referred to <span style="font-style:italic">Ashdown Forest Economic Development LLP v Weald and District Council </span>[2015] EWCA Civ 684; [2016] ENV. L.R. 2 where Richards LJ said that “the identification of reasonable alternatives… is a matter of evaluative assessment for the local planning authority, subject to review by the court on normal public law principles, including [‘<span style="font-style:italic">Wednesbury’</span>]<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>unreasonableness”.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.20in">“136. The answer, we think, must be apt to the provisions themselves. The court’s role in ensuring that an authority - here the Secretary of State - has complied with the requirements of article 5 and Annex I when preparing an environmental report, must reflect the breadth of the discretion given to it to decide what information “may reasonably be required” when taking into account the considerations referred to - first, “current knowledge and methods of assessment”; second, “the contents and level of detail in the plan or programme”; third, “its stage in the decision-making process”; and fourth “the extent to which certain matters are more appropriately assessed at different levels in that process in order to avoid duplication of the assessment”. These requirements leave the authority with a wide range of autonomous judgment on the adequacy of the information provided. It is not for the court to fix this range of judgment more tightly than is necessary. The authority must be free to form a reasonable view of its own on the nature and amount of information required, with the specified considerations in mind. This, in our view, indicates a conventional “Wednesbury” standard of review - as adopted, for example, in <span style="font-style:italic">Blewett</span>. A standard more intense than that would risk the court being invited, in effect, to substitute its own view on the nature and amount of information included in environmental reports for that of the decision-maker itself. This would exceed the proper remit of the court.” </p>

Site 2 was currently woodland and the ES (and the officer’s report) expressly referred to the ecological and visual impact of cutting down trees, some of which were subject to TPOs. It was expressly said that Site 2 was a wildlife corridor.  Site 3, the site that the appellant favours, was noted as having constrained access. Potential access roads would have to come through residential estates and there was the potential for highway congestion. Those were all environmental negatives. More significantly still, the ES and the officer’s report expressly noted that the noise levels for Site 3 would be similar to the existing school and therefore in excess of the noise levels at the proposed site. And Site 6 was discounted in the ES and the officer’s report because it was detached from the Lakenheath settlement so that there was the potential of highway issues. Again more significantly it was at the end of the runway and directly beneath the take-off path so the short term noise was “likely to be very high”. </p>

Moreover, the question of sufficiency of information was, as per <span style="font-style:italic">Blewett </span>and<span style="font-style:italic"> Ashdown Forest, </span>classically a matter for the decision-maker.

I disagree as a matter of fact. Sites 1 and 4 were discounted on the basis that they were too isolated. It is trite that, in planning terms, if a site is isolated, it means that it is more difficult to access and is more likely to require greater vehicular travel to and from the site itself. That is an environmental issue. Site 5 was discounted on the basis that its southerly location in the village was not ideal when considered against the planned growth of the village. In other words, it was not near the proposed new developments, so there would be longer journeys to Site 5 if that was where the school was located. Again that is an environmental consideration. </p>

It is important that these two questions are dealt with separately. For the reasons which I have given, I would reject the allegation of breach.

It is not possible to read the two together. However, this court does not have to decide the second issue (namely whether, in such circumstances, Section 31(2A) has to be discounted altogether) because Mr Ground QC was content on the facts of this case to accept and meet that higher test.  </p>

One question, as reformulated by the court (para 39), was whether article 10a was to be interpreted as precluding decisions of national courts that make the admissibility of actions subject to conditions requiring the person bringing the action – “… to prove that the procedural defect invoked is such that, in the light of the circumstances of the case, there is a possibility that the contested Page 26 decision would have been different were it not for the defect and that a substantive legal position is affected thereby… </p>

But if the challenge was sustainable, on the basis that there should have been more environmental information about the main alternatives, that was a procedural defect only and did not have any substantive effect on the decision. The defect would have made no difference: the planning decision would have been the same, even if the error had not been made. The appellant and the public always received full information and participated in the process for more than three years. Moreover, the prejudice if the decision was now quashed would be serious and significant, because it would mean that there was no school, and no proposal for a school, to accommodate the children of those moving into the 663 new homes in Lakenheath.  </p>
