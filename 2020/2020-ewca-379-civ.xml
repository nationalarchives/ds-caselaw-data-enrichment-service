	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In this judicial review, the Applicant Vincent Nolson sought to challenge the decision of the Defendant housing authority (“the Council”) to continue to provide him with interim accommodation under section 188 of the Housing Act 1996 (“the 1996 Act”).  In the claim, he applied for interim relief, which was refused by Butcher J.  The Applicant applied, purportedly under CPR rule 54.12(3), to have that order reconsidered at an oral hearing.  Anthony Metzer QC sitting as a Deputy Judge of the High Court refused that application on the basis that he had no jurisdiction to consider it, holding that rule 54.12(3) did not apply and the appropriate procedural course to challenge the decision to refuse interim relief was to appeal to the Court of Appeal (Civil Division).  On 24 October 2019, I refused permission to appeal.  The Applicant applied to re-open the appeal. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The factual background is lengthy and complex, but can be shortly stated for the purposes of this application.  In November 2016, the Applicant relinquished the tenancy of a property which he rented from the Council to move into his wife’s home.  On 14 February 2019, he was arrested following an incident at that address, in which he was alleged to have assaulted his wife.  The following day, he sought housing assistance from the Council and, following an interview and given his complex support needs, he was accommodated temporarily in a nursing home.  However, following the usual procedure, on 8 May 2019, the Council concluded that the Applicant, although eligible for assistance, homeless and in priority need, was intentionally homeless and so not entitled to housing.  The Applicant requested a review of that decision under section 202 of the 1996 Act.  Prior to the review decision being made, on 7 August 2019 he filed an appeal in the county court under section 204 of the 1996 Act against the intentional homelessness decision. </p>

Accordingly, on 5 September 2019 the Council wrote to him indicating that it considered it no longer had any duty to provide him with any accommodation. </p>

However, although <span style="text-decoration:underline">Lawer</span> is frequently cited as authority for the proposition, it was this court which, expressly disapproving the application of the balance of convenience test for negative interim relief as set out in <span style="text-decoration:underline">American Cyanamid Company v Ethicon Limited</span> [1975] AC 396, had earlier established that an interim mandatory injunction requiring a local authority to perform its statutory housing duty would not be granted unless the applicant could show at least a strong prima facie case (<span style="text-decoration:underline">De Falco v Crawley Borough Council</span> [1980] QB 460 at pages 478 and 481, as confirmed in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Francis v Royal London Borough of</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">Kensington and Chelsea</span> [2003] EWCA Civ 443; [2003] 1 WLR 2248 at [16], both homelessness cases).     </p>

The appeal was allowed, and the decision based on the Applicant’s intentional homelessness was quashed; with the result that he was offered (and he accepted) accommodation pending further enquiries into his homelessness application.  Thus, interim relief was effectively obtained.  Consequently, it is common ground that this appeal, which only concerns interim relief, would now be academic.  However, Mr Southey for the Applicant submits that there are nevertheless good grounds for this court both to reopen the appeal and to grant permission to appeal. </p>

As a jurisdictional matter, that further application could itself be dealt with under CPR rule 23.8(c), on the papers and without an oral hearing; but, as the court in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Collier v</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">Williams</span> indicated, to avoid a potentially endless loop of applications on the same basis, it is usually good practice to require any application under rule 3.3(5) to be dealt with at an oral hearing because, absent substantially different material, any further application under the same provision can then be struck out as an abuse of process. </p>

However, under the provisions of the CPR to which I have referred as confirmed in that authority, the Applicant in this case clearly did have a right to make an application to set aside, vary or stay the order made on the papers by Butcher J refusing his application for interim relief.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Whilst generally this court is reluctant to hear appeals which are academic as between the parties, relying upon the observations of Lord Slynn of Hadley in <span style="text-decoration:underline">R v Secretary of</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">State for the Home Department ex parte Salem</span> [1999] 1 AC 450 at page 457A, Mr Southey submits that this appeal should be allowed to proceed on public interest grounds.  Butcher J refused the application on the basis that a strong prima facie case is required if interim relief is to be granted in a housing case.  However, that approach has recently been questioned in <span style="text-decoration:underline">R (Esposito) v London Borough of Camden</span> [2017] EWHC 3124 (Admin) at [22], where May J doubted the usefulness of the dichotomy between “strong prima facie case” and “arguable case”.  Mr Southey submits that this court in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Francis</span> (see paragraph 8 above) did not have before it, and did not take into account, <span style="text-decoration:underline">R v Secretary of State for Transport ex parte Factortame Limited</span> (No 2) [1991] 1 AC 603 which, at pages 682-3, as confirmed in <span style="text-decoration:underline">National Commercial Bank Jamaica</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">Limited v Olint Corporation Limited</span> [2009] UKPC 16; [2009] 1 WLR 1405 at [19], eschewed any difference in principle in this context between applications for negative and applications for positive interim relief.  <span style="text-decoration:underline">Francis</span> is therefore <span style="font-style:italic">per incuriam</span>; and this court should take the opportunity presented by this case to reconsider the test for interim housing relief.  Whilst academic as between the parties on the facts of this case, interim relief in housing cases is sought in many cases every day; and, because it concerns interim relief in an emergency context, it is an issue which is unlikely to arise before this court in anything other than a case which has since become academic as between the specific parties on the specific facts. </p>
