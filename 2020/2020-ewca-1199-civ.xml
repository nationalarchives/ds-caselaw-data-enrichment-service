	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The Appellants in these proceedings challenge the changes brought about by a series of Pensions Acts between 1995 and 2014 which equalised the state pension age for women with that of men by raising the state pension age for women from 60 to 65 and then raised the age at which both men and women can claim their state pension.  The Pensions Act 1995 raised the state pension age for women on an incremental basis starting with those reaching age 60 in 2010.  A woman born before 6 April 1950 would still receive her state pension at age 60 but a woman born after that date would only receive her pension on a specified date when she was aged between 60 and 65, depending on her date of birth.  The Pensions Acts 2007, 2011 and 2014 then accelerated the move to age 65 as the state pension age for women and raised the state pension age for some men and women to 66, 67 or 68 depending on their date of birth.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The Appellants are two women born in the 1950s and now have a state pension age of 66.  Their challenge to the legislation at base is that although one of the aims of the Pensions Act 1995 was to end the discrimination based on gender that had previously allowed women to claim their pension five years earlier than men, this equalisation has run ahead of actual improvements in the economic position of women in their age group.  They say that they were in no better position in terms of opportunities for stable, well-paid work than women born earlier than them who have not been caught by the legislation and have continued to receive their pensions at age 60.  The Appellants say further that women born in the 1950s were not treated equally with men during their working lives and they therefore arrive at their early 60s in a poorer financial position than men of that age, making it harder for many of them to manage without a state pension.  The Appellants argue that the legislation does not therefore end discrimination but in fact gives rise to direct age discrimination contrary to Article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights (‘ECHR’) in conjunction with Article 1 of the First Protocol (‘A1P1’), indirect sex discrimination contrary to EU law and indirect discrimination contrary to Article 14 on grounds of sex or of sex and age combined.  They also claim that the Respondent failed in her duty to notify them far enough in advance of the fact that they would not, as they expected, start receiving their pension at age 60.  Finally, they argue that they should have been granted the declaratory relief they sought, even though it is now many years since the legislation that they challenge came into force. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The state pension was introduced in 1909 as a means tested pension for men and women over the age of 70, reduced to age 65 for both men and women in 1925.  The Old Age and Widows’ Pensions Act 1940 provided for a differential in the pension age for men and women when the age was lowered to 60 for women but remained at 65 for men.  The modern national insurance scheme was established in 1946 to provide a range of welfare benefits including pensions and to fund the National Health Service.  Individuals and employers pay national insurance contributions into a fund and benefits are paid out of that fund on a ‘pay as you go’ basis, this year’s contributions funding this year’s benefits.  In some years, contributions to the national insurance fund have not been sufficient to cover payments out and in that event the fund is supplemented by a grant from the Consolidated Fund.  A person’s eligibility for state pension depends on the contributions made by him or her between the ages of 16 and their state pension age.  Since 1959 the rate of contribution has been linked to earnings.  A welfare benefit known as pension credit was introduced in October 2003 to replace income support for pensioners and is paid to those with modest incomes.  Pension credit is based on financial need and a claimant is entitled to the benefit whether or not they have paid national insurance contributions.  </p>

The details of the changes are not relevant to the issues raised in this appeal so we need provide only a summary here.  One of the triggers for a reconsideration of the different pension ages of men and women was the decision of the European Court of Justice (“CJEU”) in Case C262/88 <span style="font-style:italic">Barber v Guardian Royal Exchange Assurance Group </span>[1991] 1 QB 344.  In that case the CJEU held that it was contrary to what is now Article 157 TFEU to impose an age condition which differed according to gender for the purpose of entitlement to a pension under a private occupational pension scheme, even if the difference between the pensionable age for men and that for women was based on that provided for by the national statutory scheme.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The Pensions Act 1995 equalised the state pension age by increasing the age for women to 65.  The relevant provisions are contained in section 126 of, and Part 1 of Schedule 4 to, that Act.  Women born before 6 April 1950 retained the entitlement to state pension at age 60 and women born after 5 April 1955 reached state pension age at 65.  The pension age for women born between those two dates was increased incrementally, moving up by a number of months from age 60 to 65 for each successive monthly cohort of women so that the pension age was close to 60 for a woman born shortly after 6 April 1950 and close to 65 for those born shortly before 5 April 1955.   </p>

He gave as the first reason for refusing permission that the application was “well and truly out of time” and that there was no case for an extension of time.  Following an oral hearing of the Appellants’ renewed application for permission, however, Lang J granted an extension of time to 30 July 2018 for filing the claim, if the extension of time was required. </p>

The Appellants relied on both a general EU principle of non-discrimination and on the Equality Directive, Council Directive 2000/78/EC of 27 November 2000.  The Court dismissed this claim on the grounds that the general principle did not apply because the payment of state pension did not come within the ambit of EU law concerning age discrimination and further that state pensions were excluded from the scope of the Equality Directive by Article 3(3) of that Directive: [37] and [41].

The Court rejected this claim on two bases.  First, they accepted the SSWP’s submission that the Appellants could not rely on a comparator group comprising women born before 6 April 1950 who were unaffected by the changes.  This was because the case law of the European Court of Human Rights (‘ECtHR’) showed, they held, that two cohorts are not comparable for the purposes of Article 14 where they are legitimately subject to different legislative regimes: [52].  Secondly, they held that the legislation was justified because the evidence established that it was not manifestly without reasonable foundation </p>

They held that the claim was precluded by the derogation in Article 7(1)(a) which permits Member States to exclude the determination of pensionable age from its scope: [64].  As regards the claim of sex discrimination contrary to the ECHR, the Divisional Court accepted the SSWP’s argument that there could be no direct discrimination on the grounds of gender, or age combined with gender, in circumstances where the legislation simply removed the advantage that had previously existed in favour of women: [70].  The Divisional Court decided there was no indirect discrimination contrary to the Convention because of the absence of a causal link between the measures and the disadvantages accruing to women or to women in this age group: [73].

The Court held that the claim failed as a matter of law because no promise or representation had been made by the Government beyond a promise that Parliament would not change the state pension age without prior consultation.  There had been widespread consultation with interested bodies before each of the Pensions Acts: [118].  Further, a failure to give notice could not lead to the abrogation of the relevant statute so that even if the court were able to impose obligations of notice arising from common law fairness, no breach could require or empower the court to suspend the operation of primary legislation: [119].

The Court has established in its case-law that only differences in treatment based on an identifiable characteristic, or “status”, are capable of amounting to discrimination within the meaning of Article 14. Moreover, in order for an issue to arise under Article 14 there must be a difference in the treatment of persons in analogous, or relevantly similar, situations. Such a difference in treatment is discriminatory if it has no objective and reasonable justification; in other words, if it does not pursue a legitimate aim or if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised. The Contracting State enjoys a margin of appreciation in assessing whether and to what extent differences in otherwise similar situations justify a different treatment. The scope of this margin will vary according to the circumstances, the subject-matter and the background. A wide margin is usually allowed to the State under the Convention when it comes to general measures of economic or social strategy. Because of their direct knowledge of their society and its needs, the national authorities are in principle better placed than the international judge to appreciate what is in the public interest on social or economic grounds, and the Court will generally respect the legislature’s policy choice unless it is “manifestly without reasonable foundation”.” </p>

Submissions about the extreme financial hardship that might result from the failure to uprate pensions were not relevant because a court was not in a position to assess the effect of the system on the many thousands who were in the same position as the claimants.  The court’s role was to determine the issue of principle, namely whether the legislation as such unlawfully discriminated between people in an analogous situation: [62].  The ECtHR said that, although there is no obligation on a state to create a welfare or pension scheme, if a state does so, that legislation generates a proprietary interest falling within the ambit of A1P1 for persons satisfying its requirements.  The claim therefore fell within the scope of A1P1 so that Article 14 was engaged.  The ECtHR went on to reject the claim on the ground that the claimants were not in an analogous position to pensioners resident in the United Kingdom.  The fact that the claimants had paid national insurance contributions when they worked in the United Kingdom was not sufficient to put them in a relevantly similar situation to pensioners resident in the UK.  Such a contention, the ECtHR said: </p>

Unlike private pension schemes, where premiums are paid into a specific fund and where those premiums are directly linked to the expected benefit returns, National Insurance contributions have no exclusive link to retirement pensions. Instead, they form a source of part of the revenue which pays for a whole range of social security benefits, including incapacity benefits, maternity allowances, widow’s benefits, bereavement benefits and the National Health Service. Where necessary, the National Insurance Fund can be topped-up with money derived from the ordinary taxation of those resident in the United Kingdom, including pensioners. The variety of funding methods of welfare benefits and the interlocking nature of the benefits and taxation systems have already been recognised by the Court. This complex and interlocking system makes it impossible to isolate the payment of National Insurance contributions as a sufficient ground for equating the position of pensioners who receive uprating and those, like the applicants, who do not.” </p>

The nature of the measure which Mr Ackermann said led to him receiving a lower pension than previous generations is not at all clear.  The ECtHR’s reference to the need for the State to “be in a position to adapt the pension system to the change of socio-economic circumstances” seems to be a factor more relevant at the justification stage than at the stage of identifying a comparator group.  The present state of the jurisprudence of the Strasbourg Court has not, in our judgment, reached the point that any comparator group is invalid because it is a group that remains unaffected by prospective legislation, in circumstances where that group is defined not merely by reference to the date when the legislation comes into effect but by reference to a protected characteristic.   </p>

For the phraseology of the criterion demonstrates that it is something for the complainant, rather than for the state, to establish. The rationalisation has to be that, when the state puts forward its reasons for having countenanced the adverse treatment, it establishes justification for it unless the complainant demonstrates that it was manifestly without reasonable foundation. But reference in this context to any burden, in particular to a burden of proof, is more theoretical than real.

The Green Paper highlighted four key factors.  The first was the increase in pensioners’ net average income in real terms between 1979 and 1988, in particular the increase in the number of pensioners with occupational pensions.  The second factor was the increase in the projected number of pensioners to a peak of 14.4 million in 2034 combined with a decrease in the number of people of working age potentially contributing to the national insurance fund.  This ratio is referred to as the old age dependency ratio or ‘OAD’.  In 1990 there were 3.4 people of working age for every pensioner but this was projected to fall to 2.6 workers for every pensioner by 2050.  The third factor was the increase in life expectancy for both men and women and the fourth was the projected increase in state pension costs both in real terms and as a percentage of GDP.  The 1991 Green Paper summarised the main policy drivers behind the proposals to equalise the state pension age as follows:  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:-0.01in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:1.00in">“Whatever solutions are adopted, the Government is clear that it would not be right to continue with unequal pension ages for men and women. There have been immense social and economic changes since these ages were set at their present levels over half a century ago. These changes include the greater willingness of women of all ages and marital status to work, and the spread of part time working.  At the same time pensioners generally have been living longer, and have gradually become better off through the development of occupational pensions.  To have differing pension ages now is increasingly out of line with developments in the equal treatment of men and women in the employment field, including in occupational pension scheme.” 45.<span style="font-family:Arial"> </span>Mr Gilchrist’s evidence is that the 1991 Green Paper received over 4000 responses.  The subsequent White Paper ‘<span style="font-style:italic">Equality in State Pension Age</span>’ (Cm 2420) published in 1993 explained why the Government thought it was right to equalise the pension age at 65 reflecting the increasing rates of female employment supported by the introduction of sex discrimination legislation, increasing life expectancy, the international trend towards increasing and equalising state pension ages together with the need for Britain to maintain international competitiveness and the changes to occupational pension schemes both in terms of their greater availability and the equalisation of the pension age under such schemes.  The White Paper also explained why the Government was not adopting the various options that had been canvassed in the Green Paper, including equalising at a lower age than 65 or having a flexible state pension age or allowing the full state pension to be drawn at any time once a certain number of contributions had been paid.  This last option was rejected because those who had gaps in their employment record would be disadvantaged by having to wait longer to access their pension and women were more likely to have such gaps than men.  The White Paper also made it clear that the Government recognised that the change would need to be phased in gradually so that people had enough time to plan.   </p>

This Command Paper did not propose an increase in state pension age despite increasing life expectancy.  It focused instead on increasing employment rates for people over 50 and providing incentives for people to defer claiming their state pension.  The Pensions Commission was established in 2002 and produced its first report in October 2004 ‘<span style="font-style:italic">Pensions: challenges and choices</span>’.  The report noted that without an increase in state pension age, expenditure on pensions would continue to grow as a proportion of GDP.  A further report in November 2005 highlighted the need for fundamental policy changes and a longer term pensions settlement.

Mr Gilchrist’s evidence is that although the Government maintained the acceleration of the timetable outlined in the Bill, an amendment to the Bill was introduced which phased in the transition from 65 to 66 more slowly so that the state pension age reached 66 in October 2020 rather than April 2020.  This meant that the maximum deferment faced by any woman as a result of the Pensions Act 2011 was 18 months rather than two years.  Mr Gilchrist notes that the implementation of that amendment cost £1.1 billion at 2011/12 prices and was estimated to benefit 245,000 women most affected by the changes. </p>

It is not uncommon for women born in the 1950s to have contracted various ailments and health problems by the time they reach their early 60s, because of the environment they lived in during their early years.  He said further that it is common for women in this age group to be living in straitened circumstances particularly if they are now single, with part time jobs at best and working for low pay.  It is also very common for them to be caring for elderly and infirm parents.  He argued that the lack of state pension means that they have to resort to makeshift measures to make ends meet, selling their houses, using up their savings and cutting back on any non-essential spending so that they are not in a position to enjoy their retirement years.  The amount of money that women have lost as a result of their state pension being deferred can be substantial, up to about £50,000 over the whole six years for which they have forgone their pension entitlement.

The need for more rapid reform has been borne out by subsequent statistics provided by Mr Gilchrist.  In 1951 a woman aged 65 could have a cohort life expectancy of 80.5 years whereas in 2019 a 65 year old woman could expect to live to 88.  Women retiring today can still expect to receive a state pension for over 22 years on average, that is two years longer than men.  Ms Willis Stewart points out that this does not mean that women receive more state pension than men because DWP figures in August 2018 for the mean weekly amount of state pension for men was £158.87 and for women £131.27.  Though they may have shorter life expectancy, men will still receive much more state pension than women even taking into account that women live for two years longer.  That does not, however, undermine the point that the SSWP makes that longer life expectancy for women places a strain on public finances, even if they would have received a lower pension over the years 60 – 65 than a man would receive. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The Appellants’ submission also fails to take into account the evidence provided by Mr Gilchrist that the legislation increasing the state pension age included other elements in a package of measures designed to mitigate the hardship caused by the absence of a state pension in the years 60 – 66.  It would be wrong to look at the changes to state pension age in isolation.  There have been measures to support longer working by removing the mandatory retirement age and extending the right to request flexible working.  Alongside the equalisation of the state pension age in the Pensions Act 1995, there were measures designed to improve the position of those with caring responsibilities and of low earners by treating some welfare benefits such as family credit as pensionable income for the purposes of an individual’s national insurance contribution record.  The effect of these measures has been, Mr Gilchrist explains, that once they reach state pension age a much higher percentage of women receive the full basic state pension than was previously the case.  As for the period between age 60 and 66, Mr Gilchrist points out in his witness statement that increases in the state pension age are matched by increases in the maximum age at which people can still qualify to receive working age benefits such as disability living allowance, attendance allowance and the widow’s pension.  Mr Gilchrist points out that the concept of a flexible state pension age was one of the options considered in the 1991 Green Paper and rejected.  We agree with the SSWP that this Court cannot now revisit that choice.   </p>

The application was refused by the Respondent on the ground that the claimant had not reached the male retirement age of 65.  The UK Government submitted before the CJEU that the facts giving rise to the dispute stemmed from the choice made by the national legislature to prescribe different pensionable ages for men and women.

Ms Richards was not able to fulfil one of the conditions of eligibility for that pension and because that inability arose from her gender reassignment, the unequal treatment to which she was subject must be regarded as discrimination precluded by the Directive.

The distinction which the Court was drawing in that case was a distinction between discrimination arising from the differential pension age and discrimination arising as between cisgender women and trans women.  The Court was not concerned with the application of Article 7 to legislation intended to equalise the state pension age.  This was also made clear in the Opinion of Advocate General Jacobs who said that Article 7 was irrelevant because it covered legislation concerned with determining the different pensionable ages of men and women and did not cover legislation concerned with the separate question of determining the sex of the person concerned: see [51] of his Opinion.  The reference by the CJEU at [35] to the purpose of the derogation being to enable Member States progressively to adapt their pension systems “without disrupting the complex financial equilibrium of those systems” shows that the construction for which the Appellants contend cannot be right.  The need for the derogation arises as much from legislation which makes a progressive adaptation towards equalisation as it does from the temporary retention of the differential pension ages.   </p>

The first claim considered in that appeal concerned black and minority ethnic civil servants over the age of 35 who challenged the requirement that all candidates for promotion to certain civil service grades should sit and pass a Core Skills Assessment test.  A report commissioned by the Home Office showed that BME candidates and older candidates had lower pass rates than white and younger candidates.  No one knew why the proportion of BME or older candidates failing was significantly higher.  The question for the Supreme Court was whether the claimants were required to prove the reason for the lower pass rate before they could establish their claim to indirect discrimination or whether it was sufficient to show that statistically the pass rate was lower.  At [25], Lady Hale said that direct discrimination expressly requires a causal link between the less favourable treatment and the protected characteristic.  Indirect discrimination does not.  Instead it requires a causal link between the measure and the particular disadvantage suffered by the group and the individual.  The reason for this, Lady Hale said, was that the prohibition of direct discrimination aims to achieve equality of treatment.  Indirect discrimination assumes equality of treatment but aims to achieve a level playing field where people sharing a particular protected characteristic are not subjected to requirements which many of them cannot meet and which cannot be shown to be justified.  She described one feature of indirect discrimination in the following terms: </p>

They could be traditional employment practices, such as the division between “women’s jobs” and “men’s jobs” or the practice of starting at the bottom of an incremental pay scale. … These various examples show that the reason for the disadvantage need not be unlawful in itself or be under the control of the employer or provider </p>

We are not persuaded that can be so.  The disadvantages existed and to the extent that they persist, exist anyway.  They are rooted in traditions and cultural norms which meant that women did not have the same work expectations or opportunities as men of the same age; whatever the pension age for women and whether or not equal with men, women would be subject to those disadvantages.

Ms Willis Stewart cites statistics which show that being under the state pension age reduces the average individual income by £50 per week.  She also sets out information showing that the average weekly income for those in employment aged over 60 is considerably lower for women than for men, in part because more of them work part time.  This means that the drop in income resulting from being below pension age is a far higher proportion of the total pay for women than it is for men.  Further, a significantly higher proportion of women between 60 and 64 are not in work compared with men in that age group.  These factors establish, the Appellants say, that the fact that the state pension age is the same for women and men puts a significantly greater number of older women than men at a disadvantage.   </p>

These include the fact that women carry out an average of 60 per cent more unpaid work than men; 86 per cent of single parents are women and single parents have a higher risk of poverty than any other household type.  In the 50 - 64 year old age group, women are much more likely to give up work than men because of caring responsibilities.  The Appellants submit that it is therefore indirectly discriminatory, subject to the question of justification, for the state pension to be withdrawn from them because their gender adversely affected their ability to earn a living and they are therefore entitled to the continuation of a differential state pension age favouring them.  </p>

It is undoubtedly the case that many groups have traditionally suffered discrimination in the workplace because their protected characteristic meant that there were fewer opportunities open to them for advancement in stable, well-paid work.  That is the case not only for women but for disabled people, for lone parents, for some BME groups and for transgender people. The eradication of those disparities of opportunity is in large part the purpose of the anti-discrimination law that has been put in place.  That does not mean, however, that every measure that has that kind of prejudicial effect on a disadvantaged group in society amounts to unlawful discrimination entitling that group to more favourable treatment unless the measure can be justified.   </p>

If they were suggesting there that, where the disadvantage suffered by those with a protected characteristic arises from traditions and cultural norms, it does not deserve protection, then we respectfully disagree.  Such a conclusion would make a very substantial inroad into the application of anti-discrimination legislation.  There is nothing inherently disadvantageous about being born female or a member of a BME group and there never has been.  The problem is that centuries of traditions and cultural norms have unjustifiably created such disadvantages.

Even the broad test expressed at [85] of <span style="font-style:italic">JD and A </span>still states that indirect discrimination exists where a policy or measure produces a particularly prejudicial impact on certain persons <span style="font-style:italic">as a result of</span> a protected ground, such as gender or disability, attaching to the situation.  The Appellants’ argument is that the causal link between the withdrawal of the pension and the protected characteristic is established because (i) the availability of the pension matters more for the wellbeing of disadvantaged members of society than it does for better off people, and (ii) people with a protected characteristic are disproportionately represented in the cohort of disadvantaged people, therefore (iii) it is indirectly discriminatory to deprive them of that benefit even though (iv) the criterion for access to that benefit is equally capable of being satisfied by people with and without that protected characteristic.  </p>

For example, the need to mitigate the effect of the state pension age equalisation by other elements of the package of measures was acknowledged by the Minister when the Bill which became the Pensions Act 1995 was introduced into the House of Lords for its second reading.  The Equal Opportunities Commission had presented evidence that women’s work patterns were very different from men’s and seriously affected their pension provision.

Mr Mansfield accepted that there was no authority that established his formulation as a proposition of law.  He also accepted that this was not a conventional legitimate expectation case because the Appellants could not point to any unambiguous statement, representation or undertaking given to them by the SSWP to the effect that they would be notified if their pension age were altered.  Nor was there any previous practice of notifying people of changes to their pension age that might give rise to an expectation that there would be notice in this case.  Mr Mansfield argued, however, that such a duty would represent an appropriate extension of the common law duty of fairness.  It was that duty which had prompted the development of the concept of procedural and substantive legitimate expectation.  It should now be developed to make good the failure of Parliament to include in the Pensions Acts any statutory obligation on the part of the SSWP to notify the people whose pension age had been changed.  It was, he submitted, a less onerous duty than a duty to consult since it did not affect the legislative process; the courts should more readily imply such a duty as a matter of common law procedural fairness.  </p>

The real obstacle which I think stands in the appellants' way is the difficulty of propounding a principle which reconciles fairness to an adversely affected class with the principles of public administration that are also part of the common law. These are not based on administrative convenience or potential embarrassment. They arise from the separation of powers and the entitlement of executive government to formulate and reformulate policy, albeit subject to such constraints as the law places upon the process and the product. One set of such constraints in modern public law are the doctrines of legitimate expectation, both procedural and substantive. Some have been touched on above – for example the requirements of candour and open-mindedness where either law or established practice calls for consultation. The duty to give reasons is another area in which there has been marked growth. It is not unthinkable that the common law could recognise a general duty of consultation in relation to proposed measures which are going to adversely affect an identifiable interest group or sector of society. </p>

If made good, such a duty would bring a host of litigable issues in its train: is the measure one which is actually going to injure particular interests sufficiently for fairness to require consultation? If so, who is entitled to be consulted? Are there interests which ought not to be consulted? How is the exercise to be publicised and conducted? Are the questions fairly framed? Have the responses been conscientiously taken into account? The consequent industry of legal challenges would generate in its turn defensive forms of public administration.

Although Mr Mansfield’s proposed formulation limits the duty to those who suffer a “serious adverse effect”, he did not explain how the SSWP can identify those within the overall cohort of men and women affected who have been seriously adversely affected.  Not every woman aged 60 to 65 is in the same difficult circumstances as the Appellants and not every man aged 65 to 66 is reliant on the state pension to make ends meet.  A duty to notify every man and woman affected by the change would therefore go substantially beyond the proposition put forward by Mr Mansfield.  The attempt to spell out the scope of any such duty makes it rapidly plain here, as it was in <span style="font-style:italic">BAPIO</span>, that if it is to be introduced it should be by Parliament and not by the courts. </p>

This was prompted by survey evidence which suggested that whilst most people knew that women’s state pension age was going to be raised from 60, most women did not know their correct state pension age.  Such direct mailing also became more feasible, Ms Fox says, once the DWP had access to the Customer Information System (‘CIS’) database which reduced concerns about address data being out of date.  Between April 2009 and March 2011, the DWP mailed 1.16 million women using the postal address held on the CIS database.  Women closest to the state pension age were mailed first informing them of the change to the law.  It also informed the recipient of the earliest date from which she would be entitled to a state pension. Since the enactment of the Pensions Act 2014, the DWP has continued to notify people by direct mailing of changes to their state pension age.

She continued to expect to receive her state pension aged 60 in 2018.  It was only through conversations with a colleague in 2014 that she realised she would be 66 before she was eligible.  Had she known this, she says, she would have arranged her working life differently.  In April 2012 she had decided to take voluntary exit from her job so that she could care for her mother who was suffering from ill health.  She says that she decided to leave her job, aged 54, on the basis that she would receive her pension when she reached 60.  She started to draw her civil service occupational pension from August 2012 at a lower rate than she would have been entitled to had she stayed in her job until she reached 60.  She worked full time in a local job which paid half the salary of her previous work and she now works two days a week for that employer.    </p>

When asked at what age they expected to receive their own state pension, only 26% of women within 10 years of their state pension age correctly identified their own state pension age compared with 74% of men.  Women tended to expect to reach state pension age sooner than they would in fact.  However, only 6% of women within 10 years of their state pension age still expected to receive their pension at age 60.  Ms Willis Stewart also cites studies such as one by Age UK in 2011 showing a lack of awareness of women about their pension age or their ability to obtain a pension forecast.  </p>

In that case the Supreme Court held that the time limit for bringing a claim in respect of disciplinary proceedings brought by the Bar Standards Board started to run only from the end of the proceedings when the claimant’s appeal against the decision was allowed and not from the start of the proceedings when the BSB decided to pursue the case against her.  That case does not in our judgment assist the Appellants. What the Court was looking at there was a series of acts comprising a course of conduct occurring over an extended period of time, not the continuing effect of a single act.  There is no continuing series of acts here.  The adoption of each Pensions Act affecting the Appellants’ pension age was a single act which was completed for this purpose at the latest when the legislation was brought into effect. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The Court held at [77] that the correct principle was that the grounds for making a judicial review claim first arise when a person is affected by the application to him or her of the challenged policy or practice.  That is the case at least where the legislation is mandatory and involves no independent consideration by anyone as to whether or not it should be applied in the particular case.  The claimants were not affected by the flat rate rule until they were detained in a detention centre in which that rule applied.  It was only then that they had the standing and the grounds to bring their claim, and that was when time started to run: [78].  The Court recognised that this enabled a claimant to undermine a long established rule, policy or practice that had been applied to many people in the interim.  That could operate to the detriment of good public administration and create legal uncertainty.  The answer to that was that the three month time limit for judicial review applications and the one year time limit for bringing proceedings under section 7 of the Human Rights Act 1998 would in practice constrain the number of former detainees who could pursue proceedings.   </p>

The Appellants point out that they have limited the relief they are seeking to a declaration of unlawfulness rather than seeking an order directing the SSWP to put right the unlawfulness that they allege exists.  That does not avoid the problem of the damage to good public administration that would be caused by any attempt to unwind the pension equalisation regime or the raising of the state pension age from 65 to 66.  The raising of the state pension age for women to 65 was completed by November 2018 and the raising of the state pension age for both sexes to 66 will be completed by October 2020.  3.17 million women and 80,000 men would be affected by a reversal of those changes.  It is not surprising that Mr Gilchrist estimates that the administrative costs of such a reversal together with the substantive costs of paying state pensions for the additional years would run to well over two hundred billion pounds.  </p>

The law in such a case was decided by the House of Lords in <span style="font-style:italic">R v Criminal Injuries Compensation Board ex p A </span>[1999] UKHL 21, [1999] 2 AC 330.  In that case the claimant’s challenge to the decision of the respondent Board to refuse her compensation was brought over a year after the refusal was notified to her.  Carnwath J gave her leave to move for judicial review though his ruling showed that he thought it would remain open to the Board to raise the question of delay at the substantive hearing.  His order stated simply that leave was granted and did not say in terms that time was extended.  At the substantive hearing, Popplewell J ruled that he was entitled to reconsider the question of delay and refused to extend time.  Lord Slynn of Hadley noted that their Lordships had been told that this approach had been followed in practice in other cases where it was considered that the granting of leave did not amount to an extension of time.  Lord Slynn disagreed with that approach.  If leave is given, then an application to set it aside may be made though, he said, “this is not to be encouraged”.  If leave is given and is not set aside, then it cannot be re-opened at the substantive hearing on the basis that there is no ground for extending time.  The court has already granted leave and it is too late to “refuse” it.  What the court can do under section 31(6) is to refuse to grant relief.  Lord Slynn therefore held that the issue of leave had been concluded by the decision of Carnwath J.  The other members of the court agreed, Lord Nolan noting that if a judge is minded to grant leave on the merits but retains some doubt about whether there was good reason to extend time, he can defer that issue for determination at the substantive hearing.   </p>
