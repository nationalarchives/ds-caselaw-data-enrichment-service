	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">It was common ground that Telefónica had thereby obtained a judgment more advantageous than an unaccepted Part 36 offer that it had made on 6 April 2018. The Judge accordingly awarded Telefónica indemnity costs from 28 April 2018 pursuant to CPR 36.17(4)(b) and an “additional amount” of £75,000 pursuant to CPR 36.17(4)(d). The Judge refused, however, to award an enhanced rate of interest (above the agreed commercial rate of 2% above base rate) on either the principal sum for which judgment was entered (CPR 36.17(4)(a)) or the costs Telefónica incurred after 28 April 2018 (CPR 36.17(4)(b)), holding that it would be unjust to do so.        </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Telefónica now appeals that refusal, contending that the Judge, having accepted that the Part 36 offer was a genuine attempt to settle (and having awarded two of the four “enhancements”), articulated no proper basis for regarding the award of an uplifted rate of interest as unjust. In particular, Telefónica contends, the Judge failed to recognise or consider that there was a discretion as to the level of uplift to be awarded (provided the rate, after the uplift, does not exceed 10% above base rate), and that concerns as to the proportionality and fairness of an uplift could and should have been addressed in that way. Telefónica seeks an uplift of 3% in the rate of interest, making a total rate of 5% on both the principal judgment sum and costs. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Ofcom resists the appeal, contending that the Judge had a wide discretion on the issue of costs which he exercised without erring in principle, taking into account the wrong matters or reaching a perverse conclusion. In the alternative, Ofcom argued that, even if there was a basis for setting aside the Judge’s decision, any uplift in interest rate should be nominal only.   </p>

If a defendant involves a claimant in proceedings after an offer has been made, and, in the event, the result is no more favourable to the defendant than that which would have been achieved if the claimant’s offer had been accepted, without the need for those proceedings, the message of [r.36.17] is that, prima facie, it is just to make an indemnity order for costs and for interest at an enhanced rate to be awarded. However, the indemnity order need not be for the entire proceedings, nor …need the award of interest be for a particular period or at a particular rate.

There is no limit to the types of circumstances which may, in a particular case, make it unjust that the ordinary consequences set out in [the rule] should follow... (d) None the less, the court does not have an unfettered discretion to depart from the ordinary cost consequences set out in [r.36.17]. The burden on a claimant who has failed to beat the defendant’s Part 36 offer to show injustice is a formidable obstacle to the obtaining of a different costs order.

In relation to the decision as to the rate of enhancement, such awards are not entirely compensatory, but using the word “penal” to describe them is probably not helpful. Sir Geoffrey Vos C explained as follows: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:0.50in;text-indent:0.00in">“38…The court undoubtedly has a discretion to include a noncompensatory element to the award as I have already explained, but the level of interest awarded must be proportionate to the circumstances of the case. I accept that those circumstances may include, for example, (a) the length of time that elapsed between the deadline for accepting the offer and judgment, (b) whether the defendant took entirely bad points or whether it had behaved reasonably in continuing the litigation, despite the offer, to pursue its defence, and (c) what general level of disruption can be seen, without a detailed inquiry, to have been caused to the claimant as a result of the refusal to negotiate or to accept the Part 36 offer. But there will be many factors that may be relevant. All cases will be different. Just as the court is required to have regard to “all the circumstances of the case” in deciding whether it would be unjust to make all or any of the four possible orders in the first place, it must have regard to all the circumstances of the case in deciding what rate of interest to award under [r.36.17(4)(a)]. As Lord Woolf MR said in the <span style="font-style:italic">Petrotrade </span>case, and Chadwick LJ repeated in the <span style="font-style:italic">McPhilemy </span>case, this power is one intended to achieve a fairer result for the claimant. That does not, however, imply that the rate of interest can only be compensatory. In some cases, a proportionate rate will have to be greater than purely compensatory to provide the appropriate incentive to the defendants to engage in reasonable settlement discussions and mediation aimed at achieving a compromise, to settle litigation at a reasonable level and at a reasonable time, and to mark the court’s disapproval of any unreasonable or improper conduct, as Briggs LJ put it, pour encourager les autres. </p>

Parties are no longer entitled to litigate forever simply because they can afford to so do. The rights of other court users must be taken into account. The parties are obliged to make reasonable efforts to settle, and to respond properly to Part 36 offers made by the other side. The regime of sanctions and rewards has been introduced to incentivise parties to behave reasonably, and if they do not, the court’s powers can be expected to be used to their disadvantage. The parties are obliged to conduct litigation collaboratively and to engage constructively in a settlement process.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">First, it is difficult to see the relevance of the level of the offers given that the key factor is that the defendant could have avoided the need for the proceedings (or most of the proceedings) by accepting one of the offers, and been in as good a position as it was after the trial. The fact that the amount of an offer is a very high percentage of the maximum a claimant could be awarded after judgment may justify the court in finding that it is not a genuine attempt to settle the proceedings (the purpose for which CPR 36.17(5)(c)) was added in April 2015) and therefore find that the award of enhancements would be unjust.

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">the principal sum then claimed and discounting only some or all of the interest claimed, might have been in that territory. However, once the Judge had accepted that the offers were genuine attempts at settlement (his negative formulation that he could “not determine that they were not genuine attempts to settle” amounting to the same finding, in my judgment), the level of the offers could not, in itself, form the basis of an assessment of the “proportionality” of enhanced interest, let alone a finding that any enhanced interest would be unjust. In making no order for enhanced interest in that situation, the Judge awarded the claimant no more interest than would have been awarded if the claimant had not made or not beaten a Part 36 offer, apparently on the basis that the margin between the offer and amount claimed (and for which judgment was granted) was small and the award of enhanced interest proportionately too large to be just. In my judgment, in so doing, the Judge “reintroduced” the overturned approach in <span style="font-style:italic">Carver</span>, effectively and improperly declining to implement Part 36 because of the small margins involved.  </p>

As emphasised in <span style="font-style:italic">OMV</span>, the level of enhanced interest awarded must be proportionate in all the circumstances, entailing that the court can and must ensure that the award of enhanced interest is not, by definition, unjust on the grounds of disproportionality. For example, if the court considered that any significant element of enhanced interest would be disproportionate, it could award a very low or even nominal enhanced rate.

The rule provides for the successful claimant (in the terms of CPR 36.17(1(b)) to receive each of the four enhancements and there is no suggestion that the award of one in any way undermines or lessens entitlement to the others. In this case the Judge regarded the award of the two more trivial enhancements as a reason why it was unjust to award the major enhancement. I consider he was not entitled to do so.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">However, as identified by Briggs J in <span style="font-style:italic">Smith v Trafford Housing Trust</span>, the key question is which party was responsible for costs being incurred when they should not have been. In a case such as the present, the costs were incurred because the defendant could have, but did not, accept the claimant’s offers, deciding instead to fight the case but failing to do better than the offers. That is the basis of the claimant’s entitlement to enhanced interest on costs and is not displaced in the present case. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In summary, although the Judge accepted that the claimant was entitled to enhanced relief under CPR 36.17(4), the effect of his decision was to deprive the claimant of any significant enhancement under that rule, doing so on the basis of a combination of factors which did not give rise to injustice as contemplated by the rule and so did not justify that result. Although the decision involved a value judgment and an exercise of discretion, the Judge took into account irrelevant considerations, contrary to clear statements of principle in the authorities, and failed to take into account his discretion as to the rate of interest.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">It follows that I would allow the appeal and award the claimant enhanced interest on both the principal sum awarded and its costs. Exercising the discretion in that regard afresh, and taking into account all relevant circumstances (including those identified by the Judge in refusing to make any award of enhanced interest) I would award an additional 1.5% per annum (equating, as I understand it, to about £900,000), making the total interest payable 3.5% above base rate, on both principal and costs, from the relevant date.  </p>
