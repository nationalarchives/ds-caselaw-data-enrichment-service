The claim was dismissed by order of Cockerill J dated 13 December 2019 following her judgment handed down on that date: [2019] EWHC 3382 (Admin).  At the end of the hearing we announced that we would refuse permission to appeal.  These are my reasons for coming to that conclusion.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The judicial review proceedings were brought to challenge the imposition of a charge to tax under the Schedule 11 to the Finance (No. 2) Act 2017. The aim of the legislation was to tackle tax avoidance schemes whereby people received what HMRC referred to as “disguised remuneration” in the form of a loan on which they asserted that they were not liable to pay income tax or national insurance contributions. According to Schedule 11, wherever a loan fell within HMRC’s Disguised Remuneration Rules and was outstanding as at 5 April 2019, the amount of the loan so outstanding was deemed by the legislation to be taxable income in the tax year 2018/2019.  The imposition of the tax is referred as the Loan Charge.  The Disguised Remuneration Rules applied not just to employer/employee relationships but to relationships between an independent contractor and the person engaging him and to the relationship between a company director and the company where it was a close company as defined for that purpose.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The judicial review application was lodged on 20 February 2019 by a number of claimants in addition to Cartref. In the section of the form setting out the details of the decision to be judicially reviewed, there was a list of six decisions by HMRC said to be contained in letters dated between 16 November 2018 and 21 January 2019. Some of the letters indicated HMRC’s intention to impose the Loan Charge and some said that HMRC would issue partnership follower notices to the tax payer.  The decision relevant to Cartref, the main appellant for our purposes, was a decision contained in the letter of 16 November 2018 to impose the Loan Charge on Cartref or alternatively on the Second Appellant, Mr Williams, in respect of the loan to Mr Williams from GBF Capital Ltd by reason of his participation in Premiere Sovereign Corporate.  According to the chronology in the Grounds for Judicial Review, Mr Williams completed the arrangements which generated the Loan Charge in December 2010. The arrangements involving all the other claimants were entered into on later dates. The remedy sought in the claim form was an order quashing the follower notices issued to the claimants and an incompatibility declaration, that is to say a declaration under section 4(2) of the Human Rights Act 1998, that the legislation imposing the Loan Charge was incompatible with the tax payers’ rights under Articles 6 of the ECHR and A1P1.  The Article 6 claim is not pursued before us.  </p>

She refused permission to apply for judicial review to all the claimants except for Cartref.

She dismissed the claim on the basis that the retrospective element of the legislation was not outside the margin of appreciation accorded to the legislature: [224]. In her order of 13 December 2019 dismissing the applications she also ordered the Claimants to pay HMRC’s costs to be assessed on the standard basis if not agreed.  </p>

Some of the other Claimants have lodged an appeal against Cockerill J’s refusal to grant them permission to apply for judicial review.  However, those other claimants recognise that their appeals should only proceed if Cartref is granted permission to appeal to argue that the legislation is incompatible with Cartref’s human rights.

Concerns that the Loan Charge legislation was operating in an unfair and oppressive way were raised by the All Party Parliamentary Loan Charge Group which published a report in April 2019 critical of the effect of the legislation.  This led the Government in September 2019 to invite Sir Amyas Morse to carry out an independent review of the Loan Charge.  Sir Amyas published his report on 20 December 2019, shortly after Cockerill J’s judgment was handed down and the two orders bringing those proceedings to a close had been made. The Morse report was also critical of the Loan Charge though it did not address questions about the legality of the charge or the compatibility of it with the tax payers’ human rights. At the same time as the Morse report was published, the Government published its response, accepting almost all Sir Amyas’ recommendations.  </p>

She noted at [218] that this legislation does reach back a long way – to a time before HMRC started warning people that these kinds of schemes were unacceptable: [218].

The legislation is rationally connected to its objective. Whether or not a less intrusive measure could have been used (which I do not need to decide), there is an insufficient proper evidential basis to form a counterweight to these factors.” </p>

At the hearing, Mr Southern QC appearing for Cartref argued that there were still three elements of Schedule 11 that the Appellants wished to argue were a disproportionate interference with their Convention rights.  They wanted to argue that the retrospectivity to 9 December 2010 was still excessive as it applied to close company scheme even if it might be proportionate for other kinds of disguised remuneration.  The legislation should not reach back further than March 2016 which was, he said, the first time that HMRC indicated that close company directorships would be included in the Disguised Remuneration Rules, which is what led to them being caught up in the Loan Charge.  Two other elements that they criticise are found in paragraphs of the Schedule that were not affected by the 2020 amendments.  The first is the way that the Loan Charge interacts with inheritance tax and the second is the possibility of the Loan Charge being the subject of an accelerated payment notice. Both of these, Cartref wishes to argue, could give rise to double taxation.  Mr Southern accepted that neither of these issues was raised in the Grounds of Appeal served with his notice.  They were not dealt with in Cockerill J’s judgment and, he said, were only raised in correspondence following the hearing. If permission were to be given by this court, the grounds of appeal would need to be substantially revised.    </p>

If Cartref was allowed to reformulate its claim to argue that for close company loan schemes even reaching back to December 2010 goes too far, that would in effect be allowing it to mount on appeal a fresh claim requiring fresh evidence and different arguments from those considered below.  As regards the other two elements to which Cartref now objects, those were not referred to in the judicial review claim. Leaving aside the question whether Cartref is entitled to raise them since it is a company and so not subject to inheritance tax and further, it has not been served with an accelerated payment notice, those grounds would also amount to an entirely fresh claim which cannot be asserted for the first time on appeal.  </p>

Mr Southern argued that if Cockerill J had known when she was considering whether to order the Claimants to pay HMRC’s costs that the Government was about to limit the retrospective reach of Schedule 11 so substantially, she might have made a different order from the one she made.  He suggests that people in the Government, even if not those in HMRC directly concerned with the proceedings, must have known that the Government was about to accept the recommendations of the Morse report since the Government response was published within a few days of the judgment being handed down.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The difficulty with Mr Southern’s submission is that it is common ground between the Appellants and HMRC that the amendment of the legislation has not reduced or expunged the liability of the Appellants to the loan charge.  All the arrangements that they entered into are still caught by Schedule 11 because they were made within the new, shorter reach back period.  I do not need to consider whether, if the Finance Act 2020 amendments had taken the Appellants out of the charge, there might have been an argument that because they had in the end achieved the result they had pursued in the proceedings, a different costs order was appropriate. As it is, the Claimants have not succeeded either within or outside the confines of the proceedings and there is no basis for disturbing the judge’s costs order.  </p>
