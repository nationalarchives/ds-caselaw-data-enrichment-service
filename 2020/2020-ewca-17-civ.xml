In summary, the respondent sustained injuries as a result of an accident at work whilst in the appellant’s employment and subsequently submitted a claim to the appellant’s insurers under the Protocol. The appellant admitted liability and, after the parties had failed to agree damages under Stage 2 of the Protocol, the respondent filed a claim in the county court under Stage 3, which is set out in Practice Direction 8B. At the hearing, the district judge ordered the appellants to pay £2000 by way of damages to the respondent, plus costs in the sum of £1080. </p>

The circuit judge allowed the appeal, holding that the district judge ought to have dismissed the proceedings under the Protocol, leaving the respondent to start fresh proceedings under CPR Part 7. The judge set aside the district judge’s order, dismissed the claim under the Protocol, reserved all questions of costs due under the Protocol until the conclusion of the respondent’s claim under Part 7, and ordered the appellant to pay the respondent’s costs of the appeal. The appellant then appealed the circuit judge’s decision to this </p>

She contended that, as the Court of Appeal’s discretionary powers to award costs under s.51 of the Senior Courts Act are expressed as being subject to rules of court, the terms of Part 45 Section III take precedence. The provisions of rules 45.16 to 18 are mandatory – the court may not award anything beyond the fixed costs. In support of this proposition, she cited a passage from the judgment of Briggs LJ (as he then was) in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Sharp v Leeds City Council</span> [2017] EWCA Civ 33: </p>

To recognise implied exceptions in relation to such claim-related activity and expenditure would be destructive of the clear purpose of the fixed costs regime, which is to pursue the elusive objective of proportionality in the conduct of the small or relatively modest types of claim to which that regime currently applies.” </p>

She cited a number of cases in which this court has stressed the importance of fixed cost regimes while acknowledging that, by favouring certainty, there will occasionally be cases where the outcome may in some respects appear unreasonable: see, for example, <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Lamont v</span><span style="font-style:italic"> </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Burton</span><span style="font-style:italic"> </span>[2007] EWCA Civ 429 per Dyson LJ at paragraph 26.

The costs of an appeal are entirely separate from any fixed costs regime and are dealt with separately under Part 52. An appeal to this court will involve drafting grounds of appeal and a skeleton argument containing legal submissions. The documents filed will comply with the procedural rules governing appeals. The hearing of the appeal will be of a wholly different character. The process is completely different from that set out in Stage 3 of the Protocol in Practice Direction 8B. The fixed costs regime simply does not apply. Ms Cullen pointed out that, following his successful appeal at the hearing before the circuit judge, the respondent had applied for, and been awarded, costs in the sum of £4,500. It was not suggested on his behalf at that point that the fixed costs regime applied. </p>

If (as is likely to be the case here) the claimant's access to justice is dependent on the benefit of QOCS, that access will be significantly reduced if he is exposed to a risk as to the costs of any unsuccessful appeal which he may bring or any successful appeal a defendant may bring against him. The effect of QOCS is that his liability to meet any adverse order for costs is limited to the value of sums recovered in the proceedings by way of damages except in certain circumstances. In other words, except in those circumstances, he cannot be worse off as a result of bringing his claim. If he has the benefit of a Conditional Fee Agreement he will not be liable for his own costs and QOCS restricts his liability to the sums recovered in the proceedings. The risk that a failure in litigation may result in the loss of existing assets is a substantial inhibition on access to justice and that is an important part of the reason why QOCS was established. </p>

The power to make enforceable orders for costs is designed to compensate successful parties for their expense in bringing or resisting claims, but it also has an effect of deterring people from bringing or resisting claims unsuccessfully. It is an incentive to resolve disputes and serves a public as well as a private interest. That consideration is in tension with access to justice. In appellate civil proceedings in QOCS cases permission to appeal is always required. That filter affords some protection for the civil justice system and the other parties against unmeritorious appeals. The costs disincentive is not rendered irrelevant by this fact, but in resolving the tension between access to justice and other considerations it is reasonable to start from the proposition that the issue only concerns the claimant's ability to bring an appeal which a judge has held to have a realistic prospect of success or that there is some other compelling reason for it, or to resist an appeal where a judge has made the order which is challenged.

An appeal by a claimant against the dismissal of his claim for personal injuries is a means of pursuing that claim against the defendant or defendants who succeeded in defeating that claim at trial. There is no difference between the parties or the relief sought as there is between the original claim and the Part 20 claim. Most importantly, to my mind there is no difference between the nature of the claimant at trial and the appellant on appeal. He is the same person, and the QOCS regime exists for his benefit as the best way to protect his access to justice to pursue a personal injury claim. To construe the word ‘proceedings’ as excluding an appeal which was necessary if you were to succeed in establishing the claim which had earlier attracted QOCS protection would do nothing to serve the purpose of the QOCS regime. The other construction, which holds that for the purpose of CPR Part 44.13 an appeal between the claimant and the defendant in a personal injury claim is part of the proceedings which include a claim for personal injuries is open to me, following <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Hawksford v Trustees Jersey Ltd</span>, and should be preferred because it more justly achieves what is plainly the purpose of the regime as divined from the Rules. </p>

This allows the court to make an order (generally at a very early stage of the appeal proceedings) to alter the consequences of the general scheme for costs in civil appeals in cases where other rules applied to the proceedings which resulted in the decision against which the appeal is brought. This covers cases where there are no special rules governing the costs in the appeal court, but there are in the proceedings below. This does not apply to cases where, on a proper construction of the rules, the same regime applies to the proceedings at first instance and on appeal. The fact that the court has a discretion to limit the costs orders which may be made protectively in a variety of situations is simply irrelevant to the present issue. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">S.51 of the Senior Courts Act 1981 provides that the costs of proceedings in the civil division of the Court of Appeal, the High Court and the county court shall be in the general discretion of the court, subject to rules of court. The rules governing appeals to those courts are set out in CPR Part 52. Rule 52.19(1) gives an appeal court a specific discretion to make an order limiting the recoverable costs of the appeal in “any proceedings in which costs recovery is normally limited or excluded at first instance”. Proceedings at first instance under the Protocol plainly fall into that category. It follows that the fixed costs regime applicable to proceedings at first instance under the Protocol does not apply to the costs of an appeal. Instead, the appellate court has a discretion in such cases to limit the costs recoverable. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In the circumstances of this case, however, I am not persuaded that the court should exercise its discretion under rule 52.19. The respondent made a claim under the Protocol and the appellant properly complied with all the procedural requirements up to and including the hearing before the district judge. The respondent then filed an appeal notice seeking to overturn the order he had obtained from the district judge, relying on his own failure to comply with the procedural requirements of the Protocol. That appeal was, in my judgment, wholly unmeritorious and led the appellant to incur unnecessary additional costs. In those circumstances, I conclude that the appellant is entitled to its costs of both appeals. I do not consider that the inequality in the parties’ financial circumstances justifies any departure from that outcome, nor do I consider that wider principles of access to justice have any relevance to the decision on this issue.  </p>

I therefore conclude that any appeal which concerns the outcome of the claim for damages for personal injuries, or the procedure by which such a claim is to be determined, is part of the “proceedings” under CPR r.44.13. This interpretation applies even where, as here, (a) the court is dealing with a second appeal, (b) the appeal is brought by the defendant to the original claim, and (c) the court has declined to exercise its discretionary powers to limit recoverable costs under CPR 52.19. </p>
