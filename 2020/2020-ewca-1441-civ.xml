That right is exercised by giving notice under section 13 of the Act (“the initial notice”). The date on which the initial notice is given is called “the relevant date”: section 1 (8). The right to acquire the freehold is a right to acquire it for its market value on the relevant date: Schedule 6 para. 3. There is no provision for the lessees to pay interest on the purchase price if completion of the procedure is delayed. It can, therefore, be in the interests of lessees to drag out the process, particularly at a time of rising property prices. One way in which the Act discourages this is to prescribe a series of procedural steps which must be taken within specified time limits; and to provide for a deemed withdrawal of the initial notice if that step is not taken. If the initial notice is deemed to have been withdrawn, the lessees will have to wait for a year, and then begin all over again: </p>

The notice is given by the qualifying tenants of not less than half the number of flats in the premises. The initial notice must (among other things) specify the proposed acquisition price; and a nominee purchaser for the lessees. Section 13 (3) requires the initial notice to state a period (not less than two months after the relevant date) within which the reversioner must serve a counternotice. The counternotice is given under section 21. It may (as in this case) admit the right to enfranchise, but dispute the proposed terms of acquisition. </p>

If, at the end of two months following the giving of a counter-notice, the terms of acquisition are in dispute, the appropriate tribunal may determine the dispute: section 48 (1). The application to the appropriate tribunal must be made not later than six months following the date of the counter-notice: section 48 (2). If no such application is made in time, the tenant’s notice is deemed withdrawn: section 53 (1). As in the case of the deemed withdrawal of an initial notice under section 13, the deemed withdrawal of a tenant’s notice under section 42 prevents the tenant from serving another such notice for a period of one year: section 42 (7). </p>

Section 24 (2) provides for a cut-off date for making the application to the appropriate tribunal. The application is made (at the latest) when the application is received by the appropriate tribunal. If the application is not made by the cut-off date, then the initial notice is deemed withdrawn. In this case, the lessees did not make an application to the appropriate tribunal by the cut-off date. Instead, they applied to the county court which has no jurisdiction to determine the terms of acquisition. It follows, therefore, that the initial notice is deemed withdrawn. </p>

The first was that on the facts of this case, the county court was the “appropriate tribunal.” Because the application for the determination of the terms of acquisition was procedurally joined with the application for leave to amend the initial notice, section 90 (4) empowered the county court to determine both the amendment application and also the terms of acquisition.  The definition of “the appropriate tribunal” in section 38 applied unless the context otherwise required, and on the facts of this case, the context did otherwise require.  The second was that an application under section 24 need not be made to the appropriate tribunal, if there is another tribunal with jurisdiction to determine that application. Once again, jurisdiction to determine the application is conferred on the county court under section 90 (4). These two arguments were what he called his primary case. </p>

It, too, deals with the consequences of a failure to make an application under section 48 for the determination of terms by the appropriate tribunal. The consequences of a failure to make the relevant application must have been intended by Parliament to be the same, whether the lessees are exercising a collective right to enfranchise under Chapter I or an individual lessee is exercising a right to an extended lease under Chapter II. Any other conclusion would be capricious and arbitrary, if not irrational. Unlike HHJ Gerald, therefore, I am unable to give significant weight to the introductory words of section 38 (“unless the context otherwise requires”) which do not appear either in section 62 or in section 91. But even if some weight is given to that phrase, a view that one interpretation would be more beneficial or sensible than another does not, in my judgment, lead to the conclusion that the context<span style="font-style:italic"> requires</span> that interpretation to be preferred. </p>

When originally enacted, section 24 (1) referred to a determination of disputed terms by a “leasehold valuation tribunal,” an expression which was not defined. There was no room for some other meaning to be given to that phrase. The insertion of the definition of “appropriate tribunal” in sections 38, 62 and 91 was occasioned by the transfer of the functions of the LVT (in England) to the FTT. It is most unlikely that that change was intended to enlarge the scope of the jurisdiction of the county court; still less to enlarge it under Chapter I but not under Chapter II.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in">The main difficulty with that argument is that section 91 (1) provides that certain matters “shall be determined” by the appropriate tribunal. Under section 91 (2) those matters include the terms of acquisition.  On the face of it, that excludes the power of any other tribunal to make that determination. In addition, the only permitted application under section 24 (1) is an application for the appropriate tribunal to make the determination. Once again, Mr Galtrey relies on section 90 (4). But reliance on that sub-section contradicts the clear instruction in section 91 (1); and evades the exclusion from the county court’s jurisdiction in section 90 (2). This argument also creates a wide gulf between the powers of the county court and the powers of the High Court. Section 90 (3) enables the High Court to hear joined proceedings which are within the jurisdiction of the county court under sections 90 (1) and (2). The High Court’s jurisdiction to determine the terms of acquisition is excluded by section 90 (2). But section 90 (4) applies only to the county court. It does not apply to the High Court. On this argument, therefore, the county court would have more extensive powers than the High Court. That is not impossible, but it is an unlikely intention to impute to Parliament. It would also mean that while an application to the county court would stop time running for the purposes of section 29, an equivalent application to the High Court would not. That, too, would be an unexplained anomaly. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The third argument is that the county court has power to entertain the application, even though it may not have power to determine the terms of acquisition. Section 90 (2) is about where proceedings are brought. That refers to the moment of initiation of proceedings. Section 90 (4) applies where proceedings have been brought in the county court under section 90 (1) or (2). But this argument takes as its foundation the proposition that the county court cannot determine the terms of acquisition. Yet if section 90 (4) applies, it can make that determination. This argument is therefore, in my judgment, internally inconsistent; and adds little, if anything, to the first two arguments. There is another reason for rejecting this argument. If, as this argument assumes, the county court is not the appropriate tribunal; and if, as it also assumes, the county court has no power to make the determination, then the application has simply been made in the wrong place. </p>

The answer to that question used to depend on whether the requirement was “mandatory” or “directory”, but that dichotomy has been discarded. It was perceived as unsatisfactory since the characterisation of the statutory provisions as either mandatory or directory did no more than state a conclusion as to the consequence of non-compliance rather than assist in determining what consequence the legislature intended.

It does not require hunting around among a plethora of statutory instruments. Where to make the application is entirely in the hands of the lessees and the nominee purchaser.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I sympathise with both judges in their attempts to avoid potential pitfalls for the unwary, and to simplify the overall procedure. But the fact remains that Parliament has set up a highly prescriptive procedure containing many time limits affecting both lessee and reversioner; and in each case has spelled out in terms the consequences of a failure to comply. That language is, in my judgment, simply too clear to allow of a different interpretation.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I agree. I would add three short points. First, I accept the point made by counsel for the freeholder that section 90(4) of the 1993 Act must be construed in context, and in particular the context provided by section 90(3); and that, construed in that context, its effect is to confer on the County Court jurisdiction to hear and determine a claim which would otherwise be outside its general statutory jurisdiction, where the County Court is already seized of a matter falling within section 90(1) or (2).  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Secondly, I consider that counsel for the lessees was correct not to suggest that section 176A of the 2002 Act was an answer to the problem faced by his clients. Section 176A empowered DDJ Ackland to make an order for transfer of a question to the First-Tier Tribunal, but that could not make any difference to the answer to the question of whether the lessees had applied to the appropriate tribunal in time.    </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Thirdly, as Lewison LJ has explained, the 1993 Act clearly differentiates between the functions of the First-Tier Tribunal (in England) or the Leasehold Valuation Tribunal (in Wales) and those of the County Court, and it does so for understandable reasons. That legislative policy can hardly be said to be irrational, and the courts should be careful not to subvert it under the guise of interpretation. Nevertheless, the division of jurisdiction may in some circumstances present an obstacle to efficient dispute resolution. It is therefore worthy of consideration whether the Act should be amended either so as to confer jurisdiction on just one court or tribunal or in some other way.  </p>
