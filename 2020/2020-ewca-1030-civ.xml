	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">This appeal concerns the extent of the obligation upon the court in England and Wales to enforce a foreign order in relation to children.  It directly concerns one provision of the Brussels II revised Regulation (Council Regulation (EC) No. 2201/2003) (‘BIIa’) but the underlying principles are of broad application in cases where the court is faced with an enforcement application alongside a welfare application. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">At the global level, the 1996 Hague Child Protection Convention, ratified by the United Kingdom in 2012, provides rules for jurisdiction, applicable law, recognition, enforcement and co-operation in respect of parental responsibility and measures for the protection of children as between participating states.  At the European level, BIIa performs a similar function, building on the Convention of 2001 (‘Brussels II’), which focused on jurisdiction and recognition of judgements in matrimonial matters and matters of parental responsibility in respect of the children of spouses in matrimonial proceedings, and the much earlier civil and commercial regime in the 1968 Brussels Convention.  These instruments have the common purpose of promoting international co-operation for the benefit of children and avoiding conflicts of jurisdiction.  Treating the best interests of children as a primary consideration, they provide a mechanism for the mutual recognition of judicial decisions, so that a judgment in one participating state is to be recognised and enforced in another participating state in effect as if it was a domestic judgment given in that state. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">These objectives are pursued in a number of ways: general jurisdiction is given to the state in which the child is habitually resident at the time the court is seised and continues exclusively for so long as it remains seised; in the interests of the child, the case may be transferred to the court of another state that is better placed to hear it; urgent provisional measures can be taken on the basis of the child’s presence; the hearing of the child is a matter of importance; recognition and enforcement should be based on mutual trust and specified exceptions should be kept to a minimum; in particular, the substance of a judgement given in the first state may not be reviewed in the second state; finally, the process of recognition and enforcement is to be carried out without delay. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In these circumstances, the potential for conflicting decisions is evident.  That possibility was foreseen by BIIa which, by Article 23, provides a number of circumstances in which a judgment cannot be recognised.  Of specific relevance to this case, Article 23(e) provides that a judgment relating to parental responsibility shall not be recognised in another Member State if it is irreconcilable with a later judgment given in that Member State.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In this case, the English court refused recognition of the Spanish orders on the basis that they were irreconcilable with an order that it made on the same occasion, which provided for the children to live with their mother.  The father now appeals with permission of Moylan LJ on two grounds: firstly, that as a matter of law the judge was not entitled to rely on Article 23(e) and, secondly, that the hearing was procedurally unfair because the judge made a final welfare order without hearing full evidence. </p>

Their parents, who are both medical professionals, are Spanish.  In 2002 they married in Spain, in 2003 A was born, and in 2004 the family moved to Pamplona, where the father’s family is based.  In 2006 the parents and A moved to England, and J was born in that year.  In July 2011 the family returned briefly to Pamplona before moving to the Canary Islands, where the children attended a British school.  In July 2012, the father returned to Pamplona, where he remains, and in 2013 the parents’ marriage broke down.   </p>

She was granted interim custody of the children and in December 2013, with the permission of the Spanish court, the three of them returned to England, where they have lived ever since.  Contact in Spain took place in accordance with the Spanish order, and included the children spending a month with their father in the summer and a week at Christmas.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">However, the children’s situation has never been tranquil.  From the outset the father has sought their return to Spain, with or without the mother, and several interviews were conducted with the children in Spain by a court-appointed psychologist.  In a report in February 2016, she recorded that both parents were significant figures for A, who was enduring a conflict of loyalties without taking sides.  Although A considered her home to be in England with her mother and friends, she also had a feeling of belonging in Pamplona.  J wanted his parents to solve their problems and live together again.  He was reported to have secure bonds and a positive relationship with both parents.  The psychologist identified pathological inter-parental conflict, with the mother exercising power and authority and the father being resistant and passive. </p>

The children were then aged 12 and 9 respectively.  The decision was appealed by the mother on 1 September 2016.  However, on 20 September 2016 the Spanish court ordered the mother to hand the children over to the father’s care and imposed a fine of €100 for each day that passed without her doing so.   </p>

In January 2017 she reported that A, now 13, loved her father but was clear that she viewed the UK as her home and did not want to start in Spanish schooling.  J, aged 10, was very negative about his father and about a proposed move to Pamplona.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Matters were further exacerbated by an incident that occurred in April 2017, when the children went to spend a fortnight at Easter with their father in Spain.  He instead took them on to the Far East.  The children were located by the mother in Indonesia and with the assistance of the Spanish consul they were reunited with her and returned to England 10 days after the end of their intended holiday.  This incident was described by the Guardian as a frightening experience for them.  In May 2017, she recorded A as saying that she wanted to live with her mother in England and to spend time with her father in England, and also in Spain if she could be assured she would be returned to England.  J said he wanted to live with his mother and enjoyed his time with his father.  He wanted to return to spend the holidays in Spain as long as there was an assurance that he could come back to England.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Since that time contact has not been taking place reliably and the parents have continued to be in conflict about where the children should live.  In July 2017, the Spanish appeal court, the Third Section of the Provincial High Court of Navarra, resolved to obtain a new expert psychological report and to carry out further interviews of the children.  In August 2017, the father filed a criminal complaint in Spain seeking the arrest of the mother for failing to place children in his care.  The mother did not comply with orders requiring her to bring the children to Spain for interview in September 2017.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In September 2017, a hearing took place in England before Baker J.  He noted that the case was unusual in that the Spanish court, which was first seised as a result of the divorce proceedings, had continued to make welfare decisions long after the children had become habitually resident in England and Wales.  He made a request to the Spanish court under Article 15 for the transfer of the proceedings to this jurisdiction and recommended judicial liaison to resolve what he described as an unhappy dispute that had blighted the lives of the children for too long. </p>

In January 2018, the children spent Christmas and New Year with their father in Spain, where they were seen by the psychologist and the appeal judge.  A said that she wanted to be with her friends and go to school in England and also wanted to see her father and family.  She was tired of the tension between her parents.  J had a positive view of his mother, but opted to live with his father, although he was worried about changing schools.   </p>

It noted that the children had expressed different views in the Spanish and English proceedings.  It considered that the life and development of the children was not being conducted in an appropriate family environment and that the children did not have the necessary emotional stability.  Despite the adaptation required, particularly by A (by now 14) in the light of her views, the change would not be insurmountable.   </p>

However, the Spanish court of first instance went on to make an order in August 2018 prohibiting the mother from removing the children from England until they were placed with the father, and prohibiting the issuing to the mother of Spanish passports for the children.  In December 2018, it made a further order that the children live with their father.  These orders were registered for enforcement by the District Judge and the mother appealed to the High Court.   </p>

In November 2018, Gwynneth Knowles J appointed Ms Roddy as the Children’s Guardian in those proceedings and listed the matter for further hearings in January and February 2019 for determination of the question of jurisdiction.  At the hearing in January 2019, Williams J gave directions both in relation to the mother’s Children Act application and her appeals against the registration orders, directing that they be listed for final hearing on 25 and 26 February 2019.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The procedural code for the registration of orders under BIIa and the 1996 Hague Convention and certain other Regulations is contained in Part 31 of the Family Procedure Rules 2010.  Its detailed provisions are designed to ensure that incoming requests are efficiently processed.  As  noted above, in the United Kingdom enforcement is achieved by the process of registration.  Registration is in the first instance an essentially administrative process, although a judicial act is required.  Any substantive dispute takes the form of an appeal to the High Court, issued within a month of the date of service of the notice of registration.  In the absence of a successful appeal, the order will continue to be recognised and it will be enforceable as if it was a domestic order.  The effect of a successful appeal is that the order cannot be recognised, and therefore cannot be enforced.   </p>

On behalf of the Guardian, Mr Mark Jarman, who also appeared on this appeal, argued that both limbs were available to the court, but he placed greater emphasis on the latter.  The father’s case was heavily weighted towards refuting the Article 23(a) claim.  Nonetheless, he did engage with Article 23(e) in his statement of 4 June 2019, in which he stated (correctly at the time) that there was no later judgment in England, before going on to assert that there could be no later judgment because “jurisdiction in respect of welfare matters rests solely in Spain”.

Reflecting this list of issues, the oral evidence was to be limited to these questions: how enforcement might take place, the mother’s attitude and actions and the reasons for the difficulties with contact, the children’s wishes, and whether the mother would move to Spain if the order was enforced.  The confinement of the issues and the oral evidence was doubtless the result of the father’s argument that his enforcement application took precedence and his having objected to the court hearing any oral evidence at all.

She agreed that the children have a right and a need to know and spend time with her father but she noted that, while the mother may have failed to promote children’s relationship with him, her actions had not taken place in isolation and that the failure of the parties to work together was reflected by the conflict between the two jurisdictions.  She accepted the Guardian's evidence that the mother represents the children’s key attachment figure and role model and she noted her strong professional opposition to the children being separated, a prospect described by A as <span style="font-style:italic">“horrible”</span>; J would, in Ms Roddy’s view, struggle to live in Spain without A.

In fact, there is no specific age limit within BIIa (though the age of 18 will appear in the BIIa Recast Regulation), and the age limit for enforcement will depend upon the national law of the court of enforcement: see the <span style="font-style:italic">Practice Guide</span> to BIIa at 3.1.1.1.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The first ground of appeal is that the judge was wrong as a matter of law to find that Article 23(e) applies in the circumstances of this case.  In summary, Ms Renton submits that the provision can only apply if the later irreconcilable judgement exists <span style="font-style:italic">before</span> the application is made for recognition and enforcement.  She argues that this restrictive interpretation appropriately reflects the ethos of mutual trust between States, the principle that grounds for non-recognition should be kept to a minimum, and the prohibition on a judgment being reviewed as to its substance.  Any other reading would, she says, make unacceptable inroads into the enforcement scheme of BIIa.  An enforcement application could always be defeated by an order made by a court in the requested State, assuming that it had acquired general jurisdiction in the meantime.  In this regard she points to observations made by Macur J in <span style="font-style:italic">Re LSdC, </span>cited below.  She also notes the emphasis in the Regulation and in domestic and international case law upon enforcement applications being processed without delay, and argues that this would be prevented if an enforcement application could be met by a potentially protracted welfare enquiry.  In this case, she asserts, the father’s enforcement application should have taken priority, and the mother’s domestic welfare application should have been stayed and should only have been considered at a later stage if recognition of the Spanish order was for some reason refused.  </p>

She points in particular to <span style="font-style:italic">Re D (A Child) (International Recognition) </span>[2016] EWCA Civ 12 as providing at least one instance of a heavilyfought case in this jurisdiction in which similar issues arose without any suggestion being made that Article 23(e) might apply. </p>

Although I agree that it is not necessary for the purposes of this judgment to undertake any detailed analysis of the provision in the 1996 Hague Convention, I would note that incompatibility with a later order (“measure”) is a ground on which recognition may be refused.  The difference with Article 23(e) of BIIa is that this is only expressly applicable to “a later measure taken in the non-Contracting State of the habitual residence of the child”.  The reasons for this formulation were not explored in the present case and I do not, therefore, propose to comment further on that provision. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The other ground of appeal concerns the fairness of the process.  It is said that, by case-managing the proceedings so as to limit the evidence to how the Spanish order might be enforced and to the issue of the father’s contact, the judge did not receive comprehensive evidence about the children’s circumstances.  There were no proper Children Act statements.  Further, Ms Renton draws attention to passages in the evidence where she says that the judge deterred her from pursuing even the limited issues that had been identified.  The evolution of the children’s views and the part the mother played is not analysed in the judgment.  Ms Renton therefore argues that the court should not have gone on to make a comprehensive welfare order and that the process was inherently unfair.  If this ground of appeal alone succeeds, she seeks a rehearing of the enforcement application and the mother’s welfare application. </p>

Solely with regard to parental responsibility, the judgment with which the judgment for which recognition is sought is irreconcilable must have been given later since earlier judgments will have been taken into account in the judgment connected with the divorce. The objective is to prevent the contradiction which could result, for instance, between a judgment given in another Member State regarding divorce and custody and a judgment given in the forum denying paternity. The commentary on Article 3(3) also needs to be taken into account in this connection (end of jurisdiction of the court hearing the matrimonial proceedings in matters of parental responsibility).” </p>

Recognition is automatic by operation of law and the order remains valid notwithstanding a change in the habitual residence of the child. However, when a child's habitual residence changes, jurisdiction will shift to the new state of habitual residence and that court will, if seised of an application concerning the child, have a theoretically unfettered discretion to make orders under domestic law. However the court in such a case is bound to recognise an existing order and, in the same way as it would not disregard an earlier order made by another domestic court, it must recognise an order made by another Member State. However, in appropriate cases it can make an order which makes different provisions to those made by the earlier order although it cannot 'vary' the order itself. It should only do so (as it would in a purely domestic case) where there has been a change in circumstances which warrant making different provision<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="1">

The scheme and spirit of the Regulation requires the court to act with restraint before exercising its powers in a way that sets up a barrier to enforcement.  This is a familiar discipline.  To take a purely domestic example, a contact order is made in the Family Court after a substantial hearing.  Contact does not take place and an enforcement application is made.  It is met by an application to vary the order, without there being any real change of circumstances.  The court has the power to hear the variation application but is likely to see it for what it is, namely an attempt to frustrate the enforcement of a valid order.  It will not allow it to proceed to a full hearing because that would involve the inappropriate re-litigation of issues that have already been decided; put another way, it would be an impermissible review of the substance of the earlier decision.  In contrast, where the variation application is based upon some apparently significant change of circumstances, the court may well decide to entertain it on its merits alongside the enforcement application.  At all events, neither application has automatic precedence: it will depend on the circumstances.  This is a conventional assessment for specialist family judges. </p>

Assuming for the point of this argument, that I do (and as I indicate below I determine that I do have jurisdiction) my obvious disinclination to this step made clear during the course of argument arises from the proximity in time of the Portuguese order and the inevitable and implicit review of the substance of the judgment to justify the fresh application.

Further, the length of the proceedings far exceeded what was appropriate in the circumstances and took insufficient account of the obligation under Article 31 to determine enforcement applications without delay, particularly bearing in mind the length of time that had already passed as a result of the mother’s Spanish appeal.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.00in">The judge rightly refrained from carrying out a review as to the substance of the Spanish orders.  Such a review, as described by Dr Borrás, would mean ruling again on the ruling of the Spanish court.  However, once the court had decided to carry out a welfare assessment, it was engaged in a different exercise altogether, and one that involved taking the Spanish judgments into consideration so that the court had the whole picture.  The judge’s treatment of this issue at paragraph 31 supports the submission that the Spanish judgments were ignored, but it is clear from her extensive reference to them in her account of the background history that she was well aware of their contents.  The result is that her analysis lacks an element in which the Spanish judgments are explicitly considered as part of the overall welfare assessment, and in which her decision to depart from them, notwithstanding considerations of comity, is explained. </p>

The lack of clarity about the interrelationship between the applications and the absence of close attention to the substance of the Spanish judgments – features that I have accepted – led to a welfare inquiry that was undoubtedly less than fully satisfactory.   </p>

It was a defensible welfare analysis and any shortcomings were in my view matters of form and not of substance.  It is clear from the judgment as a whole that, had the judge followed the fuller process of reasoning, she would undoubtedly have reached the same conclusion. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.00in">The judge identified the principal facts as being the length of time the children had been in England, their ages and their strong wishes to remain living here.  On any view, these were factors of magnetic and almost certainly decisive importance that were bound to dominate any welfare assessment, however it was carried out.  When the mother and children came back to England in 2013, A was returning to a country where she had already lived for six years; in J’s case he has lived here for all but two of his thirteen years.  The judge found that the children are settled and fully integrated into their schooling and peer group and social environment.  She noted that the children had been telling their Guardian since January 2017 that they emphatically do not want to live in Spain, that they are exasperated that their wishes are not heeded and distressed that it is now being proposed that they should be separated.  The range of realistic options for these children, already so narrow, was further sharply reduced by the father’s realistic acceptance that compelling A to move to Spain was not in her interests.  The Guardian’s advice that separation of the children against their wishes could not be contemplated was evidence that the judge was entitled to find compelling.  Against this background, nothing has been said on this appeal to plausibly suggest that a wider welfare survey could have led to any different outcome.  Any procedural irregularity, whether or not it is described as serious, has not led to injustice.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.00in">In any case, the Spanish court had not at any stage contemplated separation of the children and the father was therefore seeking to enforce an entirely different type of order.  Although it does not arise for formal decision on this appeal and I do not rely on it for my overall conclusions, it is not in my view open to the father to choose to pursue partial enforcement in this way.  At the very least it amounts to a significant change in circumstances since the Spanish orders. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.00in">The order for the children to spend substantial time with their father is plainly in their interests and should be capable of being put into effect if he takes the necessary steps to ensure that the children can go to Spain and return reliably.  We were told that this has not yet happened, but it is to be hoped that it will be done for the children’s sake now that this appeal has been decided. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I would add that had the appeal been allowed on ground two, I would have taken some persuading that anything useful could be achieved by remitting the matter, as opposed to remaking the decision ourselves.  The children have been subjected to continuous court proceedings in two jurisdictions since A was aged 9 and J aged 6.  This is not a judgement on the contribution that both parents have undoubtedly made to this unhappy state of affairs, but there must come a point where the children are entitled to be relieved of the pressures of seven years of litigation that has brought them so little benefit. </p>
