Mrs N and her children, A and her sister E, came to this country when Mrs N’s husband was posted here as a diplomat. At that time, they enjoyed a comfortable lifestyle, but the marriage broke down in 2004 as a result of the husband’s violence and coercive control. Mrs N applied for asylum and for a period she and the children lived in a detention centre. When they were granted asylum, they moved into rented accommodation, but the circumstances of the family remained strained and both A and E, then in their early teenage years, developed mental health problems, including eating disorders, in A’s case bulimia. The local authority social services became involved and A spent six months in foster care accommodated under s.20 of the Children Act. She returned home but her problems continued, and she was treated for a time at Great Ormond Street Hospital. At that stage, relations between Mrs N and A were sometimes difficult and it was reported that Mrs N was struggling to cope with the family’s problems. A was placed under a local authority child in need plan for nine months, but by March 2012 circumstances had improved to the extent that the local authority decided to close the case. </p>

When he returned to live in Uganda, A went to visit him in the same year and became pregnant. She returned to this country and on 29 June 2018 gave birth to F. At first, she looked after the baby without apparent difficulty. On 8 September 2018, however, after consuming “a few drinks”, A jumped from a second-floor window, sustaining several fractures. Fortunately, Mrs N had been able to take F from A shortly before the incident. In the following days, while A was recovering in hospital, Mrs N looked after the baby. Subsequently, A and F were placed in a mother and baby unit linked to a psychiatric hospital. On 15 October 2018, A was found drunk to a degree that she was unable to care for F. This prompted the local authority to start care proceedings and an interim care order was granted. After a further relapse, A left the unit and F was removed from her care and placed initially with a relative and, after that placement broke down, in foster care. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">A psychiatric assessment of A was carried out for the purposes of the proceedings. In his report dated February 2019, the psychiatrist recorded that, when giving an account of her personal history, A had described her mother as supportive but old-fashioned. She said that Mrs N had found the bulimia difficult to manage and understand. The psychiatrist concluded that A had suffered from a severe depressive episode in the postnatal period, exacerbated by excessive drinking. By the date of the report, she had recovered, and her prognosis was described as good, provided she “addresses every issue, moving forward”. As to the cause of her illness, the psychiatrist observed: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.00in;text-indent:0.00in">“With regard to aetiology, this will be multifactorial. There was probably a predisposition to depression, given that she had an emotionally unsupportive relationship with her mother, there were chronic bulimic symptoms and a sister has an eating disorder also. However one should not also underestimate the aetiological contribution of post-natal period. There is a particularly high incidence of depression at this time. This is probably caused by, at least in part, biological changes … But there are also obvious psychosocial stressors, particularly for A, was [sic] looking after her baby without the support of the father. Further, the alcohol harmful use worsened the level of agitation and insomnia. It is also probable that the ‘few drinks’ prior to the suicidal act made her more impulsive than usual.” </p>

A continued to drink and her mental health remained fragile. Hair strand testing carried out in September 2019 revealed that she had consumed chronic excessive levels of alcohol in the preceding six months. The testing also found evidence that the mother had taken ecstasy. By the date of the final hearing, A accepted that F could not be returned to her care. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">During the course of the proceedings, Mrs N offered to care for F in the event that he could not be returned to his mother. An initial assessment carried out by the local authority was negative, but a subsequent special guardianship assessment supported her. The children’s guardian appointed to represent A in the proceedings was dissatisfied with the special guardianship report and applied successfully to the court for a further assessment to be carried out by an independent social worker, Julia Hughes. At the conclusion of her assessment, Ms Hughes recommended that F should not be placed in Mrs N’s care. She accepted that Mrs N would be able to provide good care for F in the early years but was concerned about how she would cope when he became older. She also expressed further concerns about Mrs N which she considered added to the risks were F to be placed in her care. These included: (1) that Mrs N had given conflicting accounts about her family history; (2) that she had colluded in A’s attempt to obtain employment at a nursery and been less than frank when contacted by the nursery staff raising concerns about A; (3) that she had wrongly said that she had had no relationships since the separation from her husband, but had then identified as referees two men who each told Ms Hughes that they had been in a relationship with her, and (4) that she minimised the risks posed by A to F and could therefore not be trusted to protect F during contact with his mother. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In her final report, the children’s guardian reached the same conclusion as Ms Hughes. She reported that in their discussions Mrs N had adopted a professional attitude, referring to her experience as a psychiatric nurse. The guardian considered that their discussions illustrated the ongoing communication difficulties between Mrs N and her daughter, and felt there was a “worrying contradiction” between their assertions that they would manage the challenges of a special guardianship placement and what the guardian saw as the reality of their fragile and fraught relationship. The guardian considered that Mrs N underestimated the risks presented to F’s long-term stability by </p>

It was the guardian’s opinion that Mrs N continued to lack ideas about how she might have supported A’s emotional needs when she was younger and that she would struggle to meet the particular needs that F would face overcoming his earliest experiences. </p>

The local authority, supported by the children’s guardian, submitted that the court should make a care order on the basis of a care plan for adoption, coupled with a placement order. A and Mrs N proposed that F be placed in Mrs N’s care under a special guardianship order. </p>

He was critical of the evidence given by the local authority social worker, describing her as demonstrating hostility to A and Mrs N. He was also critical of the initial special guardianship assessment, observing that the report demonstrated a lack of understanding of the duties of an expert. Given the extensive guidance now available in Part 25 of the Family Procedure Rules, it is concerning to read such criticisms about an expert witness instructed in care proceedings. </p>

In the light of the fact that on both occasions she was being assessed it was less than sensible for her not to be open. However, I do not believe that she intended to conceal the true situation at all costs …. She did make full disclosure to Ms Hughes and also gave Ms Hughes the names of the two men with whom she had had relationships as referees. It must have been clear to her that they would tell Ms Hughes the truth.

She added, however, that between 2012 and 2018 things had improved. She insisted that she would not allow A to override her on the arrangements for contact.

The recorder also rejected Ms Hughes’ assessment that Mrs N would struggle to provide emotional support to F as he grew older. He considered that the challenges posed by an adolescent boy would be very different from those faced by Mrs N when caring for her daughters in 2008.

He noted her opinion that there was a significant barrier in the relationship between Mrs N and A, that there was an ongoing risk of conflict between mother and daughter, and that Mrs N would not engage with family therapy which might assist her to address that risk. It was the guardian’s view that the past was the best predictor of the future. But the recorder did not agree that this was true in this case and set out his reasons at paragraph 77 to 80 of his judgment. He did not think it likely that F would suffer problems of the sort experienced by his mother as she was growing up. Having seen and heard from Mrs N and A, it was his view that their relationship had improved over time. He noted that there was no evidence that Mrs N was not a good parent in difficult circumstances prior to the onset of A’s bulimia. Having seen Mrs N, he concluded that she clearly loved F and wanted the best for him. He thought it far more likely than not that she would engage with professionals to improve her parenting. </p>

F was too young to be able to express his wishes and feelings, but the recorder concluded that, were he able to do so, he would be likely to prefer to remain within his birth family. The recorder considered that the child’s physical, emotional and educational needs were the same as those of any small child, adding that his emotional needs were likely to include overcoming the disruption suffered as a result of leaving his foster carers. He noted that there would have to be a change in his circumstances in any event since it was not suggested that he should remain in foster care.

They submitted that the recorder had the benefit of hearing extensive oral evidence over a seven-day hearing. In the light of his assessment of the evidence, he was entitled to decide that F should be placed with his grandmother under a special guardianship order and his judgment adequately explained his reasons for his decision. On behalf of Mrs N, Mr Gordon relied on the concession made by Ms Hughes in evidence that that his client could provide good parenting for F in the early years. In those circumstances he submitted that before allowing this appeal the court would have to be satisfied that there was convincing and cogent evidence that the child will be at risk of significant harm in the grandmother’s care after that time and that no considered intervention or support could mediate that risk. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I deal first with the issue raised by Mr O’Sullivan for the first time in his skeleton argument. The local authority did not seek permission to raise this point before the appeal hearing and in my view it would be wrong to allow the point to be taken at such a late stage. In any event, there is no merit in the point. S.14A(6)(b) permits the court to make a special guardianship order even though no such application has been made. If the local authority wanted to raise the technical objection that no formal application had been made, it should have taken the point before the recorder. It is correct that s.14A(11) precludes the making of a special guardianship order unless the court has received a report dealing with the matters referred to in s.14A(8). In this case, however, those matters were fully assessed in the report prepared by Ms Hughes.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I turn next to the criticisms of the structure of the judgment. As I have said in other cases, the discipline of identifying the realistic options and summarising the advantages and disadvantages of each before making a final order is one which should be followed whenever the court is making a decision about the future of a child: see for example <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Re</span><span style="font-style:italic"> </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">J (Children)</span> [2019] EWCA Civ 2300 para 27. A judge who fails to adopt that approach runs the risk that his decision may be challenged on the grounds that he has failed to take into account a material advantage or disadvantage of one or other of the realistic options. It does not follow, however, that a judgment in which this approach is not adopted will inevitably be overturned. This court will only allow an appeal where persuaded that the decision below was wrong or unjust because of a serious procedural or other irregularity. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Bain points out that the recorder in this case did not set out an analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of a special guardianship order on the one hand and adoption on the other. He describes the recorder’s judgment as linear rather than holistic. It is instructive to remember the origins of the warning against the “linear” approach to analysis in these cases. It arose in the judgment of this court in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Re G (A</span><span style="font-style:italic"> </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Child)</span> [2013] EWCA Civ 965, which was delivered shortly after the judgment in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Re B</span> in which the Supreme Court had stressed the crucial importance of a proportionate approach to a decision to remove a child permanently from the family and stated that adoption is the option of last resort to be chosen when nothing else will do. In his judgment in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Re G</span> (quoted and endorsed a few weeks later by Sir James Munby P in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Re</span><span style="font-style:italic"> </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">B-S</span>), McFarlane LJ, as he then was, said: </p>

The judicial exercise should not be a linear process whereby each option, other than the most draconian, is looked at in isolation and then rejected because of internal deficits that may be identified, with the result that, at the end of the line, the only option left standing is the most draconian and that is therefore chosen without any particular consideration of whether there are internal deficits within that option. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In the present case, however, the recorder, having assessed the evidence, concluded that placing F with his grandmother was viable. It followed that adoption was not an appropriate option because this was not a case when nothing else would do. Applying the principles established in the case law, in particular <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Re B</span>, it was not open to him to make a placement order. In those circumstances, I do not think his failure to set out in detail the advantages and disadvantages of adoption is by itself sufficient reason for this court to intervene. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Although the summary of the relevant law set out in the judgment was relatively brief, for my part I consider that the recorder correctly identified and applied the relevant legal principles, both statutory and those derived from case law. I agree that it is unusual for a judge not to refer to the threshold document, but in this case it was not disputed that the threshold criteria under s.31 were satisfied. The issue was what order should be made to meet F’s welfare needs. It is correct that the judgment does not contain a detailed recital of the history of the difficulties Mrs N experienced caring for A and her sister during the period of 2008 to 2012, but the passages from the judgment recited above demonstrate that the recorder had those matters in mind when carrying out his analysis. No doubt some judges would have been more expansive in setting out the history and analysing the issues. But in my view the analysis set out in the recorder’s judgment is sufficient to explain the reasons for his decision. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The crucial question in this case is whether the appellant has demonstrated that the decision to place F with Mrs N was wrong. That decision was based substantially on the recorder’s assessment of the evidence given by Mrs N and A, his conclusions about their relationship, and about Mrs N’s capacity to meet F’s emotional needs as he grows older. He considered carefully the local authority’s contention that the difficulties experienced by Mrs N when caring for her own children indicated that she would be unable to meet F’s emotional needs as an older child. He rejected that argument for reasons clearly set out in the judgment. As this court has made clear time and again, the assessment of evidence, and the apportionment of weight to be attached to each piece of evidence, are matters for the judge at first instance and an appeal court must not interfere with findings by trial judges unless there are compelling reasons for doing so. It is particularly important to bear this in mind when dealing with a case about the future </p>

In my judgment, he gave sufficient consideration to the professional assessments of Mrs N and, where he disagreed with their conclusions, he explained his reasons for doing so. Crucially, his decision was based on his own evaluation of the family members who gave evidence, in particular his assessment of Mrs N herself. None of the arguments advanced on behalf the guardian or the local authority in this case has persuaded me that this court should interfere with that evaluation. Given the recorder’s assessment of Mrs N, his decision to make a special guardianship order in her favour cannot be described as wrong.  </p>
