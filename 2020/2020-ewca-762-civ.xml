	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Paul and Caroline Crowther used to run a shipping business together, but are now in the throes of a bitter divorce. In the course of the financial remedy proceedings Mrs Crowther obtained a freezing order from Lieven J to restrain the second to sixth respondents (Mr Steven Knight and companies controlled by him) from disposing of or charging four vessels operated within that shipping business. While it is common ground that legal title to the vessels is held by companies controlled by Mr Knight, Mrs Crowther’s case is that she and her husband are entitled to the beneficial interests in those vessels, or strictly speaking the beneficial interests in the shares in the companies which own the vessels, and that there is a fraudulent conspiracy between Mr Crowther and Mr Knight to claim that neither of the Crowthers have any interest in the vessels and thus to reduce the value of the assets available for distribution in the financial remedy proceedings. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Knight, supported by Mr Crowther, denies these allegations. He says that his companies are not only legal but also beneficial owners of the vessels and that there is an urgent need to sell (or perhaps to charge) one of them in order to generate funds for the upkeep and running costs of the remaining vessels in the fleet. </p>

However, the freezing order against the second to sixth respondents was reinstated by Floyd LJ on 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2020 pending this appeal. Mrs Crowther now appeals, seeking to continue the injunction granted by Lieven J until the issue as to beneficial ownership of the vessels can be determined. </p>

The terms of our order are set out in the schedule to this judgment. I now give my reasons for joining in that decision. </p>

They owned a shipping business, which operated vessels providing services in the construction of offshore wind farms and oil and gas subsea operations. Mr Crowther’s expertise was in shipping, so he was responsible for chartering out the vessels and for their management and operation. Mrs Crowther dealt primarily with the financial side of the business and also with property management, managing a serviced office centre called Maritime House until it was sold in 2018. Until 2012 the vessels were owned </p>

Thus until November 2012 the vessels were owned by subsidiaries of a company called Med Marine Charters Limited, while a limited partnership, Atlantic Marine &amp; Aviation LLP (“AMA”), dealt with the operation and management of the vessels. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It appears that the business was sufficiently successful to enable the Crowthers to enjoy an affluent lifestyle. They lived in a house in Sussex valued in excess of £4.5 million (but subject to a mortgage for £1 million), educated their three children privately, owned horses (for which purpose they employed a groom), a collection of expensive cars, and (until recently) an interest in a private aeroplane. </p>

In 1989 he was appointed to manage the Gibraltar office of Price Waterhouse but when that office was closed in 1992 he decided to stay in Gibraltar and to set up his own business, the Castle Trust Group, to take over Price Waterhouse’s private client and trust portfolio of clients. Castle has been operating in Gibraltar for over 27 years. According to Mr Knight, it manages a portfolio of assets worth in excess of several hundred million US dollars and is heavily regulated. Mr Knight emphasises that the Crowthers were just two out of hundreds of clients. </p>

According to Mr Knight, Mr Crowther explained that he and his wife owned three vessels through offshore companies and were currently acquiring a fourth, but the business was highly leveraged and they were struggling to finance their debts. Mr Knight says that he had some familiarity with the Crowthers’ business as Castle acted for some of those who had loaned them money. One of those creditors was Richard Morgan, a family friend to whom the Crowthers had agreed to pay interest at the remarkably high rate of 25% <span style="font-style:italic">per annum</span>. Mr Knight says that he considered that the business of operating offshore vessels was attractive and he saw an opportunity to invest in it. Various possibilities for collaboration were discussed.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The upshot was that two letters were sent to Mr Crowther, summarising two distinct structures. One of these letters was deliberately mis-dated 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2011 in order (according to Mr Knight) to distinguish it from the other which was correctly dated 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2012. This seems an odd way to distinguish the two letters, but it is clear that the 2011 letter was indeed written in May 2012 as it is common ground that the parties had not met before then. The 2011 letter proposed a transfer of the shares of the owning companies to a company within the Castle group in return for which Castle would take over the companies’ debts, together with a bareboat charter of the vessels to AMA, which would therefore continue to operate and manage them.

However, discussions continued through the summer of 2012, while at the same time, according to Mr Knight, loan note holders were making clear that they wanted to get their money back. According to Mr Knight, by 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> October 2012 AMA was in default of at least one outstanding loan and, on 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2012, Castle wrote on behalf of loan note holders to AMA giving notice that it was exercising the right to take over ownership of the vessels. In response, by an email dated 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2012, Mr Crowther apologised for his failure to respond earlier and for the fact “that the company is having difficulty in making the contractual payments at this time”, which he attributed to “cashflow issues”, and promised to make a proposal by the following afternoon at the latest. </p>

Mr Knight and Mr Crowther both say (and Mrs Crowther does not deny) that Mrs Crowther attended this meeting together with her husband. It was agreed that there would be two agreements, one being an agreement whereby a newly formed Castle entity, Castle Ship Management Ltd (“CSM”), would take over the indebtedness under the loan notes together with ownership of five vessels (the <span style="font-style:italic">Atlantic Guardian</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">Atlantic Surveyor</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">Atlantic Cougar</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">Atlantic Wind</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Atlantic Carrier</span>), which would then be bareboat chartered back to AMA. The second agreement was a Family Settlement which it was contemplated would protect Mrs Crowther and the children in the event of Mr Crowther’s early death. It was envisaged that part of the income which would come to AMA from sub-chartering the vessels would be paid into the Settlement in order to build up a fund. In the event, however, Mr Knight says that no money was ever transferred into the settlement. </p>

It recorded that Mr Knight and CSM represented the interests of loan note holders who had made a series of loans to Med Marine on which the latter had defaulted and that in full and final settlement of their claims it was agreed that the beneficial title to all five vessels was transferred to CSM by way of a transfer of 100% of the shares in each ship owning entity; and that the vessels would be bareboat chartered back to AMA. In addition the agreement stated that AMA had agreed to purchase a commercial charter yacht from a company called CD One Ltd but, because it was unable to complete the purchase, it nominated CSM as the buyer, as it was entitled to do under the terms of the Memorandum of Agreement for the purchase of the yacht. The yacht was subsequently renamed as the <span style="font-style:italic">Atlantic Endeavour</span>. </p>

It covered the five vessels named above “and all other vessels beneficially owned by” CSM, so that any vessel acquired in the future would be subject to the charter. The charter was on the standard Barecon 89 form and was stated to be for a firm period of 10 years, extendable by mutual agreement, but with either party having a right to terminate it at any time. The hire rate varied for each vessel depending on its gross tonnage and “operational days” on sublet time charter. This was further explained in additional clause 27: </p>

It is understood and agreed that charterers principal business is to sub charter the ship to third party charterers on a ‘time charter’ and managed basis, that charter rates and flexibility within these terms reflect this approach, and as such the parties are both accepting commercial market risk. Therefore, hire is only payable for ‘operational days’ where the vessel is on charter to a third party and earning revenue there from. It is further agreed that charter hire shall <span style="text-decoration:underline">not</span> be payable in respect of time laid up, on delivery voyages or when undertaking duties for the charterers but not sublet, nor during any time when the vessel is sublet but where hire payments to charterers have been suspended for whatever reason.” </p>

Mr Knight says that the rationale for this was that the vessels were to be employed in the offshore market which typically has seasonal periods with increased demand in spring, summer and autumn, but with many such vessels having to be laid up during the winter when weather conditions are adverse. Thus a vessel might typically have only 120 to 180 days of revenue earning employment a year.  </p>

He says that pursuant to these agreements hire was paid until 2015 in the total sum of about £2.1 million but that hire payments ceased thereafter; that the information provided by AMA which was necessary in order to allocate hire to particular vessels was unsatisfactory; that in due course the vessels initially transferred to CSM were sold and replaced by different vessels which, pursuant to the terms of the charter, were also bareboat chartered to and managed by AMA; and that about £1.6 million was advanced to the Crowthers by way of loan to fund their lifestyle, including payment of school fees and equestrian equipment, which was partly secured by a charge (albeit unregistered) for £500,000 on the family home.  </p>

Mr Charles Howard QC for Mrs Crowther confirmed in argument before us that Mrs Crowther’s case is indeed that this was unlawful tax evasion as distinct from legitimate tax avoidance, albeit that her case will be that despite being a partner in the business and responsible for financial matters, and despite having attended the November 2012 meeting, she was not a participant in unlawful activity. </p>

It can be seen that the total value attributed to these vessels was about £8.15 million, rather less than the figure of £10 million referred to in Mrs Crowther’s evidence (and also in an email from Mr Crowther to which I shall refer), although there is no independent or up-todate valuation evidence to support these figures. It should be noted also that although Mrs Crowther’s case in the divorce proceedings is that the <span style="font-style:italic">Atlantic Discovery</span> is worth £2.95 million, in the Admiralty proceedings referred to below she contends that this is a “gross overvaluation”, being a figure inserted into the Memorandum of Agreement for the purchase of the vessel in order to obtain rollover relief and thereby evade capital gains tax on the sale of Maritime House, and that it was never intended to pay £2.95 million when the true value of the vessel was only £320,000. Thus, on Mrs Crowther’s own case, the true value of the remaining vessels as at the date of the application to Lieven J appears to have been closer to £5 million than £10 million and, if she is right, a substantial part of that value will be owed to HMRC.

He explained that the vessels are ageing and in ever increasing need of maintenance, repair and upgrading if they are to be successfully sub-chartered; that running costs in respect of crewing, port fees, fuel costs and other expenses were accruing on a monthly basis; that classification society fees had to be paid to maintain one of the vessels in class, without which it would be unable to trade; that these matters had previously been the responsibility of AMA and AMOSS as bareboat charterers, who had failed to make the payments, but that CSM was now responsible for them as the bareboat charters had been terminated; that sub-chartering opportunities had been lost for lack of funds to carry out the necessary upgrade work; and that CSM had funds of only about £190,000 left, reduced from about £600,000 in November 2019. He explained also that a prospective buyer had been found for the <span style="font-style:italic">Atlantic Enterprise</span> who was willing to pay a total of US $2.7 million (US $700,000 upfront and the balance over a period of a year). This would enable investment in the remaining vessels, but was prevented by the terms of the freezing order. (We were told, however, that this sale is no longer a possibility). </p>

His conclusion was that he was not satisfied of that at all. Whatever the purpose of the arrangements entered into in 2012, that was long before there was any stress in the marriage between Mr and Mrs Crowther and those arrangements were not entered into with a view to defeating a claim for financial remedy orders. It was apparent that Mrs Crowther was well aware of whatever was arranged and negotiated at that time and had been content with it until the marriage began to fail. Moreover, the judge was not satisfied that there was any real evidence of deviousness on the part of Mr Knight or any intention to try to defeat Mrs Crowther’s claims. On the contrary, it was in her interests that the current structure remained solvent in the event that she had any claim to the beneficial interest in the vessels. </p>

A substantial volume of papers was only provided to him on the previous day, when he was in court dealing with other complex cases, and it would have taken him well over a day to read them (he said in argument that it could have been done in a day, but my own experience is that it took longer, although much of the material was of only peripheral relevance to the freezing order). The judge was not assisted (and nor have we been) by a reading list directing him to the most important documents although it is likely, as no time at all had been allowed for pre-reading, that this would have made no real difference. Moreover, the freezing order was not the only urgent item on a crowded agenda for the day.

On the contrary, he was pressed with a submission that a decision was urgent which, on the face of things, appeared to have force. A decision to adjourn would therefore have been tantamount to a decision to leave the freezing order in place for the time being, potentially with catastrophic consequences for the second to sixth respondents, in circumstances where plainly Mrs Crowther’s undertaking in damages would be of little or no value. </p>

By no stretch of the imagination was that the most urgent item for decision and the debate about whether the Admiralty Court constituted a “specialist list” within the meaning of CPR 30.5 strikes me as (to say the least) an unnecessary luxury when time was so limited. In the event the judge expressed no concluded view on whether he had power to transfer the Admiralty Court proceedings, but decided that, whether he did or not, this was an issue which the Admiralty Court should consider for itself. That decision is not challenged on this appeal and, in my judgment, is plainly right. If an application to transfer is to be made, the sooner that is done, the better. </p>

He never saw the material on which Mrs Crowther relied in support of her case that the 2012 arrangements constituted a sham and, in the event, did not reach even a provisional view as to whether she had established a good arguable case. As the judge had not read the evidence, his conclusion that there was “no real evidence of any deviousness” on the part of Mr Knight must carry little or no weight. Moreover, while the judge regarded himself as forced to adjudicate between maintaining the freezing order and discharging it against the second to sixth respondents altogether, I see no reason why he could not have made an order to the effect which he described, that is “to the effect that if [Mr Knight] sells a ship or ships the proceeds will be reinvested to meet the various expenditure commitments to which he refers".

The current position is extremely urgent as demonstrated by the Prohibition Notices served by the Maritime &amp; Coastguard Agency. Mr Howard asserted repeatedly that the vessels are currently employed, but that was not based on any evidence and is manifestly not so. It is not difficult to ascertain a vessel’s movements but Mrs Crowther has not taken the trouble to do so. Mr Howard even asserted, extraordinarily to my mind, that the Prohibition Notices are somehow the result of collusion between Mr Crowther and the Maritime &amp; Coastguard Agency, but if he had a basis for that assertion he did not share it with us. The position, therefore, is that no money is being spent on these vessels even to insure them and there is a real danger that enforcement action against them will lead to their forced sale in the near future.

If she had relevant evidence to give, I see no reason why she could not have applied to adduce that evidence on this appeal. As Mr Hale pointed out, he would not have been in a position to resist such an application in view of the late stage at which Mr Knight’s evidence had been served.

A WFO is not intended to stop a corporate defendant from dealing with its assets in the normal course of its business. Similarly, it is not intended to constrain an individual defendant from conducting his personal affairs in the way he has always conducted them, providing of course that such conduct is legitimate.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Only two possibilities have been suggested as the true nature of the 2012 arrangements. The first is that the arrangement reached was, as Mr Knight and Mr Crowther say, a commercial agreement to transfer both legal and beneficial title to the vessel owning companies to CSM in exchange for CSM taking responsibility for paying off the loan notes, combined with a bareboat charter to AMA which would enable it to continue in business and to earn a profit on sub-charters of the vessels. The suggested rationale for this arrangement was that the Crowthers were in default of their loan commitments due to cashflow difficulties and faced the vessels being taken over by Castle acting on behalf of their creditors. The second possibility is that it was a criminal conspiracy between Mr Knight and Mr Crowther, but also involving Mrs Crowther who attended at least one of the relevant meetings, to evade tax properly due on the Crowthers’ earnings. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The first of these possibilities has the support of some contemporary documents, by which I mean not only the agreements concluded themselves but also surrounding documents such as the letters and emails which say on their face that the Crowthers’ business was unable to meet loan payments due to “cashflow issues” and that they were faced with a real prospect of losing control of the vessels in any event. If that was so, it would not be a commercially implausible arrangement to make, albeit that it has what I would regard as some unusual features, such as the hire provisions to which I have referred.  </p>

Nevertheless, I am satisfied that Mrs Crowther has a good arguable case that the 2012 arrangements were indeed a sham. Some of the matters relied on by Mr Howard in support of this case appeared to me to miss their target by a considerable distance. For example, it is of no significance that AMA paid for the insurance of the vessels (which would ordinarily be the responsibility of a bareboat charterer) or that it was described in sub-charters as the owner of the vessel (which is standard usage). However, I set out below the principal matters which have weighed with me in reaching this conclusion in more or less chronological order. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">First, there is reason to be sceptical about Mr Knight’s evidence that the Crowthers’ creditors were pressing for repayment and threatening to take over the vessels. In November 2012 Mr Crowther and Mr Knight set up new email accounts for what was described by Mr Crowther as an “offline info flow”. The emails exchanged on these offline accounts appear to show that the demand letters sent by CSM, purportedly acting on behalf of creditors and threatening to take over the vessels, were in fact carefully orchestrated between Mr Knight and Mr Crowther. If that is so, the supposed rationale for the arrangement falls away and the contemporary documents purporting to show pressure from creditors are no more than an artificial paper trail. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Further doubt as to the truth of this rationale appears from the witness statement of Mr Morgan, a statement served by Mr Crowther on which both he and Mr Knight strongly relied. Mr Morgan, together with his wife, appears to have been the single largest creditor of the Crowthers. But his evidence was not that Castle was acting for them to obtain payment or that the Crowthers were in default. Rather it was that he and his wife were merely notified that ownership of the vessels together with the loan notes had been transferred to Castle. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Second, the economics of the arrangement do not appear to make sense. A single page taken from CSM’s accounts for the year ending 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> December 2013 appears to show that the total value of the loan notes taken over by CSM as at 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> December 2013 was £346,980, although the opening figure for the year was only £297,086. Nevertheless it was the figure of £346,980 which was stated in what we were told was an attachment to the agreement dated 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> November 2012, more than a year before, as being the outstanding debt on loan notes as at that date. The attachment purports to show the gross value of the five vessels transferred to CSM as being £862,500, against a total liability of £1,039,929. But some of the items making up that total liability are difficult to understand. They include the value of the loan notes. But, for example, they also include a “forced sale devaluation 25%”, amounting to £194,062, which has not been explained. The document has the appearance of an attempt to manufacture liabilities showing the Crowthers in a worse position than was really the case. </p>

That would mean that CSM would be responsible for payment of the purchase price. However, an AMA bank statement shows a payment of €220,000 made to CSM on 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> November 2012 described as “CD1 Payment”. On its face, that suggests that it was AMA and not CSM which purchased and paid for the yacht. Mr Hale submitted that despite the reference to “CD1 Payment”, the figure of €220,000 can be explained as representing the difference between the value of the vessels taken over by CSM and total liabilities in the document attached to the agreement dated 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> November 2012. However, while that may prove to be a valid explanation, there is at present no evidence to support it and Mrs Crowther is entitled to rely on what is said in the bank statement. </p>

Contemporary emails show that Mr Crowther was advised by his accountant that in order to obtain rollover relief on the sale of Maritime House, thereby avoiding a substantial tax bill, he would need to reinvest a total sum of £3,192,276. These facts do at least give rise to a suspicion that £2.95 million was a fictional purchase price. Moreover, the bill of sale (signed by an employee of Mr Knight) includes a receipt for the price, but Mr Knight now says that the price was never paid, entitling him to take back ownership of the vessel.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The context for these claims was an attempt to raise a loan of £1 million to fund litigation against a sub-charterer which had failed to make hire payments. In his evidence and in his oral submissions to us Mr Crowther has sought to explain the claim to ownership by emphasising the words “within the group” which I have italicised, claiming that this included CSM as the owner of the vessels. I find that implausible, as is his assessment of the value of the vessels, while his optimistic claims in this email about the profitability of the business are hard to reconcile with his evidence in October 2019 that the last three years had “seen an offshore industry crisis worldwide” and “a severe downturn in business” in which it was difficult to generate income. Further, the statement that “The business has NO debt” is impossible to reconcile with Mr Knight’s claim, admitted and averred by Mr Crowther, that a substantial debt is owed to CSM. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Tenth, Mr Knight’s evidence is that CSM is currently owed some £5 million by the Crowthers or their companies, although in November 2019 he was contending that the sum owed was as high as £7 million. This includes, as I understand it, unpaid hire and the purchase price of the <span style="font-style:italic">Atlantic Discovery</span> in 2018. But there is no evidence of any payment being demanded by CSM before the breakdown of the Crowthers’ marriage in September 2019. If these sums or anything like them were really thought to be due, I find that inexplicable.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The claim for unpaid hire raises the question of how the vessels have been employed in the last few years. If they have been sub-chartered so as to be earning hire (and Mr Crowther’s evidence was that at any rate the <span style="font-style:italic">Atlantic Voyager</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Atlantic Discovery</span> were employed as at 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2019), but hire has not been paid, the question arises why not. On the face of things, that would suggest either that Mr Crowther has been cheating Mr Knight (which Mr Knight has not suggested) or that AMA’s office has been remarkably inefficient in accounting for the hire due (a complaint which Mr Knight has made). But in either event, Mr Knight would have serious cause for dissatisfaction with the way Mr Crowther conducts his business. In either event it seems odd that Mr Knight should be so willing to continue to work with Mr Crowther, a man who on his case owes him a substantial sum which he has little prospect of recovering, and to remain on what the judge noted were obviously friendly terms with him.  </p>

All of them will require careful investigation, either in the course of the Family Court or Admiralty proceedings or perhaps by the tax authorities. There may be an explanation which is consistent with the case made by Mr Knight and Mr Crowther. But as matters stand at present, I am inclined to think that the court has not been provided with a full account of the parties’ relationship and have no doubt that Mrs Crowther meets the standard of demonstrating a good arguable case on the merits of her claim. </p>

Significant aspects of Mrs Crowther’s case, as to which I have held that she meets the standard of showing a good arguable case, are that Mr Knight has been engaged in tax evasion and has also advanced spurious claims in order to assist Mr Crowther to conceal the true extent of the family assets. Once again, I emphasise that these are only allegations to which there may be valid answers. However, on the present state of the evidence, there is a sufficient risk that assets may be dissipated to justify the grant of a freezing order. </p>

As already noted, this is not to provide a claimant with security or to prevent a defendant from carrying on business in the ordinary course. The freezing order made by Lieven J in the present case restrains Mr Knight and his companies from disposing of the vessels, but expressly does not prevent them from operating business as usual. There is a tension between these two provisions of the order because a sale may be made in the ordinary course of business. Indeed all five of the vessels the subject of the 2012 agreement have since been sold in the ordinary course of business and the proceeds have been used either to purchase further vessels or to invest in the existing fleet. Thus a disposal of one vessel in order to pay running costs of the remaining vessels and to </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I see no reason to doubt that running costs are being incurred. The crews need to be paid and, if they are not, will be able to enforce their rights with the benefit of a maritime lien; so too do port charges, insurance costs, classification fees and the like. Unless such payments are made, it is impossible for the vessels to operate. Moreover, these are ageing vessels. The <span style="font-style:italic">Atlantic Tonjer</span> was built in 1983 and is therefore 37 years old; the <span style="font-style:italic">Atlantic Discovery</span> is 29 years old; and the <span style="font-style:italic">Atlantic Enterprise</span> is 22 years old, although apparently it was rebuilt in 2015. It would not be surprising if at least some of these vessels are approaching the end of their useful life and it is entirely plausible that they will need maintenance and repair if they are to be gainfully employed in a competitive chartering market. Mr Knight suggests that monthly costs across the fleet are of the order of US $115,000 and, although this figure is not precisely documented, it seems to me to be plausible. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">A freezing order ought not in principle to prevent a defendant from selling one asset in order to invest in the remaining assets used in his business. That is what Mr Knight says that he wishes to do and he made the case before the judge that there was a degree of urgency in doing so. As I have explained, the position now is even more urgent. Accordingly, like the judge, we canvassed with the parties the possibility of an order which would enable a vessel to be sold or charged as security for a loan and for the proceeds to be used only for the purpose of paying such running costs together with repairs and maintenance. Mr Knight was prepared to offer an undertaking to this effect. Although very sceptical about the supposed impecuniosity of CSM, Mrs Crowther was prepared at any rate to contemplate such an order as a last resort, provided that various safeguards were included.  </p>

It accords with the principles applicable to the grant of freezing orders and (which in this case amounts to the same thing) is in accordance with the balance of convenience. It provides a prospect that the value of the vessels may be preserved for whomever is held to be their ultimate beneficial owner in circumstances where, if nothing is done, there is a very real risk that they will shortly be sold on a forced sale for no more than scrap value. As the judge said, that cannot be in Mrs Crowther’s interests if she is able to make good her case. Conversely, if she is unable to make good her case, she will potentially be exposed on her undertaking in damages to a significant liability which she is unlikely to be able to meet. </p>
