In 1994, he travelled from Somalia to join his father in the Netherlands, where he and his father were naturalised as Dutch citizens. The Appellant’s father came to the United Kingdom in 1997 and the Appellant joined him here in December 1998. The Appellant claims to have resided continuously in the United Kingdom since that date. He also claims to have developed substantial connections in the United Kingdom which, at the time of the First-Tier Tribunal hearing, included his ten year-old child with his ex-wife, his second wife and two stepchildren, and his father and other relatives.  </p>

Thirdly on 10 June 2015 the appellant was convicted of possession of an offensive weapon in a public place and other offences and sentenced to thirteen months’ imprisonment.

The Respondent accepted that the Appellant had “demonstrated five years residency in the UK” and was entitled to protection under Regulation 21(3) as a permanent resident. The Respondent considered that the deportation had to be justified on “serious grounds of public policy or public security”, but concluded that this threshold had been satisfied on the evidence. The Respondent did not accept that the appellant had ten years continuous residence. This would have afforded the Appellant an enhanced level of protection, because his deportation would have had to be justified on “imperative grounds of public security” under Regulation 21(4). </p>

FTT Judge Cassel dismissed his appeal. The Appellant subsequently appealed to the UT but his appeal was dismissed by UT Judge Rimington on 13 December 2017. On 20 March 2019, Sir Stephen Silber granted permission to appeal to this court on the grounds that the FTT and UT had failed to address adequately the level of protection owed to the Appellant by virtue of his (a) permanent residence or (b) ten years continuous residence. </p>

The Respondent disputed that the Appellant had established ten years continuous residence, but did not submit that if the Appellant had ten years residence there were “imperative grounds of public security” to justify his deportation. The second issue was whether deportation was justified on “serious grounds of public policy or public security” under Regulation 21(3), as it had to be in view of the Appellant’s having acquired the status of permanent resident after five years. This was the basis on which the Respondent made its deportation decision.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">At the UT hearing, there was some discussion about whether the 2006 or the 2016 Regulations applied. The Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2016 came into force in February 2017, prior to the FTT hearing and the FTT Judge’s decision. The UT Judge proceeded on the basis that the 2006 Regulations still applied because Schedule 4 to the Immigration (European Economic Area) (Amendment) Regulations 2017 (No.1) states that the 2006 Regulations apply to pending appeals. It was not in dispute before us that that conclusion was correct. There was also no suggestion by either party that the UK’s withdrawal from the European Union and the EEA on 31 January 2020 could make any difference to the outcome of this appeal. </p>

I am prepared to accept his evidence but that still leaves very many criminal offences covering a range of offences, many of which involve possession of controlled drugs or offences linked to serious breaches of public order, and include the possession of weapons.  The Appellant relies on <span style="font-style:italic">MG (prisonArticle 28(3)(a) of Citizens Directive) Portugal </span>[2014] UKUT 00392 (IAC) and that time that he has spent in prison does not necessarily prevent him from acquiring the highest protection counted back from the date of assessment in March 2017.  At paragraph 48 of that judgment is the following comment “.. the fact that the Court specifies that “in principle” periods of imprisonment interrupt the continuity of residence for the purposes of meeting the 10 year requirement can only mean that so far as establishing integrative links is concerned such period must have a negative impact.” In the Appellant’s case there are two periods of imprisonment.  The first was imposed by Woolwich Crown Court on 16 October 2012 when he was sentenced to 12 months for affray, 6 months consecutive for offensive weapon in a public place, 3 months for destroying or damaging property, to run consecutively and a further one month for failing to comply with an earlier suspended sentence.  The second period of imprisonment was imposed by Inner London Crown Court on 10 June 2015 when for possession of controlled drugs and offensive weapons he was sentenced to 13 months imprisonment.  As part of the overall assessment, and I accept that the periods of imprisonment do not automatically disqualify him from enhanced protection under the regulations, and that he has lived in the UK for many years beforehand, I find that although in themselves the criminal convictions do not determine the issue, the Crown Courts having found that the nature of the offences are serious ones which merited periods of imprisonment which are not insubstantial they do have a negative impact, do interrupt the continuity of residence and he is not entitled to enhanced protection.” </p>

The judge's view of the evidence was more with a view to the integrative links that the appellant had rather than to conclude whether he had permanent residence or not, but the fact remains that the judge found there was scant evidence that the appellant had resided in the UK between his release in 2002 and 2007 from when the appellant provided documentary evidence. … </p>

First, he submitted that at paragraph [27] of his judgment, the FTT Judge assumed that in order to establish ten years’ residence, the Appellant had to reside as a “qualified person in accordance with Regulation 6 of the 2006 Regulations” throughout the ten year period. This assumption was erroneous because the Appellant only had to show that (a) he had resided in the United Kingdom for ten years prior to the expulsion decision in March 2016 and (b) he had qualified for permanent residence. Mr Fripp criticised the FTT’s apparent conclusion that the claim to ten years’ continuous residence failed even as a matter of arithmetic. The Respondent’s decision letter of 23 March 2016 stated at paragraph 52 that “we are aware……that you have been in the UK since 1999 when you enrolled at school”. </p>

I note the wording used by the CJEU in paragraph 83 of <span style="font-style:italic">Vomero</span>. The aspects of the case that must be taken into account in deciding whether, notwithstanding the detention, the integrative links with the host State have not been broken include “the strength of the integrative links forged with the host Member State before the detention of the person concerned, the nature of the offence that resulted in the period of detention imposed, the circumstances in which that offence was committed and the conduct of the person concerned throughout the period of detention”.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:1.00in">After this judgment was sent to counsel in draft Mr Fripp sought an anonymity direction, so that his client would be described as IH (Netherlands), “not for any reason of his interests, but because identifying him may by extension allow the identification of his minor child and stepchildren and prejudice the children or any of them, and it is in their best interests that the risk of this be averted”. I would decline to make such an order: the FTT and UT judgments were published giving the Appellant’s full name, the hearing before us was listed and heard in open court under his name, and there are no exceptional circumstances (such as a risk on return in an asylum case) justifying a direction for anonymity. </p>
