	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">First, the three categories in subsection (2)(c) have a potential to overlap. Plainly an offender who has received a sentence of more than 12 months may have done so because he committed an offence which caused serious harm. Equally, an offender who persistently offends is likely to receive a longer sentence (and more than 12 months) because of a poor antecedent history.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">Second, the provision must be given its ordinary meaning informed by its context. The three categories must be read together. This is more than simply a conventional approach to statutory interpretation. It is plain, for example, from the structure of the provision that an offender who has been sentenced to a term of less than 12 months for an offence may nevertheless be treated as a â€˜foreign criminalâ€™ if the offence caused serious harm; and that â€˜serious harmâ€™ will only be relevant when the sentence for an offence is less than 12 months. This throws light on what may be encompassed by an offence which causes serious harm. While it is possible to think of offences which, despite causing the most serious harm, would not typically attract an immediate prison sentence of at least 12 months (causing death by careless driving is an example), in general paragraph (c)(ii) is not concerned with the most serious kind of harm which comes before the Crown Court. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">Third, Mr Biggs drew our attention to s.32(1)-(5) of the UK Borders Act 2007 (â€˜UKBA 2007â€™). Section 32(3) provides that, where an offender is sentenced to imprisonment for an offence specified by the Secretary of State by order, a deportation order may be made under s.5(1) of the IA 1971. His submission was that allowing the â€˜serious harmâ€™ test under s.117D(2)(c)(ii) to be satisfied where a given type of offence has been committed, merely because of a perceived generalised harm caused by such offending, would â€˜trespass into territoryâ€™ covered by s.32(3) of the UKBA. We are not persuaded that there is any merit in this argument. Section 32(3) has not been brought into legislative effect and the Secretary of State has not made any order as envisaged; and part 5A of the NIAA 2002 was introduced so as to provide a structured approach to the issue of deporting foreign criminals by reference to rights under article 8 of the ECHR.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">So far as the word â€˜causedâ€™ is concerned, the harm must plainly be causatively linked to the offence. In the case of an offence of violence, injury will be caused to the immediate victim and possibly others. However, what matters is the harm caused by the particular offence. The prevalence of (even minor) offending may cause serious harm to society, but that does not mean that an individual offence considered in isolation has done so. Shoplifting, for example, may be a significant social problem, causing serious economic harm and distress to the owner of a modest corner shop; and a thief who steals a single item of low value may contribute to that harm, but it cannot realistically be said that such a thief caused serious harm himself, either to the owner or to society in general. Beyond this, we are doubtful that a more general analysis of how the law approaches causation in other fields is helpful. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">Mr Biggs argued on behalf of Mahmood that the harm must be physical or psychological harm to an identifiable individual that is identifiable and quantifiable. We see no good reason for interpreting the provision in this way. The criminal law is designed to prevent harm that may include psychological, emotional or economic harm. Nor is there good reason to suppose a statutory intent to limit the harm to an individual. Some crimes, for example, supplying class A drugs, money laundering, possession of firearms, cybercrimes, perjury and perverting the course of public justice may cause societal harm. In most cases the nature of the harm will be apparent from the nature of the offence itself, the sentencing remarks or from victim statements. However, we agree with Mr Biggs, at least to this extent:  harm in this context does not include the potential for harm or an intention to do harm. Where there is a conviction for a serious attempt offence, it is likely that the sentence will be more than 12 months.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">Mr Biggs argued that the Secretary of State must prove the case against the offender by adducing specific items of evidence that would include, if the seriousness of the harm were in issue, evidence from the victim. We see no proper basis for this argument. In many cases, a victim statement will be put before the sentencing judge. This will describe the impact caused by the offence as at the date of the statement. A victim statement adduced in criminal proceedings has the status of evidence which a defendant has an opportunity to challenge before sentence is passed (<span style="font-style:italic">R v. Perkins</span> [2013] 2 Cr. App. R. (S) 72). There is no justification for allowing a second such opportunity in proceedings before the FtT. In cases where the Secretary of State relies on the causing of serious harm alone for treating an offender as a â€˜foreign criminalâ€™, we would expect the sentencing remarks (if available) and the victim statement (if it exists) to form part of the Secretary of Stateâ€™s evidence before the tribunal. However, we recognise that in many cases a victim or those less directly affected by a crime may be reluctant to make a statement as to the harm endured by an offence, and no proper conclusions can be drawn from the lack of such a statement. </p>

A tribunal is entitled to take judicial notice of the emotional and psychological impact, often long lasting, that such offending generally causes to a young victim who is sexually exploited by an older man; and to find, on the balance of probabilities, that serious harm had been caused.  </p>

Such offences did not cause harm to individual victims, although it would be sufficient that they caused harm to society in general. In the decision letter of 27 February 2018, the Secretary of State explained that falsified documents can be used for the purposes of identity theft, age deception, illegal immigration and organised crime, with identity-based fraud undermining the integrity of a wide variety of institutions and systems.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">No doubt each offence of this nature contributes to a serious and perhaps widespread problem. However, the issue under s.117D(2)(c)(ii) is whether the offender has been convicted of â€˜an offenceâ€™ which has caused serious harm. We accept that an individual offence of this sort can be said to cause serious harm, but there has to be some evidence that it has done so. The decision letter refers to the undermining of the integrity of the revenue and benefits system, banking and employment, and even national security; but there was insufficient evidence that these offences, even if aggregated, had such an effect. These offences usually result in a prison sentence because identity fraud is regarded as a serious matter; but that cannot, of itself, be enough to satisfy the requirement of causing â€˜serious harmâ€™. </p>

SSHD</span> [2019] EWCA Civ 551, pithily summarised a persistent offender as someone who â€˜keeps on breaking the lawâ€™. There can be no doubt that this is an apt description of Estnerie: his offending encompassed six separate criminal offences committed over a period of 14 years (from 2002 to 2016). While we recognise that there may be some cases where a person who was a persistent offender can show, through remorse or rehabilitation, that they are no longer properly categorised as such, the cases are likely to be exceptional. As Hamblen LJ noted in <span style="font-style:italic">Binbuga</span> at [46], this would usually involve â€˜keeping out of trouble for a significant period of timeâ€™. This cannot apply to Estnerie because his last offence was committed only a year before his conviction; because the FtT heard his appeal less than a year after he was convicted and sentenced; and because even at that appeal hearing he was found to have lied in his evidence to try and improve his position (see paragraphs [53]-[58] of the FtT judgment), which lies were consistent with the dishonest behaviour of which he was convicted ([59]).<span style="color:#2F5496"> </span>The evidence is therefore irrefutable that Estnerie has kept on breaking the law and is manifestly neither remorseful nor rehabilitated. He is therefore a persistent offender within the meaning of s.117D(2)(c)(iii). </p>

Actual bodily harm is by definition bodily harm that is more than trivial. It does not always attract a prison sentence. If it is sufficiently serious to require a prison sentence (â€˜so serious that nothing less will doâ€™), a tribunal will generally be entitled to conclude (without more) that it has caused serious harm for the purpose of section 117D(2)(c)(ii). The offending in this case was an incident of road rage committed on a public highway in which a weapon was used in a repeated stabbing motion, with the immediate victim sustaining two cuts to her scalp, four superficial cuts on her back close to the spine, and a bruise and grazes to her cheek.   </p>
