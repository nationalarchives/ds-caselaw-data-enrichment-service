This was refused absent a mobility assessment by an expert. He sought judicial review and the Respondent, in due course, entered into a Consent Order (the Order) under which the Appellant was granted a Blue Badge without having to undertake a mobility assessment.  However no provision was made for costs.  This matter was submitted to the Judge to determine. This appeal is against the ruling of Richard Whittam QC, sitting as a Deputy Judge of the High Court (“<span style="font-style:italic">the Ruling</span>” and “<span style="font-style:italic">the Judge</span>”), dated 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2019 in which he refused to make an order for costs in favour of the Appellant.  </p>

The Appellant argues that the present case is a clear category (i) case where the Appellant achieved through the litigation essentially all that he was seeking.  Accordingly he is, <span style="font-style:italic">prima facie</span>, entitled to his costs absent some other good reason not to award costs.  No such reason exists here. The Judge therefore erred in failing to categorise this case as category (i) and also in identifying a policy reason for not awarding costs.    </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The Respondent disagrees. It is denied that the Appellant won outright. He did not obtain all of the relief that he sought in the judicial review proceedings.  On this basis the Judge was entitled to treat this as category (ii) or (iii) case (where there is no starting assumption that the claimant gets costs), and in effect a “<span style="font-style:italic">nil all draw</span>”.  But even if that was wrong there were good policy reasons, based upon the need not to disincentive settlement, for not awarding costs.  Standing back, the local authority took a pragmatic decision to grant the Appellant a Blue Badge and settled the litigation at the first reasonable point in time, and the Judge correctly exercised a discretion which on appeal, this court should be slow to interfere with absent some plain error, which there is not. </p>

The Appellant argued that the Respondent had misconstrued the relevant legislation as excluding from entitlement to a Blue Badge a person with a nonphysical disability who nonetheless had a consequential inability to walk, and had imposed an unlawful, discriminatory and irrational obligation upon the Appellant to attend for a disability assessment before the Respondent would make any substantive decision.   </p>

The judicial review concerned the interpretation of Regulation 4(2)(f) of the Disabled Persons (Badges for Motor Vehicles) Regulations 2000 (“<span style="font-style:italic">The 2000 Regulations</span>”).  This was made under section 21 of the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970.

At all times until 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2019 the description of disabled persons included: “<span style="font-style:italic">a permanent and substantial disability which causes inability to walk or very considerable difficulty in walking</span>” (Regulation 4(2)(f)). The Respondent, in common with some other authorities, whilst accepting that persons with non-physical disabilities were not <span style="font-style:italic">per se</span> excluded, nonetheless construed this provision as limited to <span style="text-decoration:underline">physical</span> disability <span style="font-style:italic">causing</span> an applicant’s mobility impediment.  This therefore excluded non-physical obstacles to walking.  Examples of the latter would include anxiety at being out in public or safety concerns arising out of mental health difficulties.  </p>

In paragraph [3.11] the Department crystallised the issue around causation i.e. whether a walking impediment <span style="font-style:italic">caused</span> by a non-physical disability fell within the scheme or whether it only applied where the impediment to walking was caused by a physical disability. There was also confusion as to the nature of the impediment to walking.  Did it only cover physical problems – for instance the ability to put one foot in front of another – or did it also include the sorts of impediments that a person with a non-physical disability might encounter which might flow from anxiety or fear and those which could give rise to safety concerns.  </p>

There is, as counsel for the Respondent pointed out, a technical mismatch between the formal relief as drafted in the claim and the Order.  However, in public law proceedings it is always necessary to have an eye for the realities of the case.  It is in the nature of public law proceedings that a claimant must, perforce, cloak his <span style="font-style:italic">real</span> object in public law garb including, routinely, an application for remittal for reconsideration and/or a remittal of a damages claim for assessment in the County Court.  The High Court does not in public law proceedings usually determine the ultimate merits of a dispute over a decision taken by a public body. In <span style="font-style:italic">R(Tesfay) v Home Secretary</span> [2016] EWCA Civ 415 at paragraph [57], the same point was made about the need to look at the real substance in public law proceedings to determine who had won. A court should consider: what was sought; the basis upon which it was sought and opposed; and, what was achievable.  The Court highlighted that working out who had won in a public law case was not as easy as it might be in civil proceedings because of the fact: whilst a claimant might ultimately desire a substantive result on the merits, remittal might still be a “<span style="font-style:italic">substantial achievement</span>” and the best remedy available.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Johnson, argued that, notwithstanding, it was not in fact clear that the Appellant had truly won.  He pointed out that the thrust of the judicial review was to overcome the requirement imposed by the authority that the Appellant attend a mobility assessment.  The 2019 amending Regulations had introduced detailed new rules on mobility assessments.  In the final outcome, it was not improper to require an applicant (including the present Appellant) to attend such an assessment.  Had he done so then he would have been assessed by an independent expert.  That person might have taken a different and wider view of the law and the scope of the entitlement than did the authority.  Mr Johnson said that it was pure speculation to seek to work out what would have happened on the assessment.  The Judge was obviously aware of this and had taken the resultant uncertainty as to outcome into account in the exercise of his discretion. The answer to this lies in the position of the authority as set out in the statement of Ms Binns.  Under the rules, an assessor does no more than report back to the authority who then takes the final decision.  If, to test the argument, the assessor had recommended a grant of a Blue Badge to the Appellant upon a basis that the authority considered to be unlawful and inconsistent with the 2000 Regulations then, a court is entitled to infer, the authority would have acted in accordance with <span style="font-style:italic">its</span> own view of the law and its obligations thereunder, and not that of the assessor. Upon the basis of the construction placed upon the law by the Respondent, there would have been no real point in the Appellant attending an assessment since, on the law as understood by the authority, he would almost inevitably have failed.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">If therefore the Appellant is entitled to costs, is there any good policy reason which should apply to strip him of the fruits of his victory?  The Judge (albeit upon the basis that this was not an <span style="font-style:italic">M</span> category (i) case) held that there was, namely the policy that awarding costs could stifle settlements.  With respect, even standing alone this reasoning is not convincing.  We accept that there is some force in the Judge’s observation, but it requires qualification. If costs are <span style="text-decoration:underline">not</span> awarded litigants might feel compelled to persist in the litigation, rather than settle, upon the basis that it is only at the culmination of the judicial process that costs can be recovered.  As such, it is not always the case that making no award of costs will encourage settlement; the converse can occur, and this would disincentivise settlement.   The issue must also be seen in the broader context of access to justice.  This case concerned the rights of a person suffering from a disability to a social benefit that could ease the burdens of his everyday life. Sadly, to obtain the permit he was compelled to resort to litigation.  This is a step not lightly taken and can involve a significant exposure to an adverse costs order which can create a risk disproportionate to the sought-after benefit.  An adverse costs order, which includes no order for costs, can be ruinous. Many litigants in the position of the Appellant are unable to fund litigation which involves even a modest costs risk. If a litigant who prevails does not receive the benefit of an order for costs this also can, in an era where legal aid for the vindication of civil rights is virtually non-existent, serve to deter the enforcement of rights. The fact that the Appellant has, in this case, been legally aided does not alter the broader picture. If those advising vulnerable litigants cannot recover their costs, they will be deterred from representing them in the first place.   In short, and with respect to the Judge, I am of the conclusion that insofar as policy considerations were relevant, the analysis in the Ruling was partial and incorrect.  </p>

The amendments were clarificatory and intended to shed light upon the 2000 Regulations and make clear that those Regulations did encompass a person such as the Appellant, with a hidden, non-physical, disability, which caused an impediment to walking.  A consultation paper and response published in 2018 cannot, strictly speaking in terms of the rules governing admissible guides to the construction of legislative measures, be relevant to the meaning of the 2000 Regulations since these Departmental statements post-date the 2000 Regulations by some 18 years. They do of course predate the 2019 amendment provisions and do guide their construction, insofar as any ambiguity remains. Generally, even if not strictly a guide to construction, they can be taken as informative as the views of an authoritative and well-informed source. To this extent, they support the conclusion I have arrived at applying normal principles of construction.  </p>

He did not have the benefit (that we undoubtedly have had) of detailed written submissions and close oral argument.  In <span style="font-style:italic">R(Parveen) v Redbridge LB</span> [2020] EWCA Civ 194 (“<span style="font-style:italic">Parveen</span>”), the Court of Appeal has, in effect, warned this court to be chary of interfering in the exercise of discretion by first instance judges on costs matters.  Such judges are often required to take relatively rough and ready decisions, often on the papers only, and it is inimical to an efficient administration of justice if the appeal court pores over the fine details and picks holes in findings. A judge’s decision should not be overturned simply because the appellate court, after far fuller argument, might take a different view.  In <span style="font-style:italic">Parveen</span> the outcome pivoted upon a variety of non-legal matters.  The Court was attracted to certain conclusions that the costs judge, on a relatively rough and ready basis, had not considered persuasive. The Court nonetheless dismissed the appeal and emphasised that, bearing in mind the quite different nature of the hearing before the costs judge and that before the appeal court, the appeal court should only interfere if the conclusion of the costs judge was not “<span style="font-style:italic">open to him</span>”.

The classification of a case as <span style="font-style:italic">M</span> category (i), as opposed to (ii) or (iii), is a decision which can contain a significant element of principle.  The judge has a discretion, but that discretion must be exercised in accordance with principle.

As such the Appellant was entitled to an award of costs absent some good reason and as to this I am of the view that the analysis of the countervailing policy reason was incomplete and did not serve to rebut the basic position, namely that the Appellant was entitled to his costs. It follows that although I have sympathy with the Judge, I conclude that there was an error of principle in his reasoning and that this is therefore a case where this court can form its own view.  </p>

I have read the court file which records the manner in which the Appellant’s solicitors aggressively expanded their battle against the authority with distracting and personalised complaints about public officials to the SRA and to the Information Commissioner.

No criticism attaches to Mr Packer. </p>
	      </authorialNote>.  For its part, the authority made an error of law but its position towards the Appellant was not advanced in bad faith and arose because of a misconstruction, shared by other authorities, of legislation which has been acknowledged by Government as being less than pellucidly clear. We are told that the Appellant’s costs incurred to the point of the settlement were significantly over £60,000. It is at least a possibility that the aggression evidenced in correspondence, and the resultant strain placed on relations between the parties, added to the costs incurred.   </p>

Had this matter proceeded to a hearing and had the authority then lost it could have faced a costs bill approaching £100,000.  On the other side of the coin, disputes of this nature expose individuals in difficult social and economic circumstances to potentially disastrous litigation risk.   For both sides, this sort of litigation should be avoided. It is apparent that the decision taken by the Respondent was subject to internal re-review by a person unconnected to the case. This was however unsuccessful and did not lead to the decision being rescinded prior to litigation.  The increasingly common process of administrative re-review is desirable.  It allows administrative decisions to be internally reassessed by a fresh and independent set of eyes, in particular eyes not blinkered by the potentially strained nature of the relationship between the parties. Experience in both central and local Government indicates that where internal review is sufficiently rigorous and robust it can markedly reduce the number and incidence of disputes and consequential appeals. The authority might wish to consider why it did not succeed in this case. Had it worked it could have saved a good deal of time and public money and resource.  </p>
