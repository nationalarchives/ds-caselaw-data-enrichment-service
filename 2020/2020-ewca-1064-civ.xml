	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">At about 9.30am CET on 15 January 2015 the Swiss Franc was “de-pegged” from the Euro (having been pegged at the rate of 1.2 CHF to 1 Euro), resulting in a short period of extreme volatility in the exchange rate between those currencies. At 9.47am the appellant (“CFH”), through its automated clearing system, placed 27 electronic market orders directly with the respondent (“MLI”) to trade a total of €20,479,000 for Swiss Francs at the next available price. MLI’s automated system filled the orders almost instantaneously at an average rate of 0.1821969 CHF and executed the trades. On the main platform for EUR/CHF trading (“the EBS platform”), the “official low” was declared at 0.85 CHF. Later the same day the rate on the EBS platform stabilised at about 1.000 CHF.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">The issue on this appeal is whether it is arguable, as CFH contended, that the effect of MLI’s Terms and Conditions of Business (“MLI’s Terms”) is to import into the transactions a contractual obligation to comply with “market practice”, so as to require MLI to re-price the 27 transactions at 0.85 CHF, the “official low” of the EBS authenticated market range, or otherwise to cancel them. As MLI had offered to reprice the transactions at 0.75 CHF, an offer CFH accepted under protest, CFH’s principal claim is for damages of 0.10 CHF per Euro, amounting to 2,047,900 CHF.  </p>

The reason is quite simple: if the respondent's case is bad in law, he will in truth have no real prospect of succeeding on his claim or successfully defending the claim against him, as the case may be. Similarly, if the applicant's case is bad in law, the sooner that is determined, the better. If it is possible to show by evidence that although material in the form of documents or oral evidence that would put the documents in another light is not currently before the court, such material is likely to exist and can be expected to be available at trial, it would be wrong to give summary judgment because there would be a real, as opposed to a fanciful, prospect of success.

Indeed, in <span style="font-style:italic">Brandeis </span>the suggestion that the entirety of the SFA Rules was incorporated was rejected, despite the relevant phrase being “subject to the SFA Rules”. In the present case the list of matters to which transactions were subject was lengthy and diverse, such that incorporation of them all would have given rise to huge uncertainty and rendered transactions unworkable, as the Judge held in <span style="font-style:italic">Thornbridge</span> and repeated in her judgment in this case. Mr Auld’s criticism of the Judge for ignoring <span style="font-style:italic">Brandeis </span>in analysing clause 7 is unjustified as she analysed both that decision and <span style="font-style:italic">NRAM </span>in her detailed reasoning in <span style="font-style:italic">Thornbridge</span>, reaching the same conclusion as I have set out above.  </heading>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">Second, the phrase “subject to” in clause 7 related to matters which were collectively defined as “applicable rules”, including market practice and the FSA Rules. However, as clause 2 of MLI’s Terms expressly provided that the FSA Rules “shall not be incorporated”, it is clear that at least some of the “applicable rules” were not incorporated, undermining the argument that the intention of the words “subject to” was to effect incorporation. CFH’s argument that clause 2 indicated that everything other than the FSA Rules was incorporated ignored the structure and wording of clause 7 and failed to read the two clauses together.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">Third, I agree with the Judge that clause 7 could not on any basis be read as incorporating general market practice into transactions. The clause could simply have provided that “market practice” was incorporated, but that term was qualified by reference to exchanges, markets, trading venues and/or clearing houses. The inclusion of the word “market” in that list was plainly intended to cover specific markets, such as the EBS platform, and not to include markets, such as the FX market, in the broadest sense.</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">Fourth, it is difficult to see how a market practice overriding the ISDA Master Agreement standard terms could be derived from the Model Code when that Code itself recognised that Master Agreements should be entered into to reflect market practices and to provide for exceptional circumstances. In my judgment, CFH focused on one provision of the Model Code whilst ignoring the more fundamental recognition in the Code that legal certainty, including as to market practices and exceptional circumstances, should be ensured by adopting a Master Agreement. Read as a whole, I do not consider that the Code suggests that the “ethics” referred to in paragraph 68.18 would contractually override a Master Agreement entered as part of the “Legal Aspects” recognised in paragraph 61.10.     </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">Fifth, and again in agreement with the Judge, I consider that the alleged market practice was far too vague and uncertain to be incorporated as a contract term. It is not clear precisely what obligation is said to have arisen with regard to re-pricing (there being no reference in the Model Code to “the authenticated market price” or “the official low”), and when a party must re-price and when it must cancel: the inclusion of those two very different routes would give rise, at best, to an unenforceable agreement to agree. CFH points to its contention that other liquidity providers readily </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">I therefore conclude, for reasons which largely echo those given by the Judge, that CFH’s contention has no real prospects of success.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Auld also argued that the unusual circumstances of this case, the context of which was an important market event, gave rise to a compelling reason why the case should go to trial. It is my understanding that CFH had been refused permission to argue that ground of appeal, but in any event it has no merit. CFH is a sophisticated commercial party which entered automated transactions at the next available price without specifying a limit. It was bound by the terms of those transactions according to the ISDA Master Agreement it had negotiated and agreed with MLI, an agreement which could have made, but did not make, provision for market disruption. I see no reason why CFH should not be held to its bargain.      </p>
