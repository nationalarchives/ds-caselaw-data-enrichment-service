This is a form of trial which has been developed during the current Covid -19 pandemic to enable trials to take place safely. They represent a balance between avoiding delay for the child or children in care on the one hand, whilst on the other ensuring that the parties to the proceedings receive a fair trial by being able to give their evidence in person before the judge. </p>

On Tuesday 13 the time came for the Appellant to give evidence. At this stage, although certain parties and their legal representatives continued to attend remotely, the hybrid hearing provided for the Appellant (and in due course the Intervenor) to be physically present in court together with their legal team and, subject to appropriate social distancing, to give their evidence in person before the judge. </p>

On the Wednesday, crossexamination was not completed as the Appellant had said that she felt unwell with back pain and blurred vision. On Thursday 16 July, the Appellant told the court that she had developed a cough and was, for that reason wearing her mask fully. Whilst the Appellant did not ask to leave court, unsurprisingly, and completely appropriately, the judge with the agreement of counsel sent the Appellant home. As the appellant had given two days of evidence ‘live’ it was agreed that she could conclude her evidence remotely. </p>

The judge directed the Appellant to resume giving her evidence, which she did. The application to appeal came before this court the next day, Tuesday 21 July, when I granted permission to appeal and a stay of the trial pending the appeal hearing which was listed for today, Friday, 24 July. I am grateful to the parties who have, therefore, prepared for this appeal without complaint at very short notice. </p>

It would appear that the judge’s laptop was taken into her room closed but with the call not having been exited. It is to the credit of those that overheard the judge’s conversation with her clerk that they did everything they could both to draw the judge’s attention to the situation and indeed to speak over and distort the conversation. It was a couple of minutes however before the usher’s attention was gained who then immediately left the court and made the judge aware that she could be heard in court. </p>

We have, however, no hesitation in concluding that her comments did indeed fall on the wrong side of the line. The fact that the comments were intended to be private does not salvage the situation in circumstances where those comments were, unhappily, broadcast across the remote system and were made during the course of the Appellant’s evidence. We agree with Ms Grief that unfiltered comments as an expression of frustration at a situation (here, further delay in an already delayed case) are different from negative and pejorative language about a party in the case, all the more so when made while that party is in the witness box at the time..</p>

We emphasise that it is necessary only to go back to the objective test: “would a fair minded and informed observer, having considered the facts, conclude that there is a real possibility that the judge was biased”. The case could not be more serious. The Appellant is accused of either causing the death of her toddler or of failing to protect him from the man who caused his death. The judge made highly critical remarks about the Appellant’s honesty during the course of her evidence, remarks which we believe a person looking in from the outside could not do other than think would colour the judge’s view of that witness and demonstrate a real possibility of bias.   </p>
