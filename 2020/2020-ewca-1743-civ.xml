	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In this stakeholder claim under CPR Part 86, Stephenson Harwood LLP, a firm of solicitors (“SH”), asked the court to determine rival claims to monies held in its client account.  The two rival claims were those of the appellant, Medien <span style="font-size:11pt">Patentverwaltung</span> AG, a Swiss company (“MPV”), and Mr Michael Kagan, the administrator of the estate of the late Mr Irving Kagan, who sadly died in the course of these proceedings.  I will not seek to distinguish in what follows between the late Mr Irving Kagan and Mr Michael Kagan, his administrator, both of whom will be referred to as Mr Kagan.  MPV wishes to challenge the jurisdiction of the court to try the stakeholder claim, but Mr Kagan disputes that it is entitled to do so.  He says that the procedure laid down in CPR Part 11 applies and that MPV is deemed to have submitted to the jurisdiction or, alternatively, have submitted to the jurisdiction in fact.  Deputy Master Bartlett, in a decision dated 6 June 2019, held that the jurisdiction challenge was not open to MPV, and Mr Andrew Lenon QC, sitting as a Deputy High Court Judge, dismissed MPV’s appeal from the Deputy Master’s order for the reasons given in a judgment dated 14 July 2020.  Arnold LJ gave permission for a second appeal to this court, as the case raised, he thought, an important question about the relationship between CPR Parts 86 and 11. </p>

Formally, the party issuing the claim, the stakeholder, is the claimant and the two or more rival “claimants” to the property held by the stakeholder are the defendants.  In this judgment I will refer to SH as the stakeholder and MPV and Mr Kagan as the competing or rival claimants.    </p>

Mr Kagan was a US Attorney practising and residing in New York, and who had a consultancy business called Kagan Consultants.  Mr Kagan had previously worked with MPV and assisted MPV with the patent infringement proceedings.  The patent proceedings in the UK were funded by a litigation funding company which paid SH’s fees, the disbursements and a US$5,000 monthly fee to Kagan Consultants or Mr Kagan personally.  </p>

In November 2018, prior to the receipt of the settlement monies, SH was notified of the existence of a claim by Mr Kagan against MPV.  Mr Kagan asserted that he was entitled to a success fee for services provided in connection with the patent proceedings.  The quantum of the success fee was estimated to be around US$570,000. It was further asserted by Mr Kagan that he had a proprietary claim to this sum when received by SH as part of the settlement monies, preventing it from being released to MPV in Switzerland.  </p>

In this way, the applicant could be released from proceedings.  There is no equivalent to this in CPR 86.3(1)(a).   Rule 5(1) appears to have been the basis of Rix J’s characterisation of interpleader proceedings as an “application to be released from proceedings and not a claim for any substantive right”.  Moreover, the powers expressly given to the court in CPR 86.3 include an express power to give to the stakeholder directions for the retention, sale or disposal of the subject matter of the application, and for the payment of any proceeds of sale, powers which were not expressly given to the court under Order 17, which referred only to “interpleader relief”.  The stakeholder, although taking a back seat during the resolution of any issue between the rival claimants, nevertheless remains a party throughout and will be the subject of the court’s binding direction at the end of the proceedings. It follows that the description of interpleader proceedings as simply an application to be released from proceedings no longer gives the whole picture.   </p>

CPR 86.2(3) provides that the stakeholder application if not made within existing proceedings must be made by Part 8 claim form.  CPR 8 PDA 9.1 provides a table of types of claim for which the Part 8 procedure must be used which includes stakeholder applications under Part 86. The Part 8 procedure includes, under CPR 8.31 and CPR 8 PDA 5.2,  the filing of an acknowledgement of service in Form N210.   That Form is not modified for Part 86 claims, and includes the familiar boxes which ask a defendant whether they intend to defend the claim, or dispute the court’s jurisdiction to hear it, in line with the procedure under Part 11.  There is, in any event, no issue on this appeal that Part 11 does apply to a stakeholder claim.

The wharfinger took out an interpleader summons, an issue was directed to be tried between the rival claimants, one of whom was English and the other a French firm, and the proceedings in the direct action were stayed.  The English rival claimant had an additional money claim against the foreign claimant, and sought to raise it within the interpleader proceedings.  The Master and the judge in chambers both refused to allow this, but the Divisional Court ordered the issue in the interpleader to be set aside, and the parties in the direct proceedings to be amended to substitute the French claimant for the wharfinger, whereupon the claimant in those proceedings was to be permitted to claim for both the copper and the additional debt.

First, in paragraph 6.3 of his witness statement Mr Gwynne refers to a letter to SH of 3 January 2019 from solicitors for Mr Kagan which sought confirmation that the Monies would be set aside and not remitted to MPV on the basis that they were subject to express or constructive trusts in favour of Mr Kagan.  Secondly, in paragraph 6.9, Mr Gwynne explained that on 23 January 2019 SH had received a letter from English solicitors instructed by MPV, threatening injunctive relief against SH unless all the Monies were paid over to MPV.  The same witness statement also confirmed (in accordance with CPR Part 86.2(4)) that SH claimed no interest in the Monies, did not collude with any of the parties and was willing to pay the Monies into court or dispose of them as the Court directed.  </p>

The purpose of bringing the claim is so that the stakeholder may safely decide how to dispose of the property.  The court has the power to give a direction as to how the property is to be disposed of which binds the parties to the proceedings.  If the stakeholder disposes of the property in accordance with the directions of the court, it can do so without incurring liability to one or other of the rival claimants. In the normal case, the court will decide that the stakeholder is not liable to one of the claimants, but liable to the other. </p>

Having failed to issue a Part 11 application within the time specified (or indeed at any time) it is deemed to have accepted the jurisdiction of the court to try the claim. </p>

In that case the issue was whether leave to serve out of the jurisdiction should have been granted in interpleader proceedings under the former Order 17.  Tomlinson J had to consider whether the claim to interpleader relief could properly be characterised as a claim in respect of a contract.  No question arose in that case as to whether the defendants had submitted to the jurisdiction of the court for any purpose.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0.00in">For these reasons, I would dismiss MPV’s first ground of appeal.  It is therefore not necessary to consider the second ground of appeal, which arises only if the first is upheld.  I am entirely satisfied, however, that this ground of appeal should also fail.  First, in the absence of any error of principle, the judge’s conclusion that MPV had, by its conduct, accepted the jurisdiction of the court to try the stakeholder claim was an evaluative conclusion with which this court would not be entitled to interfere.  There was no error of principle in the judge’s approach.  He did not misunderstand the nature of a stakeholder claim, or the issues which arose within it. Secondly, it is just not true to say that MPV had at all material times made clear that it did not accept the jurisdiction of the court to give a direction as to the correct destination of the Monies.  MPV took the earliest opportunity which it could to assert that the English court could make such a direction, by causing its solicitors to write on the acknowledgment of service that it required the court to order payment of the Monies to it together with interest.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0.00in">In the witness statements submitted on its behalf, MPV proceeded to engage with Mr Kagan on the merits of the claim, and repeat their demand for payment out of the Monies to it.  The passages in Mr Lehmann’s witness statement which refer to jurisdiction do not explain why the English court does not have jurisdiction to try the stakeholder claim, as opposed to a putative claim by Mr Kagan against MPV.  Instead they assert (1) that MPV have sufficient assets to pay Mr Kagan’s claim “in the appropriate jurisdiction, which is likely to be a court outside the UK”; (2) that the agreement between MPV and Kagan Consultants was not governed by English law or subject to the jurisdiction of the English courts (paragraph 15); (3) a belief that the English court is not the appropriate forum to determine a term of the alleged fee agreement between MPV and Kagan Consultants “and certainly not as part of a stakeholder application” (paragraph 23); and (4) that the English court was not the proper forum to determine what was agreed at a mediation in Vancouver (paragraph 24).  None of this comes near to an assertion that the English court has no jurisdiction to determine the Part 86 stakeholder claim and give a direction as to whom SH should pay the Monies.  In any event it all comes too late. </p>

This ground would only arise if MPV had succeeded on its other grounds.  Neither the Master nor the judge thought that they should decide this issue. We did not consider that we should decide it either. In consequence we did not hear argument from the Mr Kagan on it, and I need say no more about it.   </p>
