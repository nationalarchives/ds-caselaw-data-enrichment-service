	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">This is a father’s appeal from the refusal of his application for a child arrangements order to be varied to provide for his 9-year-old daughter to live with him.  The existing order provided for the child Lara (not her real name) to share her time equally between her parents’ homes, but that has not reliably happened for some time.  The trial judge, HHJ Meston QC accepted the entirety of the father’s case about the cause of the difficulties in this family.  He found that a process of alienation of Lara from her father had begun in the context of the mother’s adherence to Universal Medicine, an organisation founded in Australia in 1999 by Serge Benhayon and held by the judge to be a cult.  Nonetheless, the judge left the previous order in place.  The father now appeals on the basis that the decision does not address the growing harm the child is suffering.  For her part, the mother does not accept the judge’s findings concerning Universal Medicine and seeks a reduction in the time that Lara spends with her father.  During the hearing she applied for permission to cross-appeal.  </p>

Clearly the court should not become unnecessarily involved in criticisms of minority groups with unusual or even controversial beliefs or practices, or (as in this case) with unfamiliar or bizarre concepts and terminology, whether or not those have sufficient components to be considered a religious movement. The court should be concerned only with the welfare of the child, and, in particular, only with any harm or potential harm indicated by the evidence. Not only is it necessary to identify any detriment because of the involvement of the family with the relevant group, but it may also be necessary to consider any positive strengths and benefits suggested by involvement with the group. ” </p>

I mention the point only for completeness; it plainly does not arise in this case, because the parents' beliefs are in each case clearly worthy of respect. Secondly, whilst religious belief and thought are (subject to that overriding qualification) given absolute protection by Article 9(1), the "manifestation" of one's religion in "worship, teaching, practice and observance" is subject to the qualifications referred to in Article 9(2). </p>

Children have their own feelings and needs and where their parents are polarised they are bound to feel the effects.  Situations of this kind, where the concerned parent is being no more than properly supportive, must obviously be distinguished from those where an emotionally abusive process is taking place.  For that reason, the value of early fact-finding has repeatedly been emphasised. </p>

The court’s first inclination will be to reason with parents and seek to persuade them to take the right course for their child’s sake, and it will only make orders when it is better than not to do so.  Once orders are required, the court’s powers include those provided by sections 11A to 11O of the Children Act 1989, and extend to consideration of a more fundamental revision of the arrangements for the child.  We agree that whilst a change in the child’s main home is a highly significant  alteration in that child’s circumstances, such a change is not regarded as “a last resort”: <span style="font-style:italic">Re L (A Child)</span> [2019] EWHC 867 (Fam) at [53] to [59] per Sir Andrew McFarlane P.

The situation calls for judicial resolve because the line of least resistance is likely to be less stressful for the child and for the court in the short term.  But it does not represent a solution to the problem.  Inaction will probably reinforce the position of the stronger party at the expense of the weaker party and the bar will be raised for the next attempt at intervention.  Above all, the obligation on the court is to keep the child’s medium to long term welfare at the forefront of its mind and wherever possible to uphold the child and parent’s right to respect for family life before it is breached.  In making its overall welfare decision the court must therefore be alert to early signs of alienation.  What will amount to effective action will be a matter of judgement, but it is emphatically not necessary to wait for serious, worse still irreparable, harm to be done before appropriate action is taken.  It is easier to conclude that decisive action was needed after it has become too late to take it.   </p>

Another concept is “The Heart Chakra”. The document referring to that is not easy to understand but it appears to be the basis of the requirement to move in an anti-clockwise direction: “The emotions cannot stay in the heart because the rotational spin of this centre is anticlockwise, therefore by its occult nature cannot hold anything in it that is not in its divine frequency… The heart centre is spinning in an anti-clockwise rotation therefore clearing and remaining clear all of the time.”” </p>

It need not be permanent and she may not want it, but it was in her best interests.  The main concern remained the mother’s escalating beliefs in Universal Medicine that were influencing Lara daily in a way that alienated him from her.  She constantly rang and asked to speak to Lara in secret (the father described Lara going into a cupboard to do so).  For her part, the mother was dismayed by the return of court proceedings.  She raised no safeguarding concerns herself, saying that the problem was about different parental views.  She had wholly abided by the prohibited steps order and she followed her Universal Medicine beliefs when Lara was asleep or absent.  Lara was eating healthily.   </p>

She considered Universal Medicine to be a cult and the mother’s involvement to be harmful to Lara in terms of restricted diet, behaviour and beliefs.  The mother underestimated her influence over Lara.  If she remained in Universal Medicine or associated with it on any level she would influence Lara.  She had previously said that she would disassociate from Universal Medicine but she had not done so despite previous proceedings that had continually raised concerns about it.  Given the mother’s heavy involvement over 8 years and her continued support for its teachings and leader, Ms Ware doubted that she could extricate herself without significant therapeutic support and a true commitment to do so.   </p>

She is at risk of becoming alienated from him as a result.  She would find it difficult if the current arrangements were changed so that she lived with her father because she is so close to her mother, with whom she is in an alliance, but unless the mother was able to relinquish her interest in and commitment to Universal Medicine, Lara will continue to be at risk of harm.

On 10 October, within a week of Ms Ware’s report, Ms O’Connor filed an application, seeking to strike out the father’s application altogether.  The basis for this application was that acceding to Ms Ware’s recommendation would breach the mother’s Article 8, 9 and 10 rights and that, even if the mother had any involvement with Universal Medicine, that would not disclose any legally recognised reason for varying the 2017 order. </p>

However, Ms O’Connor’s opening written submissions for the hearing stated that the mother considered that the shared care arrangement had proven to be unworkable and that Lara was very unhappy.  Her relationship with the father was strained.  The shared care arrangement should be changed so that she spent time with the father on long weekends and for half the school holidays.  The father was using Lara to control her.  How she chose to live her life was a private matter.  The Australian case had nothing to do with her.

But the mother “will of course do what is required to keep her daughter living with her”.  This position was confirmed by counsel at the start of the hearing, but in her evidence the mother said that she would prefer to maintain the current arrangements.  However, in closing submissions counsel again said that her client sought a reduction in Lara’s time with her father, but only for six months until matters had settled down.

In her view, shared care was the best arrangement for Lara but the mother needed to accept help and support to extricate herself from Universal Medicine.  The influence on Lara was not just in terms of diet and rituals, but was shown by her feeling that her father was different because he did not follow their beliefs.  That was starting to alienate her from the father.  In Lara’s mind there was no middle ground: her mother’s way is the right way and her mother’s beliefs are the right beliefs.

The father was a coercive and controlling person, and Parliament has legislated for “these cunning abusers”.  He has stalked the mother online.  The damage to his relationship with Lara is due to his conduct.  “Why despite concerns about father sharing a bed with Lara does he continue to do so?  Is it because he wants her close so that he can question her when she is most relaxed or for other reasons?”  It is “not healthy”.  Ms Ware’s recommendation should not be followed.  The mother will give whatever undertaking is required but nothing can “deprogramme” her or Lara.  The risk from moving Lara is far greater than any present risk.  “This is an unhappy child in the father’s home.”  As described above, the closing submission was that the father’s time with Lara should be reduced for a period of six months. </p>

The mother said that she would not find it easy to walk away from Universal Medicine but would do it if thought necessary because she would not jeopardise her relationship with her daughter.  Specifically, in cross-examination on behalf of the father, the mother said that she would renounce Universal Medicine and that she would speak to a therapist, and also consult a dietitian in respect of Lara. Of particular significance she said that she would accept that the Supreme Court in New South Wales had made serious findings about Serge Benhayon.

I would expect the mother now to read and understand the findings made by the Australian court.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Ms O’Connor submitted to us that there was not enough evidence to sustain the judge’s findings about Universal Medicine being dangerous.  The Australian decision was the decision of a regional court of equivalent standing to the county court in England and Wales.  Ms Ware is not an expert in cults, and her investigation of Lara’s situation was insufficient.  The judge should have confined himself to assessing the mother’s compliance with the 2017 order, and not looked more widely.  Asked about the persistent references to bed-sharing in the paperwork, she described it as a low-key issue in the proceedings, but one with which the mother is struggling.  However, there is no reference to such a concern in the mother’s extensive written or oral evidence, except for a brief chronological mention of the May 2018 GP referral.  Asked by King LJ to justify what appeared to be a veiled allegation of sexual abuse in her written submissions, Ms O’Connor accepted that there was no evidence (or as she put it, not enough evidence) but said that it was not for her to justify why bed-sharing was going on.  Was something more sinister taking place?  As to the undertakings, the judge should have outlined precisely what he required.  The father's requests go far beyond what reasonably arises from the judgment.  The mother does not accept that she needs therapy and she takes issue with the father demanding it.  She is nevertheless willing to go to therapy and make any promises necessary to prevent Lara’s removal.  The drastic reduction in contact has been with the father’s agreement or, more accurately, his acquiescence. <span style="font-style:italic"> </span>There is no precedent for a change of residence in circumstances less extreme than those seen in the reported cases.  The judge’s assessment of the risks of a move was correct.<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>The mother sought an order remitting the case, appointing a Children’s Guardian for Lara, and reducing the father’s contact to alternate weekends while investigations take place.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The third assertion is that the judge allowed consideration of Universal Medicine to overshadow concerning evidence about father's conduct.  Apart from coercive and controlling behaviour in relation to Universal Medicine, the focus here is upon Lara’s sore vagina and ‘bed-sharing’.  The father’s account has been of normal parental proximity with a child of Lara’s age.  The mother has at various times since 2015 raised the issue with the intention of conveying some sexual risk to Lara from her father, but there has never been any evidence to support the suggestion.  Nor was the allegation stated during the course of the proceedings.  Despite that, during the hearing below and during this appeal, the mother has continued to trail her coat on this point, with clear insinuations in counsel’s submissions that something improper may have been going on.  We agree that this submission is an unjustified slur that should never have appeared in professionally drafted documents.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Fourth, the scope of the undertakings proposed by the father were in our view a broad reflection of what the judgment required if the current arrangements were to continue.  Had there been any meaningful counter-proposal from the mother, a process of discussion and refinement might surely have followed.  As it is, the complaint that the father’s stance amounted to a further example of controlling behaviour is a hollow one.  The mother’s rights to protection from coercion and to freedom of belief do not confer upon her the right to harm others.</p>

The judge approached this issue carefully and correctly.  He had credible information from Dr Millikan, a expert in cults, and specific expert social work evidence about the effects on Lara from Cafcass officers in 2017 and 2019 and from the independent social worker.  His conclusion on that issue cannot be faulted.</p>

The judge rightly considered that this state of affairs could not be allowed to continue.  However, such slight measures as he then took to mitigate the harm were in our view highly unlikely to be effective.  His assessment at paragraph 115 of the mother as sincere and genuine could not be sufficient without some solid reason for believing that, as he put it, she was likely to modify, if not wholly change, her thinking about Universal Medicine and Serge Benhayon.  It is difficult to know what led the judge to believe that this was at all likely.  The mother had been a convinced adherent for almost all of Lara’s life and the father had been raising formal concerns since the child was aged three.  The clear evidence of Ms Ware, which the judge accepted, was that, given the mother’s heavy involvement over 8 years and her continued support for its teachings and leader, it was unlikely that she could extricate herself without significant therapeutic support and a true commitment to do so.  Neither of these conditions was met when the judgment was written and there was in our view no reasonable basis on which the judge could have expected them to be met in the foreseeable future. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Moreover, the judge found that the decision of the Australian court was one that no reasonable parent in the mother’s position could disregard, but that is exactly what the mother had done throughout the year of the proceedings, to the extent that it was not apparent that she had actually read the Australian decision, still less had she taken any interest in the material that led to it.  In addition, events following the judge’s own judgment were bound to dissolve any hope that the court might have entertained that she was now going to approach matters differently.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">We have set out above and at unusual length the evolution of the mother’s case.  It shows that, far from accepting the judgment and showing signs of changing course, the mother’s unmistakeable position was that she did not accept the judge’s findings about Universal Medicine, and that she had no respect for the experienced opinion of Ms Ware.  Nor has she any time for the fears of the father, with whom she shares parental responsibility: her response has been to attack him for taking action to protect their daughter, something that any responsible parent would want to do, though not all parents would have the determination to see it through.  From beginning to end there has been no sign that the mother actually <span style="font-style:italic">wants</span> to distance herself and Lara from Universal Medicine.  Even if she did want that, it would be a considerable achievement to free herself from the beliefs that have underpinned her thinking for so long.  In these circumstances, her repeated, unsupported assurances that she would do anything that is required of her to keep the care of Lara can carry very little weight.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Finally on this aspect of the matter, the dismissal of the father’s application at a point where the mother was yet to give any undertakings at all represented a clear failure to get to grips with the rooted problem that the judge had identified.  In relation to the nature of undertakings, the parties find themselves in some form of agreement.  The mother argues that the judge was wrong to ask her for undertakings and then to refuse to accept them.  The father agrees that the judge should have ensured that the mother’s undertakings were voluntary.  The inability of the court to identify undertakings that were both voluntary and sufficient should have alerted the judge to the intractable nature of the problem.  In the situation that then existed, the harm arising from Universal Medicine (both from its teachings and its divisive effect) was set to continue. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The second way in which we consider the judge to have been in error concerns his response to his findings of alienation.  Having found that a process of alienation had started to occur, he did not in our judgement take effective steps to counter it.  By the time of the order of 15 January, the relationship between Lara and her father was in considerable difficulties.  The court’s response was to re-instruct Ms Ware to advise the parents.  However, even if advice from any quarter was likely to be effective, the mother showed no sign of being amenable to receiving it from Ms Ware.  The orders made following the dismissal of the father’s application were not made in any recognisable proceedings and disclose no identifiable strategy for addressing the damage that was being caused to Lara’s relationship with her father.  There was no incentive for the mother to change her approach of laying all problems at the father’s door, with time passing all the while. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">We also consider that the judge would have done well to have addressed the insinuation of sexual impropriety that was a feature of the mother’s presentation.  She had been bringing the matter up on and off since May 2015.  It is particularly striking that she should promote suspicions about the father, despite the lack of any evidence, when she is at the same time impervious to proven allegations against Benhayon.  This state of affairs was capable of providing support for the father’s case in relation to alienation, but it did not receive any attention in the judge’s overall evaluation. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The third respect in which we consider the judge erred is in relation to the nature of the different sorts of harm that he was balancing.  He correctly reminded himself that he was concerned with Lara’s medium to long term welfare, but we do not consider that he brought that objective sufficiently into account when reaching his conclusion.  There is a contrast between on the one hand the long-term nature of the harm arising from Universal Medicine and from parental alienation, and on the other hand the short or short-to-medium term harm that would be caused to Lara by a change in her living arrangements.  The order sought by the father was indeed a significant change in Lara’s circumstances and implementing it against her wishes would undoubtedly be very steep challenge in the short term.  But the court’s powers are ample to achieve and enforce such an order if that is necessary in the child’s interests.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">We do not find a balancing-up of these factors in the judgment.  At paragraph 119 the judge simply states a firmly-reached conclusion.  We infer that he found that the harm arising from a move to the father’s care would outweigh all other forms of harm.  In our view, that minimised the continuing and untreated harm to Lara from Universal Medicine and from the developing parental alienation while at the same time it gave inordinate weight to the disadvantages of change designed to address the deep-seated problems within the family.   </p>

It is not evident that the case has to be remitted.  We have most if not all of the information to enable us to remake the decision.  The judge’s primary findings are available to us, supplemented by a body of up-to-date evidence.  The proceedings have already been on foot for over a year.  The conditions for the appointment of a Children’s Guardian (PD16A 7.2(c)) may well be met but the court has already had the benefit of the advice of Ms Ware, an experienced Children’s Guardian.  </p>

The first is that, while she would ideally want her parents to be together, the best realistic solution would be for them to share her care peacefully and co-operatively.  The next established matter is that everyone agrees that the shared care arrangement is not currently working well.  Both parents are unhappy with it and Lara has become increasingly distressed. </p>

She loves both her parents and wants them to get on.  Asked, she opposes having more time with her father and she deals with her situation by gravitating towards having less.  However, she has no way of understanding that a very significant contributor to this process, if it is not indeed its cause, is the mother’s adherence to </p>

	    <p style="text-align:right;margin-left:0.00in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">Universal Medicine.  It is a pervasive source of ongoing harm to Lara, emotionally and psychologically, and may make her vulnerable to eating disorders.  We consider that unless decisive counter-measures are taken the influence of the belief system and the distancing of Lara from her father are likely to become entrenched as she grows older.  We do not overlook the fact that she has two loving parents who are capable of meeting all her needs but for (and it is a big but) the dynamic that has increasingly characterised the mother’s approach.  She now approaches the arrangements for Lara on the basis that she knows best and that the father is someone from whom Lara is to be protected.  She views Universal Medicine as a vital and benign entity.  She has not begun to understand the substance of the judge’s findings and the concerns expressed by others.  That is how cults work.   </p>

If the mother continues to ally herself with Universal Medicine there are only two possibilities.  Either, on the mother’s case, Lara’s time with her father would have to be reduced in an attempt to reduce her anxieties.  Or, on her father’s case, her time with her mother must be reduced in an attempt to remove her from the source of anxiety and build up her resilience.  One approach addresses the symptoms, the other the cause.     </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It will be apparent from our analysis so far that we find that Lara must be distanced entirely from Universal Medicine.  Shared care can therefore only continue if the mother makes an immediate and definitive break with the organisation.  Otherwise Lara should move to live with her father.  A period with him would give her a sustained opportunity to experience a less anxious and prescriptive way of living.  There is a strong argument for saying that the time for such a move has now arrived, that this court should make the necessary orders, and that nothing short of the shock of actually losing Lara’s care is likely to impel the mother into doing what is necessary.  The alternative is to remit for a further hearing, giving her a final opportunity to dissociate herself in a determined way from Universal Medicine and seek the help she needs to do so. That brings more delay against a deteriorating background, and in the meantime, if the mother does not change her self-defeating stance, matters may get worse.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">We find the arguments finely balanced.  In the end, and not without hesitation, we have concluded that the risks involved in postponing a final decision are just worth taking.  The current circumstances, adding to the difficulty of an immediate transfer of care, have also been significantly in our minds.   With the agreement of the President of the Family Division, we shall remit the father’s application for early final determination by him.  By determining the matter in this way we are giving the mother a very short respite during which she will have one last chance to take her own steps to leave Universal Medicine, start intensive therapy, and reverse the process of alienation of Lara from her father.  In doing this, we are taking a different course to that taken by the judge, as we now explain.  Normally, when remitting a case we would emphasise that this court holds no preconceptions about the outcome.  Not so here.  In the first place, while the welfare decision will ultimately be for the judge, we remit on the limited basis that the factual foundations for future decisions are contained in the judgment of HHJ Meston QC and of this court, and that the only further evidence that will be needed is in relation to subsequent events.  Similarly, the evaluations of the harm being caused to Lara by Universal Medicine and by alienation from her father are left undisturbed by this appeal.  Above all, and so that the parties are left in no doubt, we warn that we foresee that without a wholesale transformation in the mother’s position the court at the further hearing is likely to find it necessary to transfer Lara’s care to her father.

If that can happen, Lara can return to a balanced arrangement that gives her the best of both parents, something that she is not getting and will not get as matters stand.  If it cannot happen, her loss will be very great, but she will gain from growing up in the care of a good parent while attending the same school, and her childhood will not continue to be overshadowed by the baleful influences that have led to the present situation.   </p>
