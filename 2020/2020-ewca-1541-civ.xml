It borrowed money from the Respondents (“Moneything”) secured by a legal charge over the property. Joanne fell into arrears under the charge; and on 3 December 2018 Moneything appointed LPA receivers. Joanne challenged that appointment on the ground that both the loan agreement and the charge had been procured by undue influence. On 20 December 2018 Joanne issued a claim against Moneything seeking to set aside both the loan agreement and the charge. It also claimed an injunction against the receivers preventing them from taking any further steps to realise the security. </p>

It was not headed “subject to contract”. Although it is (now) common ground that that offer was not compliant with CPR Part 36, it was interpreted at the time by both Mr Irvine and Mr Goldberg as though it was. It was clearly intended to be capable of acceptance. But it was not accepted; and Mr Goldberg’s subsequent proposal of 21 June was again headed “without prejudice and subject to contract”. His improved offer of 26 June was headed in the same way. Mr Irvine and Mr Goldberg spoke on 11 July. In that conversation Mr Goldberg proposed that £72,000 of the ring-fenced sum would be released to Moneything. Mr Irvine’s attendance note recorded: </p>

The email was headed “without prejudice and subject to contract.” He said that his clients would accept £75,000 from the ring-fenced sum; “mechanics and terms to be agreed.” Since Mr Irvine had proposed the release of £75,000 rather than £72,000, that was clearly a counter-offer rather than an acceptance of Mr Goldberg’s proposal. Mr Goldberg replied later in the day. The subject line of the e-mail also read “without prejudice and subject to contract”. The first word of the e-mail was “Agreed.” He said that counsel was away and that he would liaise with counsel and “put a proposal to you to achieve the desired end.” </p>

The letter said that unless the draft consent order was agreed by 20 August, Moneything would apply to the court for an order in those terms. The application was duly issued and served on 30 September 2019. That prompted the reply from Mr Smith that there had been no binding settlement because the negotiations had been conducted “subject to contract”. </p>

He does it in the confidence that it protects his client. It means that the client is not bound by what has taken place in conversation. The reason is that, for over a hundred years, the courts have held that the effect of the words "subject to contract" is that the matter remains in negotiation until a formal contract is executed.” </p>

That, in my judgment, is not the position. It is always the case that in “subject to contract” negotiations one side or both from time to time speak as though there was a contract or would be a contract, and that is because everybody looks on the bright side and thinks a sale is going to take place. The fact of the matter is that for very good reasons the “subject to contract” formula enables one to see at once whether there is or is not a contract—either a contract exchanged or conveyance executed and delivered—or whether parties are in the negotiation stage. Once one gets away from principle, then all is difficulty, and reliance on odd conversations and letters produces uncertainty in law.” </p>

Mr Irvine’s letter of 24 July 2019 was similarly headed; and also plainly contemplated that a consent order would be needed in order to embody the compromise, just as the earlier settlement agreement had been embodied in a formal signed contact. In the context of negotiations to settle litigation which are expressly made “subject to contract,” the consent order is the equivalent of the formal contract.

In the ordinary law of contract, an offer which is rejected (either expressly or by the making of a counter-offer) cannot subsequently be accepted. That is not true of a Part 36 offer, which may be accepted even after the offeree has put forward a different proposal: <span style="font-style:italic">Gibbon v Manchester City Council</span> [2010] EWCA Civ 726, [2010] 1 WLR 2081. That is why it is an ordinary occurrence in litigation that without prejudice negotiations often take place in parallel with the making of a Part 36 offer. The Part 36 offer is, in effect, a free-standing offer.  It is not a legitimate inference that the making of such an offer recalibrates attempts to compromise a dispute which are taking place in parallel. I do not overlook the fact that the offer in this case was not in fact a compliant Part 36 offer. But since both Mr Irvine and Mr Goldberg appeared to have treated it as though it had been, it has the same effect on the character of these particular negotiations as a compliant Part 36 offer would have had. </p>

If the “subject to contract umbrella” had been lowered, those two communications raised it again. As Mr MacDonald acknowledged, his submission entailed the proposition that we should simply ignore that heading in both communications. I do not consider that that is possible, applying an objective approach to the communications; especially where that label had been used at various stages throughout the discussions. Both Mr Irvine and Mr Goldberg, as experienced solicitors, must be taken to know what the label means. </p>
