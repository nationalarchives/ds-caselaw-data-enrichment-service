	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In this appeal the court is required to consider the jurisdiction of the Family Court in respect of two issues related to Forced Marriage Protection Orders [‘FMPO’] made under Family Law Act 1996, s 63A. The first relates to the court’s jurisdiction where the subject of the order is an adult who does not lack mental capacity. The second relates to Passport Orders as part of a FMPO, and, in particular, whether there is jurisdiction to make an open-ended or indefinite Passport Order in that context.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The factual background to the application can be stated shortly.  The Applicant, “K”, is a single woman now aged 35.  K does not lack mental capacity to make decisions with respect to marriage, and, in particular, whether she should be the subject of a Forced Marriage Protection Order.  At the time of the original application in 2015, K lived in the family home together with her mother and various relatives.  On 29 May 2015 and 3 June 2015, K contacted her local police force, West Midlands Police, alleging that her family were seeking to force her to marry against her will and that they had threatened to murder her if she refused to do so.  These allegations were congruent with numerous calls made by a neighbour or neighbours to the police over the preceding ten months expressing concern for K. </p>

The Fourth Respondent was arrested, held in custody, but subsequently the prosecution against him for breach of the FMPO was discontinued when K withdrew her allegation.  Around that time K was, however, removed to safe accommodation in a refuge.  In May 2016 K was rehoused by the local authority and she has continued to live separately from her family. </p>

The judge had accepted expert evidence that if K was seen to be in a position to protect herself during any visit to Pakistan, then the risk of forced marriage during foreign travel might, to some extent, be reduced. </p>

It is plain, however, that this was a complex and difficult case in which, in addition to the involved legal issues which are now before this court, HHJ Tucker had the further significant burden of managing proceedings with all of the key family members in the courtroom, tensions running high and, in particular, where the Fourth Respondent persistently displayed challenging behaviour of a high order.  Although, at the end of this judgment, I will hold that the appeal should be allowed, that conclusion is made simply to alter one narrow, but plainly important, aspect of the judge’s order.  It is not my intention to criticise the judge in any way.  On the contrary, it is the clear view of each member of this court that HHJ Tucker is to be commended for the manner in which she dealt with this most difficult case and we pay tribute to her. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Evidence filed on behalf of the Secretary of State demonstrates that forced marriage is not a problem confined to children or adults who lack capacity.  Statistics from the Forced Marriage Unit [“FMU”] covering 2018 demonstrate that in over 40% of the cases in which the FMU gave advice or support, the person concerned was aged between 18 and 30.  Family Court statistics for 2018 demonstrate that during that year 322 applications for a FMPO were made and 324 orders were granted.  Of these, 72% of the persons protected were 17 years or under.  In 2018, the FMU gave advice or support related to a possible forced marriage in 1764 cases, which was a significant increase on the average in previous years which was between 1200 and 1400 cases per year.  The statistics demonstrate that one in five victims is male.  The reasons for such an increase may be complicated and hard to define, but the statistics show, as the Secretary of State submitted, that, at the very least, forced marriage remains a pressing social problem. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The abusive nature of a forced marriage does not begin and end on the day of the marriage ceremony.  Rather, the marriage forms the start of a potentially unending period in the victim’s life where much of her daily experience will occur without their consent and against their will, or will otherwise be abusive.  In particular, the consummation of the marriage, rather than being the positive experience, will be, by definition, a rape.  Life for an unwilling participant in a forced marriage is likely to be characterised by serial rape, deprivation of liberty and physical abuse experienced over an extended period.  It may also lead to forced pregnancy and childbearing.  The fate of some victims of forced marriage is even worse and may include murder,  other “honour” crime or suicide. </p>

The issue in such cases is not <span style="font-style:italic">whether</span> there should be State intervention, but rather <span style="font-style:italic">what</span> that intervention should be, taking into account human rights considerations (in particular Article 3) and the victim’s standpoint and views.  Where the court’s obligation to protect a victim does not conform - as in the instant case - with the victim’s expressed wishes – the court must be particularly careful as to how it evaluates the evidence and reaches a conclusion as to what, if any, protective orders should be put in place. …Ultimately though, the court’s primary focus is likely to be to prevent a victim being left unprotected and exposed to the risk of further harm, and a breach of their Article 3 rights.” (original emphasis) </p>

In lay terms, the court, therefore, has jurisdiction, in a particular case, to protect a person from themselves.  That this is so is a clear consequence both of the structure and content of the statutory provision, but also of the operation of the relevant articles of the ECHR where, again as demonstrated by the SBS submissions, in some cases the need to protect an individual under Article 3 may be in conflict with that individual’s Article 8 rights to private and family life. </p>

In this context, I have deliberately chosen the word “accommodation” to reflect the court’s approach. The required judicial analysis is not a true ‘balancing’ exercise in consequence of the imperative duty that arises from the absolute nature of Article 3 rights. Where the evidence establishes a reasonable possibility that conduct sufficient to breach Article 3 may occur, the court must at least do what is necessary to protect any potential victim from such a risk. The need to do so cannot be reduced below that necessary minimum even where the factors relating to the qualified rights protected by Article 8 are particularly weighty. Hence the need to find a word other than ‘balance’ to describe this process of analysis. </p>

On one view, “proportionality” may seem to be an inappropriate concept when the court is considering an absolute Convention right such as Article 3.  However, in cases where there has not yet been a forced marriage, the court will not be dealing with the certainty that future harm will take place but, rather, the assessment of the risk that it may do so.  Where protective measures will necessarily limit the freedom of the protected person and others to enjoy other Convention rights, it will be necessary to evaluate, with a degree of precision, the extent of protection that is necessary in each individual case.  In this regard, the exercise to be conducted in a FMPO application is broadly similar to that undertaken where the risk of future harm arises from the potential for Female Genital Mutilation (“FGM”).

I would also agree that, when deciding how to exercise its powers, the court must balance a number of factors. The court will have to consider the degree of the risk of FGM (which, I would suggest, needs to be at least a real risk); the quality of available protective factors (which could include a broad range of matters including the court's assessment of the parents); and the nature and extent of the interference with family life which any proposed order would cause.  </p>

The court should first consider whether a finite order adequately meets the risk, with the consequence (if it does) that the applicant for the order will have to seek a further order at the end of the term if further protection is then needed.

However, before leaving the case, the President made a number of preliminary observations “without expressing any definitive view”.  Within those observations the President considered that a passport order that continued after the conclusion of proceedings would only be likely to be justified “in an unusual and probably quite extreme case” and, secondly, “if such an order can properly be made and is made, it should usually be for a defined rather than…an indefinite period of time” (referring to <span style="font-style:italic">Re L (A Child) </span>[2016] EWCA Civ 173). </p>

Indeed, it may be a protective act for the court to make explicit, as to do otherwise might render the person more vulnerable to pressure from the family if it was thought that that person retained the ability, subject to a passport, voluntarily to leave the country.  However, making an express injunction against the person to be protected opens up, as a matter of law, the prospect of proceedings against that person were it subsequently to be said that they had breached the court order.  It is, therefore, a step that a court should only take after a very careful analysis of the risks and the degree to which protection is necessary. </p>

In all other cases, the court should impose a time limit when making such orders.  The time limit will vary from case-tocase and, like all other elements, be a bespoke provision imposing a restriction only in so far as that is justified on the facts as found.  Unless the court can see with clarity that there will be no need for any continuing order after a particular date, for example when it is clear that the circumstances will change so that the risk is removed, the appropriate course will be for the court to list the matter for further review a short time before the passport and/or travel ban will otherwise expire. </p>

The judge found that K had been told that she would marry an individual known to the family and who was a brother of a young woman whom the Fourth Respondent wished to marry.  The man in question had stated that he would only agree to that marriage if he could marry K.  K had stated that she did not wish to marry him.  The judge held that in the lead-up to the 2016 hearing K had reported serious threats of violence being made against her, including a threat that she would be burnt alive and that she would be cut up with a machete.  The judge accepted the police appraisal that K feared for her own safety.  At paragraph 32 the judge recorded:  </p>

That guidance was not available to HHJ Tucker in 2016 and 2018.  I am, however, clear that the record of the judge’s findings (Stage One) over the course of the two judgments taken as a whole are more than sufficient to establish that this case justified consideration within FLA 1996, Part 4A and that the level of risk was sufficient to engage ECHR Art 3 (Stages Two and Three).

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The only point upon which I differ from the approach taken by the judge is in relation to the indefinite or open-ended nature of the Passport Order.  Family life is dynamic.  In time, the acute focus upon the need for the family to achieve a marriage between this individual in Pakistan and K may diminish or even evaporate.  A travel ban and a Passport Order are highly intrusive in terms of their impact upon the private life and freedom of movement of the individual concerned.  The facts of this case were not so extreme as to justify an indefinite prohibition on travel out of the jurisdiction.  The appropriate course was, therefore, to fix a future date for review.  On the facts of this case, given the lack of change in circumstances during the nearly three year period between the two court hearings, the review period might reasonably have been pitched at four years.  If My Lords agree, I would therefore allow the appeal to the very limited, but important, extent of providing for a review hearing, if possible before HHJ Tucker, in December 2022.  For case management, the issue of review should be listed for a directions hearing in September 2022. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Before leaving this case I would offer one further word on case management.  As I have already indicated, these proceedings would have presented a particularly difficult challenge to any judge.  HHJ Tucker is to be praised for the manner in which she met those challenges and discharged her role.  With hindsight, however, the decision to give an oral judgment to the full courtroom required the judge to temper what she said in that judgment to such an extent that she held back from stating any of the factual findings upon which she relied in making the order.  In addition, she deliberately did not mention her finding as to the risk of serious honour violence and the necessary conclusion that this case met the ECHR, Art 3 threshold.  It follows that neither the family, nor any reader of the 2016 judgment, would have understood what findings the judge had in fact made and how she had conducted the analysis leading to the conclusion that a FMPO in these terms was justified. </p>
