	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">This appeal concerns the decisions of the respondent (to whom I will refer as the Secretary of State) (i) on 19 February 2019 to deprive the appellant (to whom I will refer as “Ms Begum”) of her British citizenship in respect of which Ms Begum issued an appeal pursuant to section 40A of the British Nationality Act 1981 (“the BNA”) and section 2B of the Special Immigration Appeals Commission Act 1997 (“the 1997 Act”) and (ii) on 13 June 2019 to refuse her application for leave to enter (“LTE”) the United Kingdom to pursue her appeal before the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (“SIAC”) against that deprivation of citizenship. The latter decision was challenged by Ms Begum in two ways: (a) by an appeal against that refusal in so far as the decision determined a “human rights claim” which appeal was to SIAC under section 2 of the 1997 Act because the Secretary of State had certified that the decision was taken in reliance on information which he considered should not be made public in the interests of national security; and (b) by judicial review proceedings in the Administrative Court challenging the decision on common law grounds.   </p>

SCU’s legal position is that the ECHR does not have extra-territorial effect in relation to this case. Notwithstanding that legal position, it has been the publicly stated practice of the Home Office to consider the Article 2 and 3 risks associated with deprivation action and only recommend deprivation action if SCU considers that such action would not give rise to a real risk of a breach of Articles 2 or 3 of the ECHR were those articles to be engaged. This practice was confirmed publicly in an ECHR memorandum during the passage of the Immigration Act 2014, which stated that as a matter of practice the (then) Home Secretary would not deprive anyone of citizenship where she was satisfied that such action would constitute a breach of Articles 2 or 3 had they been within the jurisdiction and those articles therefore engaged.

The Annex then expands on the assessment including assessing that she made a conscious effort to conceal her travel from the authorities by using her sister’s passport, which suggested she had taken steps to plan her travel to Syria. The Annex then refers to some of what she said in her interview with The Times. It notes that she said that following her arrival in Raqqah she applied to marry an Englishspeaking fighter between 20 and 25 years old and shortly after married Yago Riedijk, a Dutch national. It refers to what she said about seeing a severed head in a bin for the first time: “it didn’t faze me at all. It was from a captured fighter seized on the battlefield, an enemy of Islam”.  </p>

[10] of that Annex states that the Government is aware of some ISIL-linked individuals who had been returned to their country of origin, and that some of those detained by non-state actors could be transferred to Iraq. However, the Government’s view was that it was not possible to speculate as to whether someone detained by a non-state actor might be removed to his/her country of nationality, to another country to which he/she had elected to travel or been released. Any removal would depend on the relationship between the detaining group and the third country to which it wanted to remove the individual. The assessment was that arrangements to return a British person to the UK “would most probably be exceptional and unlikely to arise in the foreseeable future”. This was because solutions were first required to complex problems such as the status of non-state actors, non-British nationals having no right of abode in the UK and the practicalities of any transfer. [12] of Annex D points out that it is difficult to speculate about the many possible combinations of facts which might arise as a result of people's choices to travel or to stay put.

The ground for the decision was that: “The Security Service (MI5) assesses that [A] travelled to Syria and aligned with ISIL … The Security Service considers that an individual assessed to have travelled to Syria and to have aligned with ISIL poses a threat to national security”.<span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif"> </span> A deprivation order was made the same day. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Having set out the outline facts, the judgment of SIAC deals, at some length, with the first preliminary issue, whether the deprivation decision rendered Ms Begum stateless. As already noted, it is not necessary to consider that issue further. Having concluded that the deprivation decision did not render her stateless, SIAC turned to the second preliminary issue, which is whether the deprivation decision breached the Secretary of State’s practice or policy (as referred to in the submission as quoted at [12] and [14] above). At [129] SIAC noted that the policy had been interpreted in its decision in <span style="font-style:italic">X2 v Secretary of State for the Home Department</span> SC/132/2016 where SIAC held that the effect of the policy was that the Secretary of State is only obliged to consider risks which are foreseeable and which are a direct consequence of the deprivation decision.  </p>

He submitted to SIAC that Ms Begum’s was a stronger case because, when the deprivation decision was made, she was at risk of removal to Iraq and Bangladesh.

We also consider that, on the material in Annex C and Annex D, the Secretary of State was not required to speculate about the future: for example, the possibility that [Ms Begum] might be removed from Syria to Bangladesh or to Iraq.

However, that subsection had been repealed from which it followed that: “Parliament intends that the Secretary of State should be free to make a deprivation order immediately after giving notice of her intention to deprive the person concerned of her citizenship, whether or not the person concerned wishes to, or later does, appeal against the notice.” </p>

It is striking, we consider, that Parliament has not stipulated that the Secretary of State should take any steps to make it easier for such appellants to exercise their right of appeal.

In <span style="font-style:italic">G1 v Secretary of State for the Home Department </span>[2012] EWCA Civ 867; [2013] QB 1008, the Secretary of State deprived the appellant of his nationality and made an exclusion order while he was in Sudan. This Court rejected the argument that there was any legislative intention that an appeal under section 40A should be conducted from the United Kingdom after the repeal of section 40A(6). Laws LJ rejected the argument that the Secretary of State owed the appellant a duty to facilitate his return to the UK to conduct his appeal. He held that there was no general common law right to be present at an appeal and that an in-country appeal can only be guaranteed by legislation. SIAC noted at [154] that Laws LJ did not clearly decide the question of legal principle whether that general rule was displaced in this type of case, but upheld the decision of Mitting J that the appellant had not shown that he could not effectively exercise his rights of appeal and that, on the facts, the Secretary of State could not be criticised for not allowing him to return to prosecute his appeal, as if he were held on appeal to be a threat to national security, that would be liable to frustrate the decision to exclude him and deprive him of his nationality. Although the Court of Appeal did not clearly decide the issue of principle, SIAC considered that this decision supported its construction of the statutory scheme. </p>

The officials asked the Secretary of State to decide in principle to deprive him of his nationality the next time he was in Sudan and exclude him from the UK, in order to mitigate the risk of the appellant establishing himself in the UK to conduct terrorismrelated activities. The Secretary of State made such a decision and a little later the appellant went to Sudan and the Secretary of State made a deprivation decision. As SIAC noted at [157], the issue was whether this was lawful or an abuse of power because it deprived the appellant of an in-country right of appeal. SIAC considered Laws LJ’s statement at [15] of his judgment that someone notified of a deprivation decision enjoyed an in-country right of appeal was wrong for the reasons it had given in analysing the legislative scheme. </p>

Laws LJ held that the Secretary of State was not prevented by the legislative scheme from taking steps which hampered the exercise of a right of an in-country appeal if that would or might damage national security. The scheme did not guarantee an in-country right of appeal. SIAC considered that the reasoning in <span style="font-style:italic">L1 </span>also supported its construction of the statutory scheme.

One of their arguments before SIAC was that they had not been allowed to return to the UK to take part in their appeals. SIAC decided a preliminary issue against them which was whether the appeals should be allowed because it was impossible to decide them fairly as the appellants were in Pakistan. They submitted that they were inhibited from giving full instructions to their solicitors who had visited Pakistan three times, although they had put in written statements. The Secretary of State pointed out that they had not engaged with the substance of the OPEN national security case against them. They submitted that SIAC should either have allowed their appeals or in their parallel application for judicial review the deprivation orders should be quashed and orders made that the appeals be heard again with the appellants enabled to return to the UK to pursue them. </p>

SIAC referred at [162] of its judgment in the present case to the point made by Burnett LJ at [69] of his judgment that the contention that: “her decision might give rise to difficulties in any subsequent appeal cannot … affect the question whether her earlier decisions to deprive or the subsequent deprivations were unlawful. Indeed, it was not even clear that there would be any appeals and if so from which of the eventual appellants. One only has to contemplate the possibility that some, but not all, appealed, to expose the difficulty”. As Burnett LJ pointed out, all the decisions were taken at the same time on the same material but on this argument, if only one of them appealed, it could be said the decision in his case was unlawful.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">SIAC noted at [163] that Burnett LJ considered the appellants’ evidence [as to the difficulties they faced in conducting their appeals from Pakistan] as “superficial and without particularity”. At first instance SIAC had declined to decide what it would or could have done if it had accepted the appellants’ argument that they were genuinely inhibited from engaging with the appeals because of fears for their safety. On appeal, it was argued that if SIAC had found this was so, it would have been obliged to allow the appeals. Burnett LJ considered that there was nothing in the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (Procedure) Rules 2003 (“the 2003 Rules”) which gave SIAC a “disciplinary power” requiring the Secretary of State to facilitate entry to the UK to take part in an appeal. He concluded at [85] that he was not persuaded that, even if the appellants had made good their concerns, there was anything in the power of SIAC to help them. He said that the appropriate course was for the appellants to apply for entry clearance outside the Immigration Rules to take part in their appeals and to challenge any refusal by way of an application for judicial review. The circumstances in which such an application would succeed would be: “rare and would require clear and compelling evidence to support the proposition that, absent physical presence in the UK the person concerned could take no meaningful part in the … appeal. Even then, the decision would have to be reviewed in the light of public law principles …”.  The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, gave permission to apply for judicial review of the refusal to facilitate the appellants’ return, but dismissed the substantive application.  </p>

He also sought to apply for judicial review of the deprivation order and by way of interim relief, for an order requiring the Secretary of State to return him to the UK to prosecute his appeal. The Administrative Court refused permission and interim relief holding his grounds were either unarguable or should be raised in his appeal to SIAC which was a suitable alternative remedy.  </p>

One of the issues considered by the Court of Appeal was whether SIAC had jurisdiction to address that argument and, if so, what relief it could give. As SIAC said in its judgment in the present case at [176] the Secretary of State argued that SIAC could address the underlying issue whether the appellant’s return should be facilitated either as a preliminary issue in the appeal or, if the appellant applied for it and the Secretary of State refused it, in an expedited appeal against the refusal of entry clearance.  </p>

His counsel argued that on the basis of the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">S1</span>, SIAC did not have jurisdiction to consider an argument about the timing of the deprivation order and because SIAC could not grant interim relief, the appeal was not, at the interlocutory stage, a suitable alternative remedy. Justice required the appellant to be returned to the UK to take part in his appeal, but the appeal could not be a forum for deciding whether it was necessary for him to be in the UK. An appeal against a refusal of LTE was also not a suitable alternative remedy. </p>

However, Elisabeth Laing J did give a short judgment on the application for judicial review of the refusal of LTE on common law grounds. She gave permission to apply for judicial review, but refused the substantive application, adopting [140] to [191] of the SIAC judgment. She noted that, at an earlier stage of the Administrative Court proceedings, the Secretary of State had made a written application under section 6 of the Justice and Security Act 2013 to rely upon CLOSED material and had been given permission by the judge to do so. In the event, there had been no reliance on CLOSED material.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">At [7] the judge set out the steps in Ms Begum’s argument: (i) that she had a constitutional right of access to the court; (ii) that the decision refusing LTE interfered with that right and should go no further than is reasonably necessary to achieve a legitimate objective; (iii) Parliament had given her a statutory right of appeal under the 1997 Act and must have intended that right to be effective; (iv) the appeal will not be effective unless she can take part in it and (v) if she cannot take part in her appeal, either her deprivation appeal should succeed or her appeal against the refusal of LTE. At [8] the judge noted that there was a significant gap between those two outcomes. The first would give Ms Begum the remedy she seeks in the deprivation appeal. The second would oblige the Secretary of State to grant LTE but would not guarantee she would be able to take part in the appeal (as she is detained in Syria) still less give her the remedy she seeks. </p>

That conclusion meant that the judge did not need to decide whether or not the Secretary of State was irrational in insisting that Ms Begum provide biometric data before he would consider the application for LTE. </p>

He submitted that at [143] in its judgment in the present case, SIAC had found in clear and unqualified terms that Ms Begum could not play any meaningful part in the appeal, which therefore could not be fair and effective. Although SIAC had not set out the evidence on which that finding was based, it was clear that it was accepting the evidence of Mr Daniel Furner, Ms Begum’s solicitor, who had produced both OPEN and confidential statements explaining the difficulties he faced in communicating with his client and obtaining instructions from her. Mr Hickman QC referred this Court to his witness statements where he describes the significant difficulties in communicating with Ms Begum. Mr Furner says that he could not properly take instructions from her in relation to the Secretary of State’s OPEN national security case. He draws the obvious distinction between the lawyer/client relationship and the interviews she has given to the press upon which the Secretary of State had relied as indicating that he could obtain instructions. At [7] of the judgment, SIAC refers to having read his statements and to the fact that he was not cross-examined. In other words, his evidence was unchallenged.  </p>

He noted that this was part of the reasoning of SIAC at [144] and the Secretary of State mentioned the point in one form or another in seven places in her skeleton argument. It was said that in a number of cases, the circumstances in which the appellant left the UK had been highly relevant. Thus in <span style="font-style:italic">G1 </span>at [16] Laws LJ made the point that the reason why the appellant had to conduct his appeal from outside the UK was not the deprivation decision, but the fact that he had fled the jurisdiction before he was required to surrender to his bail. The same point was made when his case got to the European Court of Human Rights as <span style="font-style:italic">K2</span> (see [60] of the judgment) and also in the case of <span style="font-style:italic">S1</span> at [80]. However, that point arose in the context of whether the appeal could be fair and effective. Where, as here, SIAC had decided the appeal could not be fair and effective, Mr Hickman QC submitted that the fact that it was said Ms Begum had left of her own choice was not relevant to the question of what the consequences should be of her inability to have a fair and effective appeal.  </p>

He also submitted that the evidence before SIAC did not support this conclusion in any event. When Ms Begum left the UK she was only 15 and had not taken her GCSEs. The ministerial submission recognised at (e) (quoted at [12] above) that she may have been the victim of radicalisation. He also relied upon various newspaper articles about young people being brainwashed by extremists over social media and the Core Script and Q&amp;A on Foreign Terrorist Travellers updated to 17 April 2019 produced by the Government. The latter document made the point that of the 900 people who had travelled to Syria or Iraq to engage with the conflict some 40% had returned to the UK, the majority of whom were assessed to pose no, or a low, security risk. The Secretary of State relied on the media interviews Ms Begum had given which could not be taken at face value. One simply does not know what the position is and cannot draw conclusions.  </p>

This made clear Parliament’s intention that the person should have an effective right of appeal, the appeal being the mechanism through which fairness was afforded, as was clear from the passage in the SIAC judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Al Jedda </span>quoted above.  </p>

This is a point which is developed in the written submissions made by Mr Verdirame QC, Mr Pobjoy and Ms McRae on behalf of the UN Rapporteur as intervenor, which emphasise the need for sufficient procedural guarantees and safeguards to protect against the risk of arbitrariness and the minimum requirements of a right to an independent review of a deprivation decision by a judicial or administrative body.

That this was the correct approach in a full merits appeal is clear from the first SIAC judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Al Jedda</span> [2009] SC/66/2008 at [3] to [7] and from [30] of the judgment of Lord Wilson JSC when that case went to the Supreme Court: [2013] UKSC 62; [2014] AC 253.  </p>

He accepted, however, that the court would apply anxious scrutiny in answering that question and that it would make no material difference in practice whether the court proceeded by way of review of the Secretary of State's conclusion or made its own independent assessment of risk on the evidence before it, as it would in a case under article 3. In our judgment, the question whether the Secretary of State's practice complies with his policy requires the court to determine for itself whether detainees transferred to Afghan custody are at real risk, and it is therefore for the court to make its own assessment of risk rather than to review the assessment made by the Secretary of State. That is how we have proceeded. We agree, however, that in practice the two approaches lead to the same answer in this case.” </p>

Mr Hickman QC relied upon the definition of “real risk” in this context of the test under Article 3 (which corresponded with the test under the policy) at [60] of the judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">AS &amp; DD</span>: “A real risk is more than a mere possibility but something less than a balance of probabilities or more likely than not.” The argument on behalf of the Secretary of State that SIAC was only required to consider immediate risks, not future risks, was strikingly similar to an argument rejected by the Court of Appeal in that case. </p>

SIAC had wrongly failed to recognise that this was exactly the sort of risk which leading counsel for the Secretary of State had conceded the application of the policy would lead to the person not being deprived of his or her nationality in her second example referred to in [50] of the judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">X2</span>. Furthermore, he submitted that deprivation had created the risk of Ms Begum remaining longer in the camp in inhumane conditions than would have been the case if she had retained her nationality and the UK government had sought to repatriate her. The Secretary of State had failed to consider that risk at all and SIAC had not reached its own conclusion about that risk because of its erroneous approach.  </p>

He submitted that SIAC was not saying that she could not have a fair and effective appeal for all time, but only <span style="font-style:italic">pro tem</span>. Some of her problems were susceptible to immediate change, for example she might gain sufficient access to a telephone and then to a video link. He said he was not seeking to reopen SIAC’s clear finding at [143] but just illustrate SIAC had not reached any final view. The difficulties in communicating with her lawyers were relative. She had been able to communicate with them on a range of issues and give detailed interviews to the press. There was a possibility of some response from her however attenuated, so [143] of the judgment was not a determination that it would not be possible for her position to be ameliorated. </p>

First, he submitted that the problems Ms Begum faced were nothing to do with the Secretary of State. Excusable or otherwise, they were entirely created by Ms Begum. He submitted that the case law had repeatedly recognised the relevance of the appellant’s absence from the jurisdiction being self-inflicted. He referred to [16] in <span style="font-style:italic">G1</span> and [60] when that case went to the European Court of Human Rights, passages to which I have already referred at [58] above. He also referred to [80] of <span style="font-style:italic">S1</span>. However, essentially he accepted Mr Hickman QC’s point, again recorded at [58] above, that in those cases, absence being selfinflicted went to whether the appellant could have a fair hearing, not to what happens if the appellant cannot have a fair hearing.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">His second core submission was that, in any event, there was nothing preventing Ms Begum from applying for a stay of the appeal. She chose to engage in the preliminary issues and the Secretary of State was not seeking a final determination. An adjournment or stay of the appeal was a way of dealing with the issue of unfairness. It would also allow the Court to acknowledge that, as he put it, the road was not exhausted, and put off the evil day of confronting extremely difficult issues.  </p>

The Court should not in principle have to choose between unattractive alternatives and did not need to do so yet.

He submitted that contrary to Mr Hickman QC’s submission, Parliament cannot truly have intended that in a case where an appellant could not have a fair and effective appeal, the appeal should simply be allowed without any consideration of the merits of the deprivation decision or the national security case against the appellant. It was much more likely that Parliament would expect everything to be done within the powers of the Courts to avoid that conundrum if there was a realistic alternative, which there was: to leave the deprivation decision in place and for there to be a stay or adjournment of the appeal until Ms Begum’s position improved.  </p>

The starting point was the common law position as described by Laws LJ in [22]-[23] of <span style="font-style:italic">G1</span>, that there was no presumption of a right to be present at a statutory appeal, that an in-country right of appeal could only be guaranteed by legislation, which it was not under section 40A of the BNA and that section 92(1) of the 2002 Act indicated a view on the part of Parliament that out-of-country appeals to the First-tier Tribunal are in principle neither unfair nor ineffective. That analysis was accepted by Burnett LJ at [71] of <span style="font-style:italic">S1</span>. Parliament knew full well that there was a quantity of appellants deprived of their British nationality who would be abroad and yet it had removed the suspensive effect of a deprivation decision by repealing section 40(6) of the BNA.

The geographical extent of the powers under the different statutory regimes was materially different which was significant because it affected the scope of protection that is available to deal with terrorist conduct that is contrary to the public interest. The cases relied upon by Mr Hickman QC all concerned disclosure and the failure of the Secretary of State to disclose information on which he relied in justifying the decision under challenge. Sir James submitted that that was a different issue from the question whether the unavailability of an effective appeal at a particular point in time means that an appeal against a deprivation decision must be allowed. If information cannot be disclosed without harming national security, then that was highly likely to remain an insuperable objection even if the individual’s circumstances subsequently change.

Although SIAC does not refer expressly at this point in its judgment to the evidence of Mr Furner as to the difficulties of communication and of obtaining instructions, its conclusion in the first sentence of [143] seems to me to show that it accepted that evidence which was unchallenged. I agree with Mr Hickman QC that, in circumstances where the Secretary of State has not cross-appealed the conclusion in the first sentence of [143] of the judgment or sought to challenge through cross-examination the evidence of Mr Furner, it is not open to the Secretary of State to run arguments  such as that Ms Begum’s situation in the camp might be susceptible to immediate change because she might gain access to a telephone or a videolink or that she can give instructions, albeit in an attenuated form. We have to proceed on the basis that whilst she remains detained in the camp she cannot give effective instructions or take any meaningful part in her appeal, so that, as SIAC found, the appeal cannot be fair and effective. </p>

However, as he recognised, the cases which have considered this question of absence from the jurisdiction being self-inflicted, specifically <span style="font-style:italic">G1</span> (<span style="font-style:italic">K2</span>) and <span style="font-style:italic">S1</span>, have done so in the context of the issue of whether the relevant appellant can have a fair and effective appeal, an issue which in the present case has been determined in Ms Begum’s favour. None of them has considered the legal and procedural consequences of an appellant not being able to have a fair and effective appeal, the issue which arises in the present case. In my judgment, the circumstances in which Ms Begum left the UK and remained in Syria and whether she did so of her own free will should be irrelevant to the question of the legal and procedural consequences of SIAC’s conclusion that she cannot have a fair and effective appeal. Furthermore, I would be uneasy taking a course which, in effect, involved deciding that Ms Begum had left the UK as a 15 year old schoolgirl of her own free will in circumstances where one of the principal reasons why she cannot have a fair and effective appeal is her inability to give proper instructions or provide evidence. One of the topics that could be explored on her appeal before SIAC is precisely what were the circumstances in which she left the UK in 2015, but that could only properly be determined after a fair and effective appeal.  The Secretary of State’s submission risks putting the cart before the horse. </p>

In particular, where, as in the present case, the deprivation decision is based on an expert assessment that it is in the interests of national security, simply allowing an appeal would set that assessment at nought, a point which was powerfully made by Sir James Eadie QC. That seems to me to be an extreme position which is wrong in principle and would potentially set a dangerous precedent.  </p>

But this general duty is not apt to provide a power to direct that someone (an appellant or witness) should be allowed to enter the United Kingdom for the purpose of giving evidence in person before SIAC. Rather it is concerned to ensure that in the event that SAIC considers it has inadequate material available to it to determine an appeal, it may use the other powers available to it under the rules to remedy the deficiency (in particular rules 10A and 39), which include powers to give directions to a party to serve further details of a case and evidence. A failure to comply with such directions may lead to the appeal being struck out, or the reply from the Home Secretary being struck out. This latter course would have the practical effect of the appeal going by default. Otherwise, the only circumstances envisaged by the 2003 Rules (rule 11B) for striking out the Home Secretary's reply, is if it discloses no reasonable grounds for defending the appeal.  </p>

The appellants took the first step, at least in substance. In the course of the SIAC appeal they asked, through the Treasury Solicitor, whether the Home Office would facilitate their return to the United Kingdom for the purpose of prosecuting the appeals. The answer was no. In September 2012 the judicial review proceedings were issued which are before us sitting as a Divisional Court.  </p>

Even then, the decision would have to be reviewed in the light of public law principles including if they apply, EU and ECHR principles.

He is not saying that SIAC would allow the appeal against the deprivation order without considering its merits. That would explain what SIAC described as the cryptic statement by Beatson LJ at [58] that Burnett LJ’s statement in [85] that SIAC was powerless to help the appellants did not reflect the statutory scheme.

The Court of Appeal was not purporting to determine that SIAC would have to take a particular course, as in allow the appeal, but whether it had jurisdiction to do so. As SIAC points out at [189 (iii)] of its judgment, in the last two sentences of [88] of his judgment, Beatson LJ said: “She [Ms Giovannetti QC counsel for the Secretary of State] argued that, by contrast, there is no statutory presumption that out of country appellants should be permitted to travel to the United Kingdom to conduct their appeals here and that article 8 does not create such a presumption. I express no views on these matters because, in this appeal, the role of this court is to consider whether SIAC is able to decide these matters and give a practical and effective remedy in respect of them.” This seems to me a further indication that the Court of Appeal was only deciding issues of jurisdiction, not substantive issues.  </p>

As to the right to an independent review, as Sir James Eadie QC pointed out, nothing in the principles of international law relied upon dictates as the only answer to Ms Begum’s appeal not being fair and effective that her deprivation appeal should be allowed, if there are other ways in which the unfairness and lack of effectiveness can be addressed.  </p>

The critical question remains as to what steps can be taken to alleviate the unfairness and lack of effectiveness. At [191] of its judgment, SIAC identified three possible courses: (i) that Ms Begum could continue with her appeal; (ii) that “she could apply for a stay of the appeal in the hope that, at some point in the future, she will be in a better position to take part in it”; (iii) if she does not ask for a stay, she might fail to comply with a direction under Rule 40 of the 2003 Rules, leading SIAC to strike out the appeal, but that if her circumstances changed in the future, it might be open to her to apply to reinstate her appeal. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The first and third of these courses can be swiftly dismissed as failing to answer the issue of unfairness and lack of effectiveness of the appeal. With due respect to SIAC, it is unthinkable that, having concluded that Ms Begum could not take any meaningful part in her appeal so that it could not be fair and effective, she should have to continue with her appeal nonetheless. On this hypothesis, the Secretary of State would be able to present her case justifying the deprivation decision and the national security case in particular, without Ms Begum and her legal advisers being able to mount an effective challenge to that case. It is no answer to say, as was suggested on behalf of the Secretary of State, that she would have the benefit of the submissions of the Special Advocates in any CLOSED hearing and they have already been instructed and so are essentially incommunicado without express agreement of the Secretary of State. As the OPEN disclosure in relation to the national security case makes clear in the footnote cited at [13] above, the same national security case is currently relied on in both OPEN and CLOSED. It follows that any unfairness and lack of effectiveness in OPEN cannot be cured by the Special Advocates in CLOSED.  </p>

It is quite another to proceed with an appeal without the participation of the appellant because the appellant is unable to participate meaningfully and effectively.

As Singh LJ said in the course of argument, it is difficult to conceive of any case where a court or tribunal has said we cannot hold a fair trial, but we are going to go on anyway. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The third course equally does not alleviate, let alone remedy the unfairness. What is contemplated is that Ms Begum is required to continue with the appeal, directions are made at some point with which she cannot comply and so SIAC strikes out her appeal under Rule 40(1)(c) of the 2003 Rules, leaving her to apply to reinstate the appeal under Rule 40(3) if SIAC were satisfied that she could not comply with its directions due to circumstances beyond her control. That seems to me to be no more than a refinement of the first course, carrying on with the appeal even though SIAC has found that Ms Begum cannot have a fair and effective appeal. This merely compounds the unfairness. </p>

This was the course urged upon us by Sir James Eadie QC, specifically to avoid what he described as the “ultimate conundrum” of allowing the appeal as contended for by Mr Hickman QC. I have already concluded that we should not simply allow the appeal, so one is looking for ways in which the unfairness and lack of effectiveness can be ameliorated. </p>

First, as noted in [13] above the national security case against Ms Begum at this stage of the proceedings in both OPEN and CLOSED<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>is that she travelled to Syria and aligned with ISIL. Annex A to the ministerial submission expands on that assessment again as set out in [13] above. Whilst there is no question of prejudging the national security issue in circumstances where the appeal has not been heard, that assessment would appear to be at a lower level of seriousness than in the case of U2. Second, the assessment made by SIAC in [144] of that case was made after a full appeal hearing in which U2 provided lengthy witness statements and was cross-examined on behalf of the Secretary of State. The national security case against him as set out in the OPEN judgment describes a dangerous and dedicated Islamic extremist, who has travelled to Syria many times and who has connections to equally dangerous terrorists and extremists. </p>

If the Security Service and the Director of Public Prosecutions consider that the evidence and public interest tests for a prosecution for terrorist offences are met, she could be arrested and charged upon her arrival in the United Kingdom and remanded in custody pending trial. If that were not feasible, she could be made the subject of a TPIM.   </p>

As noted above, Sir James contended that allowing the LTE appeal would not guarantee that Ms Begum would be released from the camp. However, as Mr Hickman QC pointed out, the uncontested evidence of Mr Furner was that, if Ms Begum were granted LTE and had access to UFF travel documents, he had no reason to believe she would be unable to return. As he said, the Kurdish authorities have repeatedly made clear, in public, their determination to facilitate such returns.   </p>

That is as true of the issue whether as a direct consequence of the deprivation decision there are substantial grounds for believing that there is a real risk of mistreatment or unlawful killing that would constitute a breach of Articles 2 and/or 3 if it occurred in the jurisdiction (the issue under the extra-territorial policy) as it is of the issue of statelessness, which SIAC did decide for itself on the basis of expert evidence in detailed reasoning in its judgment.

In my judgment, there is no principled reason why SIAC should adopt a different approach to assessment of risk where the extra-territorial policy applies, given that the test under the policy is the same as applies where the ECHR has direct effect and the policy proceeds as if Articles 2 and 3 had extra-territorial effect. Contrary to the submission of Sir James Eadie QC, I consider that the approach of the Divisional Court in <span style="font-style:italic">R (Evans) v Secretary of State for Defence</span> as cited at [69] above informs what should have been the approach of SIAC here. Although the policy under consideration in <span style="font-style:italic">Evans </span>was a different one from the extra-territorial policy under consideration in the present case, the intention of both policies was the same, that Articles 2 and 3 would be given extra-territorial effect, so that there is every reason why the approach of the Court or SIAC should be the same, namely to make its own independent assessment of risk on all the evidence before it.  </p>

SIAC failed to evaluate the evidence of risk if she were transferred to Iraq or Bangladesh which established an arguable case of “real risk” as defined in [60] of <span style="font-style:italic">AS &amp; DD</span>. It also failed to evaluate at all the issue whether the effect of the deprivation decision was to prolong Ms Begum’s detention in the camp, where, as SIAC accepted at [130], conditions were such as would have breached her Article 3 rights if that Article applied.  </p>

This is for two reasons.  First, the normal course when a claim for judicial review succeeds is to remit the matter to the relevant decision-making body to reconsider its decision in accordance with the judgment of the reviewing court.  Secondly, SIAC is better placed than this Court to make findings of fact, particularly in the field of national security.
