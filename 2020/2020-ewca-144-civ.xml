The respondents were the owners and operators of what was at the relevant time the largest iron ore mine in that region. It is unnecessary for the purposes of this appeal to differentiate between the different companies. The impact of the mine on the inhabitants of the region led to unrest and, in November 2010 (“the 2010 incident”) and April 2012 (“the 2012 incident”) local disturbances prompted a significant overreaction from some members of the Sierra </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">The appellants brought proceedings against the respondents alleging that the respondents were liable to them for the wrongful acts of the SLP on seven different legal grounds, summarised by the judge at [11] and explained in greater detail at [12][60]. These were: (i) vicarious liability for torts alleged to have been directly committed by the respondents’ employees and officials; (ii) vicarious liability for torts committed by the SLP; (iii) accessory liability of the respondents acting in furtherance of a common tortious design with the SLP; (iv) liability for the tortious acts of the SLP as a result of “some direction or procuring or direct request or encouragement” on the part of the respondents; (v) malicious prosecution; (vi) breach of the respondents’ direct duty in failing to take adequate steps to prevent the SLP from committing torts; and (vii) breach of a non-delegable duty in respect of an extra hazardous activity carried out negligently by the SLP and an independent contractor. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Of these seven ways in which the claim was pleaded, (i) and (iv) comprised the main thrust of the claimants’ case at trial, because they were said to arise out of the direct involvement of the respondents’ employees in the tortious acts (trespass to the person) committed by the SLP. Following a long trial and a detailed judgment, all the claims were rejected by the judge. The arguments on appeal have been limited, not to the main claims advanced at trial, but to the claims at (iii) above, namely the alleged common tortious design, and (vi) above, the alleged duty owed by the respondents directly to the appellants. This second element of the appeal also seeks to open up one of the judge’s findings as to breach and takes a further, narrow point about his findings on causation.</p>

The respondents constructed the large opencast mine at the centre of this case and built the necessary infrastructure to transport the ore to the coast. This necessitated the refurbishment of 31 miles of existing railway and the construction of 51 miles of new railway. We were told that, even in the dry season, the unpaved tracks which comprise the bulk of the road system in Sierra Leone meant that it takes five hours to drive from Freetown, the capital on the coast, to the mine.  </p>

As the judge noted at [93], in order to maintain smooth relations with the surrounding villages, the respondents employed locally recruited Community Liaison Officers (“CLOs”) to act as go-betweens. The judge identified one particular CLO, known as “Yallan”, because he was at the centre of the claimants’ allegations that the respondents were directly involved in the overreaction by the SLP during the 2010 incident.

He found that, in particular, “Kim Gordon saw abuse and physical violence inflicted on the detainees at the mine camp including the infliction of a blow to the head from a rifle butt”.

The police presence in the location of the mine specifically in April 2012 was on a considerable scale and had involved the re-deployment of many men from far distant locations. I am satisfied that, but for the provision of cash, the police response would have been considerably less robust. The significance of this is that it cannot be assumed that the payment of money is, in itself, a compelling factor supporting the conclusion that the defendant had thereby assumed a greater than appropriate level of control over the SLP. It would be understandable, against the background of a more tightly regulated and stringent police organisation than that which then operated in Sierra Leone, that a darker purpose might be inferred from such payments but, not for the first time in this case, the fact-finding exercise must not be performed without regard to the prevailing social and political context in which it falls to be carried out.  </p>

He was, as he said under cross-examination, under the command of the AIG and took orders from him. There would have been no need for Mr Gordon to take the risky course of encouraging unlawful violence in the open air and in the unnecessary presence of several potential witnesses. He need only have instructed the AIG in private to give the orders to shoot without taking the risk that every officer at the fuel depot was aware that he, personally, was responsible for the instruction. Such barefaced conduct would show a reckless disregard for his own reputation and threaten to expose the conciliatory approach evidenced in the minutes of the IMT meeting at which he was in attendance as a hypocritical sham.  </p>

Mr Gordon was unable to recollect giving money to the police or the details of what he had said to them on any given occasion. In his position as the defendant’s Health, Safety and Security Manager, I consider that it is probable that he did meet with members of the SLP on one or more occasions in order to brief the officers, many of whom may have been unfamiliar with the layout of the mine. In particular, it was only to be expected that the police should be informed of the potential flash points and targets of criminal damage and theft. In this context, I would expect Mr Gordon to emphasise the importance of taking steps to protect the fuel farm. I do not accept, however, that he would have taken it upon himself to give any orders or advice as to when, if at all, it might become operationally appropriate to use tear gas or to open fire. Neither do I accept that any such orders or advice would have made any difference to the way in which matters developed during the 2012 incident. This applies to all of the occasions when the police acted unlawfully and, in particular, opened fire using live rounds. However, the particular fact that certain members of the SLP were so undisciplined, unrestrained and violently anarchic as to open fire in the vicinity of women performing a peace dance at a location far away from the mine provides a strong indication that “standing orders” had nothing to do with the tragedy which unfolded. I reject the suggestion that the women were shot at because they had earlier been in the vicinity of the fuel farm or that the SLP could have thought that by firing live ammunition they might thus get the strike under control. I consider that the catalyst to the shooting was a mixture of fear, ill-discipline, anger and testosterone.” </p>

I am in little doubt that, save perhaps for payments made by the defendant in respect of the billeting of police officers at the mine itself, the SLP were not entitled to require, or permitted to accept, payment for the services it provided when seeking to maintain law and order in the locality of the mine. However, in reality, if the defendant had not paid for these services they would either not have been provided or, at best, would have been woefully inadequate. The SLP raised unlawful charges for services which they should have rendered free of charge but this did not give rise to any consequences of direct legal significance in the instant case.

Further, at [63] he noted that, inevitably, and for the sake of proportionality, he had had to leave a very considerable number of points “on the cutting room floor”. That did not mean that he had not considered them, but he wanted to stress that the inclusion of their analysis or resolution in an already lengthy judgment would not have had a material impact on the determination of the central issues. Other particular obstacles to the fact-finding exercise in this case were set out by the judge at [66] – [85].

Understanding that the object of the exercise was to find Mr Ismaili and "beat him up" (as she put it), she agreed to assist by pointing out the address at which she believed he lived and, in so doing, expressly or by the clearest implication, became part of the common design. It was not suggested that the fact that Mr Shah (as opposed to Mr Ismaili) was attacked makes any difference and that she was not present when the men returned to the house that she had identified is irrelevant. I have no doubt that in relation to an assault on the occupier of 41 Hibernia Road, Miss Gale was a joint tortfeasor. In this regard, I deal with Mr Clark's submission that the wrong defendant has been chosen because the Claimant would have been bound to succeed against some or all of the Part 20 Defendants: Mrs Shah has not chosen the only defendant that she could pursue but she has chosen one who is liable and against whom she was entitled to bring proceedings.” </p>

The claimant brought proceedings in trespass and conversion against all three defendants, contending that the attack had taken place pursuant to a common design between the three defendants to commit such acts, making them all joint tortfeasors.

In this context, the law of tort does not recognise true accessory liability, only joint liability where the person who can be termed the actual perpetrator is the agent of another person. Taking Devlin J's well-known example in <span style="font-style:italic">NCB v Gamble </span>[1959] 1 QB 11 at 23, the consequence is that selling a person a gun knowing that person will use it to kill someone else will make the seller an accessory to the murder but will not in itself make him liable in tort.

If I had considered that Hamblen J was wrong not to find that the first element of accessory liability was established, that is, that the appellant assisted SSCS in the commission of acts which may prove to have been tortious, I would have held that the second element was also established, that is, that the acts were done in pursuance of a common design shared by SSCS and the appellant. It would be sufficient for this purpose that the acts were done in pursuit of a campaign of which the appellant approved with the knowledge that the campaign involved a preparedness, if need be, to use violent intervention. Hamblen J observed that it was not necessarily the case that such action would take place, but a plan can include a conditional element. If D organises with P the doing of acts on V’s land, whether V consents or not, it would be no answer to a claim in trespass against D that it was possible that V would consent. But Hamblen J examined the role actually played by the appellant and judged it minimal. On that basis the conduct element of accessory liability was not established.” </p>

Intent in the law of tort is commonly relevant as a control mechanism limiting the ambit of a person’s obligation to safeguard the rights of others, where this would constrict his freedom to engage in activities which are otherwise lawful. The economic torts are a classic illustration of this. The cases on joint torts have had to grapple with the same problem, and intent performs the same role. What the authorities, taken as a whole, demonstrate is that the additional element which is required to establish liability, over and above mere knowledge that an otherwise lawful act will assist the tort, is a shared intention that it should do so. The required limitation on the scope of liability is achieved by the combination of active co-operation and commonality of intention. It is encapsulated in Scrutton LJ’s distinction between concerted action to a common end and independent action to a similar end, and between either of these things and mere knowledge of the consequences of one’s acts.” </p>

Furthermore, I am not satisfied that those in positions of power in the defendant’s organisation were pursuing a policy intending that the SLP should deploy excessive force against the local population. The person in overall charge of the Tonkolili project was Gibril Bangura, now deceased. He was generally well-liked and was instrumental in pursuing the strategy of appeasement in the aftermath of the 2012 incident. Frank Timis was the Executive Chairman of the defendant. There is some evidence to support the suggestion that, at one stage, he attempted to mislead the market in respect of the financial position of the defendant. However, in the absence of any evidence of his involvement in the relationship between the defendant and the SLP, no purpose would be served by making any findings with respect to his character or credibility and I decline to do so. Mr Jansen impressed me as a genuine witness striving to do his honest best to assist the court. He is no longer employed by the defendant and so the risk of loyalty distorting accuracy was much diluted. On 17 April 2012, he chaired an Incident Management Team meeting the notes to which reveal that he identified the defendant’s priorities to be “1. Human life 2. Company assets 3. Environment”. Mr Jansen went on to ask the team to identify the top five actions which would help to defuse the situation. I am satisfied that this was an accurate note of what was discussed and that it reflected Mr Jansen’s strategy and principles... </p>

The new case, based on what the judge treated as neutral acts of assistance (and which, as he made clear, were not the subject of any real dispute) and inferences as to intent never previously suggested, is far removed from the main areas of debate at the trial.

Using the well-worn example previously noted, if you intend to rob the bank if the coast is clear, you still intend to commit the underlying crime, and so are liable as a joint tortfeasor. By contrast, you may foresee that your friend, who is in such dire financial straits that you have lent him your car, might be desperate enough to rob a bank, but you do not intend him to use your car as a getaway vehicle. Foreseeability is never enough on its own to create a legal liability: see also paragraph 139 below. </p>

On appeal, at paragraph 37 of their skeleton argument, the appellants said that “the inescapable inference is that Mr Dumbuya <span style="font-style:italic">tacitly agreed</span> to the use of excessive force if and when the police saw fit.” Leaving aside the appellants’ repeated elision of a tacit agreement on the one hand, and inferred intent on the other, that submission is simply not open to them in the light of the judge’s findings of fact. The judge made repeated findings in respect of Mr Dumbuya that he was not encouraging or intending the police to act unlawfully, and that it was not his intention that the appellants should be the victims of tortious acts committed by members of the SLP: see for example [244], [254], [256], [258] and [328].  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">There are plenty of other examples of this complete misalignment between the new case and the judge’s findings. So, at [222] the judge found that Mr Musa Bangura was not directing/encouraging the SLP to act unlawfully, and at [233], that Mr Navo was not encouraging the police to act unlawfully and the cash payment that he made on Day 2 did not support the contrary proposition. These are findings that those involved cannot have intended the police to act unlawfully, again contrary to the inference which the appellants now ask this court to draw. Similarly, there are the judge’s findings in relation to Mr Gordon’s intent at [265] and [266]. The judge found that the fear, illdiscipline, anger and testosterone which caused the 2012 incident was the responsibility of the SLP, and that none of that had been intended by Mr Gordon. The point about the SLP’s responsibility is important for another reason: because he had concluded that the failures were solely the responsibility of SLP, the judge went on, later in his judgment, to find that, from a causation perspective, the absence of risk assessments and the like did not cause or contribute to the 2012 incident. </p>

I do not consider that he made good that submission.

But in any event, I consider that that is too nice a distinction to be meaningful on the facts of this case. The judge found in terms that those involved in these events on behalf of the respondents did not intend the SLP to use violence. In my view, in all the circumstances, that is sufficient to negate any contrary inferred intent in this case, whether actual or conditional. </p>

It was said that these were the activities from which the necessary intent could be inferred. Mr Hermer argued that the judge’s conclusions did not withstand an analysis of what money, vehicles and accommodation were provided and when. On the first day of the appeal hearing, he handed in freshly prepared timelines dealing principally with how the provision of vehicles, money and accommodation during Days 2 and 3 in particular were, on the appellants’ case, enough to demonstrate intention. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">I do not accept that submission. The timelines simply set out the assistance (about which there was little debate) and the foreseeability of possible consequences. As to the assistance, the judge’s analysis makes plain that the money, vehicles and accommodation were provided as part of both the general circumstances of the SLP in Sierra Leone, and the particular circumstances that existed in Tonkolili. The judge found that the making of cash payments was normal and that, without them, the police would not have provided the necessary services (see the passages set out in paragraphs 41-42 above). It was unsurprising that there were more payments at the height of the unrest during the 2012 incident because there were large additional numbers of police present. Similarly, vehicles and accommodation were required, given the large numbers of additional police called in on Day 1 of the 2012 incident to protect the mine and the employees from civil unrest.  </p>

In my view, those findings show that the judge had these matters (and when they were provided) very much in mind when considering intention, but they did not lead him to reach the conclusions now urged by the appellants. That was a matter for the judge. It is not a matter that can now be relitigated. </p>

The authorities on common design do not suggest that, in these circumstances, it would be appropriate to infer any contrary intent (whether conditional or otherwise) on the part of those whom the judge found did not expressly intend for the SLP to use excessive force.

Just like anyone else who calls on the assistance of the police, the respondents were entitled to seek their protection.

The judge concluded that the necessary intent would have to be in the mind of the senior management of the respondents, because this was a primary and not a vicarious liability. That may well be right. But given that the necessary intent cannot be inferred here in the minds of anyone (whether involved in the 2010 and 2012 incidents or not), this subsidiary element of the appeal simply does not arise, and it is not appropriate to deal with it further.  </p>

In <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Mitchell</span>, for example, it was a failure to warn. In <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Hartwell </span>it was the provision of access to a firearm. In contrast, the Re-Amended Particulars in the present case identify no fewer than fifteen particulars of negligence. Most of these relate to allegations falling very clearly on the omissions side of the “imprecise boundary” to which Lord Nicholls was referring in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Hartwell</span>. They include, for example, failures to have engaged in “any meaningful conflict resolution with protesters” and to have “sufficient and properly trained private security”. The categorisation of the provisions of vehicles and facilities as “acts” does not, however, equip the claimants with a Trojan horse in which otherwise bare and distinct omissions can be accommodated and brought wholesale within the parameters of a duty of care. For example, if the defendants owed no duty of care to the claimants in respect of its omission to resolve the dispute with the protesters then such a duty could not arise parasitically upon the defendant’s distinct acts in providing the police with vehicles and other support.  </p>

He stressed that his case was presented on a very narrow front. All he was saying was that there was a duty to warn, and that this duty arose because harm to the deceased was reasonably foreseeable.

Although it is right that paragraph 15 of Lord Hope’s judgment suggests that this analysis stems from the principle (as explained by Lord Goff in <span style="font-style:italic">Smith v Littlewoods Organisation Limited </span>[1987] AC 241 at 270 – 271), that the common law does not impose liability for what, without more, may be called pure omissions, I consider that it applies <span style="font-style:italic">prima facie</span> to any case where X seeks to make Y liable for harm caused by Z, where Y’s actual involvement in the relevant events was negligible or non-existent. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">First, I consider that that submission is contrary to the judge’s primary findings. As I have said, the judge found that it was the SLP who had created the danger: the overreaction was the result of “fear, ill-discipline, anger and testosterone” amongst the SLP on the ground and had not been created by the respondents. Mr Moody rightly urged the court to have regard to practical reality: on that basis, taking the appellants’ case at its highest, the provision of overnight accommodation to the SLP did not lead to or even indirectly cause the physical injuries suffered by Kadie Kalma at the hands of the SLP. So this was not a case in which, on the facts, the respondents could be said to have created the danger that eventuated. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Secondly, not only did the provision of the money, vehicles, and accommodation not create a danger but, on the judge’s findings, without them, the situation might well have been worse. It was nothing like the provision of a loaded gun to an unstable man, as in <span style="font-style:italic">Hartwell</span>. As Lord Nicholls said in that case, loaded handguns are dangerous weapons and the serious risks if a gun is handled carefully are obvious. The same cannot be said of the provision of money, vehicles and accommodation to the police during a lengthy bout of civil unrest.  </p>

In my view, that submission does not follow as a matter of logic. Moreover, the submission itself is contrary to the judge’s findings as to the relationship between the SLP and the respondent (paragraphs 41-42 above). It was not a close relationship: it was a relationship based on necessity because, as noted above, if the respondents had not provided additional resources, the SLP would not have functioned in this remote region at all. The SLP were operationally independent [266] and, during the 2012 incident, were under the command and control, not of the respondents, but the second-most important police officer in Sierra Leone.  </p>

These passages demonstrate that the judge was properly dealing with the contingent case that, if he was wrong about the existence of the duty of care, there were only a handful of breaches that he was prepared to find, and that even then, those breaches had no causative effect in any event. These, therefore, were his conclusive findings as to breach and causation and the appellants need to overturn them if the claims in negligence are to succeed.  </p>

Before I go on to address that argument, however, I should deal with the application to amend the Grounds of Appeal foreshadowed in paragraph 124 of this judgment, pursuant to which the appellants sought to argue that the judge should have found an additional, fifth breach of duty.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Dealing with the application to amend the grounds of appeal, I am not persuaded that this court should allow it. At no time until immediately before the appeal hearing itself did the appellants suggest that they wished to challenge any of the judge’s findings on breach. Until then, the causation appeal was advanced solely by reference to the four breaches found by the judge. Furthermore, this cannot have been an oversight, since the respondents’ skeleton argument (originally provided in October 2019), expressly made the point at paragraph 117 that there was no challenge to the judge’s finding that the supply of money, vehicles and accommodation was not a breach of duty. There was no explanation in the material provided to this court as to why this complaint had not been included in the original application for permission to appeal, and why the appellants failed to wake up to the potential importance of the point until some time after it had been pointed out by the respondents.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">However, even if (contrary to my views) this amendment to the grounds of appeal should be permitted so as to allow the point to be argued on appeal, I would reject the new allegation as a matter of substance. That is because I consider that the judge was plainly right to find that the provision of money, vehicles and accommodation was not a breach of any duty. The reasons for that are the same as those noted by the judge. The provision of money, vehicles and accommodation were part and parcel of the regular relationship between the respondents and the SLP. They did not themselves cause or contribute to the unlawful acts. They were equally consistent with the peaceful resolution of the incident. They were therefore not (and could not be) a breach of duty. </p>

He made the same point about the failure to produce a crisis management plan. As to the failure to engage more fully with the SLP, he said he was not satisfied that such engagement would have prevented the episodes of unrest in 2010 or 2012, or the injuries, loss and damage sustained.

The judge carefully laid a trail through the judgment of how and why he thought these breaches (if there was a duty) could not be causatively linked to what happened when the SLP overreacted in 2010 and again in 2012. The only basis on which this court could say that somehow the cumulative effect of these matters did acquire a causative potency would be to undo those findings of fact and replace them with others. There is no basis on which this court could undertake such a task. </p>

But it is to be noted that, even if – contrary to the judge’s views and my own assessment - that had been a breach of duty, the judge went on to reject the claim that it had had any causative effect. He said in terms that a refusal to provide this support may well have escalated rather than mitigated the violence and that the same number of police would have been there in any event. Again, those findings of fact are inviolable; again, they demonstrate that the appeal on causation (even if there had been a duty) is unsustainable. </p>

There is absolutely no basis for such a submission. It runs counter to the judge’s analysis and, in particular, his conclusions at [266], set out in paragraph 40 above. As the judge himself noted, if the money, vehicles and accommodation had not been provided, the situation may well have been considerably worse. The “fear, ill-discipline, anger and testosterone” which the judge concluded were the cause of the violent response may well have been exacerbated if this assistance had not been provided. </p>
