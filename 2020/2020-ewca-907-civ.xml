	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The basic issue on this appeal is whether the appellant, Mr Hancock, has shown a strong enough case to persuade the court to set aside a statutory demand dated 20 October 2016 (“the Statutory Demand”) requiring payment of an alleged debt of approximately £4.09 million, served on him by the respondent, Promontoria (Chestnut) Limited (“Promontoria Chestnut”), as long ago as 8 November 2016.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The alleged debt represented the unsecured balance due under loans originally made to Mr Hancock by Clydesdale Bank PLC (trading as Yorkshire Bank) (“the Bank”) under a series of facility letters dated between November 2006 and December 2011 as amended (“the Facility Letters”). The total amount said to be due under the Facility Letters at the date of the Statutory Demand was £10,898,772.54. Promontoria Chestnut claimed to have acquired title to the loans by assignment, and it was also the registered assignee of 21 legal charges over residential properties mostly in Liverpool </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It is no longer in dispute in these proceedings either (a) that the Deed of Assignment was duly executed by the parties to it, or (b), on the assumption that the debts due from Mr Hancock under the Facility Letters were the subject of a valid legal assignment to Promontoria Chestnut, that written notice of the assignment was given to Mr Hancock on 3 December 2014 by Promontoria Chestnut, acting through its managing agent Engage Commercial (the trading name of a company called Pepper (UK) Limited). Nor is it in dispute that the debts owed by Mr Hancock under the Facility Letters remain unpaid. We were told that the amount due including interest now exceeds £12 million. Furthermore, it is common ground that legal title to the Legal Charges was transferred by the Bank to Promontoria Chestnut on the same date as the Deed of Assignment, using the requisite Land Registry Form TR4 for that purpose, and that Promontoria Chestnut was then registered at HM Land Registry as the proprietor of the charges. In its capacity as legal chargee, Promontoria Chestnut appointed fixed charge receivers over the relevant properties in 2015, and since then the rental income from them has been paid to Engage Commercial. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Against this unpromising background, it is nevertheless Mr Hancock’s contention that there is a genuine triable issue about the title of Promontoria Chestnut to the underlying debts which he admittedly owes under the Facility Letters. The argument depends, for such force as it may have, upon the fact that the copy of the Deed of Assignment put in evidence by Promontoria Chestnut in the proceedings brought by Mr Hancock to set aside the Statutory Demand has been heavily redacted, and upon the explanation for those redactions provided by the solicitor with conduct of the matter on behalf of Promontoria Chestnut, Mr Timothy Cooper, who is a partner and member of Addleshaw Goddard LLP based in Edinburgh. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Although that is now the issue which divides the parties, it was not the basis upon which Mr Hancock first applied to set aside the Statutory Demand. He made the application, through solicitors then acting for him, in the County Court at Liverpool on 24 November 2016. Under rule 6.5(4) of the Insolvency Rules 1986, as then in force, the court hearing such an application may set aside the demand if (relevantly): </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In his first witness statement in support of the application, dated 24 November 2016, Mr Hancock set out the grounds upon which he then sought to rely. The grounds did not include any challenge to the right of Promontoria Chestnut to sue on the assigned debt arising from any alleged uncertainty about the scope or nature of the assignment, but rather contended (among other matters) that Mr Hancock was entitled to rely on various assurances which he said had been given to him by the Bank, and that his relationship with Promontoria Chestnut was unfair within the meaning of section 140B of the Consumer Credit Act 1974.  Mr Hancock exhibited to his statement a series of letters from Engage Commercial which provided statements of account since the assignment of the loans.  He complained about the way in which some of the figures had been calculated, but he appeared to accept that the assignment had taken place. He also referred, without comment, to Engage Commercial’s letter of 3 December 2014 which had given him notice of the assignment. </p>

None of the terms seem unduly onerous or unfair. It seems quite normal for overdraft facilities and commercial mortgages to be payable on demand; for there to be a right to appoint a receiver on default; and, as I have said, so far as the complaint about assignment is concerned, I cannot see that that can succeed because the respondent has acted responsibly, and there have been demand letters, appointment of a receiver, the first statutory demand which was withdrawn, and then this second statutory demand after a long default, so I do not accept that there can be an arguable case of unfairness in relation to the behaviour of the respondent.” </p>

New solicitors and counsel were instructed on his behalf, and seven proposed grounds of appeal were advanced. As Barling J later observed, in a careful and detailed judgment which he delivered on 1 August 2018 after two full days of argument on the permission application and related matters, Mr Hancock had now “jettisoned virtually all the points raised unsuccessfully in the court below”, and the set aside application had been recast “so as to raise a multiplicity of new arguments”: see [2018] EWHC 2934 (Ch) at [8]. The first of those grounds, and the only one for which Barling J granted permission, was that the District Judge was wrong to find that Promontoria Chestnut had proved title to the debts in the statutory demand: ibid, at [31]. This was a new argument, because, as Barling J rightly said, the assignment had been accepted as valid in the court below, and there had been no challenge to the title of Promontoria Chestnut to sue.  </p>

After dismissing a number of those points, at [44] to [54], including one which sought to contradict the evidence in Mr Hancock’s own witness statement that he had received notice of the assignment on 3 December 2014 from Engage Commercial, the judge identified three remaining issues relating to proof of title at [56] to [58]. Those issues were, in short: (a) whether the “relevant asset group” referred to in clause 2.1 of the Deed of Assignment included the loans to Mr Hancock; (b) the fact that, by virtue of clause 1.5 of the Deed, the assignment appeared to be expressly conditional upon the terms of a sale and purchase agreement </p>

I will need to return later to aspects of the judge’s reasoning, but, in short, he was satisfied that the debt which formed the subject matter of the statutory demand was not genuinely disputed on grounds which appeared to the court to be substantial, and that there was no genuine triable issue as to the entitlement of Promontoria Chestnut to sue on the loan facilities that were granted by the Bank to Mr Hancock: see the judgment at [30].  </p>

This is obviously a competitive process involving a whole variety of factors and considerations of which the key examples in general terms are pricing, legal structure, warranties and undertakings and tax. The proposals which are made as part of a bid are therefore commercially sensitive and confidential. If the details of a bid were to become public or fall into the hands of a competitor then this would be highly prejudicial to the chances of the bid becoming successful as other potential investors could immediately seek to tailor their bid to be more attractive in order to secure the acquisition ahead of rivals. Disclosure of the bid details could also be catastrophic for an investor’s prospects of successfully bidding for portfolios in the future as rival funds and investors in the market will have access to key information regarding the investor’s business model including details of pricing, legal and tax structures. It goes without saying that once a bid has been successful, it would be equally damaging and dangerous for a successful investor if the transactional documents were made public since the documents would reveal the details of the successful bid and assist rival investors in making their bids more competitive in respect of future offerings.” </p>

The point is that these are not mere cross-references to the SPA, but incorporations by reference of specific definitions and a specific clause (clause 1.2) contained in it. Those definitions, and that clause, therefore form an integral part of the Deed of Assignment itself, and without sight of them the reader is denied access both to an important part of the “dictionary” used by the drafter of the Deed of Assignment and to whatever guiding principles of construction were contained in clause 1.2 of the SPA. Furthermore, the very fact that clause 1.2 of the Deed of Assignment has not been redacted as irrelevant presumably implies that the incorporated clause 1.2 of the SPA may be relevant to the interpretation of the Deed of Assignment. </p>

Part II,  headed “Relevant Pool B Loan Assets”,  has again been left blank, apart from two passages in microfiche type which are illegible as they stand, but can be made legible by magnification. As magnified, they reveal, under the heading Project Chestnut, two groups of Pool B properties connected with Mr Hancock, including a list of 27 properties which comprises, as I understand it, all of those contained in his portfolio and charged to the Bank at the relevant time. Part III of the Schedule is headed “Relevant Pool B Loan Assets (Title Numbers)”, and has again been left blank apart from a sub-section headed “Pool B (Initial Transfer Asset Group)”, which then lists in an unredacted passage the title numbers which correspond to the properties listed under Mr Hancock’s name in Part II of the Schedule. For example, one of the title numbers given is MS410704, which is the title number of a property in Allerton Road, Liverpool, which Mr Hancock charged to the Bank on 12 September 2006.  </p>

Therefore, from Part II of Schedule 1 it is possible to identify the Facilities and related securities and guarantees etc which the Bank assigned. However, as I have explained above, the Deed of Assignment is the instrument for the transfer of title by the Bank to Promontoria to give effect to the sale of the Chestnut portfolio. Again, without waiving privilege or confidentiality, that sale was conditional upon payment of purchase consideration and other terms relating to the nature and quality of the Loan Assets included in the portfolio. In other words, Clause 1.5 underlines the fact that the Deed of Assignment is the relevant and distinct instrument of transfer of the Loan Assets, it transfers those Loan Assets which have been sold and subject to the terms of that sale… what Clause 1.5 certainly does not do is provide that the Bank’s rights in relation to the Relevant Pool B Loans Assets are not being assigned despite the fact that Clause 2.1 states that they are.” </p>

But the important point, for present purposes, is that Mr Cooper firmly negates any suggestion that there may have been a novation involving the Bank and a third party before the SPA was entered into. Furthermore, as he correctly points out in paragraph 45 of his statement, any such novation would have required the consent of Mr Hancock, who would have had to enter into a new agreement with the Bank and the third party if his contractual relationship with the Bank under the Facility Letters was to be replaced by a corresponding relationship with the third party .

Nor would it be plausible to suggest that any of the conditions which had to be satisfied before the assignment came into effect remained unsatisfied for any significant period of time. The notice of assignment would not have been given before the purchase price had been paid and the Effective Time had occurred, nor would the Bank have transferred the charges (as it did) to Promontoria Chestnut on the same day as the Deed of Assignment if it had not received payment for the loan assets transferred. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">That apart, I am unable to think of any good reason why the parties should have included the Relevant Pool B Loan Assets in Part II of the Schedule, or why the language of the assignment in clause 2.1 should have included all of the Bank’s rights in relation to those loan assets, if the effect of the second limb of the definition of Specified Loan Asset were somehow to exclude them from the scope of the assignment. In truth, it is Mr Hancock’s argument on this point which is founded upon speculation, and I find it telling that Mr Sims was unable to provide any plausible suggestion of how the redacted wording might have modified or materially qualified the Bank’s assignment to Promontoria Chestnut of its rights in respect of Mr Hancock’s loan portfolio. I remind myself that, on an application to set aside a statutory demand, the burden lies on the applicant to establish the existence of a substantial dispute. The creditor does not have to begin by proving its title to sue, as it would if it were seeking to recover the debt by a court action brought under Part 7 of the CPR.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Hancock’s next argument is based on clause 1.5 of the Deed of Assignment, which records the parties’ agreement that Part II of the Schedule is included “solely for the purpose of identifying the Relevant Pool B Loan Assets”, and that “such information is included… without prejudice to, and at all times subject to, the terms of the Sale and Purchase Agreement and any limitations contained therein”: see [35] above. This is admittedly a rather strange provision if read in isolation, and in ignorance of the terms of the SPA and its commercial background. However, it is clear from the language of the clause itself that (a) inclusion of a loan asset in Part II of the Schedule is intended to be for identification purposes only, and (b) such inclusion is subject to the terms of the SPA and any limitations contained in it. As to the first point, there is no dispute that Mr Hancock’s loans are correctly identified and included in Part II of the Schedule. As to the second point, there is nothing to suggest that the terms of the SPA had any relevant impact, by the date of the Statutory Demand, on the apparently clear assignment of title to Mr Hancock’s loans and the securities for them effected by clause 2.1(a) of the Deed. Furthermore, the effect of clause 1.5 needs to be assessed in the light of Mr Cooper’s evidence, including his observations in paragraph 40 of his first statement (quoted at [43] above). Viewed in that context, I remain wholly unconvinced that the clause gives rise to any substantial doubt about the title of Promontoria Chestnut to demand payment of the outstanding indebtedness from Mr Hancock in November 2016. The judge below came to essentially the same conclusion at [26] and [27] of his judgment, which I do not need to set out. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Hancock’s third argument relies on the alternative descriptions of Promontoria Chestnut in the Deed of Assignment as the “Novated Buyer” or the “Buyer”. It is clear from the former description, although not from any other provision visible in the redacted Deed, that there must at some prior stage have been a novation involving Promontoria Chestnut, which in turn (it is said) implies that there may have been at least one intermediate stage in the chain of title between the Bank and Promontoria Chestnut, with a corresponding possibility that title to Mr Hancock’s debts was disposed of separately before the Deed of Assignment was executed. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The answer to this argument is again provided, in my judgment, by Mr Cooper’s evidence. He explains that there was indeed an intermediate novation, whereby the sale originally agreed between NAB, the Bank and Holding was novated in such a way that Promontoria Chestnut stepped into the shoes of Holding. The commercial reasons for the novation remain obscure, particularly if (as I have suggested may have been the case) the novation formed part of the plan from the outset. Mr Sims speculated that there may have been an underlying tax planning motive, but there is no evidence to substantiate that suggestion, and even if there were, it would be irrelevant. What matters is the clear evidence of Mr Cooper that there was no prior disposal of Mr Hancock’s debts to a third party, such that they could not be included in the later assignment of the same debts to Promontoria Chestnut. This is hardly surprising, because if there had been any such intermediate assignment, it is impossible to understand how Mr Hancock’s debts could properly have been included in the Schedule to the Deed of Assignment, or how notice of their assignment could properly have been given by Promontoria Chestnut to Mr Hancock. I therefore conclude that the third argument, like the other two, has no real substance, and that there is nothing to displace the natural conclusion from the unredacted parts of the </p>

My conclusion on this point is again substantially the same as that of the judge, who said in [28] that “the short point is that there was no novation of the loan facilities between the Bank and [<span style="font-style:italic">Mr Hancock</span>]”, but, rather, any novation was of the SPA, with Promontoria Chestnut replacing Holding as the purchaser.  </p>

Promontoria Chestnut’s title to bring the possession proceedings depends on the same underlying transactions as its right to demand payment of Mr Hancock’s outstanding indebtedness under the Facility Letters, although the main focus in the possession proceedings is on the transfer of the legal charge over the Old Rectory from the Bank to Promontoria Chestnut. </p>

The four pages of the continuation sheet (in Form CS) had always been redacted in the versions which Mr Cooper had seem, with the exception of the details relating to Mr Hancock’s charges which were unredacted. Mr Cooper goes on to explain how he came to word his statements differently in January and November 2019. In short, he had not saved a copy of the version of the Form TR4 sent to him by Linklaters in January 2019 in either hard copy or electronic form, and when he came to make his statement in November 2019 in the possession proceedings he was provided by Linklaters with another version, which was obviously another copy of the same document, but differed in respect of some of the redactions made to the main part of the Form TR4. A further complication was that Mr Cooper had meanwhile exhibited a second, less redacted, version to his second statement in February 2019. All three versions, however, had appended to them a continuation sheet in precisely the same redacted form.  </p>

He also points out, correctly, that no complaint has ever been made by Mr Hancock about the redactions of details of third party charges in the continuation sheet to the Form TR4 (which was a single transfer dated 28 November 2014 by the Bank and NAB to Promontoria Chestnut of all the Legal Charges). </p>

While any error in evidence given to the court by a solicitor is to be regretted, and Mr Cooper was right to apologise for it, I do not accept that the error casts any doubt on his credibility, or that it has any relevance to the issue whether the Deed of Assignment effected a valid transfer of Mr Hancock’s loan portfolio from the Bank to Promontoria Chestnut. </p>

In general terms, it is elementary that a written contract has to be construed as a whole, in the light of admissible evidence of the relevant background facts (or surrounding circumstances) known to both parties at or before the time when the contract was made, but excluding evidence of prior negotiations: see <span style="text-decoration:underline">Wood v Capita Insurance Services Ltd</span> [2017] UKSC 24, [2017] AC 1173, at [8] to [15] per Lord Hodge JSC (with whose judgment the other members of the Supreme Court agreed).

Construction of a written document is a matter of law for the court, and questions of relevance require an evaluative judgment which it is for the court, not the solicitor of one of the parties, to perform. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In the present context, Mr Sims makes the submission in two alternative ways. His primary submission is that the court should simply refuse to engage with the construction of the Deed of Assignment in its redacted form, because the court is not in a position to construe it as a whole. His secondary submission, if the court thinks it appropriate to adopt a more pragmatic approach, is that the primary rule should be the starting point, but the court may in its discretion depart from it by devising a bespoke solution in order to meet the concerns of commercial confidentiality articulated by Mr Cooper. This could be done, for example by establishing a “confidentiality ring” within which the Deed of Assignment could be made available in its unredacted form to the court and a limited number of lawyers on each side. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It quickly became apparent in oral argument that the primary submission was unrealistic if taken as a rigid rule which admits of no exceptions. For example, Mr Sims readily accepted that there could be no reasonable objection to the redaction, on grounds of irrelevance, of details of third party loan assets and title numbers in the schedule to the Deed of Assignment. Those personal details were of no concern to Mr Hancock, their disclosure might arguably infringe the privacy of the third parties concerned, and it would be fanciful to suppose that they could have any bearing on the construction of the operative clauses of the Deed. Similarly, redaction of personal details of signatories and/or attesting witnesses would obviously be irrelevant to any issue of construction of the body of the Deed, although such details could be highly relevant if there were an issue concerning its due execution.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Redactions to the body of the Deed, however, are more problematical. I have much sympathy with the general thrust of the submission, which I take to be that where the court is called upon to resolve a question of construction of a contractual document, the document must in all normal circumstances be placed before the court as a whole, and it is not for the parties or their solicitors to make a pre-emptive judgment about what parts of the document are irrelevant. Sometimes, as with the details of third party transactions contained in the Schedule to the Deed of Assignment, it may be obvious that they can properly be omitted or blanked out; but even then a clear explanation must in my view be provided of the nature and extent of the omissions, and the reasons for making them.  In general, irrelevance alone cannot be a proper ground for redaction of part of a document which the court is asked to construe, and there must be some additional feature (such as protection of privacy or confidentiality, but no doubt there are others too) which can be relied upon to justify the redaction. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Considerations of confidentiality, by contrast, give rise to very different considerations. Seldom, if ever, can it be appropriate for one party unilaterally to redact provisions in a contractual document which the court is being asked to construe, merely on grounds of confidentiality. If it is obvious that the provisions in question would on any reasonable view be completely irrelevant to the issue of construction, and if the reasons for taking that view can be clearly and fully articulated by the solicitor acting for the party seeking the redaction, I am inclined to accept that the redaction may be defensible. But the reason why it would be defensible is that the provisions are clearly irrelevant, not that they are confidential.  Confidentiality alone cannot be a good reason for redacting an otherwise relevant provision in a contractual document which the court has to construe, and there are other ways in which problems of that nature can be addressed. I have already given the example of a confidentiality ring. Another solution, if the parties all agree, could be for the judge alone to see the document in its unredacted form. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">At this point, however, it is necessary to remember the procedural context in which the question of construction arises, as well as the very limited nature of that question. We are concerned with an application by Mr Hancock to set aside a statutory demand, where the burden lies on him to show the existence of a substantial dispute about the title of Promontoria Chestnut to demand payment from him. Mr Hancock admits that he owes the debts set out in the Statutory Demand, and he can no longer dispute that he received written notice in December 2014 of the assignment of those debts by the Bank to Promontoria Chestnut. Apart from his complaints about the redactions in the Deed of Assignment, Mr Hancock has been unable to produce any credible evidence casting doubt on the title of Promontoria Chestnut to the debts, and he would be fully protected by section 136(1) of the Law of Property Act 1925 if he paid the money demanded. This is not a case where Promontoria Chestnut has to prove its title to sue Mr Hancock, and even if it were, Promontoria Chestnut would only need to rely on the Deed of Assignment in order to establish the absolute  assignment of the relevant debts to it by the Bank. It is only in that limited sense that a question of construction of the Deed of Assignment arises.  Furthermore,  since Mr Hancock was not himself a party to the Deed, or to the SPA which preceded it, the question relates to a transaction between third parties rather than to an agreement under which Mr Hancock assumed rights and obligations of his own.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Viewed in that context, the redactions to the Deed of Assignment seem to me to fade into relative insignificance. For the reasons which I have already given, the unredacted parts of the Deed are in my judgment sufficient to show that title to Mr Hancock’s debts was indeed assigned by the Bank to Promontoria Chestnut. In a case of the present type, it would therefore be wrong to lay down any overriding principle based on the redactions to the Deed. I have little doubt that the redactions were far more extensive than they needed to be, and Mr Cooper’s evidence would have been of greater assistance to the court if he had condescended to greater detail about the specific reasons for particular redactions. He could, for example, have explained, without revealing any confidential information, why the second limb of the definition of “Specified Loan Asset” was redacted, and why it had no impact on the generality of the first limb of the definition. Similarly, he could, and in my view should, have provided a general explanation of the contents of clauses 3 to 6 of the Deed, explaining why they were considered confidential, and why they were on any view irrelevant to the question of title to Mr Hancock’s loans. Furthermore, Mr Cooper should clearly in my view have disclosed the relevant parts of the SPA which were incorporated by reference. In a different context, these criticisms, and others of a similar nature, might arguably have precluded Promontoria Chestnut from placing reliance on the Deed of Assignment in the redacted form which we have seen. In the present context, however, I am satisfied that the redactions have not caused any injustice to Mr Hancock, and the doubts which he has sought to raise about Promontoria Chestnut’s title to demand payment from him are unfounded. </p>

As the title of the case suggests, it concerned another company in the Promontoria/Cerberus group, which I will call Promontoria Oak. That company brought possession proceedings against the defendants, Mr and Mrs Emanuel, who owned a residential property in Cornwall and had charged it to Clydesdale Bank as security for business loans. Promontoria Oak claimed as the assignee of Clydesdale Bank, relying upon a Deed of Assignment dated 16 September 2016 (“the 2016 </p>

As in the present case, Promontoria Oak put in evidence a significantly redacted version of the 2016 Assignment, alleging that the redactions contained commercially sensitive material which had no bearing upon the existence and effectiveness of the assignment. Again as in the present case, written notice of the assignment was given to the Emanuels, by a letter from Clydesdale Bank also dated 16 September 2016. An earlier letter from Clydesdale Bank to the Emanuels, in June 2016, had informed them that there would be an assignment to a different company in the Cerberus group, Promontoria Holding 170 BV, and that the transfer was expected to take place on 16 September 2016. The subsequent letter of that date informed the Emanuels that Promontoria Oak was successor in title to the holding company, but no explanation was given of the legal process by which this had occurred.  </p>

The Emanuels then appealed to the High Court, and their appeal was heard by Marcus Smith J on 3 December 2019. By the date of the hearing, the property had been sold under protest by the Emanuels and without prejudice to their arguments on the appeal. They had permission to pursue three grounds of appeal, the first of which was that the Recorder had been wrong to admit the redacted version of the 2016 Assignment into evidence. In the alternative, the second ground was that he had been wrong to conclude that the redacted deed proved title, while the third ground was that Promontoria Oak had adduced insufficient evidence to prove its chain of title.  </p>

I do not propose to review the judge’s reasoning in this judgment, because we were told that there is a pending application by Promontoria Oak for permission to appeal to this court which I would not wish in any way to influence. I would, however, draw attention to a striking feature of the judge’s process of reasoning. He began by considering grounds 2 and 3 together, and rejected them on the basis that the judge had clearly been entitled, on the evidence adduced before him, to reach the conclusion which he did: see the judgment at [33] to [36].

Promontoria Oak had to establish its title to sue, as the claimant in Part 55 proceedings for possession and a money judgment. By contrast, Mr Hancock is seeking to set aside a statutory demand, and the burden is on him to show the existence of a substantial dispute. Furthermore, there was no evidence from Promontoria Oak’s solicitors to explain the commercial background to the 2016 Assignment, and the procedure by which an intended assignment to a Dutch holding company in the Cerberus group was replaced by an assignment to a Promontoria company established in Ireland. Presumably, as in the present case, there was a novation of the original agreement, but in the absence of an explanation that critical step in the history was left wholly obscure. Nor was there any evidence from a solicitor such as Mr Cooper giving reasons for at least the majority of the redactions, and (importantly) informing the court that he had inspected an unredacted version of the assignment and was therefore able to give the court assurances of the kind which I have described. Finally, the parties to the litigation and the assignment relied upon in the two cases were of course different, although it is fair to say that the redactions appear from the judgment of Marcus Smith J to have been broadly similar to those in the present case.  </p>

Marcus Smith J gave his reasons for reaching this further conclusion in a subsequent reserved judgment (<span style="text-decoration:underline">Emanuel II</span>) which he handed down on 19 March 2020.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">These submissions have a superficial attraction, but as I have already indicated I can only accept them to a very limited extent. There is in my judgment a clear distinction between the rules which apply when a party is giving disclosure of documents, in the ordinary course of litigation, and the process of construction which a court has to embark upon when considering the meaning or legal effect of a document. Since the process of construction requires the document as a whole to be considered, the starting point must always be that the entire document should be made available to the court, and any redactions to it on  grounds of irrelevance should either be forbidden or, if permitted at all, convincingly justified and kept to an absolute minimum.  Except in the clearest of cases, the question of relevance to the process of construction is one that the court should be left to decide for itself. Certification by a solicitor provides an important safeguard, but where the question is one of the correct interpretation of a written document, it is not normally appropriate for a solicitor, however experienced, to pre-judge which parts of the document the court may find useful in performing its task, except perhaps in relation to material that on no reasonable view could have any bearing on the exercise. In all normal cases, the entire document should be placed before the court; and if, exceptionally, any redactions are made, they should be fully explained and justified by the party making the redaction, with sufficient particularity for the court to be able to rule on the need for the redaction if it is challenged. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I have so far spoken only of redaction for irrelevance. Redaction on the grounds of confidentiality alone is a very different matter, and as at present advised I find it hard to see how it could ever be justified where the confidential material forms a relevant part of the document which the court is asked to construe. As I have already said, there are other ways of dealing with problems of confidentiality, such as the use of confidentiality rings which have become a familiar feature of competition and intellectual property cases.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In many contexts, application of the criteria which I have outlined above might well (I say no more) lead to the conclusion that redactions similar to those in the present case were so extensive, and of such a nature, that the court could not safely resolve an issue of construction of the document in question, even if the redactions were accompanied by explanatory evidence and assurances of the kind  given by Mr Cooper. In the particular context of the present case, however, I have concluded, for the reasons already given, that the redactions cannot, without more, enable Mr Hancock to make good his challenge to the Statutory Demand. As so often, context is everything, and sweeping generalisations are to be avoided. I will therefore content myself with saying that, in most circumstances, it is unlikely to be helpful to draw an analogy between the established principles which apply in this jurisdiction to the redaction of documents on disclosure in civil proceedings, on the one hand, and the particular problems posed by redaction of a document which the court is being asked to construe, on the other hand. </p>

In short, the argument is that, regardless of the Deed of Assignment, Promontoria Chestnut has good title to sue Mr Hancock for the debts set out in the Statutory Demand because it has been duly registered at HM Land Registry as proprietor of the Legal Charges granted by Mr Hancock to the Bank as security for his borrowing. The charges contained covenants to repay the sums owed under the Facility Letters, and in the absence of a contrary stipulation by the Bank the benefit of those covenants was transferred together with the charges. Reliance is placed on section 114(1)(a) of the Law of Property Act 1925 and section 58 of the Land Registration Act 2002. </p>

The issue may well arise for decision if permission to appeal is granted in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Emanuel II</span>, and for that reason alone it would be undesirable for us to embark upon an obiter examination of the topic. The argument also faces the difficulty that no reliance was placed upon it in the Statutory Demand, where Promontoria Chestnut’s title to sue was unambiguously said to arise from the Deed of Assignment alone. </p>
