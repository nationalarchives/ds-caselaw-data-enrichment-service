On 11 March 2016 he pleaded guilty to two counts of sexual assault and was subsequently sentenced to four years imprisonment.  He was due to be released on licence, on 25 December 2017.

He claimed he had been sexually abused from an early age and held as a captive sex slave for six years.  On 2 October 2018 the Respondent rejected the asylum claim and made a deportation order.  By then he had been in immigration detention for over nine months. </p>

These were fully analysed by the judge in paragraphs 18 to 30 and 33 to 41 of the judgment.  The last DCPR took place on 4 January 2019, 12 days before the hearing below.  The judge commented that, at more than one point, detention was in fact prolonged further than the period authorised in the latest extant DCPR. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Over the ensuing months, as the judge outlines, successive decisions were taken to authorise further detention, on the basis that removal could be effected in a reasonable timescale.  The Appellant had made a failed application for bail in January.  It seems that the Appellant first sought Schedule 10 accommodation (accommodation pursuant to paragraph 9 of Schedule 10 to the Immigration Act 2016, suitable for an individual with the Appellant’s record and risk) on 5 April 2018, and again in May 2018 and in ensuing months.  At that point, and beyond, the Appellant’s asylum claim had not been resolved. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">A further application for bail was refused in the First-tier Tribunal on 23 May 2018, although the Tribunal indicated the balance of factors would likely change if there was further delay with the asylum decision.  In a further hearing on 3 July 2018, although bail was refused, First-tier Tribunal Judge Barber expressed concern at the delay in the case. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">A DCPR took place on 7 July 2018.  As the judge found, detention was not authorised until 3 August2018, and thus there was a further period of unauthorised detention.  On 30 July 2018, a case progression panel concluded that “removal within a reasonable time … may not be possible” [judgment, paragraph 25].  Further detention was nevertheless authorised on 3 August 2018.  However, on 15 August 2018 the First-tier Tribunal ordered that the Appellant should be released on bail subject to provision of Schedule 10 support.  This was clearly a watershed in the case. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">As I have indicated, detention was thereafter repeatedly authorised.  The question of provision of accommodation was analysed by the judge, once more impeccably, in paragraphs 42 to 47 of the judgment below.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">After consideration of the law, and the policy of the Respondent, as affecting detention and the provisions of accommodation, the judge reached his conclusions on the lawfulness of detention.

	      </a>principles, though approved as such by the Supreme Court, are not the equivalent of statutory rules, a breach of which is enough to found a claim in damages.  As I understand them, they are no more than applications of two elementary propositions of English law: first, that compulsory detention must be properly justified, and, secondly, that statutory powers must be used for the purposes for which they are given.  To found a claim in damages for wrongful detention, it is not enough that, in retrospect, some part of the statutory process is shown to have taken longer than it should have done.  There is a dividing-line between mere administrative failing and unreasonableness amounting to illegality.  Even if that line has been crossed, it is necessary for the claimant to show a specific period during which, but for the failure, he would no longer have been detained." </p>

The Claimant continues to pose a significant risk of absconding and re-offending which can only be satisfactorily addressed by rigorous bail conditions.  Detention pending release on bail is, in principle, lawful, even though it is now clear that removal will not take place within a reasonable period of time.  That is because the Secretary of State no longer intends to detain pending removal, but only until appropriate accommodation can be secured. </p>

	      </a>to detain individuals is not subject to any express limitation of time, I am quite satisfied that it is subject to limitations.  First of all, it can only authorise detention if the individual is being detained in one case pending the making of a deportation order and, in the other case, pending his removal. It cannot be used for any other purpose.  Secondly, as the power is given in order to enable the machinery of deportation to be carried out, I regard the power of detention as being impliedly limited to a period which is reasonably necessary for that purpose.  The period which is reasonable will depend upon the circumstances of the particular case.  What is more, if there is a situation where it is apparent to the Secretary of State that he is not going to be able to operate the machinery provided in the Act for removing persons who are intended to be deported within a reasonable period, it seems to me that it would be wrong for the Secretary of State to seek to exercise his power of detention. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.00in">“60.  I have already expressed my opinion that the test for the lawfulness of a period of detention is one of reasonableness.  The obligation of the Secretary of State is to cease detention when it becomes clear that detention is no longer required to effect removal but, in my view, common sense demands that a short period of grace is required for the decision-making process to take place which <span style="font-style:italic;color:#212121">may</span> include a decision as to the management of the detainee on release.  First, there is, I think, a distinction between cases in which it is clear that removal directions will not be re-set (e.g. upon grant of ILR) and those in which the decision whether to re-set removal directions depends upon the outcome of proceedings (as in the present case). The Secretary of State will in the latter cases be concerned to ensure that she is kept aware of the whereabouts of the released detainee.  That may require administrative arrangements for appropriate accommodation to be made available.  I do not think that the Secretary of State is bound to release without regard to a residual risk of absconding (see, for example, <span style="font-style:italic">R (Wang) v SSHD</span> [2009] EWHC 1578 (Admin)).  Secondly, I do not consider, as Mr Husain argues, that the Secretary of State's assumption of responsibility for the welfare of these two children in detention can lightly be segregated from a responsibility to take reasonable steps to ensure that they are properly accommodated on release. There is no policy of the Secretary of State which requires case workers to turn detainees out of a detention centre without first ensuring that they can survive.  On the contrary, it is the policy of the Secretary of State (EIG 55.6.3) that detention may be necessary “whilst alternative arrangements are made” for the detainee's care (provided, of course, that the purpose of detention was to effect removal). It is not difficult to envisage circumstances in which the Secretary of State could be said to be acting in dereliction of the duty undertaken by the act of detention if she took no action but to release the detained person immediately removal within a reasonable period became, as a matter of fact, not possible. </p>

For many months the Respondent had known the Appellant should have been released albeit under strict conditions.  For whatever reason, those arrangements had fallen away and the necessary steps had not been taken.  It is clear from the judgment that a proper understanding of these difficulties had brought the judge to the conclusion that detention up to the date of the hearing was lawful.  But the repeated failure to arrange release into secure conditions are relevant to what further period can properly be regarded as lawful.  In this case it is also relevant that, at the time of the trial, the Respondent still had produced no evidence as to how the Appellant might safely be released.  There were still no arrangements available after some 14 months of detention.  </p>

That is a decision for the Respondent and her officials.  There can be no question that it is proper for officials to avoid such a decision until compelled to release by the courts. </p>
