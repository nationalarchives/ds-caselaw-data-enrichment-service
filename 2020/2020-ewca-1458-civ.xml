That review must be carried out and a decision must be notified to the applicant within certain regulatory time limits or “within such longer period as [the applicant] and the reviewer may agree in writing”: ss. 202(4), 203(3) and (4) and reg. 9(1) of The Homelessness (Review Procedure etc.) Regulations 2018 (made by the Secretary of State pursuant to powers conferred by the Act.) </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In this case, Ms Stanley brought appeals to the County Court against both an original s.184 decision, made adversely to her, and also against the s.202 review decision that was made by the reviewer on a date which she contends was outside the permitted time limits. Judge Bloom struck out her appeal against the s.184 decision and dismissed her appeal against the s. 202 decision. She held that Ms Stanley and the reviewer had agreed an extension to the relevant time limit and that, in any event, having brought an appeal against the review decision, Ms Stanley had waived any right to object to the timing of that decision and/or had “validated” it. Ms Stanley now appeals to this court against the judge’s order striking out her appeal against the s. 184 order, by permission granted by Asplin LJ by her order of 17 August 2020. She does not appeal against the dismissal of her appeal against the review decision. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Two points arise. The first point is whether Ms Stanley (through her solicitors) and the reviewer agreed in writing that notice of her requested review decision could be given within a longer period than that provided by the ordinary application of reg. 9. The second point is whether, in any event, having brought an appeal against the review decision that was ultimately made by the reviewer, Ms Stanley had waived objection to the review decision or otherwise had elected to pursue the appeal against the review in place of her appeal against the first decision. Those two points have been argued by Mr Vanhegan and Ms McGibbon for Ms Stanley and Mr Lane and Mr Calzavara for the Council. I am grateful to them for their written and oral submissions.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">While the appeal does give rise to questions of law as to the application of reg. 9 to the facts of this case, cases of this type almost invariably fall to be decided largely upon the precise of facts of each of them. So, it is the facts that I address first. They are uncontroversial and much depends upon the proper understanding of exchanges of correspondence between Ms Stanley’s solicitors and the Council’s reviewing officer, Mr David Trewick, and upon the circumstances surrounding the presentation of the two appeals. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The Council’s s.184 decision was made by letter to Ms Stanley of 1 July 2019. As was correctly explained to Ms Stanley in that letter, under the terms of the Act when an application is made to an authority which is satisfied that the applicant is homeless and eligible for assistance, it must take reasonable steps to help the applicant to secure that suitable accommodation becomes available for their occupation and, if unsuccessful, reach a final decision on the application. For a full housing duty to subsist the authority has to be satisfied that the applicant is homeless, or threatened with homelessness, whether he/she is “eligible for assistance” and, if so, whether he/she is in “priority need”; further, the applicant must not be “intentionally homeless”. In this case, the Council decided that Ms Stanley was “intentionally homeless” by failing to pay rent, which was affordable to her, under her tenancy of her previous property. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">By e-mail of 19 July 2019, Ms Stanley’s solicitors requested a review of the Council’s decision. By letter of 31 July 2019, Ms Stanley was informed of the procedure for the review. The period for the notification of the decision, specified in reg. 9, was 8 weeks from the date of the request for review, in this case by 13 September 2019.  She was entitled to make representations (reg. 5) and was informed that she should do so within 21 days (here, by 21 August 2019). By e-mail of 20 August, the solicitors asked for an extension to 27 August. Mr Trewick responded immediately that this would be agreed so long as an extension for the review decision could also be agreed. The solicitors readily agreed, on the same day, to a similar extension to the time for notification of the review decision by 7 days, i.e. to 20 September 2019. By letter dated 27 August 2019, possibly only sent by an e-mail of 1038 hrs on 28 August 2019, representations were made in support of the review by Ms Stanley’s solicitors. By e-mail of 1151 hrs on that day, Mr Trewick replied simply, “Thank you”. </p>

By the time of this appeal, they had already issued the section 184 appeal and they had activated the section 204(1)(b) provisions. They then chose to issue an appeal under section 204(1)(a). I am satisfied that was a validation of the section 202 decision. They had an election. They could have said they were not going to proceed under section 204(1)(a) as they already had a valid appeal under section 204(1)(b). </p>

If they choose to appeal the section 202 decision that is a validation of the decision. In my view, this conclusion is in line with both <span style="font-style:italic">Muloko</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Jobe</span>. If they choose not to appeal the section 202 decision, that is because they have a choice. If they are confident that the review is out of time, then they do not need to appeal it, they proceed by appealing the section 184. It is a matter for the appellant to decide whether it is a clear case or not. In some cases, if there is an ambivalence, it may well be that the sensible course of action for an appellant is to appeal the section 202 rather than lose their rights. But it is a risk that they have to take. In my view that is what section 204 envisages, not that both routes are proceeded under. As Mr Lane says, the appellant, of course, could have made his position clear by extending time or indeed, as I have said, on 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September making it clear that there was no extension of time and that the final date was 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September. But they cannot, in my view, do what they have done and appeal under both section 204(1)(a) and (1)(b) and I am satisfied that by issuing the appeal against the s202 decision, they have made an election, and the section 202 is validated by that election.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Vanhegan’s succinct submission on this point was this. Any extension in time in this case was no more than general and that does not satisfy the requirements of reg. 9 on its proper construction. What is required, he said, is agreement on extension to a specific date. He said that this is so for a number of reasons. First, the language of reg. 9 speaks of the relevant period of time for notification as being in a specific period of weeks or such longer period as is agreed; that implies a period of specific length, either in weeks or to an alternative specific date, for an agreed extension. Secondly, such a specific date is required because an appeal can only be brought against the decision under s.184 within 21 days of the date on which the review should have been notified; without a specified date it is impossible to know when an appeal must be brought. Thirdly, a date is needed because otherwise the authority is unable to comply with its duty (under reg. 5(3)(c)) to inform the applicant of the review procedure, which must include the period within which he/she will be informed of the decision. </p>

The “Minded To” letter proposed a date for representations (24 September) that was outside the previously agreed date for notification of the decision (20 September). Ms Stanley’s solicitors did not merely agree to that, they also asked for an additional 24 hours (25 September). Then on 26 September they sent the representations to Mr Trewick saying expressly that they looked forward to receipt of the review decision “shortly”. They got the decision </p>

This is still an extension for an agreed period, even if its precise end is not immediately known. This may well be a sensible course for parties to take in a number of situations, e.g. where negotiations are being conducted between them or information is being collected from outside sources, such as medical opinions on suitability of particular accommodation. I see no reason why, in such circumstances, the Minister should be saying in the regulations that an applicant could not give the authority an extension until it was put upon notice that further time will not be allowed. A sensible applicant in such a situation, after an expiry of time, might say that he/she now wanted the decision within (say) 7 days. An unreasonable applicant might say, “I’ve lost patience; I want your decision today”. In either case, either the review would be forthcoming as demanded or not. If not, the applicant could initiate an appeal to the County Court because he/she had not received a decision. Nothing would be lost.  </p>

If the letter making further representations on 26 September was truly intended to be “without prejudice” to an argument that any review decision would be out of time, it did not say so, and if that was intended “<span style="font-style:italic">sub silentio</span>”, it would have been simply deceptive, which it is not suggested that it was.

Nothing is said in the Act to suggest that the obligation to review lapses upon expiry of the time, under the regulations, within which it is required to be provided.

The appeal was brought after the authority had not produced the review decision requested by her within the prescribed time. A review decision was then sent to the applicant. She considered that her appeal against the original decision had become academic and sought its dismissal with an order for costs against the authority. Judge Luba QC dismissed the appeal as asked but he declined to make the costs order. In the brief report, he is said to have found that the late decision on review was not a decision under s.202 at all. It was held that the applicant was entitled to “elect” whether or not to validate the decision notified out of time. If she did so, she could then appeal against that decision, as had happened in <span style="font-style:italic">Jobe</span>. If she did not so elect, then she was entitled to pursue an appeal against the original decision. It was said that such a course could have a number of potential benefits, if an appeal were successful: there would be chance of a review against a new decision by a different officer and the chance to make new submissions and advance fresh evidence; there would be delay, with a concomitant possibility of improvement in her position; and the interim accommodation duty under s.188(1) of the Act would continue.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In the passage quoted above from the judgment of Chadwick LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Bellamy</span>, the learned Lord Justice expressed the view that the County Court judge had been correct to treat the appeal before him as being against the later review decision of 15 November 2004; it was a route to dealing with the case on its merits and on an up-todate basis. This and the wording of s.204, to which Chadwick LJ and Judge Monty QC in <span style="font-style:italic">Castro</span> referred, indicate that once the authority fails to notify a review decision in time, but produces a late review decision, the applicant has a choice of an appeal against the original decision or the review decision but not both. If he/she does appeal against both, as Judge Clarke said in <span style="font-style:italic">Ngnoguem</span>, the first appeal will remain an appeal before the County Court, but the review decision will not be a nullity; unless there is some distinct factor giving rise to a legitimate interest in pursuing a quashing of the </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I also think that Judge Clarke was correct to say in <span style="font-style:italic">Ngnoguem</span> that, as at the date of the review decision, that decision replaced the original decision of the authority and there would be no legitimate interest in doing other than addressing such legal challenge as there might be to what was decided on the review.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I do not see that seeking the quashing of the original decision simply in the speculative hope of a more favourable decision from a different officer would be legitimate in the relevant sense. Nor would the mere hope of fresh evidence be of use, provided the reviewing officer had had all the material evidence. A desire to preserve the interim housing duty under s.188 would seem to be simply an attempt to play the system which is not what the public housing system is for. In the present case, there was nothing on the facts advanced to suggest that the original decision maker or the reviewing officer had not had all necessary material before them nor was there advanced any other distinct advantage for Ms Stanley of a determination of the appeal against the first decision. </p>
