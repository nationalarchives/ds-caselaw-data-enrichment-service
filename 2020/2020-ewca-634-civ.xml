The case was moved to the Older Live Cases Unit under the Legacy criteria. Both the appellant and his mother were given permission to work in 2015. On 26 January 2016, the respondent sent a Further Submissions Decision to the appellant’s mother concluding that she did not qualify for leave on any basis. No direct mention was made of the appellant as a dependant. On 8 February 2016, the appellant’s mother was granted Discretionary Leave to Remain in the UK until 26 July 2018 but he was not granted leave in line with his mother.  </p>

That claim was refused and certified with no in-country right of appeal. He issued Judicial Review proceedings and on 7 August 2017, Upper Tribunal Judge Kekić granted permission on the grounds, inter alia, that it was arguable that, given the wording of the respondent’s policy on discretionary leave, the appellant should have been treated as a dependant when his mother’s further submissions were considered, even though he was 18 at the time. The respondent agreed to reconsider the decision and the application was again refused on 27 April 2018. It is that decision which was the subject of the appeal with which we are concerned. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">At the outset of the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal, counsel for the appellant, Mr Andrew Gilbert (who also appeared before this Court) told the judge that the asylum claim was not being pursued and the appeal would proceed on the basis of Article 8 only, both within and outside the Immigration Rules. The First-tier Tribunal judge considered first the claim under paragraph 276ADE. She noted at [25] that applicants of 18 and above who have lived in the UK for less than 20 years must show that there would be very significant obstacles to their integration into the country to which they are to be sent. Having considered the evidence in detail, the judge concluded at [35] that there were no very significant obstacles to the appellant’s integration into Sri Lanka so he did not meet the requirements for leave to remain on the grounds of private life in the UK in paragraph 276ADE. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The judge turned to consider the Article 8 claim outside the Rules. She noted that the appellant had been in a relationship with Dhiviya Thangabelu but was no longer because her father had sent her abroad when he became aware the appellant had no status in the UK. There had been no contact since.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The judge also noted at [38] that Mrs Chandran now had limited leave to remain until 14 June 2021. At [39] the judge said that she was prepared to accept the appellant was more than normally emotionally dependent on his mother and they had a family life which engaged Article 8. At [41] the judge said the respondent’s decision furthered the legitimate aim of proper and effective immigration control and that, for the decision to be disproportionate, the consequences for the appellant needed to be more than mere hardship or difficulty. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">At [42] the judge made an important finding that there was no reason why Mrs Chandran could not accompany her son to Sri Lanka, if he was required to return there. The effect of the rejection of her asylum claim is that she was merely an economic refugee. She had lived in Sri Lanka until she was 35 and worked as a housemaid which she could utilise to find employment. There was no basis for a finding that family life could not reasonably be pursued in Sri Lanka.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The judge said that she was aware of what UTJ Kekić had said about it being arguable that on this wording the appellant should have been treated as a dependant when his mother’s further submissions were considered, even though he was 18 at the time.

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.00in;text-indent:0.00in">“I consider that the dependant in question needs to be under the age of 18 as at the date that the further submissions are lodged. The second paragraph of 3.8 refers to “the further submissions” not “any further submissions” and so must relate to the further submissions alluded to in the first paragraph i.e. those submitted when the dependant was under 18. When Mrs Chandran’s further submissions were lodged on 28 August 2008…her son had already attained the age of majority. In my judgment the appellant did not fall within the ambit of the respondent’s policy.” </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The judge then went on to consider the question of delay. On behalf of the appellant it was submitted that the seven-year delay in considering the further submissions had permitted the appellant to develop deeper ties both in the UK and to his mother and further distanced him from Sri Lanka. This mitigated against the weight to be attached to immigration control. Mr Gilbert for the appellant relied upon <span style="font-style:italic">Jeunesse v Netherlands</span> (2015) 60 EHHR 17.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">At [50] the judge said delay is not determinative and is merely a relevant factor, citing the decisions of this Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Strbac v SSD</span> [2005] EWCA Civ 848 and <span style="font-style:italic">S, H &amp; Q v SSHD</span> [2009] EWCA Civ 142, noting that in the latter case the Court found that arguments based on “unfairness” based on administrative delay did not give jurisdiction to intervene. The initial asylum claim was dealt with expeditiously in 2007 and when it was refused, the appellant had no justification in regarding himself as settled in the UK. The judge said there was some merit in the argument that the respondent showed acquiescence in the appellant remaining in the UK when he was given permission to work in 2015, but this was limited to shortage occupations. UTJ Kekić had referred to absence of enforcement action when he was seen by an immigration officer in 2009, but there was no evidence of this and in her witness statement Mrs Chandran said she could not remember the incident. The judge concluded that the appellant had not suffered any specific detriment in consequence of the delay in making a decision on his mother’s application, even assuming he believed himself to be a dependant on that application. Whilst he had entered a relationship, that was in full knowledge that his immigration status was precarious. That relationship had been over for some time and the appellant had no especially strong links of the kind that would create relationships that are hard to disrupt.  </p>

He also submitted that if 3.8 was ambiguous it should be resolved in favour of the appellant. In relation to delay the First-tier judge had not taken full account of it in the proportionality exercise and had been wrong to say dismissively that delay was not determinative and only a relevant factor.  </p>

The former expressly refers to the latter.  Critically, the latter says expressly in paragraph 1.1 that it must be read in conjunction with the former.  So they were clearly intended to be read together. The penultimate sentence of 3.7 (now 3.8) in the former: “Where a minor child was treated as a dependant on the initial asylum claim but turns 18 before further submissions are submitted, they will need to make a first protection claim or apply for leave to remain in their own right”, makes it clear beyond argument that the construction placed on the second paragraph of the latter by the First-tier judge was correct. There is no doubt or ambiguity. If, at the time that the further submissions are submitted, the former dependant has turned 18 (as was the case here since the appellant was 18 when his mother’s further submissions were submitted on 28 August 2008), the former dependant must make his or her own application in their own right. </p>

She considered the question of whether the delay had caused any detriment to the appellant, making a finding at [50] that it had not, which is not open to challenge on appeal. Given the other findings of fact she made, which again are not open to challenge on appeal, this was always a weak case under Article 8 and the delay did not tilt the balance in the appellant’s favour. The judge carried out a careful balancing exercise and the fact that the appellant may disagree with it is not the basis for a successful appeal. This ground of appeal is also dismissed.  </p>
