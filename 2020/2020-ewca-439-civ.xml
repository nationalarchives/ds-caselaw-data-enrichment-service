The judge dismissed the Appellant’s appeal from the decision of 7 August 2018 of the Review Officer (“RO”) of the London Borough of Tower Hamlets (“the Respondent”), affirming the decision of the Respondent’s Housing Officer of 12 December 2017. The housing officer had refused the Appellant’s application for assistance under Part VII of the Housing Act 1996 (“the Act”) on the ground that she had rendered herself homeless intentionally. </p>

In such cases, there is intentional homelessness, but it is not reasonable for him or her to continue occupation. On the other hand, improper non-payment of rent, leading to eviction, is treated as intentional homelessness, but it becomes more difficult to assess the reasonableness or otherwise of hypothetical continued occupation in such a case where there is also some evidence of domestic violence before/after eviction and before the decisions on housing assistance are taken by the housing authority and/or by an RO.  </p>

The Appellant and C had married in 2000. The marriage broke down in 2015; there had been some domestic violence at that stage and C vacated the property. C went for a time to the United States, but he returned not long afterwards. On 5 May 2015 he returned to the property and barricaded himself in with the children. The police were called; they forced entry and removed C from the premises. A non-molestation order (“the First NM Order”) was made against C on 6 May 2015 for a period of 12 months. The order prohibited C from using or threatening unlawful violence towards the Appellant or coming within 100 metres of the premises or the school/nursery which the children attended; he was also restrained from communicating with the Appellant by letter, text message or otherwise, except through solicitors. The order was varied in August 2015 to permit visits to the school, within certain limited parameters. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The review decision indicates that the Appellant first approached the Respondent’s housing department in April 2016, during the currency of the First NM Order, saying that she was in arrears with her rent owing to a change in her housing benefit. She had received notice from the landlord requiring her to leave the property for failure to pay the rent. A possession order was made on 5 August 2016 to take effect on 2 September 2016; the order was executed on 3 November 2016. She had informed the Respondent on 5 September that she intended to stay in the property until forced to leave by bailiffs. It seems that at that stage there was no indication that she would leave because of domestic violence and that she was attempting to make a payment arrangement with the landlord. In a note dated 3/11/2016 in the Respondent’s housing file it is stated that the Appellant had mentioned the First NM Order, but with the comment that she was “… not in fear now … D[omestic] V[iolence] was in Tower Hamlets, however not in fear …”. She was given temporary accommodation pending enquiries. </p>

C was further restrained (for a period of 12 months) from threatening and abusing the Appellant and was ordered not to go within 100 metres of the children’s schools without prior written invitation from the school authorities. </p>

C was interviewed by the police, but the Crown Prosecution Service declined to charge “as it was not in the public interest”. It seems that shortly thereafter C sought to appeal against the Second NM Order. Permission to appeal was refused by a Circuit Judge on 5 July 2017, at a hearing which C did not attend, and a new order (“the Third NM Order”) was made in essentially similar terms to the previous one. This third order was also to last for 12 months. </p>

It is clear that the focus of the decision was whether the Appellant had intentionally given up an affordable property by not applying her resources properly to ensure that the rent was paid. Any question of domestic violence centred upon whether this had rendered her less able to manage her affairs, including payment of her rent, rather than any question of whether violence made it unreasonable for her to have continued in occupation of the old property. The nine-page decision letter said this about C’s behaviour and the court orders:  </p>

The arguments raised by the Appellant at that stage again centred on the issue of affordability of the old property. Domestic violence was only raised as having relevance to the Appellant’s mental state at the time when she fell into rent arrears. It was not being suggested that the prospect of further violence had rendered it unreasonable for her to continue to occupy the premises.

Naturally, the section directs the reader to the time when the act is done or is not done which results in the applicant leaving the premises. One is answering the same question when applying the deeming provision in s.177.

On the facts, there had been violence in 2015 and the First NM Order had then been made; there was no evidence of violence (even in the necessarily broad sense of that word) between that date and the eviction. Further, the Appellant had told the authority expressly, at that very date in November 2016, that she was not in fear of violence. Indeed, she had been endeavouring to secure with the landlord a negotiated basis on which she could stay where she was. At that date, therefore, it would have been reasonable for her to continue to occupy the old property. </p>

She had knowledge of the Second and Third NM Orders. She discovered the breach alleged to have occurred in May 2017, concerning attendance at the school and the decision of the CPS not to prosecute. She heard about the Appellant’s complaint of a further breach in January 2018 and was told that the Appellant had failed to report that matter at the police station as advised. She was told by the police officer responsible that there was always a risk from C but that it was not possible to assess the level of the risk either at the old property or at the temporary accommodation provided by the Respondent. The Island Advice Centre in its last letter referred to other incidents, but without any specific details or dates. The only specifics mentioned were those of May 2017 and January 2018 relating to C’s attendance at the school, the second of which had not been pursued by the Appellant herself. In considering the arguments raised by Island Advice, the RO saw that they had understood that the incident of May 2015 had occurred in May 2017. This error was pointed out in the review decision letter. </p>

She was not confining herself solely to incidents that might occur physically <span style="font-style:italic">at the old property</span>. Any such impression is countered by the extent of her enquiries with the police and the contents of the “minded to” letter of 19 July 2018. She was also having proper regard to the nature of the events which were said to have occurred and the absence of evidence of further significant breaches of the NM Orders pursued by the Appellant. That is not to ignore the complaints actually made about the two attendances by C at the school. </p>

The question of how much weight is to be attached to particular elements of the evidence was for the Respondent to decide. Absent an error of principle or logic in reaching that evaluative decision, it cannot be said that the review decision as a whole was unlawful. It was for the Respondent to assess the case for review that had been presented to it and it did address the specific submissions made by Island Advice in its letter of 3 August 2018, and the other materials, in the final decision letter itself. </p>

However, it is the RO’s decision on this latter question that matters and, in the light of the authorities considered above, I do not find that the RO erred in this respect either.
