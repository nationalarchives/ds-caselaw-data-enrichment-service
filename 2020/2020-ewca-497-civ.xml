But in other cases a comparative test needs to be applied. The particular category of person with whom we are concerned is described in section 189 (1) (c) of the Housing Act 1996: </p>

It is also to be noted that the reviewer did not specifically identify a “disability” as that word is defined by the Equality Act 2010; and, in addition, placed considerable reliance on the assistance that Mr Kanu obtained from his wife and son to perform the tasks of daily living that he could not do for himself. </p>

This is a somewhat arid argument, and I am unconvinced that it is sensible to force housing authorities and reviewing officers into a straitjacket on this sort of issue. In any event, the correct answer may depend on the facts of the particular case. However, given the reference to “other special reason”, and given the fact that in many cases there will be a mixture of reasons as to why an applicant is said to be vulnerable, I suspect that the one-stage test will probably be more practical in most cases.” </p>

If such an applicant, when homeless, would be perfectly capable of visiting a doctor to obtain a prescription and a pharmacist to collect his medication, and then of administering the medication to himself, it would be unrealistic to describe him as “vulnerable”, when compared with an ordinary person when homeless. Mr Paul Brown QC tried valiantly to meet that point, but it does not appear to me that it is answerable.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.00in;text-indent:0.00in">“In the first place the defined term is a different word. Second, although it is true that there is a blanket prohibition on discrimination on the ground of disability, there is also a positive duty to treat a disabled person more favourably. That duty is a duty to make “reasonable adjustments”. What those adjustments are in any particular case must depend on the extent of the disability in question. By contrast, if a homeless person has a priority need and has not become homeless intentionally the local authority owes the same duty to that person, namely to secure the provision of accommodation, irrespective of whether the test (whatever it is) is only just satisfied or is obviously satisfied by a wide margin. The degree of disability will no doubt go to the fulfilment of that duty by securing the provision of suitable accommodation, but the duty itself will have been triggered. Third, whereas the test of disability in the Equality Act 2010 takes an ability to carry out normal day to day activities as its reference point, Part VII of the Housing Act 1996 is all about finding accommodation. It is also important to emphasise that an assessment of whether someone is vulnerable within the meaning of section 189(1)(c) is a “contextual and practical” assessment: the <span style="font-style:italic">Hotak</span> case, at para 62. In the case of a person who falls within the category of “old age” the focus is not on his or her chronological age but on the effect of old age on his or her ability to deal with being homeless. Likewise in the case of a disabled person the focus is not on the extent of his or her disability, but on the impact of that disability, together with whatever support is available, to deal with being homeless. By contrast the definition of “disability” in the Equality Act 2010 is concerned with an individual's unaided capacity to carry out normal day-to-day activities. Fourth, the use of the definition in the Equality Act 2010 focuses on only some of the characteristics in section 189(1)(c) whereas the concept of vulnerability applies to all of them.” </p>

In <span style="font-style:italic">Pieretti</span>, for example, the housing authority had failed to undertake sufficient inquiries into the applicants’ mental problems before coming to a decision that they were intentionally homeless. Another example canvassed in argument was a person suffering from agoraphobia who failed to attend for interview and was rejected on that account. I note that in <span style="font-style:italic">Durdana</span> Patten LJ said at [25] that although it was theoretically possible for the duty to be complied with in ignorance of what it consists of, “such cases are likely to be rare”. I do not consider that we need to adjudicate between Lord Neuberger and Patten LJ; not least because in neither of our cases was the reviewing officer unaware of the PSED. The answer may well lie in the focussed nature of a vulnerability assessment of a particular individual (as in <span style="font-style:italic">Kanu</span>) compared with a decision whether or not to take proceedings for possession based on a pre-existing policy (as in <span style="font-style:italic">Durdana</span>).

In addition, if the application of a four stage sequential test had been essential, the Supreme Court could not have upheld the review decision in Mr Kanu’s case.

Indeed, she made no finding whether or not Mr Kanu suffered from a disability as defined for the purposes of the Equality Act. So the making of such a finding cannot be a fatal flaw in a review decision, contrary to what both judges held in our two cases. Nor did she consider what the effect would be on Mr Kanu if he ceased to receive the support of his wife and son. So she was not even considering “disability” as defined in the Equality Act. Mr Vanhegan suggested that there might be other parts of the review decision which did address those questions. But it is normal judicial practice to quote or summarise those parts of a decision under scrutiny in so far as relevant for the issue under consideration. In my judgment we must assume that all relevant parts of the review decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Kanu </span>are adequately quoted or summarised in Lord Neuberger’s judgment. </p>

I agree with Mr Paget and Ms Rowlands that it would be highly artificial if, in order to answer the first three questions, the reviewing officer had to imagine a world in which the applicant was bereft of any support or medication; but then, in order to answer the fourth question, the reviewing officer had to add back in such support and medication as was available to the applicant.

He also submitted that a disability could also consist of an impairment in carrying out day-today tasks at work, as well as in and about the home. As an elucidation of the meaning of disability in the abstract that is no doubt right. But that is not the task that Parliament has set for the reviewing officer. As Lord Neuberger’s third question makes clear, what is under consideration is the likely effect of the disability, when taken together with any other features, on the applicant if and when homeless. An inability to work is only relevant if it would have an effect on the applicant if and when homeless. In other words, what needs to be considered in an assessment of vulnerability is that which is relevant to a person’s ability to deal with the consequences of being homeless. </p>

In addition, any vulnerability assessment will be concentrated on the particular facts of the case in question. What the reviewing officer must consider is whether a person is vulnerable as a result of “mental illness or handicap or physical disability”. It is difficult to see how that task can be performed without a sharp focus on the extent of the illness, handicap or physical disability; and its effect on the person’s ability to deal with the consequences of homelessness. What matters is the substance of the assessment not its form. Provided that a reviewing officer appreciates the actual mental or physical problems from which the applicant suffers, the task will have been properly performed. As Ms Rowlands put it, the task of the reviewing officer is not to label; it is to understand. Just as a failure to mention the PSED or a failure to tabulate each feature of it will not necessarily vitiate a vulnerability assessment, so a mere recitation of the PSED will not save such an assessment if it has failed in substance to address the relevant questions: <span style="font-style:italic">Kannan </span>at [24].  </p>

I cannot see how it can realistically be suggested that, having decided that a person is not vulnerable, the fact that he is disabled gives him automatic priority. Some categories of person are entitled to automatic priority: pregnant women among them. But the disabled are not. They are only entitled to priority if the disability causes them to be vulnerable. If they are not vulnerable, despite having a disability, then a decision that they do not have a priority need is, to use Lord Neuberger’s phrase, “simply putting Parliament's decision into effect”. Now suppose that a reviewing officer decides that a homeless person is vulnerable as a result of physical disability. The full housing duty is therefore triggered. What difference can it make to the triggering of that duty, if, in addition, the reviewing officer decides that that person is also disabled? The same duty will have been triggered.  </p>

It may bear on the question whose case, among all those in priority need, should be dealt with first. It may bear on the nature of the accommodation to be offered. The accommodation must be suitable, having regard to any disability. So a person who is both vulnerable and disabled will have to be provided with accommodation more tailored to their particular needs.

To quash the decision because Mr Perdios did not adopt a particular formula to express his clear conclusion is, in my judgment, to ask far too much of a reviewing officer. </p>

So far as his depression and low mood were concerned, she said that she was satisfied that Mr Kiefer’s “ability to manage daily activities has not been affected by the conditions.” Her overall conclusion was that “Mr Kiefer demonstrates an ability to manage daily activities with no support required”. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">In my judgment that is a clear finding that Mr Kiefer was not relevantly disabled. There was no impairment that had a substantial and long-term effect on his ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities. It is true that there is a tension between that conclusion and her statement that the depression “could be” a disability. But to seize on that tension (as Mr Vanhegan did) is to apply an over-lawyerly approach (or as Lord Carnwath put it “an over-zealous linguistic analysis”) to a review decision. On a fair reading of the decision as a whole, the statement that depression “could be” a disability is a theoretical possibility. In Mr Kiefer’s particular case Ms Kaissi considered that the depression had no effect on his ability to manage daily activities. The only condition not specifically mentioned is Mr Kiefer’s diabetes. That is one of the conditions that is managed by medication. But whether or not Ms Kaissi ought to have regarded that as a disability for the purposes of the Equality Act, what she concentrated on (and in my judgment rightly concentrated on) was the effect of that condition on Mr Kiefer’s vulnerability. Ms Kaissi approached that question in the same way that Lord Neuberger commended in <span style="font-style:italic">Hotak</span> at [64] (quoted above). As in Mr McMahon’s case, there was no evidence that any of Mr Kiefer’s conditions in fact impaired his ability to carry out normal day-to day-activities. </p>

Ms Kaissi said that there was nothing that was even <span style="font-style:italic">suggestive</span> of an inability to carry out daily activities. That was a finding of fact which was not challenged. If there was nothing that was even suggestive of such an inability, I cannot see that Ms Kaissi was under any further duty to make inquiries. But in fact, Ms Kaissi drew attention to that in her letter to his solicitors of 2 August 2019. She invited further representations by 9 August. None were made. The silence is eloquent.  </p>
