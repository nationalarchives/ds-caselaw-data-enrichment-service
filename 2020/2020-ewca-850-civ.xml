	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.05in;text-indent:0.5in">The first and second appellants and the second and third respondents operate competing businesses in the timber frame construction industry from adjacent properties in the same business park in St Michaels in Preston.  The third and fourth appellants are individuals involved in the management of the first and second appellants, whilst the first respondent has been involved in that of the second and third respondents.  Over the years the relations between the two factions in this appeal have not been as cordial as one might have hoped, resulting on occasions in litigation.  The present proceedings are brought by the respondents (collectively “Supawall”) against the appellants (collectively “Flitcraft”) for infringement of patent, infringement of copyright and passing off.  At a hearing on 12 June 2019 Recorder Campbell QC (“the Recorder”) gave summary judgment in favour of Supawall on the patent and copyright infringement claims, but allowed the passing off claim to proceed to trial.  Flitcraft appeal to this court, pursuant to permission which I granted, on the ground that the judge ought to have held that Flitcraft had a real prospect of defending both the patent and copyright claims, and on the further ground that the hearing involved a serious procedural irregularity.  Flitcraft also seek the admission of new evidence on this appeal, which, they contend, would have had a material influence on the outcome of the application had it been available to adduce before the Recorder. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.05in;text-indent:0.5in">The issues in the patent and copyright infringement claims are narrow ones, related to whether Supawall has title to sue.  In its most radical form, Flitcraft’s defence is that title to the patents and copyrights is vested in them by virtue of a series of assignments.  If that defence fails, they contend that Supawall do not have title in any event, for reasons which I will have to explain in due course. </p>

These are photographs of certain buildings said to have been constructed by Supawall in around 2006 to 2008, and to have been used by Flitcraft in its promotional materials and on its website. The Appendix 3A and 3C works are said to have been created by the first respondent’s late father Anthony Price, who was a commercial photographer.  The ownership of the copyright in these works is said to have passed to Anthony Price’s wife, Jean Mary Price (the first respondent’s mother) “by the inheritance of Mr Anthony Price’s estates in or about January 2015”.  Jean Mary Price is then said to have assigned these copyrights to the first respondent by a deed of assignment dated 25 August 2015.  Different particulars applied to the Appendix 3B works, but summary judgment was not pursued in respect of these, which were said to have been created by the first respondent himself in 1993.  The Appendix 3B works can thus be safely ignored. </p>

It identified the issues in the claims as including proprietorship of the patents, and ownership of copyright in the Appendix 3A and 3C works.  The skeleton dealt with ownership of the patents at paragraphs 23 to 37.  At paragraph 29 the skeleton referred to the 2011 Bridge assignment, relying only on the Patents Forms 21 to establish its existence. It then referred to the 2016 Bridge assignment, and the fact that that assignment was recorded on the register on 26 January 2017.  The skeleton then dealt with the appellants’ case, which they took as including (see paragraph 31) the positive allegation that Mr Bridge assigned the patents to MTS.

Supawall then contended that “the fundamental difficulty and the reason why this point is suitable for summary judgment” was the fact that Flitcraft’s case for owning the copyright depended on the copyrights being assigned in 2011 by the 2011 Bridge assignment, around four years before Anthony Price died, and whilst, at least on Supawall’s case, the copyright remained vested in him. </p>

A bankrupt’s estate vests in the trustee … There has also been at least one corporate insolvency.”  Having floated those points, Flitcraft then relied, at paragraph 7, on a chain of title to the patents from Mr Bridge to MTS to FEBL to the first appellant: </p>

They have failed to do that.  The upshot is there is no documentary support for the defendants’ case as pleaded.”    </p>

Of course, I have to take into account not only the evidence actually placed before me but also  the evidence that can reasonably be expected to be available at trial.  The difficulty here as I see it for the defendants, is that the defendants invite me to assume that the documentation  on which they rely will be available at trial, when that documentation is not available now,  has not been supplied at any time since the defence, or indeed since the issue of the  application for summary judgment; and I have been given no obvious reason as to why I  have not been supplied with any of that documentation, assuming it exists.  </p>

He held that the reference in paragraph 21 of the defence to the belief that the relevant acts of infringement were carried out in the belief “correctly held” that the relevant rights were vested in the first appellant meant that the appellants accepted that intellectual property rights did subsist in the photographs in question, and claimed they were owned by the first appellant.  It followed that the only issue was that of title.  He concluded at paragraph 46 that the appellants’ claim relied on the same assignments as they relied upon in relation to the patents, and that their claim could be no better than it was in relation to the patents. In fact it was worse, because of the timing the first respondent did not acquire the copyrights in the Appendix 3A and 3C works until after the time of the 2011 Bridge assignment.  </p>

The reason is quite simple: if the respondent’s case is bad in law, he will in truth have no real prospect of succeeding on his claim or successfully defending the claim against him, as the case may be. Similarly, if the applicant’s case is bad in law, the sooner that is determined, the better. If it is possible to show by evidence that although material in the form of documents or oral evidence that would put the documents in another light is not currently before the court, such material is likely to exist and can be expected to be available at trial, it would be wrong to give summary judgment because there would be a real, as opposed to a fanciful, prospect of success.

Thus in an idealised case, a claimant can issue and serve an application for summary judgment to be heard in 14 days’ time.  The defendant must serve his evidence 7 days before the hearing, and the claimant must serve any evidence in reply at least 3 days before the hearing.  If all this is done, the hearing can go ahead on the appointed day.  The overall object of the rules and practice direction taken together is to ensure a fair hearing of the summary judgment application within a short time scale.  The procedural safeguards, such as  requiring notice of the rule under which the application is brought, identification of issues and/or a statement in the application notice or the evidence referred to in it that the applicant believes that the respondent has no real prospect of successfully defending the claim or issue are important protections aimed at ensuring that the overall procedure is fair. </p>

The criteria formerly applied under the Rules of the Supreme Court to the admission of further evidence, based on the judgment of Denning LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Ladd v Marshall</span> [1954] 1 WLR 1489,  continue to be highly relevant, although the court must, first and foremost, give effect to the overriding objective of doing justice at proportionate cost.  The criteria are: (1) the evidence could not with reasonable diligence have been obtained for use at the trial; (2) the evidence must be such that, if given, it would probably have had an important influence on the result of the case (though it need not be decisive); and (3) the evidence is apparently credible though it need not be incontrovertible.

The learning shows, in my judgment, that the <span style="font-style:italic">Ladd v Marshall</span> criteria are no longer primary rules, effectively constitutive of the court’s power to admit fresh evidence; the primary rule is given by the discretion expressed in CPR 52.11(2)(b) coupled with the duty to exercise it in accordance with the overriding objective.

It may well be that the standard of diligence required of the defendant preparing his case in opposition to a summons for summary judgment, especially if under pressure of time, would not be so high as that required in preparing for trial. The second and third conditions will no doubt be satisfied if the further evidence tendered is sufficient, according to the ordinary principles applied on applications for summary judgment to raise a triable issue. But I see no injustice at all in requiring the defendant to use such diligence as is reasonable in the circumstances to put before the judge on the hearing of the summons, albeit in summary form, all the evidence he relies on in defence; whereas it would be a great injustice to the plaintiff to allow the defendant to introduce for the first time on appeal evidence which was readily available at the hearing of the summons but which was not produced.’ </p>

The court is in the highest degree reluctant to allow fresh arguments to be deployed after a trial when the effect may be to require fresh evidence to be adduced in response, or if, had the point been run below, it would have caused the trial to take a different course.   The rule is an aspect of the finality principle, and the trial is intended to be a final determination of the parties’ rights.  Where, in contrast, the issue is whether a party has a realistic prospect of succeeding in or defending a claim at a trial at some point in the future, the same strict approach is not necessitated.

Verras Law asserted that the patents had been assigned to their client as part of a funding deal on 22 March 2011.  McLoughlin &amp; Law asked for this claim to be set out in writing.  Verras Law responded by a letter dated 7 June 2013 in which they asserted that their client had met with the first respondent in April 2013.  At that meeting Mr Rich Jones had asserted, amongst other things, Lightpeak’s right to certain intellectual property pursuant to a deed of assignment.  A copy of the deed was attached to the letter, and carries the signatures of both the first respondent and Mr Rich Jones.  The deed is undated, but the letter states that it was executed on 22 March 2011.  The deed is expressed to be made between the first respondent and “Supawall Group Limited … formerly Lightpeak Limited”.  The patents are included, by Part 1 of Schedule 1, in the intellectual property apparently assigned by this deed.

During the administration of the Maple Partnership the first respondent and Mr Middleton did not raise the suggestion that these copyrights belonged to anyone other than the Maple Partnership.  He goes on to record that the accounts of the Maple Partnership contained multiple entries of payments to Anthony Price, and that the copyrights in the photographs would have transferred to the Maple partnership at the time of payment.

It continues (see paragraph 10.6A.2) by asserting that Flitcraft “no longer admit” that the 2011 Bridge assignment was entered into, or entered into on any date before the commencement of the first respondent’s bankruptcy.  They allege that it is to be inferred that either no such assignment was entered into, or alternatively that it was entered into after the Lightpeak Assignment and after the relevant bankruptcy petition was presented.  In that case the 2011 Bridge assignment was either of no effect (because the rights had already been disposed of to Lightpeak) or it was void pursuant to section 284 of the Insolvency Act 1986: paragraph 10.6A.2.1 and 10.6A.2.2. </p>

On its face, the Lightpeak assignment appears to dispose of the patents, and the documentary material produced by Mr Craig suggests that it did so before the date of the 2011 Bridge assignment.  Mr Pritchard suggested that the Lightpeak assignment had been executed but not delivered.  That may turn out to be the case, but there are a number of pointers in the opposite direction.  First, Mr Middleton writing to the patent attorneys in June 2012 thought that the possibility that the patents had been transferred to Lightpeak was sufficiently serious to justify taking advice and described the situation as “not straightforward”.   Secondly, the first respondent’s August 2012 email to his trustee in bankruptcy may suggest that the Lightpeak assignment had been effective to dispose of the patents.  Thirdly, the attempts by Lightpeak and its solicitors in 2013 to enforce the transfer suggest that Lightpeak did not think that the assignment was ineffective.  </p>

It is true that section 32(9) of the Patents Act 1977 allows Supawall to rely on the fact of registration as “<span style="font-style:italic">prima facie</span> evidence” of an assignment.  The 2011 Bridge assignment is, however, said to have been dated only 6 days after the Lightpeak assignment.  It is of course conceivable that in those 6 days Supawall decided not to proceed with the Lightpeak transaction, but, again, there are indications the other way.  For example, Mr Middleton’s June 2012 email to the patent attorneys is not obviously reconcilable with this as it suggests that it was subsequent commercial developments which removed the basis for the Lightpeak transaction, resulting in the assignment to Mr Bridge. This seems a lot to have happened in the 6 days between the two assignments.  Further, Supawall have not, thus far, been able to produce a copy of the 2011 Bridge assignment, or any secondary evidence of it apart from the Forms 21 filed much later at the UKIPO.  The circumstances plainly warrant investigation, and Flitcraft cannot be said not to have a real prospect of successfully defending the action, notwithstanding the effect of section 32(9). </p>

The assertion of a trust in the amended pleading is based entirely on Mr Craig’s evidence, but Mr Craig does not explain with any particularity how he says the trust arose.  It faces a number of difficulties.  For example, the patents were granted in 2007.  Did the partnership exist at that time and, if not, how did the patents become partnership property?  Moreover, the first respondent licensed the patents in 2008 to the second respondent.  Again, it is not clear whether the partnership existed at that time.  If it did exist, then it is surprising that, as beneficial owner, it was not a party to the licence.  If it did not exist, then, again, it is not clear how the patents came, subsequently, to be its beneficial property.  There is also a substantial question surrounding the circumstances of the abortive sale to MTS.  If the patents reverted to Mr Craig at that stage, as he says they did, were they part of the sale of MTS’s assets to FEBL?   </p>

That defence is not vulnerable to the principal point taken by Supawall before the judge, because it no longer relies on an assignment from the first respondent to Mr Bridge or from Mr Bridge to MTS. It is therefore no answer to say that the assignment to Mr Bridge predates the first respondent’s acquisition of any interest in the copyright.  </p>

They put Supawall on notice that they required these matters to be proved.  They might, therefore, reasonably have expected Supawall to support their summary judgment application with evidence as to these matters, but no such evidence was forthcoming.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0.05in">The Recorder thought that the fact that Flitcraft had pleaded that they “correctly” believed that they owned all relevant rights meant that they accepted that copyright subsisted in the works.  I accept that one might reach that conclusion reading paragraph 21 of the amended defence in isolation, but such a reading cannot be reconciled with the earlier part of the pleading.  In my judgment, reading the pleading as a whole, the second part of Flitcraft’s defence is pleaded on the assumption that Supawall are able to establish the subsistence of copyright.  Furthermore, I do not see how Flitcraft can be taken to have admitted that the title to the copyright got as far as the first respondent, when the matters on which reliance is placed were simply not within Flitcraft’s knowledge, as they had expressly pleaded.  Again, the second part of Flitcraft’s defence must be pleaded on the assumption that Supawall is able to establish that the copyright passed in the way alleged from the first respondent’s father, to his mother and then to him. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0.05in">The application for summary judgment made by Supawall did not comply with the mandatory procedural requirements for such applications. With respect to the Recorder, these procedural safeguards in the rule and practice direction are not “formal requirements” or “formalities” if by that it is intended to detract from their critical importance for ensuring a fair hearing of the application.  The requirement to state in the application notice (or in the evidence contained or referred to in it) that it is made because the applicant believes that on the evidence the respondent has no real prospect of successfully defending the claim is an important one.  It prevents a claimant making an application and claiming the case to be straightforward when, in truth, he knows otherwise.  In the present case I doubt that Supawall could have made such a statement when (a) the first respondent in his August 2012 email had described the ownership of the IP as “a complicated subject”; and (b) Mr Middleton had described the same question as “not straightforward”. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0.05in">The way in which the Recorder agreed to compensate for the breaches of the practice direction was “to bear in mind the [respondents’] lack of compliance with formalities in relation to the non-availability of specific documents”.  However, the Recorder went on to grant summary judgment, notwithstanding the issues of fact on the pleadings, because “there was no documentation to support the [appellants’] case as regards the three assignments on which it relies.”  Given the way in which the matter was brought before the court in breach of the important procedural safeguards, I do not think the Recorder was justified in criticising the absence of documentation.  He went on to criticise the absence of evidence from the third appellant to put the documents into context.   In circumstances where the application was brought in breach of the rules, without any evidence in support from Supawall, and where Flitcraft had only agreed to the hearing proceeding on the basis that they would not be penalised for failing to produce documents, that does not seem to me to have been a fair point.    </p>
