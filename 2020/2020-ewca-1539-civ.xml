Previous convictions remained disclosable, and those who had committed crimes remained disadvantaged by them, indefinitely.  The Act sought to address that mischief. </p>

A second issue, which did not arise on the facts of this case, was debated before the tribunal panel: for the purposes of the power in section 7(3) to admit evidence otherwise inadmissible under section 4(1), in determining a licence application under the 2004 Act, is a local housing authority a “judicial authority”? </p>

There is no applicable exception in the circumstances of this case.

As I understood his submission, he particularly relied upon paragraph 5 of the Order, which, under the power in section 7(4), excludes the application of section 4(1) in relation to proceedings specified in the Order, including the various disciplinary proceedings there listed and “proceedings relating to taxi licences”.  On the basis of the construction of section 4(1) as adopted by the tribunal panel, that exclusion would again be unnecessary; and evidence of the relevant conduct would be admissible in any event under section 4(1). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.00in">“Section 4(1)(a)… refers to the prohibition relating to a person who has ‘committed or been charged with or prosecuted for or convicted of or sentenced for any offence…’.  In contrast section 4(1)(b) refers to ‘spent conviction or spent convictions’ and includes the phrase ‘or any circumstances ancillary thereto’.  It is necessary in section 4(1)(b) to refer to ‘any circumstances ancillary thereto’ because the drafting of the section only uses the word  ‘conviction’ and this makes it clear that the prohibition is wider than just the conviction itself.  This is not necessary in the rest of section 4 as the drafting is wider and includes circumstances that are ancillary to the conviction, such as committing the offence and sentencing….” </p>

	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.00in">“In my judgment it is necessary to look at section 4 as a whole and to consider the purpose behind it.  Section 4(1) provides that once a conviction is spent a person ‘shall be treated for all purposes in law as a person who has not committed or been charged with or prosecuted for or convicted of or sentenced for the offence or offences…’.   The purpose is to seek to prevent the past offences coming to light and to ensure that the rehabilitated person is treated as not having committed the offence in question.  Section 4(1)(a) prohibits evidence of spent convictions being produced in legal proceedings and section 4(1)(b) prohibits questioning about spent convictions and ‘any circumstances ancillary’, the definition of which is referred to above.  This is doing no more than making it clear within the particular circumstances of those subsections that information about the conduct that constituted the offence should not be disclosed.  If the section is not looked at in this way then it seems to me that the whole purpose of it is undermined.  I asked [counsel for the local authority] during his submissions how a person who had been convicted of stealing a car could be described in accordance with his analysis of section 4.  He replied that it would be permissible to state that the person had taken a car without the permission of the owner.  To my mind those are the elements of the offence and an individual could not be a rehabilitated person unless it was permissible for them to refuse to provide such information or without a prohibition on such information being provided.  Anyone hearing such a description would know that the person had committed a criminal offence.” </p>

If, as Mr Bates contends, that includes the conduct constituting the offence for which he was convicted, then section 4(1)(b) would be otiose: indeed, the two provisions, (a) and (b), would be inconsistent.  Where evidence is inadmissible, it is unnecessary to have a distinct provision to the effect that questions seeking to elicit such evidence should not be asked; and it cannot be open for an individual to have a choice as to whether or not to give that (inadmissible) evidence in answer to questions. </p>

He gave, as an example, a situation where the judicial authority admitted evidence of a conviction but not of the conduct underlying it: that would, he submitted, allow the rehabilitated person to answer question in relation to that conduct, if he wished.  However, that is not the case: in those circumstances, he or she would still be unable to give evidence as to the conduct, because, unless and until the authority had exercised its discretion to admit evidence of conduct (as opposed to merely the fact of conviction), that evidence would remain inadmissible.   </p>

Whilst, of course, it is open to the Parliamentary drafter to express a single concept – here, the concept of the conviction of an offence and the conduct constituting that offence taken together – in two distinct ways, section 4(1)(a) and (b) are adjacent provisions within the same subsection, which makes it unlikely in the extreme that that was the intention here.  The unlikelihood is compounded by the fact that the drafter thought fit and necessary expressly to define the relevant phrase used in section 4(1)(b) (“… or in circumstances ancillary [to a conviction]”…) in section 4(5).  In my view it is clear that the different words used in section 4(1)(a) and (b) were intended to have different effects so far as scope of the provisions is concerned: the admissibility prohibition in the former is deliberately drafted not to include evidence of conduct constituting the relevant offence(s).  </p>

I do not consider that the report of the committee set up by various organisations including JUSTICE under the chairmanship of Lord Gardiner , “Living it Down: The Problem of Old Convictions”, to which Mr Bates referred, which appears to have prompted the Parliamentary activity which resulted in the 1974 Act, is of any assistance in construing section 4; but, in my view, like the Act itself, it too generally focuses on rehabilitation so far as convictions are concerned. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Second, as Mr Underwood emphasised, it is noteworthy both that (i) criminal conduct that does not give rise to a conviction for an offence cannot be the subject of rehabilitation or “spent” under the Act, and that (ii) conduct that is criminal may also give rise to civil or administrative claims.  On the basis of Mr Bates’ construction, if a criminal conviction based on conduct is spent, that would generally prohibit that same conduct being used to found a civil claim or further administrative action such as further enforcement action.  Mr Underwood submitted, with some force, that Parliament could not possibly have intended such a consequence, which would be devastating for both civil claimants and regulators; in circumstances in which, had there been no conviction, evidence of that conduct could have been relied upon in the later proceedings.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In response, Mr Bates acknowledged the public policy argument; but submitted that, where Parliament or the executive wished to ameliorate the position as set out in section 4(1), they had the powers to do so.  For example, the position of civil claimants is dealt with by section 11 of the Civil Evidence Act 1968; and, in various specific provisions, Parliament (see, e.g., section 125 of the Gambling Act) or the Secretary of State (see, e.g., his use of the power under section 7(4) of the 1974 Act in respect of taxi driver licences, referred to above at paragraph 17(ii)) have intervened.  Furthermore, in section 7(3), judicial authorities have the power to admit such evidence. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">At common law, the fact of conviction was not evidence of the underlying facts of the offence; but misconduct which had founded a criminal charge and conviction was admissible in later civil proceedings.  Section 11(1) and (2) of the Civil Evidence Act 1968 merely allowed the fact of conviction (which, as Mr Bates submitted, had been capable of proof by way of certification by the relevant court since the Criminal Act 1865) to be admissible in civil proceedings as proof that the relevant person committed the offence (section 11(2)(a)), and allowed the contents of various documents related to the criminal proceedings (such as the complaint and information) to be used as evidence of “the facts upon which the conviction is based” (section 11(2)(b)).  However, whilst the 1974 Act may have reversed the extension provided by the 1968 Act so far as spent convictions are concerned, there is nothing to suggest that it intended to reverse the common law position by which evidence of misconduct that had founded a criminal charge and conviction was admissible in later civil proceedings.

I consider it inconceivable that Parliament intended such a consequence: certainly, had that been the intention, it could and would have used clear words to do so, which the 1974 Act does not.   </p>

On the construction which I favour, the 1975 Order and statutory provisions such as section 125 of the Gambling Act 2005 have substance: for example, they render section 4(1)(a) inapplicable, thereby admitting evidence of a conviction itself.  In relation to the “safety valve” of section 7(3), in my view, that does not in any way undermine a construction of section 4(1) which, in some circumstances, renders such a safety valve unnecessary. </p>

However, the issue is an important one in practice, the tribunal panel expressed a view upon it, and it was fully debated before us.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">With respect to the Deputy Judge’s contrary view (and in agreement with the tribunal panel: see [143]), in my view it is clear that this wide definition extends beyond those who exercise the function of adjudicating between third parties.  It extends to those persons and bodies who have the power under any enactment to “determine any question affecting the rights, privileges, obligations or liabilities of any person, or to receive evidence affecting the determination of any such question”; which I consider unambiguously to include an authority empowered by statute to determine the grant, refusal and revocation of licenses which give the holder the right to control and manage property which is subject to the 2004 Act licensing regime.  Such a licence gives the holder a right of real value: without it, individuals are unable to manage or control relevant properties, and commit a criminal offence if they do so.  I see no difficulty arising from this construction with regard to section 7(3) which simply allows the authority to disapply section 4(1): it does not suggest that there must be some form of application by a party for such disapplication, precisely because it does not envisage section 7(3) only being used in the context of traditional court proceedings.   </p>
