	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">This appeal from an order of His Honour Judge Hodge QC, made in Manchester on 24 July 2019, requires the court to consider the nature and extent of proprietary rights in relation to fish.  The fish in question are in nine enclosed lakes at Borwick in Lancashire, from which they cannot escape.  They provide sport for anglers who try to catch prized specimens which, if they succeed, they weigh and photograph before returning them to the lake.  The respondent, BDS, carried on a commercial fishery on this basis which had been in operation for some 12 years by 2016.  In that year the land comprising the lakes was sold to the appellant, CWF, by way of enforcement of the security of BDS’ mortgagee.  No rights in respect of the fish were granted or reserved on the transfer to CWF.  BDS claims that it retained the proprietary rights over the fish which it held beforehand, notwithstanding the sale of the land.  The judge accepted this argument and gave judgment for damages for conversion against CWF, the amount to be determined at a later trial if necessary. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The Borwick lakes were created in voids resulting from the extraction of gravel for the construction of the M6 motorway.  BDS bought the land in about 1997 and obtained planning permission for the development of the land as a commercial fishery in 2002.  The lakes are stocked with carp and other fish.  Under the terms of a section 106 agreement, the nine lakes were to be kept separate and isolated from each other, so that, in practice, the fish stock would be confined to the relevant lake and could not escape from it either to another of the lakes or to the outside world, nor could extraneous fish enter the closed system.  There were pipes between the various lakes so that water could flow to and fro, but grates within the pipes prevented all but the very smallest fish from passing from one lake to another.  The stock of fish included a number of large specimens, some of which became well known and identified, and acquired given names.  BDS contends that the fish are (or were) of great value; it puts the value of its claim in damages at more than £1.1 million. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In 2003 BDS granted a lease of the relevant land, including the lakes, to British Waterways Board (BWB), which was to, and did, run a commercial fishery there.  There may already have been some relevant fish in the lakes at that time, but BWB spent money on buying fish so as to stock the lakes.  BWB’s lease came to an end in 2005 in circumstances which do not matter, save to note that BDS paid nothing to BWB for the fish then in the lakes. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">BDS then ran the fishery itself from 2005, spending money on adding to the stock of fish and on maintaining the lakes and the fish within them.  In 2012 it constructed a restaurant and café facility to expand its business.  In order to do so, it borrowed money from a lender on the security of a legal charge over the land.  In January 2016 the lender appointed receivers under the Law of Property Act 1925 in relation to the site.  BDS was already trying to sell the land itself and entered into negotiations with CWF on the basis of a sale of the land for (initially) £700,000 and of “all stock of fish in the lakes” for £200,000.  These negotiations came to nothing and on 29 June 2016 the LPA receivers sold the land to CWF for £625,000.  The receivers told Mr Smith, BDS’ director, that they did not consider that the lender’s charge extended to the fish and that they had given no warranties to the purchaser in relation to the transfer of ownership of the fish on completion. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">CWF’s solicitors took the position that BDS had no right to the fish following the sale, but BDS’ solicitors protested, demanding that CWF should not operate a business using what they claimed to be BDS’ fish stocks, which BDS intended to remove.  However, the removal would have been a difficult and time-consuming process, which BDS was advised would take between 4 and 6 months and would have to be carried out between October and March.  Because of the cost and disruption that this would have involved, later in 2016 BDS changed its position, so as to leave the fish in place but to claim damages against CWF for conversion rather than an injunction.  BDS brought these proceedings accordingly, which it commenced in August 2018.  The proceedings also related to other assets, but the judge’s decision on that aspect of the case is not challenged on this appeal. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Legal issues as regards animals may arise in a variety of circumstances, including (as here) proprietary claims, or claims arising from damage caused either by or to animals.  For these purposes, English law draws a distinction between wild animals and domestic animals.  Into which category an animal falls is a question of law, not of fact – a question for the judge in a criminal trial, not for the jury.  Despite the disapproval of the use of Latin in court proceedings, it seems to me sensible to use the traditional Latin labels, namely animals <span style="font-style:italic">ferae</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">naturae</span> and animals <span style="font-style:italic">domitae</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">naturae</span>, to mark this distinction, because merely to refer to wild animals, as if it were an ordinary use of English rather than a term of art, might be misleading.   </p>

For BDS Mr Vickers submitted that the fish in the lakes which we have to consider cannot sensibly be referred to as wild: they have never lived in the wild, they are not free to escape from the lakes, and they are not in any sense dangerous to man.  He submitted to us, as he had done to the judge, that these fish ought to be regarded as in the category of animals <span style="font-style:italic">domitae naturae</span>, and that the established classification should be regarded as out of date and should be adapted so as to allow such treatment. </p>

Only one other case was cited to us in which a court has been invited to adapt the established classification.  This is <span style="font-style:italic">Buckle v Holmes</span> (1925) 134 LT 284.  (The case went to the Court of Appeal, reported at [1926] 2 KB 125, but this particular point was not pursued on the appeal.)  The defendant’s cat had killed what were said to be valuable racing and homing pigeons and some bantams of the plaintiff.  The plaintiff sued for damages for the loss, but was unable to prove that the defendant knew the cat to have any specially vicious propensity as compared with cats generally.  He therefore argued that, although cats were to be regarded as <span style="font-style:italic">domitae naturae</span> in general, they should be classified as <span style="font-style:italic">ferae naturae</span> in relation to birds such as pigeons and bantams.  Shearman J and Sankey J, sitting on appeal from the county court, both held that the distinction was too long and firmly settled as a matter of law for the court to qualify or modify the established classification, however welldisposed they might have been to the proposition if it had not been settled law for a very long time. </p>

The fishing process had started outside the limit.  A large quantity of mackerel had been collected in a seine, and the crew proceeded to bale the fish from the seine into the vessel.  While that process was under way the vessel moved to within the three mile limit.  The question was whether “fishing or catching fish” was happening within the limit, it being argued that the fishing was complete when the fish were within the seine.  The majority of the Supreme Court of Canada held that the process of fishing was not yet complete while the fish were being baled out from the seine into the vessel.  Sedgewick J, with whom King J and Girouard J agreed, spoke of the process continuing until the moment when the fish “are finally reduced to actual and certain possession”, which he held did not happen in that case until all the fish were on board the vessel.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">A third case, decided in the Supreme Court of Ireland, is <span style="font-style:italic">Purcell v Minister for Finance</span> [1939] IR 115.  This arose under legislation providing for compensation for malicious injury causing actual damage to property, payable out of public funds.  Mr Purcell caught eels in a river, not being the owner of the land over which the river ran nor, so far as the report discloses, holding any right such as a profit à prendre of fishery.  He put the eels into a large wooden box, referred to as a trunk, floating in the river and secured to the bank by chains.  He kept the eels there, alive, until there were enough of them to take to the market for sale, a process which Johnston J on the first appeal from the circuit court described as involving acquisition of the eels <span style="font-style:italic">per industriam</span>.  In his absence, a third party destroyed the trunk, thereby releasing the eels from their captivity back into their natural element.  The particular issue in the case does not matter for our purposes, turning on a point of statutory construction on which both of the appellate courts divided equally.  It arose in relation to a claim for compensation for the loss of the eels, which so far as the evidence went had not themselves been injured in any way but certainly ceased to be the subject of any proprietary rights on the part of Mr Purcell when they escaped from captivity.  The case provides a clear example of a situation in which animals had been taken or reduced into possession, giving the taker rights arising from the possession, which however lasted only for so long as the possession did.  Mr Purcell was able to get at eels in the trunk readily and with ease in order to take them on the next stage of their journey to market.  Until the destruction of the trunk he had rights over the eels <span style="font-style:italic">per industriam</span>, without having had any rights <span style="font-style:italic">ratione soli</span>. </p>

In <span style="font-style:italic">Kearry v Pattinson</span> [1939] 1 KB 471 the Court of Appeal had to decide on the rights and wrongs arising where bees had left a hive on the plaintiff’s land and had swarmed, first to the defendant’s land and then farther on.  The plaintiff asked the defendant for permission to come onto his land to recover the swarm, which was denied at first.  By the time the defendant had given permission, the next day, the bees had moved on and could not be recovered.  The defendant was held not liable to the plaintiff for the loss of the bees on the basis that he had no obligation to allow access onto his land.  Counsel cited Justinian and Blackstone, and both Slesser LJ and Goddard LJ relied on Blackstone’s proposition to the same effect, which I have summarised in paragraph 30 above.  Slesser LJ spoke of ownership of bees as being <span style="font-style:italic">rationale soli</span> and said “thus a qualified property may be had in bees in consideration of the property whereon they are found” (page 479).  But lower on the same page he said “they are <span style="font-style:italic">ferae naturae</span> before being hived but they may be taken into the disposition of the owner <span style="font-style:italic">per industriam</span> by hiving and so become his property”.   </p>

He said that “fish reared and / or introduced into a closed commercial fishery are wild animals in which a qualified property exists through industry, diligence and the hard work of the owner or operator of that fishery”: paragraph 69.  Accordingly he held that the owner of the land had a qualified property in the fish.  I do not disagree with that, though in some cases it may not require much by way of work to take the animal into the necessary degree of possession, and I would not wish to set up a test which involved differentiating according to the degree of difficulty or effort involved in the task. </p>

All of those show that close control was needed, and one can see why on the facts of those cases.  No rights arising from ownership of the underlying soil were or could be relevant.  The fish were at liberty in nature and it was necessary to bring them into captivity if any property right was to be exercised over them.

Moreover, the reference to a stew does not tell us anything about the size or nature of the area of water in question.  Lord Justice Peter Jackson has drawn my attention since the hearing of the appeal to a body of water near Epsom called the Stew-pond which is three quarters of an acre in size, a lot smaller than the biggest of the Borwick lakes but a great deal bigger than Mr Purcell’s trunk, and too big for it to be necessarily easy to take fish from it as and when required.  The passage from Blackstone is mainly concerned with deprivation of liberty.  It seems to me that it would be wrong to place too much reliance on the use of the phrase “immediate power” in that passage.  As for Savigny, on the one hand the discussion in the judgments in the Canadian case itself shows that Roman law authorities were not necessarily at one on points in this area, and on the other hand Lord Chelmsford observed in <span style="font-style:italic">Blades v Higgs</span> at 637 that English law had not followed Roman law in all respects as regards “the right of property in wild animals captured”.

At paragraph 71 he said that BDS retained its qualified property in the fish because the transfer of the land did not specifically address or purport to transfer title to the fish.  He did not explain why or how BDS could retain this qualified right when it was no longer the owner of the land and had not retained or obtained any right to go on to the land in CWF’s ownership in order to get access to the lakes and the fish, and CWF had the landowner’s exclusive right to fish for whatever fish there might be in the lakes on its land. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Wells relied both on the general proposition that BDS ceased to have possession of the fish when it ceased to own the land, and also on the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Kearry v Pattinson</span> where at 479 Slesser LJ said of bees that they “may remain his property while they are swarming so long as they are in his sight and he has lawful power easily to pursue them”.  There are references elsewhere to the need for the animal to remain within sight, but I cannot regard those as essential.  The main focus of the court’s attention in <span style="font-style:italic">Kearry</span> was on the question whether the plaintiff had the lawful power to pursue the bees, not on whether they were within his sight.  Goddard LJ said at 481: “The whole of this argument comes down to what Blackstone means when he says ‘and have power to pursue them’” and later “It follows, therefore, that you cannot demand entry upon another man’s land for the purpose of retaking animals”.  That was also the essence of the reasoning of Slesser LJ at 480, with whom Clauson LJ agreed.  The claim failed because the plaintiff was not entitled to insist that the defendant allow him on to the latter’s land for such pursuit.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">However, after the sale of the land to CWF, in what sense or respect could it be said that BDS had any kind of control over the fish, and therefore possession of them?  If the transfer of ownership of the land had been the result of a transaction negotiated between BDS and CWF directly, the terms of that transaction would have determined the parties’ respective rights.  Of course, BDS was in name and in law the seller of the land, but it acted through the agency of the receivers appointed by its mortgagee under the Law of Property Act 1925, and we should not ignore the commercial reality that BDS itself, through its directors and shareholders, was not involved in the negotiation.  As a result, neither in the contract for sale of the land on the part of BDS by the receivers nor in the transfer on completion was there any express reference to the fish, nor to any rights in relation to the fish, and in particular there was no reservation to BDS of any right of access over the land in connection with the fish.  It was said that the receivers gave no warranty to CWF in respect of the fish, which is not surprising, and that they had taken the view that the lender’s security did not include the fish.  This is likely to have been right, given that the legal charge created by BDS was expressed to charge the Scheduled Property, consisting of the land comprised in two titles registered at HM Land Registry, “and all Rights relating to the Scheduled Property in existence at the date of this mortgage”, those Rights as defined being irrelevant for present purposes.  The charge of the registered titles will have included the landowner’s rights <span style="font-style:italic">ratione soli</span> in respect of fishery within the land comprised in the titles, but cannot have included any specific rights in respect of all or any of the fish in the lakes.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Absent any reservation of rights in the transfer of the land, BDS had no right to enter the land and do anything with or in respect of the fish after the sale to CWF.  Mr Vickers compared the position of the fish after the sale with that of chattels owned by a vendor of land which are not included in the sale but, for whatever reason, are left on the land at the time of the sale.  He submitted that the sale of the land would not transfer title in the chattels to the purchaser, and that accordingly the transfer of the land in the present case need not and should not be taken to transfer any rights in relation to the fish to CWF.  The difference between the two cases lies in the different nature of the relevant ownership rights.  Chattels are the subject of absolute rights of ownership such that they do not pass with the land, assuming that they are not fixtures and are not comprised in the sale itself in which case they would pass contractually and by delivery.  What the position may be between vendor and purchaser in respect of chattels of the vendor left by mistake or otherwise on the land would depend on the terms of the transaction, but in general the vendor would not be entitled to insist on going on to the land to recover the chattels, but might be able to demand that the purchaser deliver them to him (subject perhaps to reimbursement of any cost incurred) and might assert a claim in conversion if their return is refused.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Animals <span style="font-style:italic">ferae naturae</span> are not the subject of such absolute property rights.  The rights that can exist in them <span style="font-style:italic">per industriam</span> depend on continued possession, with the sole exception of roaming animals while they retain an intention to return.  If the keeper’s possession of the animal depends on his ownership and control of the land on which they are found (or on some right derived from the landowner), then it must follow that, once he is not entitled to the land on which they are kept, or to any relevant right derived from the landowner, he no longer has the possession which is essential to the continuance of his rights.  Mr Vickers laid emphasis on references in the cases to animals regaining their natural liberty as being the case in which the former keeper loses his qualified rights based on possession.  That is no doubt a common situation, as it was with Mr Purcell’s eels.  But it does not seem to me to be any more essential to the legal position than is the reference to the animal remaining in sight.  The real issue, except in the case of roaming animals, is whether they are sufficiently in possession or not as a matter of fact.  Where rights acquired <span style="font-style:italic">per industriam</span> depend on the ownership of the land, or of some rights derived from the landowner, with the result that it is not necessary to prove close control of the animals, the rights cease to exist when the ownership of the land (or of the derived rights) itself comes to an end, because from that moment on the possession which is essential to the continuance of the rights no longer exists. </p>

The classic case referred to in the books is where they escape from possession as Mr Purcell’s eels did, but in my judgment the case is the same when ownership of the land comes to an end, without the reservation of any right of access over the land such as would enable the previous owner to come and take the fish himself.  From that moment on the former owner no longer has possession of the animals in any sense, and his former rights acquired <span style="font-style:italic">per industriam</span> no longer exist. </p>

Post and his hounds were pursuing a fox on waste ground in Long Island when Pierson intercepted and killed it.  Post sued, claiming ownership of the fox, and won at trial.  On appeal, the judgment was reversed by the New York Supreme Court, the majority view being given by Justice Tompkins.  His elegant judgment cites Justinian, Bracton, Pufendorf and others, and concludes that  </p>

That is to say, that actual bodily seizure is not indispensable to acquire right to, or possession of, wild beasts; but that, on the contrary, the mortal wounding of such beasts, by one not abandoning his pursuit, may, with the utmost propriety, be deemed possession of him; since, thereby, the pursuer manifests an unequivocal intention of appropriating the animal to his individual use, has deprived him of his natural liberty, and brought him within his certain control. So also, encompassing and securing such animals with nets and toils, or otherwise intercepting them in such a manner as to deprive them of their natural liberty, and render escape impossible, may justly be deemed to give possession of them to those persons who, by their industry and labour, have used such means of apprehending them.” </p>

The question is by no means settled, how long these may be said to belong to no one.  Nerva the son said that the fish which are in our fish-ponds belong to us, but not those in a lake; also that wild beasts which are confined in a park are our property, but not those which wander at large in forests that are fenced in. But fish in a private lake are no less shut in than in a fishpond, and well-fenced forests detain wild beasts no less effectively than parks; … and these differ in no other respect than that one is a narrower, the other a less restricted confinement.  Therefore in our time with greater justice the opposite opinion has prevailed, so that it is understood that we have right of ownership over wild beasts in private forests, and fish in private lakes, just as we have possession of them.”  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I would reject Mr Wells’ argument that if one needs to sport for fish, they cannot by definition be property <span style="font-style:italic">per industriam</span>.  He understandably relied on the statements from the authorities requiring a degree of close control, but they must be seen in the light of the circumstances then in contemplation and they cannot be transposed literally to every situation.  In this case, we are called upon to apply the common law in new circumstances.  Coarse fishing (fishing with bait) has a long history but, as <span style="font-style:italic">Fitzgerald v Firbank</span> shows, the thought of fishing with the object of catching and returning fish to the water baffled our judicial forebears only a century ago.  Today it is one of our most popular sports.  A 2018 Environment Agency report states that coarse anglers in England and Wales fished for 19 million days in the previous year and that the industry was worth £1.4 billion to the economy.  The fish in many inland waters are therefore objects of some value.  The test of separation and control adopted by the judge for qualified property <span style="font-style:italic">per industriam</span> is in my view a suitable one.  It is satisfied where creatures cannot escape the confinement in which the possessor of the right has placed or maintained them, and from where they could by reasonable means be recovered by him.  In my view there is no reason why the test should not apply irrespective of ownership of the land.    </p>

I incline to the view that BDS’s rights prior to the sale are better described as rights <span style="font-style:italic">per industriam </span>because they were so naturally associated with the purchase, introduction and cultivation of the fish, and not merely with its ownership of the land on which the lakes stood.  I would in any case be cautious about limiting rights <span style="font-style:italic">per industriam</span> to cases where there is no relevant land ownership (e.g. the sea) or cases of animals that roam and return.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It can be seen that captive wild creatures are considered to be qualified property <span style="font-style:italic">per industriam</span>, even though they are also on land presumably owned by the same person.  As explained by Sir Timothy at paragraph 25 above, the two rights are not symmetrical.  One is an exclusive right to reduce the animal into possession by virtue of land ownership, the other an exclusive right to possession of the animal by virtue of some effort.  I would therefore not exclude the possibility of a person enjoying rights <span style="font-style:italic">per industriam</span> in unusual circumstances where the ownership of the land lay elsewhere.  However, this is not an issue that needs to be resolved in the present case as BDS’s claim in conversion must in any event fail. </p>
