	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">GT admitted that it had in important respects carried out the audits in breach of its duty of care and that it had failed in its duty to identify management fraud, particularly dishonest representations and evidence provided to it by senior management in the course of the audits.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Although GT admitted breaches of duty, a large number of elements of AssetCo’s claim were in dispute before Bryan J. The trial lasted 20 days, involving extensive evidence from factual and expert witnesses and consideration of a large volume of documents and of 877 pages of written submissions as well of course as oral submissions. The bulk of the evidence went to the counterfactual situations which AssetCo alleged would have occurred in 2009 and 2010 if GT had conducted competent audits.  The judge delivered a 493-page judgment with over 1270 paragraphs. He found that the counterfactual situations would have occurred, that the damages sought were within the scope of GT’s duty and were not too remote, and that </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Many of the issues before the judge do not arise on this appeal. Factual causation, on a “but for” basis, is not in issue before us. There is no challenge to the judge’s conclusions on the remoteness of loss or mitigation. Some, but by no means all, of the case on the counterfactual situation is not in issue. AssetCo does not challenge the decision on contributory fault and GT, which argued for a greater reduction in damages, was refused permission to appeal against it. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">GT’s appeal proceeds on three grounds. First, it submits that the judge should have held that AssetCo had failed to establish that the losses for which it claimed damages were within the scope of GT’s duty of care and that its breaches of duty were the legal cause of those losses. If it succeeds on this ground, the whole award of damages would be set aside. Second, he erred in his application of the principles for awarding damages for loss of a chance in finding that the counterfactual situation was established on a 100% basis, and also erred in his assessment of the chances of four specific<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>matters. Third, the judge failed to give credit for benefits received by AssetCo. If successful, this would eliminate or reduce the losses for which damages were recoverable. </p>

AssetCo London and other subsidiaries (the London Group) provided, serviced and maintained the London Fire Brigade’s fleet of fire engines and ancillary equipment. Second, under a 20-year Public Private Partnership contract dated 19 April 2006 (the Lincoln Contract) with Lincolnshire County Council, AssetCo Lincoln Limited (AssetCo Lincoln) and other subsidiaries (the Lincoln Group) provided similar services for the Lincoln Fire Brigade. In FY2009, the support services division contributed over 80 per cent of the group’s reported operating profit of £17.43 million and of its reported pre-tax profit of nearly £11.3 million. The London Contract represented the major contributor<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>to these results, to the extent of about 85 per cent of the division’s reported profits. </p>

Under the terms of the PSA, AssetCo agreed that any contract for support services in Abu Dhabi would be concluded with AADL and that the £15 million subscribed by the investors (the PSA monies) would be retained in AADL, save for £5 million which could be lent to AssetCo. Christopher Mills, NAV’s chief investment officer, had good personal links in Abu Dhabi and strongly believed that there were very profitable opportunities for the provision of the services by the AssetCo group. During 2009, negotiations were conducted with the Abu Dhabi authorities which led to the conclusion of a contract dated 24 February 2010 (the SOC Contract) with the Service Operations Command of the Armed Forces of the UAE for the provision of fire and rescue services.  </p>

The management’s statement that the group had adequate resources to continue as a going concern for at least 12 months from the time of signing the 2009 accounts in June 2009 was untrue. The carrying values of goodwill and other fixed assets in the consolidated accounts and of the investment in subsidiaries in AssetCo’s balance sheet were unsupportable. An impairment of at least £66.4 million was required in the goodwill and other assets of the support services division alone. Overall, the group’s assets were overstated by some £120 million. </p>

The statements were dishonestly made, and the documents were forged. It was only on the basis of these alleged payments that the London<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>Contract appeared to be profitable. Moreover, on the basis of these supposedly increased payments, capital expenditure under the London Contract was treated as the sale of a finance lease, enabling alleged future revenue of nearly £7.59 million to be recognised in the 2009 accounts (and at least £13.1 million in the 2010 accounts). Another example was that the 2009 accounts reported bid costs for contracts of over £4.5 million within intangible assets. Such costs could be recognised in this way only if it was probable that the contracts would be obtained. Mr Shannon and Mr Flynn falsely and dishonestly reported that they would probably be obtained. Further, the false forecasts and cash flow statements meant that goodwill and other assets were not impaired as they should have been, and they enabled the accounts to be prepared on a going concern basis.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">AssetCo claimed damages for the following losses. First, a total of £23,348,675 was claimed in respect of sums provided to its loss-making subsidiaries between 31 March 2009 and 29 September 2011. These sums were provided by AssetCo from a group cash pool facility with the group’s bankers and represented loans to the subsidiaries. These loans were not repaid, and the judge found at [1239] that they were at all material times irrecoverable. The loans were in part funded out of £7.5 million, plus interest of £235,089, subscribed for preference shares in AADL under the PSA and out of an advance payment of just over £3.6 million made under the SOC contract. These payments were made in breach of the PSA agreement and formed an alternative claim for damages. It was common ground that this claim overlapped with the claim in respect of the loans to loss-making subsidiaries.  Second, profits of £1,435,817 made by AS Fire and Todd, which would have been available to AssetCo by way of dividend or otherwise, were used to support the loss-making subsidiaries. This second category does not essentially differ from the first, being simply another means by which AssetCo provided support to trading subsidiaries to cover their losses. Third, AssetCo itself incurred expenditure totalling just over £3.53 million which it would not have spent in the Counterfactual. This comprised just under £820,000 spent on management fees to AC Management Services, a company connected to NAV, between 24 July and 31 December 2009, and just over £2.7 million spent between Mr Davies’ appointment on 23 March 2011 and 7 July 2011. Fourth, £1.5 million was claimed in respect of a payment made by AssetCo in December 2009 under a fraudulent related party transaction with a company connected with Mr Shannon, Jaras Property Development Limited (Jaras). Fifth, just under £1.65 million was claimed in respect of dividends paid by AssetCo in September 2009 and November 2010. </p>

Ground 1(2) is that the judge erred in failing properly to consider whether trading losses claimed by AssetCo fell within the scope of GT’s duty, and in wrongly eliding scope of duty and legal causation. Ground 1(3) is that, as a result, the judge asked the wrong questions, and arrived at the wrong answers, when considering whether GT was responsible in law for the trading losses suffered. In particular, it is said that the judge failed to consider whether this was an “information” case or an “advice” case and, therefore failed to find that it was an information case and failed to ask the correct question, namely whether the claimed losses would have occurred even if the information provided by GT, by means of its unqualified audit reports, had been true.

As ground 1 was developed in argument, a central feature of the submissions of Mr Salzedo QC for GT was that the judge had misunderstood the common ground as to the conduct of the management of the AssetCo group both before and after the 2009 audit. This in turn led the judge to find in error the necessary connection between GT’s admitted failings in the performance of its audit duties and the losses claimed by AssetCo.  </p>

First, as set out in the second sentence, they made dishonest statements and provided fabricated evidence to the audit team. Second, as set out in the third sentence, management behaved dishonestly “[o]utside of the audit process”. In that category, the “overfunding” of assets and the forging and backdating of documents involved borrowings of some £13.3 million in excess of the cost of the assets and the dishonest use of fabricated invoices to mislead lenders. The excess sums were used to sustain the business. The misappropriation of monies is, as I understand it, a reference to using the PSA monies, which should have been retained for AADL, for the general purposes of the group. The fraudulent third party transactions were first concluded in FY2010, being in particular transactions with Jaras and Graphic Traffic Limited for the benefit of Mr Shannon. </p>

Sub-paragraph (3) is concerned with the PSA monies. GT itself submitted to the judge that Mr Shannon and Mr Flynn were well aware of the circumstances of this money. It is inconceivable that they did not know that its use was restricted by the PSA Agreement and that any use, save as permitted by the agreement, would be a breach of contract or, as GT submitted, a breach of trust. In FY2009, £3 million of the PSA monies had been used in ways not permitted by the agreement: see the judgment at [131]. I find it hard to see that any such use could be anything other than dishonest on their part. However, Mr Salzedo is right to say, so far as I can see, that the judge did not find that GT should have recognised dishonesty as regards the PSA monies in the course of the 2009 audit: see the judgment at [1041].  Sub-paragraph (4) concerns management’s statement that AssetCo had sufficient resources to continue as a going concern until June 2010. This was premised, at least in part, on the same dishonest representations concerning the unitary payment under the London Contract. Mr Salzedo submitted that sub-paragraph (4) added nothing to sub-paragraph (2), but I reject that.

The acceptance of fictitious income on the London Contract and its treatment as a finance lease resulted in the unjustified recognition of significant additional revenue in the FY2009 accounts. At [147], the judge said that the “overall result of GT’s negligence on AssetCo’s financial statements was significant and material. The Group’s assets were overstated by £120 million, profits and cash balances were also greatly overstated, and crucially, AssetCo was said to be able to continue as a going concern, when in fact it was insolvent”.

Although expressed there as a defence, the judge correctly proceeded on the basis that it was for AssetCo to establish that both these requirements were satisfied, as he made clear in the next following paragraph. He summarised the two issues as whether “the type of loss suffered was one from which GT owed a duty to protect AssetCo” (scope of duty) and whether “GT’s breach of duty was a legal or substantial cause of the loss” (legal causation). </p>

Second, the losses were suffered as a result of AssetCo continuing to trade “in a particular manner” (<span style="font-style:italic">Temseel Holdings v Beaumonts </span>[2003] PNLR 27 at [52]). AssetCo relied on what the judge said, by reference to GT’s opening<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>skeleton (para. 3),<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>was the common ground that AssetCo was run by Mr Shannon and Mr Flynn in a fundamentally dishonest way and also on the common ground in the Revised List of Issues that AssetCo was “ostensibly sustainable only on the basis of dishonest representations or unreasonable decisions made or taken by its management”. AssetCo submitted that every aspect of its business, including the wasted expenditure claimed as damages, was touched by the fraud of Mr Shannon and Mr Flynn. Third, in those circumstances, all of the losses suffered by it fell within the scope of GT’s duty. Fourth, the losses were legally caused by GT’s negligence and there was no break in the chain of causation, because the losses were the “very thing” that GT was under a duty to protect against (see <span style="font-style:italic">Barings plc v Coopers &amp; Lybrand (No 7) </span>[2003] EWHC 1319 (Ch), [2003] Lloyd’s Rep IR 566). </p>

There was therefore no link found by the judge between the false accounting and GT’s failure to detect it on the one hand and the trading and other losses incurred by AssetCo on the other. Without that link, the losses claimed by AssetCo could not fall within the scope of GT’s duty nor could its breaches of duty be the legal cause of those losses. There were some specific instances of dishonesty in the conduct of the business, such as overfunding, but it was not part of the case as set out in the revised List of Issues that GT should have detected them nor, except for the Jaras payment, were they were part of the claimed losses. GT did not accept, nor was it alleged or proved, that the business was as a general proposition being conducted in a dishonest, or fundamentally dishonest, manner.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">In my judgment, Mr Salzedo is correct to submit that [6] is not a statement of common ground that the business was being conducted in a fundamentally dishonest way. Rather, it is a statement that the senior management team’s conduct in the respects particularised in the following two sentences was fundamentally dishonest. The distinction is important. There are very many cases in which it is found that directors or managers have engaged in dishonest conduct in the course of running a business (as, for example, in the ways identified in the third sentence of [6]), without the entire business being run in a fundamentally dishonest way. The latter on the other hand occurs, for example, where the business is a Ponzi scheme or where the business can be continued only by taking on credit which the management knows cannot be repaid. It was not suggested that AssetCo and its group businesses fell into this type of category. There were dishonest transactions, such as the over-funding, but overall the problem with the operation of the main businesses of the London and Lincoln Contracts was that they were heavily loss-making, such that the group was insolvent and could not continue as a going concern. </p>

It may be noted that at [691] the judge said that it was common ground that a competent auditor would have discovered management dishonesty in relation to overfunding, but this appears to be an error: it does not feature as common ground in the Revised List of Issues or in the summary of agreed breaches of duty in the judgment at [87].    </p>

Counsel also made clear to the judge his submission that a failure to detect specific incidents demonstrating particular types of fraud in the conduct of a company’s business does not expose the auditor to liability for all losses resulting from fraud of all kinds. If, for example, the only negligence of an auditor was a failure to detect a fraudulent transaction with a company connected with a director, the auditor may well be liable for subsequent losses of a similar kind but will not be liable, when it is discovered that the company was operating as a Ponzi scheme, for all the losses resulting from the generally fraudulent conduct of the company’s business.

The business was in this way “ostensibly sustainable”. In other words, it was made to appear that it was sustainable when in truth it was insolvent. This occurred only because, as GT accepts, it negligently failed to detect that the position was being deliberately misrepresented to it in the respects set out in the judgment at [87].

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">The effect of these decisions was reviewed and applied by this court in <span style="font-style:italic">MBS</span>. As part of its business, the claimant building society issued fixed interest lifetime mortgage loans. It hedged its interest rate risk on those mortgage loans (the risk that the variable interest rates that it paid to acquire funds would exceed the fixed rate under the loans) by entering into interest rate swaps. From 2005, the claimant was required by accounting standards to include swaps at fair value in its balance sheet, the fair value being its mark-to-market (MTM) value at the balance sheet date. This exposed the claimant’s financial position, as stated in its balance sheet, to volatility arising from changes in MTM values. This could be mitigated by the use, if permissible, of hedge accounting. The defendant, which was MBS’s auditor, advised in April 2006 that it could apply hedge accounting, which was accordingly adopted in the accounts for each year from 2006 to 2011. As auditor, the defendant gave an unqualified audit report for those accounts, repeating its approval of the use of hedge accounting. From April 2006, the claimant relied on the defendant’s advice to enter into further lifetime mortgages and further long-term swaps. If the defendant had not so advised, it would not have entered into any further swaps and it would have broken the swaps it already held. </p>

At [54], Hamblen LJ said that the <span style="font-style:italic">SAAMCO </span>principle “may generally be addressed by considering the following” six questions. The first step is to consider whether it is an “advice” case or an “information” case, for the reasons which I have earlier set out. If it is an “information” case, the fifth step is that “the negligent adviser/information provider will only be responsible for the financial consequences of the advice and/or information being wrong”. (The reference is made there to “adviser” and “advice” because advice on a particular aspect of a proposed transaction or course of action, rather than advice on the merits of the transaction or course of action overall, makes it an “information” case: see <span style="font-style:italic">Hughes-Holland </span>at [39]-[41].)

In April 2006, the defendant gave accounting advice on one topic, the applicability of hedge accounting to the treatment of swaps in the claimant’s accounts. By giving an unqualified audit report for each of the years 2006 to 2011, the defendant implicitly repeated the advice it had given in April 2006. It was plain that the defendant’s responsibility was limited to giving accounting advice and never came close to extending to responsibility for the entire lifetime mortgage/swaps business ([70]). The correct question was therefore whether the claimant would have suffered the MTM losses if the accounting advice had been correct. For reasons that are immaterial for present purposes, it was held that the claimant had failed to prove that it would not have suffered those losses. </p>

In addition, and this is central to the present case, auditors are under a duty to use reasonable care and skill to identify and report the existence of fraud and dishonesty. The absence of a report of fraud or dishonesty is an implicit representation that none exists, which is negligently made if there was fraud or dishonesty that the auditor, exercising professional care and skill, should have detected.

There was no finding that the losses incurred in providing support to the subsidiaries was anything to do with management’s dishonesty in the preparation of the accounts.

The fact that the judge was not invited by either party to address it need not, in this case, inhibit this court from doing so. In oral submissions, Mr Salzedo put the point somewhat differently, saying that the underlying principle that recoverable losses must fall within the scope of the defendant’s duty was clearly put to the judge. He was asked to apply the right principle but came to the wrong answer.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">Moving to the substance of the point, Mr Templeman submitted that the <span style="font-style:italic">SAAMCO</span> principle, while a useful and workable test where professional information or advice is provided in the context of a specific transaction or a course of conduct then in contemplation, was not applicable to the very different context of an audit report to a company and its shareholders. In the case of the single transaction, the information or advice will form only part of the material which the recipient will consider before committing to the transaction. It is directed to the recipient taking a decision. In those circumstances, the provider of the information is liable only for the consequences of that information being wrong, determined by asking whether the loss resulting from the transaction would have been suffered even if the information had been correct. Mr Templeman drew attention to the numerous occasions in the judgment of Lord Sumption in <span style="font-style:italic">Hughes-Holland </span>when he referred to the principle as applying in the case of a specific transaction or course of action. The same is true of <span style="font-style:italic">MBS</span>. Although the relevant advice was given by MBS’s then auditors, it was directed specifically to whether MBS should continue to issue fixed rate mortgage loans hedged by interest swaps. It was given in the context of a specific proposed course of action and the subsequent audit reports were relevant only because they implicitly approved the advice previously given. Indeed, Hamblen LJ said at [50] that the <span style="font-style:italic">SAAMCO </span>principle provides a filter to eliminate certain losses from the scope of the defendant’s negligence “in cases where foreseeable losses are suffered <span style="font-style:italic">as a result of entering into a transaction</span> in reliance on negligent advice and/or information” (emphasis added).</p>

As he said, it would be unwarranted speculation to assume that unauthorised trading would start in the following year. In saying that the <span style="font-style:italic">SAAMCO </span>principle did not assist, Evans-Lombe J was referring to its inability to assist the auditors in their defence. The issue addressed by the judge was whether the auditors were liable for losses incurred after the start of and as a result of “Dollar Funding”, an improvident supply of funding from other Barings companies. While Evans-Lombe J considered that there was a reasonable common sense case for saying the auditors should not be liable for these losses, he concluded that they could not avoid liability save on a basis that might involve reopening their concession that the losses were foreseeable and not too remote: see [825].

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The claim for loss in respect of the Jaras transaction is, however, in my judgment to be treated differently. It involved Mr Shannon misappropriating company funds for his own personal benefit. There was no similar transaction in FY2009 and no negligence on the part of GT in respect of transactions of this type in its conduct of the 2009 audit. It might be said that directors who are prepared to lie and forge documents to deceive the auditors into accepting the company and the group as solvent and profitable are capable of any fraud in the conduct of the company’s business and it was GT’s negligence that allowed Mr Shannon to perpetrate this particular fraud. That, however, is no more than “but for” causation. There is no parallel between, on the one hand, the continuation of the loss-making trading businesses on the strength of dishonest statements to the auditors and, on the other hand, dishonest misappropriation of company funds, other than the presence of dishonesty. The absence of any such transaction, or any other misappropriation, in FY2009 meant that there was no reason to anticipate the transaction. There was no effective causal link between the transaction and GT’s negligence in the 2009 audit. I have earlier set out the passage from the judgment at [1001] where the judge held GT liable for this loss on the basis that it was “part of the management’s dishonest trading” and that it occurred “through AssetCo’s (continued) trading in a fundamentally dishonest manner”. In this paragraph, the judge is relying on the Jaras transaction as part of the fraudulent conduct of the business, but for the reasons earlier given, that is not a basis available on the common ground between the parties.  </p>

In its skeleton argument, GT restated without repeating its submissions on the judge’s error in proceeding on the basis that AssetCo had been run in a fundamentally dishonest way and that GT had a duty to detect it. In his oral submissions, Mr Salzedo said that legal causation could not be satisfied without a finding as to the causes of the losses suffered by AssetCo. In my judgment, as the judge found, the losses occurred because an insolvent business was allowed to continue when it was only “ostensibly sustainable” by reason of the failure of GT to detect the dishonesty of the audit representations made to it by management, such failure depriving AssetCo of the opportunity to which it was entitled of correcting the position. As Mr Salzedo said, the issue has been presented as essentially the same as scope of duty.           </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">GT challenges this conclusion on two principal grounds. First, even on his own findings, the judge was wrong to treat each third party contingency as a certainty. While in some cases he specifically assessed the relevant chance at 100%, in others he assessed them at, say, “not less than 90%”. He was wrong to round those chances up to 100% but should have treated them as 90% and multiplied the percentage chances of each contingency in order to find the overall chance of a successful scheme and restructuring in 2009 and awarded damages on that basis. Second, GT challenges the percentage prospects found by the judge in the cases of four specific contingencies, submitting he should have assessed the chances at a much lower level. When multiplied with the other percentages, this would of course produce a significantly lower overall chance and would therefore significantly reduce the quantum of damages. </p>

The evaluation of that chance was part of the assessment of the amount of the damages. He rejected the submission of AssetCo that where a claimant is able to prove on the balance of probabilities that the defendant’s breach has caused it to suffer loss, it is entitled to recover damages equal to the full amount of such loss, even where the claim depends on the hypothetical acts of third parties. This is not challenged by AssetCo. In such a case, while causation will be established and, for the purposes of quantification also, the claimant will have established what it would have done, the court must still evaluate the chance that the hypothetical would have occurred, essentially evaluating the chances that the relevant third parties would have taken the necessary action.  </p>

GT accepted that in principle NAV would have wanted to appoint Mr Davies to carry out investigations. The judge stated at [586] that “I am satisfied that not only is there a real and substantial chance, but it is an absolute certainty that once NAV (through Mr Mills) became aware of AssetCo’s financial problems Mr Mills, on NAV’s behalf, would have approached Mr Davies immediately by email and asked him to go on AssetCo’s board and carry out further investigations”. At [587]-[608], the judge considered whether Mr Davies would have accepted the offer of appointment, concluding as regards both Mr Mills asking Mr Davies to go on to the board  and Mr Davies agreeing to do so, that “there is no doubt in my mind that that is what they each would have done, and as such the probability …does not stand to be discounted in relation to this step”. </p>

This included about £1.46 million in respect of the scheme, which for the most part would not need to be paid until the scheme was approved.

As against a return of between nil and 0.54 pence in the pound on a liquidation, they would know that they stood to receive substantially more under a scheme; under the scheme in 2011, the return was 23 pence<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>in the pound. He had “no doubt” that NAV would have supported AssetCo during the period needed to investigate AssetCo’s position and propose the scheme.

No discount was required “to take account of any (hypothetical) action of trade creditors” and the evaluation of NAV supporting AssetCo in this period “does not stand to be discounted, and stands at 100%”. </p>

As regards creditors, GT’s submissions centred on the position of creditors that were subsidiaries of AssetCo, which would receive only a very small return under the scheme.

The judge was immersed in this material over an extended period and also received very lengthy and detailed written and oral submissions from the parties. His evaluation did not depend on any principles of law but was directed to very specific and fact-sensitive hypothetical issues, unique to this case. Leaving aside the oral evidence, many of the factors that are now recognised as reasons why appeal courts should be very slow to interfere with findings of fact also apply here: see, for example, <span style="font-style:italic">McGraddie v McGraddie </span>per Lord Reed at [3]-[4].

It was common ground that at 15 June 2009, over £7.7 million of the PSA monies remained in bank accounts in the name of AssetCo or AssetCo Group Limited. The judge found that Mr Mills would have taken legal advice and that he would have been advised that there was a good arguable case that the PSA monies were held on trust for AADL or for NAV and the other investors and that they could consider applying for a freezing injunction in respect of those funds. GT submits that the natural course would have been for NAV to take over AADL and demand the repayment to it of the PSA monies which it would have received. While NAV would have thereby suffered a loss on its investment, its losses would have been capped and it would not have exposed itself to unknown future losses.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">GT submits that the reasons given by the judge cannot support his conclusion. First, the prospect of an upside on the warrants to subscribe for shares in AssetCo was not cited by Mr Mills and is “incoherent”. The strike price was 61.2 pence per share which would not have been realistic in the Counterfactual. Second, the financial interests of AssetCo and NAV would have been aligned only if NAV provided financial support for AssetCo and cannot therefore provide a reason for NAV giving such support. I interpose here to say that this involves a misreading of what the judge said at [633]; it was a comment on the effect of support by NAV, not a ground for thinking that NAV would have given support. Third, the desire of the Abu Dhabi authorities “to contract with the mother ship” in February 2011 was after they had entered into the SOC Contract and before the true facts about AssetCo were known. It was of limited value in assessing NAV’s likely perception in June 2009. Again, I interpose to say that this does not properly reflect what the judge said at [634], his substantial point being that for other reasons NAV considered it important to have AssetCo in place when bidding for business in Abu Dhabi. The mother ship reference simply provided further support from Abu Dhabi for NAV’s view. Fourth, the judge did not properly address the “obvious problems” posed for NAV by Mr Shannon’s ability to block a restructuring as a result of holding shares carrying over 25% of the voting rights.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">Finally, the judge’s finding that NAV would have supported AssetCo in 2009 despite not knowing the true scope of its liabilities, unlike the position in 2011, was inconsistent with Mr Mills’ own evidence that he would not invest without knowing or thinking he knew the true extent of liabilities. There was no finding that it would have been possible to ascertain the extent of the liabilities that would have to be met before a scheme was approved in 2009. NAV would not therefore have been able to limit its short-term support.  This was a key difference between the situation in 2009 and in 2011 when NAV had been closely involved in AssetCo for some time, Mr Davies being appointed a director some six months before the scheme and after five weeks of dialogue. Further, AssetCo had raised capital of £16 million in March 2011 and it was not understood to be insolvent, although some creditors were pressing for payment.    </p>

He regarded AssetCo’s experience of the type of operations under consideration as important to obtaining any business in Abu Dhabi.

The scheme was proposed between the company and its creditors, but it was dependent on the capital restructuring to implement the debt for equity swap for which it provided. This required the passing of special resolutions, for which a majority of 75% of the votes cast was needed. As Mr Shannon in 2009 held shares carrying 37.5% of the votes, he could block a special resolution. Mr Flynn’s holding gave him only 9.85% of the votes and his position does not therefore need separate consideration. By contrast, in 2011 the combined holdings of Mr Shannon and Mr Flynn carried less than 25% of the votes, as a result of the capital raising earlier that year in which they did not participate.  </p>

As against this, GT pointed to his conduct in 2011 when Mr Shannon took steps contrary to the interests of AssetCo, although in the end he did not vote against the resolutions or take steps to oppose the scheme or restructuring. In 2009, when he had a blocking vote, GT submitted that he would have appreciated his bargaining power and used it to achieve advantages for himself.

Mr Shannon had pledged 8.8 million of his shares to a bank as collateral for a loan facility of £2.7 million. From January 2009, Mr Shannon was coming under increasing pressure from the bank to repay or refinance the facility. The judge considered that it was “far-fetched to suggest that Mr Shannon would ‘cut off his nose to spite his face’ in the situation he faced at that time”. A solvent solution was obviously in his best interests and, consistent with the belief of Mr Mills and Mr Davies, “I have no doubt that he would have approved (or not opposed) the various resolutions”. The judge also took account of the fact that Mr Shannon had less to cover up in the way of his own misfeasance as a director in 2009 than in 2011 and therefore had less to fear from AssetCo continuing to operate. The chances of Mr Shannon voting against the resolutions were “vanishingly small, and not such as would justify any discount of any damages recoverable”. </p>

The view that Mr Shannon would not cut off his nose to spite his face is undermined by the fact that under the capital restructuring the holdings of existing shareholders would have been virtually wiped out. On the same basis as the 2011 restructuring, shareholders would have received 1 new share for 1,000 existing shares. Mr Shannon would have held 26,963 shares in place of over 29.63 million shares, while 3.75 million new shares would have been issued under the scheme. His resulting shareholding would have been so small that it would not have saved him from his financial difficulties.

While it is fair to say that his holding after the scheme would have had a very small value, something is better than nothing, especially if the holder is facing possible bankruptcy and the shares or some of them are charged in favour of his principal creditor. Wilfully destroying such value as remained in the security is not likely to have been well received by the creditor.

GT was not specific, so far as I am aware, as to the form that this inducement would have taken, but if indeed it were provided to secure his support, it would of course have to be disclosed to the other shareholders.

In the only realistic alternative of an insolvent liquidation, it was estimated in the circular to creditors in 2011 that the return to creditors was likely to be between nil and 0.54p in the pound, the precise amount depending principally on the level of liquidation costs. Assuming, unrealistically, that the return would be 0.54p in the pound, AssetCo Emergency would receive approximately £350,000. </p>

To do so would be a breach of duty by the directors of those companies. It could not be in the interests of those companies to receive so much less than the amount offered to non-group creditors and, more importantly, less than the likely return in a liquidation. Counsel for GT accepted at the trial that a return of about half a penny in the pound is not much, but it was 50 times better than 0.01p in the pound.

As a result of the scheme, the subsidiaries would have a parent company with every prospect of being successful for itself and the group in the future. The directors of subsidiaries could reasonably decide that this, rather than “taking a chance” in a liquidation (as it had been put on behalf of GT), was in the best interests of their companies. When it was put to Mr Davies that the directors would have decided to take a chance with a liquidation, he said “I do not think any people inside a group would do something like that”.

Nor is it suggested that there were any differences between the circumstances in 2009 and 2011 material to this issue. No reason is put forward why the directors should have taken a different view in 2009 than the view they took in 2011.

Moreover, counsel for GT were unable to tell us whether, for example, AssetCo Emergency, which was simply an intermediate holding company, itself had any creditors whose interests the directors would have been required to consider. If it had no creditors, the directors would properly be guided by the interests of its parent company. It is also the case that the proposals announced in 2011, which it is assumed would have been mirrored in 2009, included arrangements for the London Group; see the judgment at [343]. As the holding company of the London Group, this would be an important consideration for the directors of AssetCo Emergency in deciding whether to support the scheme. </p>

As applied to the present case, GT accepted that steps 1 to 5 in the list set out by the judge at [353] were not independent. Step 1, the hypothetical discovery of AssetCo’s major problems in 2009 if GT had not been negligent, was admitted by GT and is not so much a contingency in the hypothetical as its starting point. Steps 2 to 5 all concern NAV, Mr Mills and Mr Davies. These steps were so closely linked that GT was content to treat them as a single contingency.

In submissions to the judge, counsel had accepted, indeed put forward, that in two circumstances a contingency with a 90% chance could be treated as a certainty. First, where the loss of a chance depended on a single contingency with a 90% probability, the contingency and hence the lost chance could be treated as a certainty. Second, where the loss of a chance depended on more than one contingency, and the result of multiplying the contingencies produced an overall chance of 90%, the lost chance could be treated as a certainty.

As regards the provision of financial support by NAV for AssetCo in return for Mr Davies’ appointment (step 3), the judge said that “there is no doubt in my mind that…NAV would have so agreed”, adding that the possibility of it not doing so can be dismissed, “such that the likelihood of such step is assessed as greater than 90% (and so as 100%)”.  The judge was satisfied that Mr Shannon and Mr Flynn would have been retained as employees for as long as AssetCo considered that necessary (step 4). Staving off insolvency pending a scheme (step 7) is directly linked to NAV’s agreement to support AssetCo until a scheme was approved. The judge again said that there was no doubt in his mind that NAV would have provided whatever funding was needed for this purpose and the evaluation of the chance of NAV doing so does not stand to be discounted “and stands to be assessed at 100%”. Taking those steps together, it is clear that the judge concluded that it was a certainty that they would all have occurred. The reference to the chance of support from NAV being assessed as greater than 90% and so as 100% is to be read with the rest of what the judge said about this chance, namely that there was no doubt in his mind that NAV would have agreed to provide support. </p>

Once a judge has assessed a chance as greater than 90%, an assessment that the chance is 93% or 96% or 99% lends a spurious degree of precision. It is not possible to assess the chances of the sort of events involved in the 2009 Counterfactual with such fineness. They are not events that can be tested in laboratory conditions. Having reached an assessment of greater than 90% for each contingency, he was, in my judgment, entitled in this case to treat it as being, in counsel for GT’s phrase, a “racing certainty”. This was not rounding up a 90% chance to a certainty but a conclusion that, within the confines of judicial decision-making, it was a certainty. </p>

All that you can do is to evaluate the chance. Sometimes it is virtually 100 per cent certain: sometimes virtually nil. But often it is somewhere in between.”. Stuart-Smith LJ continued: “…the evaluation of the chance is part of the assessment of the quantum of damage, the range lying somewhere between something that just qualifies as real or substantial on the one hand and near certainty on the other. I do not think it is helpful to seek to lay down in percentage terms what the lower and upper ends of the bracket should be”.  </p>

There was then no available chartering market and they claimed damages for loss of profits during the remaining two years. They took the decision to sell the vessel, which realised a price of $23.7 million. The expert evidence established that its value at the end of the two-year period would have reduced to $7 million.

The early termination of the charterparty did not necessitate a sale of the vessel. It was a decision taken by the owners on commercial grounds, independent of the termination. It was the absence of a relevant causal link that prevented the charterers from claiming this benefit. The analysis would be the same even if the owner’s decision to sell was driven by the lack of any work for the vessel.

In that case, the claimant provided a loan facility for a term of nine months to a property developer. Shortly before the expiry of that term, in reliance on a valuation provided by the defendant surveyors, the claimant lent £3.088 million to the developer, on terms that just under £2.8 million would be used to repay the indebtedness under the first facility and the balance of £289,000 to finance completion of the development. The indebtedness under the first facility was duly discharged. None of the indebtedness under the second facility was repaid. The claimant alleged that the valuation was negligent and claimed damages equal to the unpaid amount due under the second facility. The defendant surveyors applied to strike out the claim, except to the extent of the “new money” of £289,000. They argued that the amount applied in repaying the first facility was not recoverable because if (as had to be assumed) the claimant would not have made the advances under the second facility but for the surveyors’ negligence, the advances under the first facility would have remained unpaid.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Salzedo submits to us that the guiding principle was, where a benefit arises in a “but for” sense from the negligence of the defendant, it prima facie comes into account in order to maintain the basic compensatory purpose of damages, subject to rebuttal if the benefit is collateral in the sense that it arose independently of the circumstances giving rise to the loss. He accepted that the benefit must also be legally caused by the wrong, as required by <span style="font-style:italic">The New Flamenco</span>, but “the only way you can reconcile the three Supreme Court authorities” is to say that a benefit which is factually caused by the wrong is a benefit unless it is collateral or <span style="font-style:italic">res inter alios acta</span>. </p>

Although Mr Salzedo seemed to pray <span style="font-style:italic">Swynson </span>in aid of his submission, it is clear to me that it does not assist him. It was a case about avoided loss, not a benefit for which credit might be required. The claimant’s loan had been repaid and it had therefore suffered no loss. In the present case, AssetCo advanced some £23 million on inter-company loan account to subsidiaries. Those loans were never repaid or discharged for value. They were presumably at some point written off. AssetCo therefore suffered a loss which has not been made good. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Salzedo’s suggestion that the three Supreme Court cases needed to be reconciled suggests some inconsistency between them, although they were decided in quick succession without any adverse comments on the results or reasoning in the other cases. In my view, no reconciliation is required. As Mr Templeman submitted and the judge held, <span style="font-style:italic">The New Flamenco </span>is clear authority that “but for” causation is insufficient and that, before credit is given for a benefit, it must be shown to have been legally caused by the breach. This was acknowledged by Lord Sumption in <span style="font-style:italic">Tiuta </span>at [12] where he said that the general rule is that “where the claimant has received some benefit <span style="font-style:italic">attributable to the events which caused his loss</span>, it must be taken into account in assessing damages” (emphasis added), with the exception of collateral benefits. The reference to benefits being attributable to the events causing the loss encompasses legal, as well as factual, causation. The decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Tiuta </span>was not concerned with benefits. As Lord Sumption explained at [13], the repayment of the indebtedness under the first facility was not a benefit at all to the claimant. In order to identify the claimant’s loss, it was necessary to look at the whole transaction, the major part of which was to refinance the first facility. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Salzedo’s submission that the only benefits excluded from the quantification of loss are collateral benefits is inconsistent with <span style="font-style:italic">The New Flamenco</span>, which contains no suggestion that legal causation equates to factual causation in all cases except collateral benefits, and is inconsistent with the passage in Lord Sumption’s judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Tiuta </span>at [12] cited above. Indeed, the general principle underlying the exclusion of collateral benefits is that they are benefits “whose receipt arose independently of the circumstances giving rise to the loss” (per Lord Sumption in <span style="font-style:italic">Swynson </span>at [11]). It is the lack of a causal relationship that underpins their exclusion. Further, I consider the judge was right to say that the exclusion of collateral benefits is directed to the calculation of the claimant’s loss, not to whether credit must be given for a benefit in measuring the damages to be awarded for the claimant’s loss. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in">235.<span style="font-family:Arial"> </span>I can deal very shortly with the overdraft monies and the PSA monies. When AssetCo raised funds by way of overdraft, it became indebted to the bank in the same amount. It involved no benefit to AssetCo for which credit can be given. The same is true of the PSA monies but the reason is slightly more involved. AssetCo was not entitled by the terms of the PSA agreement to use the PSA monies for its own purposes, save for £5 million agreed with the investors. The monies were to be used solely in the promotion of AADL’s business. The PSA monies, or part of them, were in fact held in bank accounts of AssetCo but that did not affect the restrictions on their use. GT argued, for other purposes, that the monies were held by AssetCo on trust for AADL or (less plausibly) for the investors but, even if that was not the correct analysis, AssetCo was subject to contractual restrictions. Accordingly, when AssetCo in fact used £7.735 million of the monies for its own purposes, it immediately came under an equal liability to restore the monies for the sole use of AADL. As with the overdraft monies, the use of the PSA monies involved no benefit in a relevant sense for AssetCo.  </p>

Whether the receipt by a company of the subscription monies for an issue of shares is properly analysed as a benefit for these purposes may not be a straightforward question. AssetCo raised this issue before the judge, submitting that it is not a benefit but a neutral transaction, consistently with (it was submitted) the decision of the High Court of Australia in <span style="font-style:italic">Pilmer v Duke Group Ltd </span>[2001] HCA 31. The judge noted that, given his findings, the point was academic and, because he did not consider it to have been fully argued before him, he preferred to express no view on it. The point has not been revived before us and the appeal has proceeded on the basis that the receipt of the proceeds of a share issue is a benefit.  </p>

If GT’s wrong caused AssetCo to continue its loss-making activities, the same wrong caused it to raise the money to do so. It was no answer to say, as the judge did, that the proximate cause of the share issue in July 2009 was AssetCo’s need for cash, because its need for cash arose from its continued trading for which GT was, <span style="font-style:italic">ex hypothesi</span>, responsible. </p>

That must depend on the specific circumstances in which the funds were raised. So, if an asset which AssetCo owned before GT’s breach were sold after the breach, the proceeds of sale could not be said to be a benefit caused by GT’s breach. I pause to say that must, of course, be right. The asset could have been sold irrespective of GT’s breach and its sale would have no connection with GT’s breach. Moreover, it is not clear how a sale of an asset at market value could properly be called a benefit for these purposes; by selling the asset, the company would give full value for the cash price it received. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I am unable to accept this distinction. The share issue in July 2009 was undertaken in the course of the continuation of AssetCo’s “ostensibly sustainable” business. It was part and parcel of that business, as Phillips LJ put to Mr Templeman in the course of argument. To say that the need for cash was the effective or proximate cause of the share issue is no different from saying that the effective or proximate cause of AssetCo’s loans to its subsidiaries was their need for cash. In my judgment, the legal cause of both was the audit reports on the 2009 accounts that deprived AssetCo of the opportunity, which it would have taken, of putting a stop to its “ostensibly sustainable” business. The point was well put by GT in its closing submissions, quoted by the judge at [1065], when it said (assuming against itself that its negligence was the legal cause of the losses): “The necessity of raising further funds from equity investors…arose from AssetCo’s financial model which it is common ground would have been known if the audit had been competently performed”. </p>

This was the judge’s conclusion, although of course he did not rely on it as he had decided that the share issue was not legally caused by GT’s negligence: see the judgment at [1086].

While the investors would have no remedy against GT, they would have a remedy against AssetCo, if (as this argument assumes) they were misled into investing by fraudulent, reckless or negligent statements in, or omissions from, the share offer documents issued by AssetCo. If any such claims had been made, or (perhaps) might realistically have been made, the benefit of the proceeds of the share issue would be matched in whole or in part by a certain or contingent liability and, to that extent, would not be a benefit in the hands of AssetCo. Credit would not therefore, to that extent, be available to GT. In fact, no such claims were made and any such claim was, by the date of the trial, time-barred. In those circumstances, AssetCo received a substantial benefit from its continued trading as a result of management’s dishonest representations to the auditors. I see no reason in principle why GT, whose liability is for negligence, should be denied a credit for that benefit to AssetCo.  </p>

It was a response to the problems caused by AssetCo’s continued operation of an unsustainable business, rather than being part of it. I agree with the judge that this is entirely inconsistent with a sufficient causal nexus between GT’s breaches and this share issue. For the same reason, GT’s argument that the funds raised were applied, in part, in meeting prior liabilities incurred while AssetCo was still operating the business does not assist. That was part of the response to the prior unsustainable trading, not part and parcel of that trading. I should add that, contrary to the judge’s view, I would not regard the passage of time since the 2009 audit as relevant if the true position had not by March 2011 emerged, and in any event AssetCo had a parallel claim in respect of the 2010 audit.  </p>
