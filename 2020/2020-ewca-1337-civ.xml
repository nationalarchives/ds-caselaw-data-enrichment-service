	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">By orders of Simon J dated 7 March 2014 and Blair J dated 14 November 2014, the claimant (“VTB”) was granted separate summary judgments against the first defendant (“Mr Skurikhin”) for sums in Russian roubles equivalent, in total, to about £13.4m. On 12 June 2014 Eder J granted a worldwide freezing injunction against Mr Skurikhin (“the WFO”), freezing his assets up to £25m. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">VTB thereafter sought to enforce the judgments by obtaining possession of and selling three properties in Italy used by Mr Skurikhin and his family, worth about €17m (“the Properties”), the registered owner of the Properties being the second defendant (“Pikeville”), an English limited liability partnership. Pikeville’s membership shares are registered to the first to third respondents, who originally held them on trust for Mr Skurikhin, but since 2010 have held them for the fourth respondent (“Berenger”), a foundation incorporated in Liechtenstein. VTB contends that Mr Skurikhin either has a right to call for the assets of Berenger to be transferred to him or has de facto control of those assets.  </p>

	  <content>

On 7 June 2017 the same court concluded the bankruptcy proceedings and Mr Skurikhin was discharged from his liabilities to his creditors. VTB appealed that decision to the Arbitrazh Court of the West Siberia region and was partially successful as, on 18 December 2017, the appeal court confirmed that the bankruptcy proceedings had concluded, but set aside Mr Skurikhin’s discharge. Mr Skurikhin’s appeal against that decision was dismissed by the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation on 20 April 2018. </p>

The resolution of the board of Berenger stated that it was made “Due to [Mr Skurikhin’s] bankruptcy and its related harm to [Berenger]”. Accreda’s resolution stated that “One of the beneficiaries has lost his entitlement as a beneficiary. In accordance with the court’s decision of 7 June 2017, [Mr Skurikhin] was declared bankrupt.... [Mr Skurikhin] thus loses his ability to benefit of this trust”. Accreda passed a further resolution on 16 January 2019, irrevocably declaring that Mr Skurikhin was an excluded person, and would be treated as excluded since 18 June 2017. </p>

It was first suggested by Mr Meier that the beneficiary concerned did not know of the application for a Receivership Order in 2015 because Berenger did not have contact details for all beneficiaries (an assertion he later contradicted). Mr Meier later suggested that there was a sensitivity about contacting beneficiaries because not all of them knew that they were beneficiaries.    </p>

In that case a party belatedly complied with an unless order that they give disclosure of assets, and sought relief from the sanction of being debarred from defending the claim on the basis that circumstances had changed since a previous application for relief had been refused. The Supreme Court upheld the dismissal of that application, holding that belated compliance was not a material change of circumstance as the court had already determined, by previously refusing relief, that it was too late to comply.

For instance, if the late payment was explained by the individual having inherited a sum of money subsequent to the hearing of the first application which enabled him to pay; or if the company had gone into liquidation since the hearing of the first application and, unlike the directors, the liquidator was now able to raise the money.

I would not accept that it is necessary, before abuse maybe found, to identify any additional element such as collateral attack on a previous decision or some dishonesty, but where those elements are present the latter proceedings will be much more obviously abusive, and there will rarely be a finding of abuse unless the later proceedings involves what the court regards as unjust harassment of a party. It is, however, wrong to hold that because a matter could have been raised in earlier proceedings it should have been, so as to render the raising of it in later proceedings necessarily abusive. That is to adopt too dogmatic an approach to what should in my opinion be a broad, merits-based judgment which takes account of the public and private interests involved and also takes account of all the facts of the case, focusing attention on the crucial question whether, in all the circumstances, a party is misusing or abusing the process of the court by seeking to raise before it the issue which could have been raised before. As one cannot comprehensively list all possible forms of abuse, so one cannot formulate any hard and fast rule to determine whether, on given facts, abuse is to be found or not.” </p>

Indeed, the power exists precisely to prevent the court’s process being abused through the lawful and literal application of the rules, and most likely would not be needed or engaged where a party was acting unlawfully or in breach of procedural rules, where established rules of law or procedural sanctions would usually suffice to protect the court process. In my view <span style="font-style:italic">Thevarajah </span>is an example of such protection via the rules, alternatively the recognition of an issue estoppel, rather than a finding that the application in that case was an abuse of process.

If a party effected such a change immediately after losing the first hearing and issued a second application the very next day, that would self-evidently be an abuse, as Mr Lord QC, for Berenger, accepted in the course of argument. Equally, if a party waited several years before effecting such a change, then made a second application just as the other party, after incurring significant expense, was about to reap the benefit of the first order, that would also seem to be a clear abuse.  </p>

The application was not a genuine attempt by Berenger to discharge the receivers because Mr Skurikhin no longer had any interest in its assets, but was made at Mr Skurikhin’s behest and for his benefit because he, being in contempt of court, was not permitted to advance the argument himself.  The whole process was redolent with illegitimate collateral purposes, subterfuge and manifest unfairness.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It follows that Berenger was in breach of the WFO in excluding Mr Skurikhin as a beneficiary and so, as it accepts, for that reason Berenger cannot rely upon that exclusion as a basis for applying to discharge the Receivership Order and the application was accordingly an abuse. It is therefore unnecessary to determine the interesting but difficult question of whether, taken in isolation, excluding a discretionary beneficiary is a breach of a freezing order on the standard Commercial Court form, now contained in Appendix 11 of the Admiralty and Commercial Courts Guide 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> ed (2017). It is also unnecessary to decide whether Accreda was also in breach of the WFO, or whether Berenger was also in breach of the Receivership Order.  </p>

There could not be a clearer example of a wrongful and abusive process, one which the Judge was right to refuse to entertain.      </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Berenger’s contention was, and remains, that the valid irrevocable exclusion of Mr Skurikhin meant that he could not, thereafter, receive its assets, even by exercise of his mandate and de facto control. Mr Skurikhin therefore no longer had any enforceable right to call for the assets of Berenger to be transferred to him, and so cannot be regarded as the owner in equity of those assets. Berenger contended that the Receivership Order should therefore be discharged, both because it had no proper foundation as a matter of law, and because it had no utility as VTB, as a judgment creditor of Mr Skurikhin, would not be able to enforce against any assets realised and held by the receivers.    </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Judge rejected that contention in the following terms: “179…The issue is whether, although he is still a mandatory, the fact that he is now no longer himself named as a beneficiary removes the basis for the order. I accept that the trustee could not properly make a distribution directly to Mr Skurikhin himself, on his direction, in circumstances where he is no longer a beneficiary. However, his ability to direct that assets be distributed to any other beneficiary that he may choose (and, conversely, to prohibit any distribution to any other beneficiary that does not accord with his wishes) is undiminished. 180. The effect of Mr Skurikhin’s exclusion from Berenger is that all of the assets are currently held by Berenger on trust for Olympic, which in practice puts them under the control of Mr Meier (who, as I have found, is his trusted adviser and acts on his instructions), through Accreda Trustees. There is no bar to a distribution being made, via Olympic, to a new corporate entity established for that purpose, which the trustees have power to include amongst the class of beneficiaries of Olympic. Equally, Berenger can be instructed under the mandate to add a new “juristic person or institution” as a beneficiary. Mr Skurikhin has shown himself adept at using complex structures which have the effect of obscuring the beneficial ownership of assets and would have no difficulty at all in ensuring that he could still access the assets if he chose to do so. More straightforwardly, distributions can be made to another family member who is named as a beneficiary, Mr Skurikhin having agreed with that other beneficiary that they will take the assets as his nominee and pass them on as and when instructed and distributions can be withheld from any beneficiary who is not willing to accept a transfer on those terms. In those circumstances, I am not prepared to find that the basis for the Receivership Order has been destroyed by the exclusions …” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">On this appeal, Berenger argued that the Judge’s reasoning amounted to no more than speculation on the basis of hypothetical situations, wrongly taking into account how assets might be transferred to Mr Skurikhin by those entitled to receive them, rather than addressing his right to and interest in those assets.  Berenger further contended that the Judge failed to take into account that the assets would not belong to Mr Skurikhin, even if transferred to a company wholly owned by him, referring to <span style="font-style:italic">Lakatamia Shipping Co Ltd. v Su </span>[2015] 1 WLR 291.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgment the Judge was right to reject Berenger’s contentions for the reasons she gave. The decision of Christopher Butcher QC to appoint receivers was based on Mr Skurikhin’s control of Berenger, in particular by exercising his powers under a mandate agreement (the existence of which the deputy judge inferred, but which the Judge found as a fact). Indeed, the fact that Mr Skurikhin was a discretionary beneficiary of Berenger did not feature in the deputy judge’s reasoning. That control was in no way diminished by Mr Skurikhin’s exclusion as a beneficiary: it merely entails that he would have to route the assets through a nominee (which he would probably have done in any event) in order to receive them. As VTB put it in argument, nothing has changed at all.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">There is no merit in Berenger’s technical objections. Whilst it is of course correct that a shareholder of a company does not, in that capacity, have a beneficial interest in its assets, even if the shareholding is 100%, that does not address the situation where the company receives assets for no consideration and, on proper analysis, as nominee for or on trust for the shareholder.

I am in no doubt that their appointment will continue to serve a useful purpose.   </p>
