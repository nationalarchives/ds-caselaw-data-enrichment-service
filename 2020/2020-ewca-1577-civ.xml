On 17 March, officials within the Department contacted representatives of 20 local authorities asking for views on regulations that should be considered for amendment. On the same day, the Department wrote to certain adoption agencies and fostering agencies along the same lines. On 18 March, the Department circulated a note to the Association of Directors for Children’s Services (“ADCS”) seeking views on the proposals for regulatory amendment. Over the course of the next week, the Department received a range of responses from local authorities, Regional Adoption Agencies, service providers, the Local Government Association, ADCS, Cafcass and Ofsted addressing the question of whether any regulations should be amended. </p>

In submissions to us, Ms Jenni Richards QC on behalf of the appellant described what happened as a form of private discussion with one side but excluding anybody representing children in care.

We are advising amending the requirement to convene an adoption panel and the minimum number of panel members required would be reduced from 5 to 3 to ensure that adoption approvals and matches can continue even where there are a shortage of panel members because of Covid-19. The requirements for reviews and visits is [sic] also recommended to be amended during this period to provide maximum flexibility for agencies working with families.

They include provisions for making decisions about placements and timings for when placement decisions should be reviewed. We are proposing to amend regulations to remove some of the timescales around formalising a placement plan, moving from before a placement, or within five days of the start of a placement, to as soon as reasonably possible after the start of a placement. We would also relax deadlines for placement reviews, allow people who are not ‘connected persons’ to be approved as temporary foster carers and to increase the timescales of placement with a temporary foster carer. The duration of short breaks would also be expanded to allow increased flexibility and we propose to modify requirements around how visits to the child in placement are conducted and their placement reviews to provide greater flexibility.

We’re also suggesting amendments to provide flexibility around how independent visits are conducted and that the registered manager provide suitable facilities for young people to speak privately over the phone or other video-link facility if required to their parents, relatives, advocate etc. We are proposing amendments to enable children’s homes to enforce a deprivation of liberty that arises from cases where a young person is infectious or suspected of being infectious …. The above amendment would only capture cases where the young person has been deemed infectious or suspected of being so and couldn’t be used to generally enforce restrictions on movement.

Our intention is to continue to prioritise the needs of children whilst relaxing some minor burdens in order that local authorities can continue to deliver children’s services without being unnecessarily hindered by process in these extraordinary circumstances. Changes are being made to 10 sets of regulations which are outline[d] in the document attached. Most changes are small procedural changes to ease administrative burdens, allow visits and contact to take place remotely and relax strict timescales where possible. However, given a large proportion of foster carers are vulnerable to coronavirus, we are also making amendments to allow individuals who are not connected persons to the child, to be approved as temporary foster carers and extend the timescales for placements in an emergency. We consider most of these changes to be low risk and will support increased demand for services and staff and carer shortages who are ill with coronavirus. These amendments will be kept under continuous review and in place until the Coronavirus Act renewal date on 25 September.

Children in care are already vulnerable, and this crisis is placing additional strain on them – as most are not in school, less able to have direct contact with family and other trusted professionals, and facing the challenges of lockdown and anxiety about illness – all on top of the trauma they have already experienced. If anything, I would expect to see increased protections to ensure their needs are met during this period. </p>

The explanation for this is that ‘<span style="font-style:italic">waiting 21 days will put extraordinary pressures on local authorities, providers and services to try to meet statutory obligations while continuing to provide care for vulnerable children and young people during the outbreak</span>.’ However, the reports I have been receiving from local authorities are that staffing for social care is holding up well. It therefore appears that bringing these regulatory changes to ease excessive strain on a depleted workforce, and to do so without the opportunity for public scrutiny, is not justified.” </p>

She stressed that the government had always been clear that the temporary amendments should be used only when absolutely necessary and only if consistent with the overarching safeguarding and welfare duties that had remained in place. She reported that the Department’s monitoring has shown that the majority of the regulatory flexibilities had been rarely used. The most used related to the fostering and adoption regulations, in particular allowing medical reports to be considered at a later stage in the process and the relaxation around adoption panels. Virtual engagement with children and families had been used alongside face-to-face visits and in some respects had improved engagement with young people. The Minister stressed that it had always been the government’s position that the temporary arrangements would remain in place only for as long as they were needed and that the government had now concluded that the overwhelming majority of the regulations would expire as planned on 25 September. She was, however, minded to extend a small number of temporary changes for a further period, but this would be subject to further consultation. That consultation duly started two days later, and on this occasion included the Children’s Commissioner and other agencies involved with children’s rights. </p>

S.22C makes provision for the accommodation and maintenance of “looked-after” children (defined in s.22 as meaning children in the care of the local authority under Part IV of the 1989 Act or being provided with accommodation by the authority in the exercise of its statutory functions). Unless it would not be consistent with the child’s welfare, or would not be reasonably practicable, the local authority must make arrangements for the child (“C”) to live with a parent, or with some other person with parental responsibility, or (in respect of a child subject to a care order) with a person named as a person with whom C was to live in a child arrangements order in force immediately prior to the care order: </p>

The power of public authorities to change policy is constrained by the legal duty to be fair (and other constraints which the law imposes). A change of policy which would otherwise be legally unexceptionable may be held unfair by reason of prior action, or inaction, by the authority. If it has distinctly promised to consult those affected or potentially affected, then ordinarily it must consult (the paradigm case of procedural expectation). If it has distinctly promised to preserve existing policy for a specific person or group who would be substantially affected by the change, then ordinarily it must keep its promise (substantive expectation). If, without any promise, it has established a policy distinctly and substantially affecting a specific person or group who in the circumstances was in reason entitled to rely on its continuance and did so, then ordinarily it must consult before effecting any change (the secondary case of procedural expectation). To do otherwise, in any of these instances, would be to act so unfairly as to perpetrate an abuse of power.” </p>

In <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">R (Osborn) v Parole Board</span><span style="font-style:italic"> </span>[2013] UKSC 61, this court addressed the common law duty of procedural fairness in the determination of a person's legal rights. Nevertheless the first two of the purposes of procedural fairness in that somewhat different context, identified by Lord Reed in paras 67 and 68 of his judgment, equally underlie the requirement that a consultation should be fair. First, the requirement ‘is liable to result in better decisions, by ensuring that the decision-maker receives all relevant information and that it is properly tested’ (para 67). Second, it avoids ‘the sense of injustice which the person who is the subject of the decision will otherwise feel’ (para 68). Such are two valuable practical consequences of fair consultation. But underlying it is also a third purpose, reflective of the democratic principle at the heart of our society. This third purpose is particularly relevant in a case like the present, in which the question was not ‘Yes or no, should we close this particular care home, this particular school etc?’ It was ‘Required, as we are, to make a taxation-related scheme for application to all the inhabitants of our Borough, should we make one in the terms which we here propose?’” </p>

The first is that the Defendant was facing an unprecedented situation in March and April 2020 and the decisions that were made have to be considered in that context. The advice being given by SAGE [the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies] in February 2020 was of a realistic worst-case scenario of social worker absences through sickness from Covid-19 of 35% as a weekly average and rising to a peak of 41%, and an excess death toll of 828,000. Happily, nothing approaching those figures occurred and the strains on the sector although great have not been of that scale. However, that is what the Defendant had to be planning for and the fairness of the consultation has to be judged in the light of the advice the Defendant was receiving at the time.  </p>

A large proportion of LACs [looked-after children] are living with foster carers and foster carers are, as a group, likely to be older and thus more vulnerable to Covid-19. These were important factors in the Defendant considering it to be critical to introduce more flexibility into the system in the light of the crisis. </p>

In each of the seven specific regulations that the Claimant refers to, the protections in the original Regulations are important ones. I fully accept the Claimant's submission that the children subject to these Regulations are particularly vulnerable. Many local authorities in the field do not manage to provide a good enough level of service and this leaves already very vulnerable children highly exposed to risk. When things do go wrong it can be catastrophic for the children involved. In those circumstances, the importance of having regular visits; senior officer oversight by nominated officers; some independence through independent reviewing officers and independent adoption panels cannot be overstated. These are not administrative burdens, or minor matters, they are fundamental parts of a scheme of protecting vulnerable children. Each has been introduced over time precisely because of the risks that LACs face and the need for safeguards to be in place. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The Defendant's position is that he was concerned to discover through the consultation what urgent changes were needed by providers to make sure that they could continue to deliver vital services to protect children. This was in the face of the pandemic and in particular the very high staff shortages, including lack of foster carers, that were being predicted. Therefore, the Defendant was entirely focused on asking that question of the people who were providing the service. I accept that there is inevitably another side to that question which is what is the impact on children of introducing flexibility. In normal circumstances there can be no possible doubt that the Defendant would have had to ensure that he was consulting a range of people in order to ensure that he was getting a full answer to the question posed. In particular I have no doubt that in normal circumstances he would have been under a duty to consult the Children's Commissioner whose very statutory purpose was to put forward the views of children and promote their welfare. </p>

Firstly, these were not normal times and the sector was facing an unprecedented crisis that would impact on the welfare of LACs. The Defendant had to make very quick decisions to protect those children in as effective a way as possible. To do that it was reasonable to focus on the providers of services to explain what they thought was needed in the very short term. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly, those providers were themselves considering the welfare of the children they were caring for. I entirely accept the Claimant's case as to the importance of hearing from both children themselves and those advancing their rights and that local authorities and providers do not represent those children. There will in some cases be a conflict between the wishes and interests of providers and those of LACs. However, that is not to say that the providers who were consulted were ignoring the need to protect the children and continue to seek to protect their welfare. This is shown quite clearly by the ADCS using a RAG [red – amber – green] rating of the Regulations in order to understand which were the most important to safeguard children. This is not a situation where the interests of the children were simply not taken into consideration through the consultation. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">I agree with the Claimant that the Children's Commissioner could have been consulted. Although matters were urgent there was time for many providers and not just local authorities to be consulted. There is no evidence that there was a positive decision not to consult the Commissioner but Ms Ward could give no very clear explanation as to why the Children's Commissioner was not consulted save that the focus was on those providing services. In anything less than a national crisis of quite such urgency I would have been minded to find that the consultation was not lawful if the Commissioner was not consulted. However, given the very particular focus of what the Defendant had to decide in amending the 2020 Regulations, the extreme urgency and the scale of the issues facing the Defendant in March-April 2020, I do not think there was an error of law in not consulting either the Commissioner or the Claimant. Although the comment in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">R</span><span style="font-style:italic"> </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">(Christian Concern) v Secretary of State for Health</span> [2020] EWHC 1546 about the circumstances of the pandemic potentially overriding any legitimate expectation were <span style="font-style:italic">obiter</span>, it is in my view apposite. A legitimate expectation that arose in normal circumstances would not give a right to consultation in the circumstances of dealing with the pandemic in Spring 2020. In terms of conducting a fair consultation I do not consider that something had gone clearly and radically wrong in the consultation.” </p>

In addition, he was under a duty to consult at common law generally because there is an established practice of consultation in this area. Ms Richards drew attention to the observation in the preaction response that “it is of course in any event the Secretary of State’s usual practice to carry out appropriate consultation whenever substantive changes are made to regulations”. She submits that, as recognised by the judge, the changes made by the Amendment Regulations were unarguably substantive. Further, the appellant submits that the Secretary of State was also a under a duty to consult at common law because of the significant impact of the Amendment Regulations on highly vulnerable lookedafter children. The unprecedented nature and impact of the pandemic on the lives of vulnerable children, and the extent of the proposed changes, required such a consultation before the changes were finalised and implemented. In those circumstances, it is submitted that the case falls within the fourth category identified in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Plantagenet Alliance</span> where a failure to consult leads to conspicuous unfairness.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Ms Richards put forward five submissions in support of her argument that the judge’s decision was wrong. First, the judge erred in failing to apply the logic of her factual finding that, notwithstanding the pandemic, the respondent did have time to consult the Children’s Commissioner. Instead, the judge appears to have given the fact of the pandemic some intrinsic relevance in reaching her conclusion. The <span style="font-style:italic">obiter</span> observations of the Divisional Court in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">R (Christian Concern) v Secretary of State for</span><span style="font-style:italic"> </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Health and Social Care</span> have no relevance to the decision in this case in which the respondent chose to carry out the consultation but on an entirely one-sided basis and not involving those most directly affected by the changes.  Secondly, the judge rightly rejected the argument that it was unnecessary to consult the Commissioner because the changes were “minor” and “administrative” but again failed then to apply the logic of that finding, which was that the Commissioner ought to have been consulted about changes of this kind. Third, it is submitted that the judge failed to provide any rational justification for concluding that the failure to consult the Commissioner was lawful in circumstances where she had expressly stated that, but for the pandemic, she would have found the respondent to be under such a duty. Fourth, it is submitted that the judge’s conclusion that local authorities could adequately represent the interests of children in care is unsustainable. The appellant asserts that the interest of views of local authorities cannot simply be aligned with those of children in care where, as the </p>

Furthermore, the idea that children require representation independent of local authorities is well recognised by Parliament, and is demonstrated, for example, by the creation of the post of Children’s Commissioner. Finally, it is submitted that the judge also erred in failing to find that in the specific context fairness also required proportionate consultation with other children’s rights organisations and with children themselves. </p>

There was no statutory duty to consult nor any legitimate expectation to do so. A limited number of the regulations amended under the Amendment Regulations were subject to the duty to consult under s.22(9) of the Care Standards Act 2000 but on the facts of this case there was no breach of that duty. Even if there was a legitimate expectation of consultation, it was overridden in the particular circumstances of this case. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The duty to consult is fact-specific and varies greatly from one context to another. Mr Sheldon stresses the context in which the Amendment Regulations were introduced, namely the global pandemic and its anticipated effects on this country. At the time the decision was made to proceed with the amendments, the government was operating on the basis of scientific advice of a reasonable worst-case scenario forecast including workforce absences of 17 to 20%, several million people requiring health assessments, 1.3 million people in hospital for an average of six days, and some 820,000 excess deaths. In the children’s social care context, it was anticipated that there would be significant reductions in the available workforce due to sickness, selfisolation and caring responsibilities, at the same time as a potential increase in demand for children’s social care services. The Department, in common with government as a whole, was seeking to respond responsibly to a fast-moving situation on the basis of incomplete information about the true effect of the virus. </p>

It is submitted on behalf of the Secretary of State that, in the context of this particular decision-making process, as recognised by the judge, the interests of providers and interests of children were aligned. Everyone involved was seeking to ensure that services could continue to function for the benefit of the most vulnerable children notwithstanding the pandemic. </p>

Secondly, they incorporated a review mechanism which allowed a much wider pool of stakeholders, including children’s charities and the Children’s Commissioner, to provide feedback to the Department on the operation of the amendments. Thirdly, revised guidance (as published in July 2020) stressed that the amendments “should only be used when absolutely necessary, with senior management oversight, and must be consistent with the overarching safeguarding and welfare duties that remain in place.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In so far as there was a statutory duty to consult under s.22(9) of the Care Standards Act 2000 in respect of the 2015 Regulations, it is submitted that the Secretary of State complied with his obligation to consult such persons as he considered appropriate. In the context of the pandemic, any failure to consult the Children’s Commissioner and/or the appellant cannot be described as unreasonable or so unfair as to be unlawful. As for the common law obligations to consult, it is submitted that no legitimate expectation arose in the circumstances, whether on the basis of past practice or exceptionality. The basis on which the appellant seeks to assert that there was a legitimate expectation does not have the “requisite clarity, unequivocality and unconditionality” necessary to give rise to such an expectation. There was no established practice of consultation which could be characterised as “so unambiguous, so widespread, so well-established and so well-recognised” as to establish an obligation to consult. By his respondent’s notice, the Secretary of State invites the Court to conclude that the judge’s finding to the contrary at paragraph 78 of her judgment was erroneous. It is submitted that the appellant’s alternative arguments as to an exceptional duty to consult lack substance. The simple fact that the pandemic was unprecedented cannot form a basis for a duty to consult. On the contrary, the judge had been correct to hold, in line with the <span style="font-style:italic">obiter</span> observations of the Divisional Court in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">R (Christian Concern) v Secretary of State for Health and Social Care</span>, that any legitimate expectation to be consulted in normal circumstances would not give rise to a right to be consulted in the exceptional circumstances of the pandemic. The question was not whether there was, literally, sufficient time to consult the Children’s Commissioner or other bodies but whether the failure to do so was unlawful in the light of the context of the pandemic. In oral submissions Mr Sheldon accepted that consulting the Children’s Commissioner and others might have been helpful to those drafting the regulations but submitted that the failure to do so was not unlawful. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In his further submissions, Mr Sheldon draws attention to the fact that the Dunford report had specifically considered but rejected a proposal that a statutory requirement to consult the Commissioner on law and policy relating to children should be introduced. In turn, that proposal was not adopted by Parliament when enacting the 2014 Act. Furthermore, Parliament did not adopt a recommendation in the Dunford report that a mechanism be found to ensure that the Commissioner is alerted to new policies or laws sufficiently early in the process for his or her advice to make a difference. Mr Sheldon submits that the fact that, when expanding the role of the Commissioner in 2014, Parliament chose not to introduce a duty to consult the Commissioner is relevant when determining the extent of any such duty. He contends that it is particularly significant that Parliament chose that course notwithstanding the fact that, under the amended s.2(4) of the 2004 Act introduced in 2014, the Commissioner was given extended duties and powers in respect of children living away from home or receiving social care. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In reply, Ms Richards contends that the respondent has erected a “straw man” by raising these issues since it has never been any part of the appellant’s case that the respondent was under a statutory duty to consult the Children’s Commissioner. Rather, the appellant’s case has always been and remains that it was unlawful for the respondent to fail to consult with the Commissioner (and others with a specific focus on children’s rights) through the wholly one-sided consultation process on which he embarked. Ms Richards adds, however, that, insofar as points arising from the Dunford report have any relevance to the issues on this appeal, they tend to reinforce rather than undermine the appellant’s case that it was irrational and/or conspicuously unfair for the respondent to make these changes without consulting the Commissioner. Through the 2014 Act, Parliament amended the statutory scheme to give the Children’s Commissioner powers which can only properly be exercised if she is made aware of proposed policy and legislation. This is most obviously the case in relation to the power under s.2(3)(d) “to consider the potential effect of government policy proposals and government proposals for legislation” but also applies to her other powers under s.2. In particular, the appellant draws attention to the amended s.2(4) which requires the Children’s Commissioner to have “particular regard to the rights of children who are … living away from home or receiving social care … and other groups of children who the Commissioner considers to be at particular risk of having their rights infringed”. Ms Richards points out that the Amendment Regulations directly affect precisely this cohort of children. In those circumstances, it is submitted that it was irrational for the Secretary of State to act in a way which frustrated the Children’s Commissioner’s exercise of the significant new powers given to her by Parliament following extensive review. </p>

It is important that children and prospective adopters are both individually suitable for adoption and are a good match. The appellant points out that, where adoptions go ahead in the absence of these conditions, they are likely to break down and thereby cause a significant amount of trauma to all involved, with long-term adverse consequences for the child’s wellbeing. Adoption panels contribute vital independent security and quality assurance to the pre-court adoption process. Their functions include recommending to the adoption agency whether a particular child should be placed for adoption, advising whether an application for a placement order should be made, and advising, where relevant, on any contact that the child may have with their birth family. Adoption panels consider and recommend whether prospective adopters are suitable to adopt a child and whether a particular child should be placed for adoption (“matched”) with prospective adopters. The Statutory Guidance on Adoption published by the Secretary of State in July 2013 describes, at paragraph 1.19, how “adoption panels perform an important role in assisting the agency to reach the best possible decision …. Panels play an important quality assurance role, providing objectivity and having the ability to challenge practice which is felt not to be in the interests of children or to fall short of the regulations ….” </p>

The appellant submits that the conversion of the duty to constitute an adoption panel into a discretion to do so is obviously disproportionate, having regard to the centrally important quality assurance role played by the panels.  </p>

An out-of-area foster placement describes a situation where a child is placed with foster carers living outside the local authority’s area. In some cases, this placement may be many miles away in a different part of the country. Such a move may be in the child’s best interests – for example, in the case of older children, to move them away from harmful relationships – but comes at a cost of cutting them off from family support, educational settings and other local connections. As the appellant points out, it is more difficult for local authorities to monitor the child’s welfare when they are placed many miles from their home area. Such moves are generally considered detrimental and, under s.22C(6) and (9) of the Children Act 1989, a local authority is under a statutory obligation to provide the child with accommodation within its area “unless that is not reasonably practicable”. For those reasons, the 2010 Regulations provide additional procedural safeguards where a local authority seeks to move a child out of area. Under regulation 11, any decision to place a child out of area must be approved by a nominated person who must satisfy themselves that a number of factors have been addressed. Regulation 11(4), however, exempts from these safeguarding mechanisms placements made under regulation 24, namely where the placement was with a “connected person”, defined as “a relative, friend or other person connected with” the child. In the case of such placements, there is no requirement under the 2010 Regulations for prior approval by a nominated person. Instead, the local authority is empowered to approve that person as a local authority foster parent for a temporary period not exceeding 16 weeks, provided they comply with further specified requirements. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Regulation 8(11) of the Amendment Regulations amended regulation 24 of the 2010 Regulations by expanding its provisions so that it applied not merely to placements with “connected persons” but to all foster placements. On behalf of the respondent, it is said that the inclusion of unconnected persons during the pandemic was intended to cater for a scenario in which there were no known relatives or connected people able to provide emergency care for a child where their parents contracted Covid-19, or in the eventuality of their death. This increased flexibility would enable the right placement to be found quickly and not be constrained by geographical limitations in circumstances where the available pool of approved foster carers may be significantly reduced as a result of foster carers being ill or declining new placements for fear of contracting the virus. The appellant submits that as a result of this amendment, regulation 24 was vastly expanded in scope so as to allow the temporary approval of not just connected persons but any persons not yet approved as foster carers. It is submitted that this effectively allowed children to be moved out of area, to live with persons unconnected to them in any way and who had not yet even been approved as foster carers. All of this was permitted without the significant procedural safeguard of the oversight of a nominated person. </p>

As the appellant points out, however, such placements can be very contentious for birth parents since they often follow an assessment by the local authority that the child is unlikely to return to their care. The appellant contends that such arrangements are therefore extremely sensitive and require careful professional scrutiny and oversight. For that reason, sub-paragraph (2) of regulation 22A provides that a decision to place a child in such a placement must not be put into effect until it has been approved by a nominated officer and, <span style="font-style:italic">inter alia</span>, sub-paragraph (3) imposes obligations on the nominated officer to be satisfied, <span style="font-style:italic">inter alia</span>, that the placement is the most appropriate placement available for the child and will safeguard and promote his or her welfare. Regulation 8(8) of the Amendment Regulations removed sub-paragraph (2) entirely. As a result, there is no requirement for a nominated officer to approve such a placement. Sub-paragraph (3) is amended so as to require the authority to ensure that the requirements therein are satisfied. </p>

Regulation 28 of the 2010 Regulations establishes three types of statutory timescales for social work visits to children in care. They must be visited within one week of starting a new placement, and then every six weeks for the first year of the placement, and then every six weeks or every three months thereafter, depending on the circumstances. Children in long-term placements can, with their consent, be visited only twice a year. The appellant contends that the statutory timescales are of particular importance. One source of present concern is that more than 6000 looked-after children are placed in unregulated settings, many of which are outside the area of the responsible local authority. The appellant contends that regular and timely social work visits are essential to safeguard the welfare of all looked-after children, but especially those who are at risk of sexual exploitation or of being exploited by criminal gangs, children who are in unregulated settings, and children settling into new placements. </p>

The justification for this amendment, according to the respondent, is that where a local authority is unable to comply with the timescales due to the exigencies of the pandemic, it should not automatically be in breach of the law. The appellant submits, however, that this provision was likely to have an adverse effect on some of the most vulnerable looked-after children, including children in new placements, institutional settings, and unregulated placements.

The safeguards are less stringent in terms of planning, visiting requirements and reviews. Under regulation 48, this modified form of looked-after status applies where a child is using overnight short breaks for up to and including 75 days in a year in the same setting, but where each individual short break lasts for 17 days or less. Under the Amendment Regulations, the modified form of looked-after status was extended to all children using overnight short breaks for no more than 75 days a year, irrespective of the timescale of the individual short break or the number of different settings used. </p>

The appellant submits that in many cases there would be a greater need for respite care, given the additional strains resulting from those restrictions.

The regulations which were under consideration for amendment are an integral part of the whole statutory scheme governing children’s social care. They supplement, support and amplify the provisions in the principal statutes. Thus, for example, the provisions in the 2010 Regulations about out-of-area placements, including regulation 11, supplement the statutory obligation under s.22C(7) and (9) of the 1989 Act to place a child within the local authority area “unless that is not reasonably practicable”. Similarly, the provisions in the 2010 Regulations about connected persons, including regulation 24, supplement the statutory provisions in s.22C(6) and (7). The provisions governing adoption panels in the 2005 Regulations supplement the statutory powers granted to local authorities under s.18 of the 2002 Act to place a child for adoption. </p>

Although Mr Sheldon in his submissions to this Court disclaimed any characterisation of the Amendment Regulations as “minor”, that is precisely how they were described in the initial email to the Children’s Commissioner sent on 16 April 2020. This suggests to me that the Department may not have fully appreciated the potential impact of the proposed amendments on children in care. Contrary to what was said in the Child Rights Impact Assessment produced by the Department’s Children Rights Team on 15 April 2020, the amendments manifestly had the potential to change the substance of the services being provided to children in care. For example, I entirely agree with the judge’s observation that the potential impact of allowing a child to be placed with a stranger who is not a family member hardly needs stating, particularly in circumstances where there may be no nominated officer oversight. I also agree with her about the importance of regular visits to children in care within a fixed time scale, particularly in the context of placements out of area and given the very large number of children at present placed in unregulated settings. On any view, these amendments, taken as a whole, represented a significant change in the substantive provision of services to children.  </p>

I accept Ms Richards’ submission that the Secretary of State, having chosen to carry out a consultation, conducted it on an entirely one-sided basis and excluded those most directly affected by the changes<span style="font-style:italic">. </span>Had they been included, the Secretary of State would have unquestionably been better informed about the impact of<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>the proposed amendments on the vulnerable children most affected by them. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Secondly, I conclude that there was an established practice of consulting the Children’s Commissioner and other bodies representing children’s rights when considering regulatory changes of this sort. It was acknowledged in the pre-action response served prior to the issue of this claim that “it is of course in any event the Secretary of State’s usual practice to carry out appropriate consultation whenever substantive changes are made to regulations”. The judge accepted, and I agree, that an “appropriate consultation” about regulatory changes in this area manifestly must include those organisations concerned with the rights of children, including children in care, and, in particular, the Children’s Commissioner. Prior to the introduction of the 2015 Regulations, the Department carried out an open consultation on the proposed changes. Although we were not referred to it in the course of submissions, the published government response to that consultation (which is available on the internet) indicates that the Children’s Commissioner not only responded to the consultation but facilitated a number of consultation events with children and young people. Several other organisations concerned with the rights and interests of children in care also responded to the consultation, including The Care Leavers Association, the National Youth Advocacy Service, and the NSPCC. Thus in contrast to the position in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">R (C) v Secretary of State for Justice</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">R (Christian Concern) v</span><span style="font-style:italic"> </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Secretary of State for Health and Social Care</span>, there had been consultation with the Children’s Commissioner and other bodies representing children’s rights before the introduction of at least some of the original regulations amended by the Amendment Regulations. </p>

I can find nothing about the circumstances that existed in March 2020 to justify the Secretary of State’s decision (if indeed any conscious decision was made) to exclude the Children’s Commissioner and other bodies representing the rights of children in care from the consultation on which he embarked. He decided to undertake a rapid informal consultation, substantially by email. In the circumstances, it was plainly appropriate for the consultation to be conducted in that fashion, rather than a more formal, drawn-out process. But having decided to undertake the consultation, there was no good reason why that process should not have included the Children’s Commissioner and the other bodies. On the contrary, there were very good reasons why they should have been included.  </p>

They were plainly better equipped to do so than the local authorities and care providers whom the Secretary of State chose to consult. In so far as the judge concluded in the circumstances of this case that the interests of children would be sufficiently protected by consulting the providers, I respectfully disagree. The assertion in the submission to ministers on 6 April that the principles to be followed in making decisions were “broadly endorsed by the sector” was, in my view, potentially misleading. The “sector” plainly included not merely local authorities and service providers but also all those engaged or involved with children’s social care, including those bodies whose focus was on children’s rights. </p>

She, and other bodies, had been consulted before as part of the Department’s established practice. The fact that Parliament, when amending and expanding the role and powers of the Children’s Commissioner in 2014, chose not to include any general statutory duty to consult the Commissioner does not, in my view, assist in deciding whether there was a duty to consult on this occasion. I accept Ms Richards’ submission, however, that, given the expanded powers and duties of the Commissioner found in s.2(3) and (4) of the Children Act 2004 as amended, once the Secretary of State decided to carry out a brief informal consultation about the proposed Amendment Regulations, it was irrational and unfair not to include the Commissioner in that consultation. </p>

First, the extension of the consultation to organisations representing children’s rights would unquestionably have informed the Secretary of State’s decision about the amendments. In the context of the pandemic, when faced with difficult decisions about how to protect children’s social care services, it was surely right to seek a wide range of views so that the proposed amendments could be properly tested. Secondly, it was manifestly in the interests of the vulnerable children who would be most affected by the proposed amendments that those agencies and organisations representing the rights and interests of children in care should be consulted. Thirdly, given the range of regulations under review, and the potential impact of the proposed changes across the country, a wider consultation was clearly, in Lord Wilson’s words, “reflective of the democratic principle at the heart of our society”. Such consultations help to ensure protection against arbitrary decisionmaking. </p>

Mr Sheldon conceded that it was not part of the Secretary of State’s case that there was insufficient time to consult the Children’s Commissioner and other bodies representing children’s rights. I can see no argument why the Children’s Commissioner and the other representative bodies could not have been consulted in the same relatively informal way (by email) as was adopted by the Secretary of State in the two or three weeks or so when which he was consulting the local authorities and other providers. </p>

In the original claim, the appellant sought a declaration that the Amendment Regulations “were unlawful and/or appropriate declaratory relief to reflect the judgment of the court” and “an order quashing<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>the 2020 Amendment Regulations”. In the course of oral argument, however, Ms Richards indicated that the appellant no longer sought a declaration of <span style="font-style:italic">ultra vires</span> or a quashing order and would be content with a declaration that the regulations were unlawful by reason of the failure to consult. </p>
