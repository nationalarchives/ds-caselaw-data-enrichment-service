	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The most common way of enforcing an unpaid money judgment is by seizing,  and if necessary selling, goods of the judgment debtor.  From mediaeval times until the twenty-first century, this could be done in England and Wales by issuing a writ of <span style="font-style:italic">fieri facias</span> (or <span style="font-style:italic">fi fa</span>) and delivering it to the sheriff for execution.  The writ was so called because it commanded the sheriff <span style="font-style:italic">quod fieri facias de bonis et catallis </span>(that you cause to be made of the goods and chattels) of the debtor the sum to be recovered.       </p>

	    <p style="margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">2007 (the “TCE Act”) which came into effect on 6 April 2014.  By section 99 and Schedule 7 of the Courts Act, writs of execution issued from the High Court are now directed to an enforcement officer authorised by the Lord Chancellor rather than to the sheriff of a county.  By section 62 of the TCE Act, writs of <span style="font-style:italic">fieri facias</span> were renamed “writs of control” and the power conferred by such a writ to recover a sum of money is now exercisable only by using the procedure in Schedule 12 to that Act.  The TCE Act also replaced bailiffs by “enforcement agents”, who generally require a certificate issued under section 64 of the Act to perform this role.   An enforcement power under Schedule 12 may only be exercised by an enforcement agent who is either the enforcement officer on whom the power is conferred or another enforcement agent who has been authorised by the officer to act under the power (see Schedule 12, para 2). </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The main question raised on this appeal is what, if any, rule of priority applies where two (or more) writs of control to recover different judgment debts from the same debtor are directed to different enforcement officers.  In particular, is the enforcement officer who receives the second (or subsequent) writ obliged to wait until the amount outstanding under each earlier writ of control has been paid before taking steps to enforce the later writ; and if the enforcement officer does not wait and enforces the later writ, what consequences follow?    </p>

A controlled goods agreement is an agreement under which the debtor is permitted to retain custody of the goods listed in it while acknowledging that the enforcement agent is taking control of them and agreeing not to remove or dispose of the goods, nor permit anyone else to, before the debt has been paid: see para 13(4) of Schedule 12 to the TCE Act.  Under the terms of the controlled goods agreement made on 23 July 2018, Mr Handa undertook to pay £10,000 within 30 days, followed by payments of £1,000 per month, until the full amount outstanding under the Marston writ was paid. </p>

This language has been interpreted by the courts to mean that, although the delivery of a writ of execution to the sheriff / enforcement officer does not affect the title to the debtor’s goods, it renders the goods liable to be seized by the officer and sold to satisfy the debt.  In accordance with the principle recognised by the House of Lords in <span style="font-style:italic">Barras v Aberdeen Steam Fishing and Trawling Co Ltd</span> [1933] AC 402, it is to be presumed that, in re-enacting words used in previous statutory provisions which have been the subject of authoritative judicial interpretation, Parliament intended those words to bear that settled meaning: see e.g. Lowe and Potter, <span style="font-style:italic">Understanding Legislation</span> (2018), para 3.53 and the cases there cited.   </p>

This is the only fair arrangement.

There was only one sheriff for each county and all the cases concerned with priority between writs of <span style="font-style:italic">fieri facias</span> therefore involved writs delivered to the same officer for enforcement.  When responsibility for enforcement was transferred by the Courts Act 2003 from sheriffs to enforcement officers, it became possible for the first time for a creditor to choose which enforcement officer to use.  This in turn has created a situation in which two (or more) different enforcement officers may each receive a different writ of execution enforceable against the same debtor in the same district.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In a note sent to the court after the hearing of this appeal counsel for CES went further.  They submitted that the case of <span style="font-style:italic">Payne v Drewe</span> (1804) 4 East 523 (found by junior counsel for CES, Mr Royle, after the hearing) positively indicates that there is no priority between writs of execution delivered to different officers.  In that case the Sheriff of Dorset seized goods under a writ of <span style="font-style:italic">fi fa</span> but then declined to sell the goods to satisfy the plaintiff’s debt when he learnt that a writ of sequestration against the debtor had been issued and delivered to sequestrators some 18 months earlier, although nothing had been done to enforce it.  The Court of Chancery held that the sheriff’s duty had been to execute the writ of <span style="font-style:italic">fi fa</span>, notwithstanding the existence of the unsatisfied writ of sequestration. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In reaching this conclusion, Lord Ellenborough CJ, who gave the judgment of the court, assumed in favour of the sheriff that a writ of sequestration had the same effect as the delivery of a writ of <span style="font-style:italic">fi fa</span>, that is to say, that it bound the property in the goods but did not prevent the sheriff from making a valid sale.  Lord Ellenborough next considered whether, if the sheriff had sold the goods in execution of the writ of <span style="font-style:italic">fi fa</span>, he would have incurred any liability to the parties interested in the sequestration or would have been in contempt of court.  He concluded that the answer to those questions was “no” in circumstances where nothing had been done to enforce the writ of sequestration for at least 18 months such that the process could be considered “dormant” and the writ “virtually abandoned and waived by the parties originally interested in its execution” (see 523-4).  The court concluded that, as the sheriff would not “have subjected himself either civilly or criminally to any inconveniences” by executing the writ of <span style="font-style:italic">fi fa</span>, he ought to have done so and was accordingly liable to the plaintiff. </p>

The case of <span style="font-style:italic">Payne v Drewe</span> indeed seems to me to be an authority positively adverse to CES, as it suggests that, had there not been culpable delay in enforcing the first writ, it <span style="font-style:italic">would</span> have been a breach of duty – to the parties interested in the execution of the first writ and to the court – for the sheriff who received the subsequent writ to execute it before the earlier writ had been executed.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Apart from this authority, CES appealed to considerations of policy.  A director of CES, Mr Simcox, expressed the opinion in a witness statement that a system of priority which applies between all writs of control (and not just between writs held by a single enforcement officer) would be “entirely unworkable”, as it would require every enforcement agent to be in constant liaison with every other to determine whether anyone else had a ‘priority’ instrument.  Mr Simcox suggested that it would also lead to the “absurd situation” that an enforcement officer who received a writ first might wait for a later writ to be enforced and then simply claim the proceeds without having done anything to enforce his own writ. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The judge dealt with these and other related arguments not now pursued under a heading “Project Fear” and explained why he was not persuaded by them.  As Mr Ryan for Marston pointed out, Mr Simcox did not give any evidence that any difficulties of the kind he postulated have actually arisen in practice since the new system of enforcement officers was created by the Courts Act 2003.  This is despite the fact that a current textbook and training material for High Court Enforcement Officers (quoted by the judge at paras 44 to 47 of his judgment) tell them that writs of execution, to whomever the writs are issued, hold a chronological order of priority determined by the date and time of receipt.  If this arrangement were really unworkable, it is reasonable to expect that CES would have provided evidence of difficulties actually encountered in its operation.  Moreover, the suggested risk that an enforcement officer who receives a writ of control might deliberately sit back and wait for a writ later in time to be enforced seems fanciful – not least because, for such a possibility even to arise, the enforcement officer would first have to learn that a later writ had been issued to another enforcement officer at the request of another creditor; in any case it does not follow (as the old case of <span style="font-style:italic">Payne v Drewe</span> illustrates) that, if there is a rule of priority between writs, culpable delay in enforcement will have no adverse consequence.    </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Counsel for CES also submitted that it would be unjust if an enforcement agent who, without notice of a prior writ, executes a writ of control and pays the proceeds of enforcement to the creditor were then required to pay the priority creditor with his own funds.  I agree that this is a valid concern.  But again it is not a consequence which necessarily follows from a rule that the first writ to be received has priority.  It depends also on questions of remedy which I will come to later in this judgment. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">On the other hand, if CES were right that there is no rule of priority where two (or more) writs against the same debtor are delivered to different enforcement officers, this would undoubtedly cause injustice.  The consequence would be that, where a writ of execution has already been delivered to an enforcement officer, a second writ directed to the same officer could be executed only after the first writ has been executed; yet if instead the second writ is directed to a different officer, that writ could be executed immediately, enabling the creditor who chose that enforcement officer to jump the queue.  It would be arbitrary and inequitable as between creditors if the enforceability of a writ were dependent in this way on the identity of the person to whom the writ is directed for enforcement.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Such a regime would also permit a disorderly race between enforcement agents, favouring the most aggressive and least forbearing.  That in turn, as Mr Ryan for Marston pointed out, would be contrary to one of the policy objectives of the reforms implemented by Part 3 and Schedule 12 of the TCE Act, which was to encourage a proportionate and staged approach to the enforcement of judgment debts and discourage aggressive actions by enforcement agents.  That aim of the legislation is reflected in the title of the consultation paper published by the Ministry of Justice in February 2012 which preceded its implementation: “<span style="font-style:italic">Transforming Bailiff Action: How we will provide more protection against aggressive bailiffs and encourage more flexibility in bailiff collections</span>”.   It would be a significant disincentive to adopting the less aggressive approach of entering into a controlled goods agreement rather than removing the debtor’s goods and selling them at the first possible opportunity if the result might be that, just before the debtor made a payment in accordance with the agreement, the money could be diverted by pressure from another, more aggressive enforcement agent seeking to enforce a later writ – as happened in this case. </p>

The alternative is lawlessness. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">I recognise that pointing out that unjust and anarchic consequences would follow from the absence of a rule does not demonstrate that there is one.  But in fact I think it clear that the statutory rule of priority is not (or at least is not fundamentally) a rule about the duties of an enforcement officer who receives two or more writs for enforcement.  It is a rule of priority between writs which does not depend on who receives the writs concerned.  The duty of an officer who receives several writs to enforce them in the order of their receipt is merely a consequence of the basic rule.  The language of para 4(2) of Schedule 12 to the TCE Act, which (as discussed earlier) has not changed materially from the language used in the Statute of Frauds, is that “the writ binds the property in the goods” from the time when it is received by the person who is under a duty to endorse it.  The natural and rational interpretation of how this provision applies where two or more writs are issued is that the enforcement power conferred by a writ is subject to the enforcement power conferred by any writ which has previously been received by the person under a duty to endorse it, whoever that person was.  Priority in enforcement is thus determined solely by the chronological order in which the writs are received.  It does not depend on the identity of the enforcement officer to whom any of the writs is directed and whether that officer is the same or different from the officer who receives any earlier or later writ. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">I do not consider this to be a realistic contention.  If this was how priority between writs operated, it would leave some goods of the debtor ‘up for grabs’ with all the undesirable consequences already mentioned, and with the additional practical difficulty, uncertainty and potential for dispute caused by the need to determine when particular goods were acquired by the debtor (something which in the case of particular banknotes might be practically impossible).  The fallacy underlying such an approach seems to me to be that it treats the receipt of a writ as if it created some form of proprietary interest in the debtor’s goods which attaches to the goods at a particular point in time.  As discussed, although the phrase “binds the property in the goods” might be thought to carry such a connotation, its established meaning is simply that the sheriff or enforcement officer who has received the writ has the power to take the debtor’s goods in execution.  The rule which gives priority to the power conferred by the writ first received must sensibly be understood as applying equally to all goods of the debtor irrespective of when those goods are acquired.      </p>

One way would be by prohibiting the enforcement of a subsequent writ while the property in the debtor’s goods remains bound by a prior writ.  The other would be by permitting a subsequent writ to be enforced but on condition that any proceeds from the exercise of the enforcement power must be used to pay the amount outstanding under the prior writ before any balance can be applied to the subsequent writ. </p>

In the present case, by contrast, Mr Wild did not remove goods from the possession or control of Marston’s enforcement officer.  Had that happened, then – as already indicated – I think it clear that Mr Badger would have been entitled to sue Mr Wild and CES for conversion.  Rather, Marston’s enforcement officer had not yet taken control of the money of which CES obtained and refused to relinquish possession.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">As Mr Page QC and Mr Royle on behalf of CES pointed out in response to Marston’s written submissions on this issue, the power to take control of goods using the procedure in Schedule 12 to the TCE Act is not equivalent to, and does not include, a right to require the possession of goods to be surrendered on demand.  It is a power limited to taking control of goods in certain specified ways, each of which is subject to specified restrictions.  So, for example, para 9 of Schedule 12 provides that an enforcement agent may take control of goods only if they are on premises that the agent has power to enter or on a highway.  Those powers may only be exercised within prescribed times of day: see Schedule 12, paras 25 and 32.  There are only four permitted ways of taking control of goods, set out in Schedule 12, para 13.  These are: (a) to secure the goods on the premises on which the enforcement agent finds them; (b) to secure them on the highway; (c) to remove them and secure them elsewhere; or (d) to enter into a controlled goods agreement with the debtor.  The permitted ways of taking control do not include demanding that goods be delivered up.  I agree with counsel for CES that there is in these circumstances a material difference between the power to take control of goods conferred by a writ (or prior writ) of control and the immediate right to possession of goods needed to found a claim for conversion.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">I also consider that treating the power to take control of goods as sufficient to give title to sue for conversion would be inconsistent with the case law mentioned earlier about the effect of what is now called a writ of control.  If receipt of the writ conferred title to sue, the logical consequence would be that a debtor who disposes of any of his goods after a writ of control has been received by an enforcement officer but before any step has been taken to enforce the writ would be liable for conversion, at any rate if the goods were sold to a purchaser for value without notice or consisted of money which passed into currency, such that the property in the goods ceased to be bound by the writ.  However, authorities such as those mentioned at paragraphs 26 and 27 above make it clear that, unless and until goods in which the property is bound by the writ are taken in execution, the debtor (or anyone else to whom the goods are transferred) remains free to deal with them as he pleases; and if the goods are transferred to a person who acquires them in good faith, for valuable consideration and without notice of any writ, the property in the goods ceases to be bound by the writ and the enforcement officer has no power of enforcement against either the transferee or the debtor.   </p>

By implication, absent such agreement, the debtor <span style="font-style:italic">is</span> free to remove or dispose of the goods.

In accordance with section 6(c) of the Interpretation Act 1978, in the absence of a contrary intention words in the singular include the plural.  It is therefore consistent with the language used in para 50(3) that the “amount outstanding” may comprise more than one unpaid debt.  Nowhere, however, is it expressly stated which unpaid debt or debts (and associated fees) proceeds must be used to pay in circumstances where the property in the debtor’s goods was bound by more than one writ.

It is natural to assume that the amount which proceeds from the exercise of an enforcement power must be used to pay is the debt which that power may be used to recover, and not any other debt.  In the present case the only enforcement power which Mr Wild had was the power conferred by the CES writ to use the Schedule 12 procedure to recover the amount outstanding under that writ.  He had no power to enforce the Marston writ and hence no power to take control of and sell goods (or take money) to recover the debt which was the subject of the Marston writ.  It may be said that, at least in the absence of clear words to the contrary, para 50(1) should not be construed as requiring an enforcement agent to use proceeds from the exercise of the power conferred by the writ which is the source of the agent’s authority to pay an amount outstanding under a different writ which the agent has no power to enforce. </p>

A creditor who is seeking to recover a judgment debt cannot simply instruct an enforcement officer or agent to take control of and sell goods of the debtor.  The creditor must request the court to issue a writ of control – which takes place when the writ is sealed by a court officer of the appropriate court office: see CPR 83.9.  It is that writ issued by the court which confers the power, and responsibility, on the enforcement officer to whom it is directed (and any agent to whom the officer delegates the exercise of the power) to use the Schedule 12 procedure to recover the judgment debt.  Such an enforcement agent is therefore acting on the court’s behalf (with the court itself in constitutional terms acting on behalf of the sovereign).  This is reflected in the prescribed forms of writs of control which command the enforcement officer in the Queen’s name to take control of the debtor’s goods and raise therefrom the sums detailed in the schedule to the writ.  </p>

It would mean that an enforcement agent who, as in this case, enforces a writ despite having notice that the property in the debtor’s goods was bound by a prior writ would come under a duty to pay the proceeds to the lower priority creditor, with any surplus to be paid to the debtor – leaving the prior writ unsatisfied.  Furthermore, it is difficult if not impossible to see how the judgment creditor whose prior writ was bypassed in this way (or the enforcement officer to whom the prior writ was directed) could have any remedy, given that the use of the proceeds to pay the amount outstanding under the second writ first would on this hypothesis be a statutory obligation.  The result would be to subvert the rule of priority in the enforcement of writs which, as I have concluded, was intended to be preserved by the legislation.  It would also lead to all the unjust and disorderly consequences which that rule is designed to prevent.   </p>

Moreover, with the assistance of additional written submissions filed since the appeal hearing, the court is in a position to address a wider range of legal issues than were originally raised.  I am persuaded that it is in the overall interests of justice that the court should proceed on the basis that £10,050 was paid by Mr Handa in cash and the other £2,000 by credit card, as CES asserts, and decide what, if any, difference the method of payment makes.    </p>

Unlike coins and banknotes, bank money has no physical existence.

I think this is right.  Although the definition of “goods” in para 3(1) as “property, of any description, other than land” is broad enough to include intangible property such as a debt owed by a bank to its customer, the ways of taking control of goods available under Schedule 12 (mentioned at paragraph 65 above) all involve securing the goods in a particular physical location.  (While entering into a controlled goods agreement does not directly involve this, it presupposes that the goods covered by the agreement can be physically removed and secured if the agreement is not made or is not complied with.)  It therefore seems to me that the only goods which it is possible to take control of are tangible property or “securities” – defined in para 3(1) as including “bills of exchange, promissory notes, bonds, specialties and securities for money” – which are embodied or represented in some tangible form.  Thus, an amount credited to a bank account, which is merely a legal obligation and is not represented by any physical object, is not amenable to enforcement by a writ of control.  To enforce a judgment against such an asset, it is necessary to obtain a third party debt order.  </p>

The answer, as it seems to me, is illustrated by the facts of this case.  If an enforcement agent acting under the power to enter premises and take control of goods threatens to remove goods unless the debtor pays a sum of money, and to avoid that outcome the debtor makes the payment by debit or credit card or bank transfer thereby causing the sum to be credited to a bank account, I do not think it a strained use of language to describe the credit to the account as “money taken in exercise of the [enforcement] power.”  It also makes rational sense to treat equally as proceeds from the exercise of the power money paid to avoid the seizure and sale of goods and money realised by actually seizing and selling them.  Indeed, I can see no rhyme or reason for distinguishing in terms of the use to which they should be put between payments obtained in these two ways. </p>

One is that, although the money taken constitutes controlled goods, para 37(1) does not apply to the money because it falls within the exception created by para 37(2).  The other possible reason is that the money taken does not constitute controlled goods because it consists of bank money and not physical money.  I cannot conceive of a situation in which money which is not embodied in any physical object could be sold for more than its value if used as a means of payment.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Those submissions, in my view, are without merit.  I have already held that money obtained by threatening otherwise to remove goods from the premises under the authority conferred by a writ of control is just as much an exercise of the enforcement power conferred by the writ as the carrying out of such a threat by actually removing and selling the goods.  The suggestion that money is not “taken” if it is demanded and handed over by the debtor to avoid the removal of his goods is equally untenable.  It would be an absurd distinction if the answer to the question whether, for example, banknotes removed from the debtor’s premises were “money taken”, and hence “proceeds” from the exercise of an enforcement power, depended on whether the enforcement agent took hold of the banknotes without any intermediate act of the debtor or whether the debtor handed over the banknotes in response to the agent’s threat before the enforcement agent took hold of them himself.   </p>

Apart from creating serious evidential difficulties, such a distinction would be pointless.  Even on the narrowest interpretation of para 50(2), “proceeds” include cash of which an enforcement agent takes control, however control of it is taken and whether or not it is expressly tendered as payment.   </p>

If only cash and not bank money was caught by para 50(2)(b), there would be no statutory obligation to use money paid by debit or credit card or some other form of bank transfer in that way.  Instead, there would be nothing in the statutory scheme to stop an enforcement agent from using bank money obtained by threatening to take control of goods to satisfy a lower priority writ, thereby bypassing the order of priority between writs (as CES have sought to do in this case). </p>

It is, however, far from obvious to me that in the situation postulated by counsel for CES the enforcement agent would be liable to repay the priority creditor.  A claim in restitution for unjust enrichment would potentially be met by a defence of agency (or, as it is sometimes called, ‘ministerial receipt’) and/or change of position.  It is also far from clear that the priority creditor would have any right to sue for loss caused by a breach of statutory duty; and even if it did, such a loss would only be sustained if and in so far as the sum paid over could not be recovered from the lower priority creditor to whom the proceeds were disbursed.

At the time when Mr Wild made this threat and took the money from Mr Handa, he was on notice that there was a writ of control which had been received by Mr Badger of Marston before the CES writ was received.  He had also been shown a copy of the controlled goods agreement entered into between Mr Handa and Marston on 23 July 2018.  Mr Wild therefore knew that Mr Handa had agreed to pay the amount outstanding under the prior Marston writ in instalments, with the first instalment of £10,000 due to be paid the very next day.  Despite that knowledge, Mr Wild induced Mr Handa to pay over to CES funds which plainly included money that Mr Handa was intending to use to make that payment.  He did so by threatening otherwise to remove goods belonging to Mr Handa there and then.

I nevertheless consider that it would be inconsistent with the standard of conduct expected by the court of its officers for the agent with the lower priority writ to attempt to enforce that writ unless it was clear that to do so would not interfere with the enforcement action which the agent with the prior writ was taking or proposing to take.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">For the reasons given, I conclude that the sum of £12,050 paid by Mr Handa to CES on 21 August 2018 constituted proceeds from the exercise of an enforcement power which, pursuant to Schedule 12, para 50(1) of the TCE Act, was required to be used to pay the amount outstanding under each writ by which the property in the debtor’s goods was bound, starting with the first writ to have been received by the enforcement officer who was under a duty to endorse it.  As that writ was the Marston writ, under which the amount outstanding substantially exceeded the sum of money received from Mr Handa, the whole of that sum had to be applied to the Marston writ.  As those acting for CES refused to pay the money to Marston so that it could be used for that purpose, it was necessary for the court to order this to be done so as to procure compliance with the legislation. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">I have also concluded that, in attempting to enforce the CES writ when they were aware of the controlled goods agreement with Marston and on notice that the Marston writ had priority, Mr Wild and the CES enforcement officer, Mr Davies, acted improperly and in a manner inconsistent with the standards of conduct expected of officers of the court.  I consider that in these circumstances the court also had power to remedy the effect of their misconduct by ordering the CES enforcement officer to procure that the money obtained in this way be paid over to Marston (insofar as it had by the time of the order fallen due under the controlled goods agreement).  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">I would therefore hold that the judge was right to dismiss the application made by CES to set aside the Master’s order which required it to pay the sum of £12,050 to Marston, and that this appeal should likewise be dismissed. </p>
