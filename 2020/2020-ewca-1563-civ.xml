	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">1.<span style="font-family:Arial"> </span>This is an appeal by the Second Defendant (“Mr Bell”) against an order of Teare J dated 28 January 2020 giving the Claimant (“Ivy”) permission to amend its Particulars of Claim to advance a claim against Mr Bell for breach of warranties contained in an agreement dated 4 April 2019 (“the SPA”) by which Ivy agreed to purchase the shares (“the Shares”) in five companies which carried on an online gambling business under the name 21Bet (“the Business”). On its face Mr Bell is not a party to the SPA. Ivy contends that the First Defendant (“Mr Martin”) entered into the SPA both as principal in respect of his own 50% beneficial interest in the Shares and as agent for Mr Bell in respect of Mr Bell’s 50% beneficial interest in the Shares. The judge concluded, for the reasons given in his judgment dated 23 January 2020 [2020] EWHC 54 (Comm), that Ivy had a real prospect of succeeding in its contention that Mr Bell was liable for breach of the SPA, and therefore granted Ivy permission to make the amendments. Mr Bell appeals against that conclusion, with permission granted by Lewison LJ, on three grounds: first, that the express terms of the SPA exclude any liability of Mr Bell; secondly, that Ivy and Mr Martin expressly contracted in the SPA on the basis that Mr Martin was the sole beneficial owner of the shares, and therefore Ivy is estopped from contending to the contrary; and thirdly, that Ivy irrevocably elected to bring its claim for breach of the SPA against Mr Martin to the exclusion of Mr Bell when it commenced the proceedings. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">For the purposes of the appeal, the background to the matter can be briefly summarised as follows. It is not in dispute that, prior to the SPA, the Shares were legally owned by Richard Hogg, who is not a party to the proceedings, but were beneficially owned 50/50 by Mr Martin and Mr Bell. Nor is it in dispute that these facts were disclosed to Ivy prior to execution of the SPA in a response to a due diligence questionnaire in July 2018. It is also common ground that both Ivy and Mr Martin were legally represented during the negotiations over the SPA, and that the SPA was professionally drafted. Mr Bell has admitted that Mr Martin “kept [him] upto-date on the sale of the Business to [Ivy] at a high level” and that “as a 50% shareholder, [he] expected to receive [his] share of the balance of the sale proceeds” after repayment of creditors.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The initial consideration payable by Ivy upon completion was £3 million, with further consideration payable in respect of three one-year earn-out periods based on the performance of the Business. There is a dispute between the parties as to whether or not completion has taken place. It is common ground, however, that on 5 April 2019 Ivy paid the sum of £2.95 million to Mr Martin by way of a pre-payment pending completion. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Ivy’s case is that it was the victim of a fraud. Ivy says that, during the course of the negotiations leading to the SPA, Mr Martin fraudulently misrepresented the EBITDA and financial performance of the Business, including at a meeting attended by Mr Martin and Mr Bell in Prague in October 2018. Ivy was told at that meeting that the </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">As well as claims for fraudulent misrepresentation, Ivy also advances claims against Mr Martin under the SPA for breach of warranty, and a claim in restitution for the return of the £2.95 million pre-payment. There are also claims relating to the Third Defendant (“Premier”), a competing business which Ivy says was set up by Mr Martin in breach of non-compete provisions contained in the SPA. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">As for Mr Bell, the claims originally pleaded against him were for the torts of unlawful means conspiracy and inducing breach of contract.

Ivy’s affidavit evidence in support of the application stated that the SPA was made between Ivy and Mr Martin, and did not suggest that Mr Bell was party to, or liable under, the SPA. Ivy issued its claim form outlining the causes of action summarised above the following day. The freezing order was subsequently set aside as against Mr Bell on the ground that Ivy had failed to demonstrate a real risk of Mr Bell dissipating his assets, but it continues against Mr Martin and Premier. </p>

The advantage of this from Ivy’s perspective is that it enables Ivy to claim a contractual measure of damages against Mr Bell, whereas it can only claim a tortious measure for its existing claims. There is no dispute that Ivy has a real prospect of success on its claim that the warranties were breached.

He also found that the reason for this arrangement was that Mr Chernukhin needed to be discreet in relation to such an investment at the time because of his position as Deputy Minister of Finance in Russia and Chairman of Vneshekonombank. Accordingly, the judge held that Mr Chernukhin was entitled to enforce the SHA although he was not named as a party to it.

When an agent acts for an undisclosed principal, the counterparty has no knowledge at the time of making the contract that there is an undisclosed principal who is entitled to intervene to enforce the contract purportedly made between the counterparty and the agent. However, the law will assume (the ‘beneficial assumption’ as Lord Lloyd described it) that the counterparty ‘is willing to treat as a party to the contract anyone on whose behalf the agent may have been authorised to contract’ unless the terms of the contract or background circumstances expressly or impliedly exclude that possibility (see the <span style="font-style:italic">Teheran-Europe</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Siu Yin Kwan</span> cases (above)).  </p>

Although Ivy had pleaded in the Amended Particulars of Claim that Mr Martin had entered into the SPA as agent for Mr Bell, it had not pleaded or suggested in its evidence any reason why the SPA had been structured in that way. Accordingly, the judge was wrong to conclude that further evidence was necessary before construing the SPA. Secondly, counsel submitted that, even if such evidence existed, it would be inadmissible as being subjective evidence of the parties’ intentions or part of the pre-contractual negotiations: see <span style="font-style:italic">Chartbrook Ltd v Persimmon Homes Ltd </span>[2009] UKHL 38, [2009] AC 1101 at [32]-[41] (Lord Hoffmann).

So far as the first is concerned, the stark discrepancy between the facts known to the parties concerning the beneficial ownership of the Shares and the terms of the SPA cries out for an explanation. It is an obvious inference that Mr Bell did not want to be named in the SPA. I agree with the judge that it is relevant to inquire why the parties were prepared to contract on that basis. Furthermore, this is not a case of Micawberism: it is inherently probable that there is an explanation. Furthermore, I am unimpressed by the fact that Ivy did not adduce any evidence as to what the explanation is. (In saying this, I should make it clear that I agree with counsel for Mr Bell that what Ivy has subsequently pleaded in its Reply must be disregarded since it was not before the judge and there is no application by Ivy to adduce further evidence on the appeal.) While Ivy must have been willing to proceed on the basis that Mr Bell was not named in the SPA, it does not necessarily follow that Ivy was aware of Mr Bell’s reason(s) for not wanting to be named. That is a matter which disclosure and evidence from Mr Bell and/or Mr Martin can reasonably be expected to shed light upon. In saying this, I do not overlook the point that, in order to be admissible with respect to the construction of the SPA, factual background material must have been known, or reasonably available, to all the contracting parties.

For the reasons explained in <span style="font-style:italic">Filatona</span>, the burden on Mr Bell is a heavy one to discharge. Although clause 15.12 says that “[n]othing in this Agreement … is intended to confer upon any third party other than the Parties hereto …. any liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement”, and Mr Bell is not a Party, the clause does not in terms exclude liability arising by virtue of Mr Bell being the principal of a Party who has entered into the SPA as his agent.

As he submitted, however, given that Mr Martin contracted as principal with respect to his own 50% beneficial interest, that is not necessarily inconsistent with Mr Martin contracting as agent for Mr Bell with respect to Mr Bell’s 50% beneficial interest.                </p>

The question is one of fact and it must be shown that the decision to institute proceedings against the agent was a ‘truly unequivocal act’, which ‘involves looking closely at the context in which the decision was taken, for any conclusion must be based on a review of all the relevant circumstances’ (see pp. 791-3 per Willmer LJ. Russell LJ at p. 795 said that what must be shown is that ‘the plaintiff has settled to a choice involving abandonment of his option to enforce his right against one party’).  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I do not accept this submission. As the judge rightly observed, election is a question of fact: see <span style="font-style:italic">Evans v Bartlam</span> [1937] AC 473 at 485 (Lord Wright). As such, I agree with the judge that the matter was not fit for summary determination, particularly given that suing Mr Martin for breach of the SPA was not necessarily unequivocal given that he was in any event a principal in respect of his own 50% beneficial interest. But I would go further, because it is not clear beyond argument that the third party is required to elect between suing the agent and suing the principal. Lord Sumption’s statement in <span style="font-style:italic">Playboy</span> was obiter and made without reference to authority, although there are dicta which support it. As the editors of <span style="font-style:italic">Bowstead &amp; Reynolds on Agency </span>(21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st </span>ed) explain at 8-120, in considering the cases in this area one has to put aside decisions which are explicable on other bases, notably estoppel and merger. More fundamentally, a requirement of election only makes sense if the liabilities of agent and principal are alternative, as opposed to joint and several, but that is open to doubt (see also <span style="font-style:italic">Taylor v Van Dutch Marine Holding Ltd </span>[2020] EWCA Civ 353, </p>
