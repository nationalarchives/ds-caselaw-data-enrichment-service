By that order the judge gave permission to Lady Brownlie (either “the Respondent” or “Lady Brownlie”) to substitute the Appellant as defendant to this action in place of Four Seasons Holdings Incorporated, (“FS Holdings”) (a company incorporated under the law of British Columbia, Canada). Permission was also given to amend the Claim Form and Particulars of Claim. It was declared that the courts of England and Wales were the proper forum for the litigation of the Respondent’s claims and that the High Court of Justice in this country had jurisdiction to try those claims. The Respondent was further given permission to serve the Claim Form and amended Particulars of Claim on the Appellant out of the jurisdiction in Egypt, but it was ordered, for practical purposes, that that service might be effected by service on its solicitors in London. Those were the same solicitors who had been acting for the “Four Seasons” organisation throughout. There were further ancillary orders. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The Respondent is the widow of Sir Ian Brownlie QC. In January 2010, she and her husband, his daughter, son-in-law and two grandchildren were on a holiday in Egypt and were staying at the Four Seasons Hotel Cairo at Nile Plaza. In her evidence in the action, the Respondent states that on a previous visit to the same hotel she had picked up at the hotel a leaflet advertising certain tours that the hotel provided. In advance of the holiday in question, she had booked, over the telephone with the hotel’s concierge, one such tour involving a guided excursion to Fayoum in a chauffeur-driven car. The tour took place on 3 January 2010; the passengers were the Respondent and Sir Ian, his daughter and her two children. During the journey, the chauffeur-driven vehicle left the road and crashed. Sir Ian and the daughter were killed. The Respondent and the two children were seriously injured. </p>

There was significant difficulty in identifying the correct “Four Seasons” company as the potential defendant to the claims.

The Appellant was substituted as defendant. The issue on this appeal is whether the judge was wrong to permit service of the claim on the Appellant out of the jurisdiction in Egypt with a view to the trial of her claims in the courts in this country. The judge held that England, rather than Egypt, was the more convenient place for trial. That conclusion is not contested in this court. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The Respondent began these proceedings on 19 December 2012 claiming damages in contract and tort (a) for her own personal injury, (b) in her capacity as her late husband’s executrix, under the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1934 (“the 1934 Act”), and (c) for bereavement and loss of dependency under the Fatal Accidents Act 1976 (“FAA 1976”) as Sir Ian’s widow. The Claim Form named FS Holdings as first defendant and an Egyptian company, Nova Park SAE (“Nova Park”), as second defendant. The difficulties of discovering the identity of the appropriate “Four Seasons” entity with whom the contract had been made, are summarised by the judge (at [10] to [13]). In short, following enquiries made by the Respondent’s solicitors to the Four Seasons organisation at the outset, FS Holdings appeared to be a correct defendant and Nova Park had been identified, as the owner of the hotel premises, as a further defendant. Nova Park was not served with the Claim Form and took no part in the proceedings. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Permission to serve the proceedings on FS Holdings in Canada was granted by Master Yoxall on 15 April 2013 and they were so served on 10 May 2013. By application notice issued on 14 May 2013, FS Holdings sought orders staying/striking out the proceedings, alternatively a declaration that the English court had no jurisdiction to try the claims. That application succeeded before Master Cook. Tugendhat J allowed an appeal against that order on 19 February 2014. There was a further appeal to this court  which came before Arden LJ (as she then was), Bean and King LJJ and on 3 July 2015 that appeal was allowed in part, permitting the Respondent to serve her claim based in contract and her claim under FAA 1976 out of the jurisdiction, but permission was refused in respect of her other claims in tort.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Finally, there was a further appeal and cross-appeal to the Supreme Court. The court allowed FS Holdings’ appeal, holding that evidence, ultimately produced by that court’s direction after some initial inconclusive exchanges between the court and FS Holdings’ leading counsel on the first day of the hearing, showed that FS Holdings was a non-trading company which neither owned nor operated the Cairo hotel and that there was, therefore, no realistic prospect that Lady Brownlie would be able to show that she had contracted with that company or that it would be liable in tort for the negligence of the driver. It was held, therefore, that the English court had no jurisdiction to try the claims against FS Holdings. However, the court remitted ancillary matters to the High Court and, as Nicol J records (at [31] in his judgment) the Supreme Court ordered expressly that Lady Brownlie had permission to apply under CPR 17.4 and/or 19.4 – 19.5 to correct the name of the defendant to the proceedings or to add a new party as a defendant.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">How the respective roles of FS Holdings and of the present Appellant, with regard to the operation of the Cairo hotel, were flushed out from within the Four Seasons corporate labyrinth by the Supreme Court is summarised by the judge in his judgment at [26] – [29]. It is informative that although the Supreme Court decided that the Respondent had never had a viable claim at any stage against FS Holdings, it made orders that there should be no order for costs of the proceedings either before Tugendhat J, the Court of Appeal or before the Supreme Court itself. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Having decided that FS Holdings was not the company responsible for the running of this particular hotel and that the claims against it, both in contract and tort, were not viable for that reason, it was not necessary for the Supreme Court to decide whether the intended claims in tort against FS Holdings were or were not within the “gateway” </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The Supreme Court nonetheless considered the question whether Lady Brownlie’s claims in tort in respect of this accident, against a proper defendant, would fall within the definition in PD6B, para. 3.1 (9)(a). By a majority (Baroness Hale of Richmond, Lord Wilson of Culworth and Lord Clarke of Stone-cum-Ebony) decided that they would be within the definition. The minority (Lord Sumption and Lord Hughes of Ombersley) decided to the contrary. That difference of opinion is at the heart of one of the issues in the appeal before us.  </p>

The Claim Form was also amended to state that the Respondent’s claim to damages against the Appellant is “pursuant to Egyptian law”. That amendment was required since, as has always been common ground in respect of the new Egyptian defendant,  this result followed (for the contract claims) from the EU Regulation known as “Rome I” (Regulation (EC) No. 593/2008 of the Council and Parliament) and (for the tort claims) from the Regulation known as “Rome II” (Regulation (EC) No. 864/2007); see the judgment below at [6]. </p>

However, thereafter a consensual procedure was adopted for the new “Four Seasons” defendant, the Appellant, to challenge the proposed substitution of it as the new defendant and the intended amendments and to challenge yet again the jurisdiction of the English courts. Procedural directions were given by Stewart J by his order of 6 February 2019, including directions as to the provision of expert evidence as to Egyptian law “with respect to personal injury and wrongful death claims in contract and tort/delict, including in particular the law of limitation as it applies to such claims”.

The judge had to devote a large part of his very careful judgment to these CPR questions, none of which have been pursued on appeal. He decided ([67]) that the claims were not rendered unarguable because of the evidence on the Egyptian law as to limitation. He also rejected ([71]) the Appellant’s other arguments that he should not exercise his discretion to permit amendment in the Appellant’s favour. The judge further rejected the Appellant’s argument that the consequential amendments to the causes of action, deleting references to the 1934 Act and the FAA 1976, should be refused on the basis that they rendered such claims without any real prospect of success and/or failed to plead the Egyptian law provisions upon which reliance was placed. He addressed these points subsequently in his decision on jurisdiction. </p>

So far as the contract claims were concerned the relevant PD6B requirement was also passed and was subject only to the arguments as to whether it had been shown that there was a “good arguable case” on those claims under Egyptian law. </p>

Given this division of opinion, like the judge, I would feel strongly inclined to follow the majority conclusion, unless we are either obliged not to do so by other binding authority or we are clearly persuaded that we should not do so. It is noted, of course, that the passages on this point in all the judgments in the Supreme Court are indeed obiter dicta and, even if Lord Sumption did not do so, Lady Hale (at [33]) and Lord Wilson (at [57]) expressly sounded notes of caution about the views on the point expressed by the court. Nonetheless, it seems to me that the court had before them essentially all the same legal materials as have been before us and, having seen the printed cases, it seems they also had deployed before them much the same arguments as have been skilfully put by both counsel before us. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Ms Kinsler submits that the purpose of the gateway provision, in the form adopted in 1987, is to mirror the jurisdiction provisions governing such claims in Article 5(3) of the Brussels Convention on Jurisdiction and Enforcement of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters 1968 which allows proceedings in tort/delict “in the courts of the place where the harmful event occurred or may occur”,  i.e. notwithstanding the usual rule of European Union (EU) law that a claim must be brought in the courts of the defendant’s domicile. She argues that this purpose dictates that the meaning applied to the PD6B para. 3.1 (9)(a) should, therefore, mirror the manner in which such claims have been regarded in the law of the EU, not only at the time of the amendment in 1987 but also subsequently. It is submitted that this follows even though PD6B uses materially different language from the Convention and is dealing with claims against prospective defendants not domiciled in the EU, to whom (by definition) the restrictive regime of the Brussels Convention does not apply. She relies upon the statement of Lord Mance in <span style="font-style:italic">Bloomsbury International Ltd. v Sea Fish Industry Authority </span>[2011] 1 WLR 1546: </p>

This EU legislation, in its present form, continues to employ the same language of “in the courts for the place where the harmful event occurred and may occur” to confer jurisdiction in tort/delict claims exceptionally on the courts of member states in which defendants are not domiciled. That is the language that has been interpreted by what is now the Court of Justice of the European Union (“CJEU”) over the years. Whatever the prompt for the change of wording in RSC O.11 in 1987 (and we have been referred to no relevant “travaux préparatoires” leading to that change) the words used in our rules were not, and are not, those words, and the nature of the jurisdiction on non-Convention cases is materially different. I am content to assume the 1987 change to O.11, as noted by the Court of Appeal in 1989, was prompted by one <span style="font-style:italic">particular</span> decision of the European Court which illustrated how narrow the original tort gateway had been in English law (under O.11 r. 1(1)(f) in its previous form). In my judgment, the change that was then made should not be taken to have admitted, by language entirely different from that of the Convention/Brussels I/Brussels I recast, the subsequent narrow interpretation which the CJEU has found to be required by the language of that convention/regulation. I do not consider that the 1987 change to O.11, noted by this court in 1989, was necessarily thought to have reflected an intention that the words of O.11 should simply “parrot” the jurisprudence  of the European court from time to time in its decisions on the different wording of the very different jurisdiction regime under the Convention. </p>

Under the old Rules of the Supreme Court (“RSC”), the predecessor of the present Civil Procedure Rules (“CPR”), tort claims were covered by O.11 r.1(1)(f) which originally permitted service abroad of claims in tort where the action was “founded on a tort committed within the jurisdiction”. This was changed (with effect from 1 January 1987) to enable the court to permit foreign service where “the damage was sustained, or resulted from an act committed, within the jurisdiction”. It may be that the change was made enable the rule to align the rule with Article 5(3) of Brussels I as interpreted up to that time: see below. When the provision was imported into the new CPR 6.20(8) (with effect from 6 May 2000) the definite article was omitted from the phrase “<span style="font-style:italic">the</span> damage” and the requirement became that “<span style="font-style:italic">damage </span>was sustained within the jurisdiction”.

The loss claimed, it was held, was the quantification of loss caused by harm that had occurred in Germany. There was the further compelling argument that to hold otherwise would have undermined the scheme under Brussels I that the plaintiff did not have the simple option of suing in the courts of his own domicile. There is no such scheme in English law for cases not governed by Brussels I.

However, it was not considering a case like the present where physical and other damage was suffered sequentially both outside and then inside the jurisdiction.

STB challenged the jurisdiction of the English courts on the basis that no relevant act or damage had occurred in England. It was held that there was no arguable case that the damage had been sustained in England. The court (Tuckey LJ and Mance LJ and Black J (as they respectively then were)) held that, on the evidence the damage was sustained where the investment had been made; it examined the source of the investment funds. The loss had been suffered in Switzerland, where the purchase moneys were debited from its bank account, or possibly in France on the basis of certain telex communications referred to in the judgment.

There is no need to import the legalistic niceties inherent in the concepts of direct and indirect damage. Such jurisdiction may not necessarily be exclusive. It may be that other “significant damage” is inflicted in the defendant’s country also and the rules of that country may give its courts jurisdiction also. It is then a question of balance for the court to decide whether this country’s jurisdiction should be asserted in the face of a parallel jurisdiction of the courts of the country abroad. </p>

In my view, that approach ought to follow when a court later construes those rules in an individual case. The courts did so in the context of personal injury cases, as applying to the damage resulting from injuries to the person.

For my part, I would reach the same conclusion with regard to the other claims made (both in contract and tort). However, I would add a direction, in exercise of the case management powers of the court, that Lady Brownlie should set out in outline (in a revised pleading) the main principles of Egyptian law upon which each of the claims are based. I would so order, not as a condition of permission to serve out of the jurisdiction but to achieve orderly progress in the resolution of the claims. Ancillary directions as to further pleading in response by the Appellant can be left to the High Court. In my judgment, the nature of the claim, the expert evidence, and the pleaded case, together with the history of the proceedings, justify that course. </p>

At what is still unfortunately an early stage of the proceedings, in my view, one needs to step back from detail and look at the case in the round. Having considered in draft my Lords’ judgments on this ground and the cases there cited, it seems to me that the question of how and when foreign law is to be pleaded and proved is determined substantially by what is in the interests of efficient procedural management of each case. In an English court, issues of foreign law are issues of fact and are not to be debated at length on a preliminary application about jurisdiction. The same holds good for the extent to which the default rule should be applied. On the other hand, no party is to be ambushed by a surprise point of foreign law and, as far as necessary, pleading and the exchange of expert evidence may be required.  </p>

Given the driver’s conviction of a serious offence there seems to be little question about fault on his part. So much seems in effect to have been accepted by the Appellant before the judge: [139 (vii)] of the judgment. Para. 33 of the Amended Particulars of Claim also sets out a number of allegations of fault on the part of the Appellant. The pleading alleges breaches of duty in contract and tort. The existence of a contract can hardly be doubted, and the allegations of fault include serious criticism of the Appellant in the adequacy of the driver selection and of the vehicle provided and its equipment (2-wheel drive only, no seat belts, inadequate tyres, an unsuitable/defective inner tube fitted to a tubeless tyre, etc.).  </p>

As Underhill LJ says (at [207]), there is nothing problematic in presuming that under the law of a foreign country it would be a requirement of a contract for the provision of the services of a car and driver, for an excursion such as this, that reasonable care should be exercised in the selection of the driver and of the vehicle.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The context of the rule is that it forms one of the gateways through which a claim must pass in order for permission to serve the claim form out of the jurisdiction to be granted. The gateways represent the considered judgment of the Civil Procedure Rules Committee as to the classes of case in which it may (but not necessarily will) be appropriate to bring a foreign defendant before the courts of England and Wales. (Although the gateways are contained in a Practice Direction rather than in a rule of the CPR, which may be thought somewhat questionable from a constitutional perspective, they nevertheless need, and receive, the approval of the Committee.) Thus the purpose of the rule is to identify situations in which there is a sufficient connecting factor with England and Wales to justify our courts asserting jurisdiction over foreign defendants (provided that the court is satisfied that England and Wales is the proper place in which to bring the claim: CPR rule 6.37(3)). As Lord Sumption pointed out in <span style="font-style:italic">Brownlie I</span> at [28], “English law has never asserted a jurisdiction for its courts on the basis of the English identity of the claimant, whether by virtue of residence, domicile or nationality”. It follows, in my opinion, that the courts should be cautious about interpreting the rule broadly. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The next point is that the rule applies to all claims “made in tort”. It does not differentiate between torts which cause personal injury and other torts. It follows, in my opinion, that the interpretation of the rule cannot be driven by policy considerations which are peculiar to personal injury cases. On the contrary, it is necessary to resist the temptation to allow one’s natural sympathy for English and Welsh claimants who have been injured as a result of torts committed abroad to colour the interpretation of the rule, since it is important not to facilitate forum shopping in cases involving purely economic damage. For this reason I am unable to accord the line of first instance decisions in the personal injury context relied upon by counsel for Lady Brownlie the weight that they were given in <span style="font-style:italic">Brownlie I</span> by Lady Hale at [41]-[48] and [52], Lord Wilson at [65] and Lord Clarke at [69]. </p>

In my judgment, however, this point is not determinative. The amendment was not made in order to comply with Article 5(3), because permission of the court to serve out was not required where the claim form could be served out pursuant to the provisions of the Convention, but in order to avoid the incongruity of service out being precluded in cases which paralleled cases in which service out was possible under the Convention. The wording which was adopted even then (let alone after the 2000 amendment) did not replicate the wording of Article 5(3), however. Accordingly, while this aspect of the legislative history supports the conclusion that what is now gateway 9a must be interpreted at least as broadly as what is now Article 7(2) of European Parliament and Council Regulation 1215/2012/EU of 12 December 2012 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (recast) </p>

Where domestic legislation was adopted in order to give effect to European legislation, it must (so far as possible) be interpreted consistently with the latter as it is interpreted from time to time by the CJEU. I consider that the same approach should be adopted with respect to domestic legislation which was adopted in order to be consistent with European legislation. It follows, for example, that gateway 9a should be interpreted as permitting service out of a claim for a negative declaration that no tort has been committed by the claimant against the defendant if a claim by the defendant against the claimant would fall within it: see <span style="font-style:italic;color:#201F1E">Fujifilm Kyowa Kirin Biologics Company Ltd v AbbVie Biotechnology Ltd</span><span style="color:#201F1E"> [2016] EWHC 2204 (Pat), [2017] Bus LR 333 following</span> Case C-133/11 <span style="font-style:italic">Folien Fischer AG v Ritrama SpA</span> [EU:C:2012:664], [2013] QB 523. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">As has often been pointed out, the scheme of the English legislation is different to that of the European legislation. The scheme of the European legislation is necessarily an inflexible one, and one which gives primacy to the jurisdiction of the defendant’s domicile, in order to maximise certainty and minimise jurisdictional conflict. Accordingly, the European legislation does not have the safety valve provided by the doctrine of <span style="font-style:italic">forum non conveniens</span> in the domestic legislation. I accept that, other things being equal, this is a factor which favours a broader, rather than a narrower, construction of the gateways. In my view, however, it is important not to place too much weight on this factor. Save in clear-cut cases, disputes as to the appropriate forum are expensive and uncertain. They are expensive because of the need for evidence and argument as to the connections between the dispute and the respective fora, and they are uncertain because they depend upon judicial evaluation. It would therefore be unsatisfactory to adopt an interpretation of gateway 9a which is so broad that most of the work in identifying cases in which foreign defendants should be brought before an English court is left to be done by <span style="font-style:italic">forum conveniens</span>.

In that case M &amp; R was a Swiss company which traded on the London Metal Exchange through an English broker, AML. M &amp; R’s chief aluminium trader carried out a series of fraudulent trades with the assistance of employees of AML. M &amp; R obtained a judgment against AML for over £50 million plus costs, but only recovered £6.7 million due to the insolvency of AML. M &amp; R brought proceedings against AML’s American parent companies, and obtained permission to serve them out of the jurisdiction which the American companies applied to set aside. Although M &amp; R advanced other claims, the only cause of action which the Court of Appeal held to be arguable was inducing or procuring breach of contract. This was based on breaches of the trading contracts and of a compromise agreement entered into by M &amp; R and AML as part of the discharge of a <span style="font-style:italic">Mareva</span> injunction. The Court of Appeal went on to hold that M &amp; R satisfied the requirements of Order 11 rule 1(1)(f) in respect of these claims. </p>

As regards tort the ECC follows French law in having only a few broad general principles the most important of which is Article 163 ECC which states that a person who commits a fault resulting in damage to another must pay compensation. This Article establishes the three-fold test in tort of finding a fault, a causal link and damage. None of these is defined in the ECC but jurisprudence shows that once a fault is established (which may be any negligent act or imprudent act) then all the damage that follows from it is compensable. As long as the act was one of the causes of the ultimate damage then it is not necessary for it to be the most proximate or chief cause. Egyptian law is therefore more liberal in finding tortious liability than is English law.” </p>

Accordingly, what matters is whether the evidence establishes a reasonably arguable case, not whether that case has yet been adequately pleaded.

In the case of a direct claim in tort, for example, there is no discussion of the extent to which Egyptian law imposes a duty of care to the client on someone who arranges an excursion to be performed by a third party contractor to ensure that the contractor’s vehicle is appropriate and roadworthy and its driver competent. In the case of a contractual claim there is no discussion of the extent to which the ECC imposes liability on an agent for the acts of an undisclosed principal or the extent to which the ECC imposes a contractual duty of care in circumstances such as these. Indeed, one does not even know from Mr Edge’s report whether Egyptian law recognises the concept of an implied term of a contract of the kind pleaded by Lady Brownlie in the Amended Particulars of Claim (it is not contended by Lady Brownlie that there was any express duty of care in the contract she alleges was made with FS Cairo). Given Mr Edge’s expertise in both English and Egyptian law, I doubt that this is accidental. On the contrary, I think it likely that he focussed his reports on vicarious liability for good reason. </p>

This is even worse, because in that section of his report Mr Edge is addressing, and refuting, Mr Ezzo’s opinion that there was a commercial contract of carriage governed by the ECommC. Not only does Mr Edge not address points such as those mentioned in paragraph 122, but also he expressly states in paragraphs 10 and 24(iii) that in his view the only relevance of the contract is that it provides part of the foundation for the claim of vicarious liability. Thus, by contrast with the claim of vicarious liability, Mr Edge’s reports would not enable counsel for Lady Brownlie properly to plead the principles and sources of Egyptian law applicable to the claims of direct tortious liability and contractual liability. (It follows that the order which McCombe and Underhill LJJ propose, on “case management” grounds, will effectively enable Lady Brownlie to rely upon expert evidence which she has not yet obtained, which she has no permission to rely upon for the purposes of the jurisdictional dispute and which FS Cairo has had no chance to answer, contrary to the order of Stewart J.) </p>

The requirement is a matter of fairness and consistency and applies even if a claimant voluntarily relies upon foreign law. But a further, obvious consideration supports the proof of foreign law in cases where the introduction of foreign law is obligatory.

As discussed above, the first question is a substantive question as to the applicable law applying the relevant rules of private international law, whereas the second question is a question of procedure and evidence. In so far as his judgment suggests that a claimant who needs to, and does, rely upon foreign law can reverse the burden of proof by invoking Rule 25(2), however, then I respectfully disagree with it. I note that some of the authorities and commentaries I have discussed were not cited to him. Furthermore, he relied upon dicta in <span style="font-style:italic">OPO v MLA</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Brownlie I </span>without, it seems to me, taking fully into account the context of those dicta. This is not to say that his decision was wrong, since it may well have been justified on the grounds that (a) the defendants relied upon Iranian law but had not identified any relevant difference between Iranian law and English law, (b) the defendants had (it appears tactically) not adduced any evidence as to Iranian law and (c) the case was ready for trial.  </p>

First, it would involve Lady Brownlie relying upon a mixture of Egyptian law and English law, particularly in relation to the direct claim in tort. Secondly, at least in relation to the contract claim, it would involve Lady Brownlie relying upon the legal content of the provisions contained in the 1934 Act and the 1976 Act, despite having rightly accepted that she cannot rely upon those Acts and deleting all references to them. This is because Mr Edge’s only discussion of Lady Brownlie’s capacity to claim damages under Egyptian law is in paragraphs 59 and 60 of his first report. In context, he is discussing her claim for vicarious liability in tort. Given what he says in paragraph 20, it is reasonable to suppose that the same principles would apply to a direct claim in tort; but given the absence of any discussion of contractual liability, there is no basis for concluding that they would also apply to a claim in contract.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">We are in an unusual position as regards this ground.  The Supreme Court has fully considered the very issue which it raises, and in the context of this very case, and has expressed a clear view, albeit by a three-two majority.  But because of the turn which the appeal took, as described by McCombe LJ at paras. 7-9 above, it did so on what was necessarily an <span style="font-style:italic">obiter</span> basis; and two members of the majority went out of their way to emphasise that that was the case, Lady Hale saying at para. 33 of her judgment that everything said on the tort gateway issue should be treated with caution and Lord Wilson pointing out at para. 57 that the Court might have heard less full argument than its importance required.  It is thus our responsibility to reach our own decision on the issue.  However, I do not think that it would be right to treat the judgments of the majority as if they were no more than a contribution to the debate that deserves our respect and careful consideration.  In my view the approach that accords proper weight to a fully considered but <span style="font-style:italic">obiter</span> view of a majority in the Supreme Court should be the same as that which a first-instance court takes to the decision of a court of co-ordinate jurisdiction, namely that we should follow it unless we are satisfied that it is clearly wrong.  It would be easier for us to be satisfied of that if it could be demonstrated that the argument before us had raised aspects of the tort gateway issue </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">If, as I believe, that is the correct approach, I have to say that I am not persuaded that the view of the majority was wrong.  There are powerful points to be made on both sides, as the division of opinion both in the Court itself and between McCombe LJ and Arnold LJ demonstrates.  As everyone agrees, the language of the Practice Direction is capable of both a wide and a narrow interpretation, and I do not believe that the history of the circumstances in which it took its current form affords any clear guide to which should be preferred.  Accordingly, the choice between the two interpretations depends on general considerations of legal principle and policy.  It seems to me that the real question is whether it is appropriate to have a gateway so wide that it would admit any claim in tort where the claimant has suffered significant damage of any kind within England and Wales, and thus to leave it to the discretion formerly known as <span style="font-style:italic">forum non conveniens</span> to restrict what would otherwise be an exorbitant exercise of jurisdiction.  I see the force of Lord Sumption’s objection (see paras. 28 and 31) that such a use of the discretion is contrary to principle, but Lady Hale (at para. 54) and Lord Wilson (at para. 66) considered and specifically rejected that objection.   I also see the force of the point made by Arnold LJ at para. 75 above about the increased scope for dispute at the permission stage; but that cannot be decisive in itself, and the majority in the Supreme Court must be taken to have appreciated that a “robust” or “muscular” deployment of the discretion would increase the scope for such disputes and must have regarded that as acceptable.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I would add by way of coda that it is rather surprising that there appear to be no accessible pre-legislative materials casting light on the policy underlying so important an issue as the basis on which the courts of England and Wales should, in modern conditions, be entitled to accept jurisdiction over a foreign defendant.  This is not, as might appear at first sight, because the question is the subject of a mere Practice Direction (though I am bound to say that that too seems surprising and rather unsatisfactory): the terms of paragraph 3.1 of PD 6B were taken unchanged from what was previously CPR 6.20 (8), and that in turn was taken, with one change, from O. 11 r. 1 (1) (f), so that any substantive pre-legislative materials would relate to those rules rather than the Practice Direction.  However we were not referred to any prelegislative materials relating to those earlier versions, and I infer that there has been no general review of the question for very many years.  I would assume that the impending departure of the UK from the Brussels regime has prompted a careful review within government, with appropriate consultation, about the principles which should govern the assumption of jurisdiction by the courts of this country not only over defendants situated in the EU but over other foreign defendants.  Such a review will inevitably cover the case of claimants who sustain damage in this jurisdiction as a result of a harmful event suffered abroad.  New rules, based on clear principles, would be of great value.  </p>

As Arnold LJ has demonstrated, neither Mr Edge’s first nor his second report contains any evidence about the Egyptian law of contract as it would apply to the pleaded claims; indeed, he appears to say in his second report that no claim in contract is being made.  Mr Ezzo does in his report discuss at some length the provisions of the Egyptian Commercial Code relating to contracts of carriage, and the applicable limitation regime (which he says would be time-barred), but the relevance of his discussion is only to his contention that any claim in tort would be defeated by the doctrine of <span style="font-style:italic">cumul</span>.  He says in terms that his report was prepared “on the assumption that there was a contract between [the Respondent] and [the Appellant]” and that he was instructed that he need not express a view “on this issue”.  It is unclear exactly what issue he is referring to, but he says nothing about the first two essential propositions.  As to the third proposition, Mr Edge does say, albeit only in the context of a vicarious liability claim in tort, that the Respondent would be entitled to bring a claim as her husband’s executrix and dependant: to anticipate, I believe that that evidence is a sufficient basis for a decision, at the permission stage, as regards the contractual claim also (see para. 203 below), but that is a distinct point.   </p>

That was the case in both <span style="font-style:italic">OPO</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Brownlie 1</span>.

On the contrary, in those cases where its application is not inappropriate it seems to me to represent a sensible and just way of avoiding the expense and complication of the parties having to investigate and prove foreign law.  That is most obviously sensible where the likelihood is that the effect of the applicable law will be substantially the same as that of English law (typically, though not only, where the law in question is that of a common law jurisdiction).   But it may also be attractive to the parties in cases where it is recognised that the foreign law in question is very different in its sources and structure, so that it it is entirely conceivable that it might produce a different substantive outcome from English law; even in such a case the trouble and expense of establishing whether that is so may be viewed by the parties as  disproportionate.  It is important not to lose sight of the fact that the rule only applies if both parties are content that it should: either can ensure that the relevant foreign law is applied substantively as well as nominally by pleading and proving its content.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="6">

I agree, but I would be cautious about abandoning altogether its distinct status as a rule of evidence: there may be circumstances in which its application is justified but which would be problematic to fit into an analysis based on a real agreement. </p>

If it were otherwise there would be no scope for the application of the default rule.  That conclusion is consistent with the Civil Procedure Rules.  Rule 16.4 (1) (a) requires a claimant to plead in their particulars of claim only a concise statement of the facts on which they rely: thus if they are not relying on the content of Ruritanian law they are not required to plead it.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">Andrew Baker J’s, is that it can make no difference to the issue of who has the burden of pleading foreign law that the claimant has expressly acknowledged that foreign law applies (i.e. as opposed to simply pleading on the basis of English law).  Indeed, as noted at para. 171 above, by definition the default rule only comes into play where foreign law <span style="text-decoration:underline">does</span> apply.  The distinction between accepting the application of foreign law and pleading its content is arguably not sufficiently appreciated in some of the authorities. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Finally as regards the sequence of pleading, although the foregoing in my view represents the approach to be followed in ordinary cases, I repeat that the default rule is to be applied flexibly.  It is always open to a court to direct that where a claimant accepts that foreign law applies to their claim (or it has been held that it does) they must plead the content of that law first.   Such a direction might be made on the basis that the default rule was inappropriate for reasons concerning the nature of the claim, as mentioned at para. 172 above; but it might also be appropriate for case management or other reasons peculiar to the particular case.   (Likewise, to get ahead of myself, it might sometimes be appropriate to direct that evidence of foreign law be served in a different sequence from the sequence of pleading.) </p>

Arnold LJ addresses the applicable principles at paras. 135-139 of his judgment.  I agree with what he says at paras. 135137.  What he says there is consistent with my own analysis of the correct approach in cases where jurisdiction is not in issue, but he draws attention to the additional obligations imposed on the claimant by the duty of disclosure. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">However, I must respectfully part company with paras. 138-139, which address the position where the claimant has accepted that foreign law applies but has adduced no evidence of its content and where the defendant objects to their relying on the default rule but does not wish to adduce their own evidence of foreign law in advance of seeing such evidence from the claimant.  I do not know how often defendants in practice adopt that position: I suspect that in many or most cases they simply adduce their own evidence of foreign law in support of the application to set aside.  But the question is whether in principle they would be entitled, as Arnold LJ believes, to insist on the claimant adducing evidence of foreign law before they do so.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">As to that, I can see no basis in principle why the sequence of evidence in the context of a jurisdictional challenge should be any different from the sequence of pleading in a case where no jurisdictional issue arises, as expounded above.  I of course accept that, as Arnold LJ says, the burden is on the claimant seeking permission to serve out to show that the claim has a real prospect of success.  But I do not see why that burden cannot be discharged by relying on the default rule unless and until the defendant adduces substantive evidence of the applicable foreign law: it is the production of such evidence that disapplies the default rule, not merely a party registering an objection to its application, as Arnold LJ suggests at the beginning of para. 138.  To characterise that approach as “reversing the burden of proof” is tendentious.  The effect of the default rule is – inevitably – that the burden of pleading (and, in the service out context, proving) the content of foreign law is on the party who wishes to contend that it is different from English law.   </p>

This is a necessary rule if proceedings are not to be stultified or unduly delayed, particularly in the interlocutory stages, in any case where the answer to a claim with a foreign element is clear so far as English law is concerned. It will often be the case that the material provided as to foreign law will be of an incomplete or provisional nature unsupported by detailed authority or by materials of the weight or complexity suitable to a final disposal, but nonetheless sufficient to satisfy the court that an arguable defence or other relevant issue has been established for the purposes of a decision at that stage of the proceedings.

In that case a Part 20 defendant was seeking to challenge the grant of permission to serve him out of the jurisdiction.  The claim against him alleged breaches of duties said to be owed to one of the defendants as an employee and/or fiduciary arising out of contracts which it seems to have been accepted were governed by Saudi law.  The application was heard by Sir Andrew Morritt C.  One of the issues was whether the defendant should have pleaded Saudi law in its Part 20 claim form, which was pleaded purely by reference to English law.  In the event the issue did not fall for decision but the Chancellor nevertheless addressed it in his judgment.  Counsel for the defendant had sought to defend his omission to plead Saudi law by reference to the default rule as then expounded in <span style="font-style:italic">Dicey</span>, submitting that “it was sufficient in the first instance to rely on the so-called presumption referred to in the second passage and leave it to the defendant to ascertain and rely on any aspect of the foreign law he considered to be different and material” (see para. 38 of the judgment).  The Chancellor said that that approach “[did] not reflect my experience either at the bar or on the bench” and (at para. 39) that the failure to plead the substance of the relevant Saudi law rendered the pleading deficient.  The passage quoted by Arnold LJ at para. 141 follows immediately thereafter.  The effect of that passage, read in the context of counsel’s argument, does indeed on its face appear to be that in any case governed by foreign law a party must plead and prove the substantive law supporting any necessary legal propositions, and not rely on the default rule.  I can only say that if that were the case it would, as I have already said, deprive the rule of any content, and I do not believe that it can be right.  I strongly suspect that the Chancellor’s intended reasoning was more limited.  The decision is not binding on us and the passages in question are shortly reasoned and contained in an <span style="font-style:italic">obiter</span> part of an <span style="font-style:italic">ex tempore</span> judgment.  In those circumstances I will only say that for the reasons already given I must respectfully disagree with what the Chancellor appears to say. </p>

Various interlocutory issues arose, one of which concerned what was the law applicable to the claims.

The claimants’ position had various aspects, but the relevant point for our purposes is that they submitted that it was not possible for them to plead a position on what the applicable law was until there had been findings of fact which might bear on that question, and that the case should proceed in the meantime on the basis of the default rule.  At first instance – [2013] EWHC 4111 (QB) – Simon J held that that approach was evasive; that it was appropriate to decide the appropriate law on the basis of the pleadings as they then stood; and that it was, as the defendants contended, the law of the five countries where the claimants had been mistreated.   </p>

The claimants had argued that the effect of Simon J’s order would be, wrongly, to put the burden on them to plead the details of five different systems of law in circumstances where they did not seek to aver that those systems were any different from English law.  The Court at para. 153 described this as “a wholly artificial and unrealistic way of looking at the case <span style="font-style:italic">when one considers the nature of the allegations made by the appellants </span>[my emphasis], and … the concession made by [counsel for the claimants]” – that concession being that it was unlikely that English law applied; and at para. 158 it confirmed that the result of its decision was that the claimants would have to plead their case that the conduct alleged was unlawful under the laws of the five countries in question, observing that that was in accordance with the requirement of CPR 16.4 (1) </p>

I think that this is because, despite what it says about “the real bone of contention”, the actual issue before it was not who should plead first but whether it was appropriate to reach a decision on the applicable law before any facts had been found: the interaction of those two issues complicates and somewhat obscures the analysis.  However, what matters for our purposes is that the Court’s reasoning was not based on any general propositions about the correct sequence of pleadings in a case where one party wishes to rely on the default rule.  On the contrary, it was avowedly specific to the (very unusual) circumstances of the particular case.  That is apparent from the words which I have italicised in para. 153, but it is to be noted also that in para. 157 the Court explicitly declined to address what it described as “some broader issues” which the defendant had apparently raised about the operation of the default rule, and instead made the point which I have quoted at para. 174 above, from which it appears that it treated the case as falling into the exceptional category where the application of the default rule is inappropriate.  On that basis, of course, its reference to CPR 16.4 (1) (a) is unexceptionable, since where it is inappropriate to apply the default rule a claimant will indeed have to rely on the content of foreign law.   </p>

It did not suggest that it stated the law wrongly.  On the contrary, it distinguished it.  It did so on the basis that the claim in that case involved “a complex international contract dispute” which was “not analogous on [its] facts to this [case]”.

That is consistent with my analysis of its overall reasoning: <span style="font-style:italic">Belhaj</span> was a case where, for particular reasons, it would be inappropriate to apply the default rule.

Lord Sumption’s reasoning clearly means that the Respondent cannot rely on the 1934 and 1976 Acts as such, and in her pleadings she has duly deleted any reference to them.  But Lord Sumption went on to say in terms that claims for bereavement and loss of dependency might well be available to her under Egyptian law even though as matters stood no such claims had been advanced; Lady Hale said the same at para. 33.  The question for us is whether such claims under Egyptian law can be advanced in reliance on the default rule or whether the actual content of the relevant Egyptian law would have to be pleaded and proved.  I do not think that Lord Sumption or Lady Hale were addressing that specific question: at that point the Respondent had not formally conceded that Egyptian law was the applicable law and thus had not pleaded (even in the minimalist way that she now does) that her claims were being brought under Egyptian law.  My provisional view is that there is no reason in principle why the default rule could not be relied on for this purpose.  If the rule applies, it does not mean that the Court is being asked to apply the 1934 and 1976 Acts as such.  It means only that it is being asked to proceed on the basis that Egyptian law recognises substantially equivalent rights – that is, that it permits an executrix and widow to claim damages on behalf of her husband’s estate and as his dependant.   </p>

At paras. 59-60 of Mr Edge’s report he says that Egyptian law permitted the Respondent to advance her vicarious liability claim in tort in her capacity as executrix and dependant.  Although it is unsatisfactory that he does not give the same evidence as regards the contractual claim, it is not unreasonable to infer that a similar rule would apply.  It is important to recall that Nicol J was not obliged to make a definitive finding on the point: he needed only to decide whether the Respondent had a real prospect of showing that under Egyptian law she was entitled to claim in those capacities.   </p>

As discussed above, that depends what you mean by “relies on foreign law”.  The Respondent relies on foreign law in the sense that she accepts that Egyptian law is the applicable law, but she does not do so in the sense that she relies on its actual content.

She submits that the default rule cannot operate in circumstances where the Court has evidence (third reason), or otherwise has reason to believe (fourth reason), that foreign law is different from English law; and that that was evidently the case here.  She was not referring to evidence showing that Egyptian law is different from English law in the very respects on which the claim depends: obviously such evidence would displace the default rule, but the whole issue in this appeal arises from the fact that there is no such evidence.  Rather, she made clear that what she meant was that the rule could not apply where the sources and structure of the foreign law in question were so different from those of English law that it was very unlikely that its effect in a particular situation would be, even substantially, the same.  I do not accept that.  I believe that the default rule may be just as beneficial in such a case as in one where the two systems of law are broadly similar: see para. 175 above.  For the same reason I respectfully disagree with the similar point made by Arnold LJ at para. 150 of his judgment. </p>

There can be nothing problematic (to use <span style="font-style:italic">Dicey’s</span> term) in proceeding on the basis that under the law of a foreign country it would be a requirement of a contract for the provision of the services of a car and driver that the supplier would use reasonable care for the customer’s safety – more particularly, that the car would be in a safe condition and that the driver would drive with reasonable care; or that if a guest makes such a contract with the concierge of a hotel the hotel itself will be, or will be treated as, a party even if the services are in fact provided by someone else.  I do not of course say that that is inevitably the position under the Egyptian law – only that this is not the kind of case where the propositions on which the claimant relies are of their nature problematic to apply in the context of a foreign country or its institutions.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Of course that is not what happened: both parties did adduce evidence.  The problem is that that evidence did not address the issue in question: in crude terms (this is in fact an over-simplification, but it will do for present purposes), it covered the Egyptian law of limitation and the doctrine of <span style="font-style:italic">cumul</span>, but not the issue of substantive liability.  The question is whether, where the parties in a claim covered by foreign law have chosen to adduce evidence of the content of that law as regards some but not all of the issues raised by that claim, that fact precludes them (or, more particularly, the claimant) from relying on the default rule as regards the issues on which no such evidence is adduced.  We were referred to no authority on the point, but I can see no reason in principle why it should, provided that the issues are substantially selfcontained.  The default rule is, as we have seen, a practical rule of evidence designed to assist in determining claims with a foreign element: I see no reason why its application needs to be all-or-nothing except in cases where dealing with different issues by reference to different systems of law might create real difficulties.  (I accordingly respectfully disagree with the first of the two points made by Arnold LJ at para. 151.)  That is not the case here.  The limitation and <span style="font-style:italic">cumul</span> issues do not depend on the issues which are otherwise determinative of liability.  That is illustrated by the fact that Mr Ezzo felt able to give an opinion on both issues without saying anything about the substance of the contractual claim.  I agree with Arnold LJ that it would normally be wrong to allow a party who had chosen to adduce evidence of foreign law on a particular issue to seek to repair deficiencies in the evidence relating to that very issue by invoking the default rule: the two routes should be treated as mutually exclusive.

If that were the case she would be affixed with the consequences of any failure to do so.  But no such common understanding could be established on the material before us, not least, though not only, because we do not have a complete picture of how Stewart J’s order came to be made: I have already noted the focus on the limitation issue.

Since I would decide the appeal in the Respondent’s favour on the basis that she was not obliged at the stage of the jurisdictional challenge to adduce evidence of the content of Egyptian law, it is at first sight contradictory to require her to plead it either, unless and until the Appellant does so.

On my analysis it would not follow from that fact alone that the Respondent should plead her case first.  However, I am inclined to think that she should do so at least as regards her vicarious liability claim in tort: she has already obtained evidence of Egyptian law on that aspect, and indeed went first with it at the jurisdiction stage (following the sequence to which she had agreed), and there should accordingly be no significant difficulty and expense in her pleading it.  And if that is so, then it seems to me cleaner that she should also go first in pleading the remaining Egyptian law on which she will have to rely as regards her other claims (and her entitlement to claim as her husband’s executrix and dependant).  It also appears to me that the precise basis of the claims being made may be relevant to the availability of a defence based on <span style="font-style:italic">cumul</span> and/or limitation, on both of which the Appellant has made it clear that it intends to rely; and the position will be easier for everyone if it can plead those defences in response to a substantive pleading of Egyptian law.  If in the end it turns out that the Appellant accepts that Egyptian law recognises the essential propositions, then some costs may turn out to have been wasted, but that is a price worth paying for having a complete Egyptian law case pleaded from the start and avoiding the risk of it having to be pleaded piecemeal by way of reply or further amendment.   </p>
