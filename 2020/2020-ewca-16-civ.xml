In March 2018 he was made subject to a placement order.  In November 2018 he was placed with prospective adopters and in April 2019 they applied to adopt him.  The parents, who have had no contact since October 2018, asked for leave to oppose the making of an adoption order.  On 1 November 2019, their application was refused.  B’s Children’s Guardian now appeals from that refusal.  The parents (naturally) support the appeal; the local authority opposes it. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The legal institution of adoption dates back to the Adoption of Children Act 1926.  After several legislative iterations, the process is now governed by the Adoption and Children Act 2002 (ACA 2002).  The number of adoptions, having peaked at around 25,000 in 1968, is now much smaller: 3,570 children looked after by local authorities were adopted during the year ending 31 March 2019. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The ACA 2002 brought about significant changes of principle and practice.  One of these concerned the process by which parental objections to adoption are considered.  Previously, the question of whether parental consent should be dispensed with was decided at the adoption hearing, the main basis for dispensation being that consent was being unreasonably withheld.  In many cases, this process artificially pitted prospective adopters and parents against each other and led to hearings at which the focus was rather on the parents than the child and at which the preservation of the confidentiality of the adoptive placement was a particular concern.  The ACA 2002 changed the main basis for dispensing with consent by linking it explicitly to welfare and it decoupled the decision about parental consent from the decision about adoption, enabling the court to decide the former at an earlier stage in the process.  The result is that by the time the adoption application comes to be heard it is hardly ever formally opposed. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">This outcome is achieved by the provisions concerning placement orders (ss. 21 and 52 ACA 2002) combined with those concerning adoption orders (ss. 46 and 47).  Section 21 provides for placement orders, which authorise a local authority to place a child for adoption with any prospective adopters it may choose.  By s. 21(3) and s. 52(1)(b) the court may only make a placement order if in the case of each parent or guardian of the child who does not consent it is satisfied that the welfare of the child requires the consent to be dispensed with.   </p>

Given modern expectation of life, this means that, with a young child, one is looking far ahead into a very distant future – upwards of eighty or even ninety years. Against this perspective, judges must be careful not to attach undue weight to the short term consequences for the child if leave to oppose is given. In this as in other contexts, judges should be guided by what Sir Thomas Bingham MR said in <span style="font-style:italic">Re O (Contact: Imposition of Conditions)</span> [1995] 2 FLR 124, 129, that "the court should take a medium-term and long-term view of the child's development and not accord excessive weight to what appear likely to be short-term or transient problems."

The mother, who continued to look after the three children, suffered an acute breakdown.

In the meantime B was born in April 2017 and removed to foster care shortly after his birth.  The judge made significant findings of fact adverse to the parents, aptly summarised by Mr Jones, counsel for the Guardian, as involving a cumulative picture of poor emotional parenting and significant physical abuse in the form of over-chastisement.  At the welfare stage there were detailed psychological reports in relation to the children and the mother.  These explained the children’s high level of need, and the mother’s difficulties in her mental health, and the effect of that on the children.   The judge recorded the parents’ limited insight and progress in tackling the problems that had led to the children being removed, and to their partial acceptance of the court’s findings about their treatment of the children.  At the same time he acknowledged the efforts they had made in attending for both general and specialist parenting support.  However, he found that there had been no full acceptance of the traumas that the children had experienced, and he noted a continuing lack of empathy on the mother’s part.  He therefore found that the children could not return home.  Specifically as to B, although the parents could meet his physical needs, he should not be returned to their care while the mother underwent therapy, something the judge considered would be “experimenting with his welfare”.   A placement order was made in his case and, as I have indicated, B was placed for adoption in November 2018.  Contact had ended in the previous month.  The eldest two children remained separately in foster care and the third child was provided with a specialist placement.  Regular parental contact with those children continued.  </p>

The parents, who were unrepresented, wrote to the court and were treated as having made an application for leave to oppose.  The local authority resisted their application and expressed deep concern that B’s permanent placement had not yet been secured.  Unlike his siblings, he has never lived with his parents and has formed a strong and positive attachment with his prospective adopters, with whom he is thriving.  He is a very sensitive child who has been required to move from his first carers at the age of 17 months and could not be expected to break another attachment.  The local authority therefore strongly opposed a change in care plan at such a late stage.  It initially argued that the s. 47(5) test was not met under either limb, but by August 2019 it acknowledged that the first limb was satisfied by the “stark” changes that had been made.   </p>

Having carried out her inquiries, the new Guardian took a different view to the social worker.  She regarded the first stage of the test as easily satisfied.  As to welfare, she could not rule out that possibility of B transferring to his parents’ care and  she advised that further information was needed in the form of expert evidence about B’s attachment and ability to transfer.  She considered that the prospect of a successful transfer of care was based on solid foundations and was not fanciful.  Her analysis also contended that the local authority assessment did not give sufficient weight to the impact on B of the loss of his birth family later in life.  The short-term effects of leave to oppose being granted could be contained, given B’s young age and through local authority support for the prospective adopters.  She recommended that the parents’ application should be granted and that updating assessments should be ordered within the adoption proceedings.    </p>

I wish they had been able to undertake it sooner. I realise how much they want to restore their family. I wholly accept their good faith and good intentions, their care for their children that is now being exhibited, the efforts that they are making. But I am concerned that where, in looking at the solidity of their prospects is concerned, the effects on the welfare of B, even bearing in mind, as I say, the benefits of a relationship with natural family, are such that I would fear for his future welfare in the event that there were to be a further disruption to his placement. And so I also, again, repeat that the parents are really now, for the first time, experiencing a reunification with the older children, and it is still a work in progress, it seems to me. It will be some time before there will be any certainty that the rehabilitation of the other three children has been successfully achieved. So, very, very sadly, I come to the conclusion that it would not be right for leave to be given. I would not wish there to be further delay, because it does seem to me that the journey that B is on is one where he is coming to a position where he is attaching and that is very important. I see what the parents believe, that they would not want a sudden change. I see that they are open to professional support. I understand all of that. But sadly, for the reasons that I have come to it appears to me that the welfare of B does require that this application be dismissed.” </p>

In support of this submission, he relies upon a passage from <span style="font-style:italic">Re W (A Child) </span>[2016] EWCA Civ 793.  In that case a child had been placed in foster care at birth and with prospective adopters at 7 months old.  After the birth of a second child to the mother, the maternal grandparents became aware of the birth of their first child and expressed the wish to care for her as well as the second child.  They were given permission to apply for a special guardianship order, and that application was heard together with the adoption application.  There was a conflict of professional advice as to what outcome was best for the child.  The judge made a special guardianship order to the grandparents.  The prospective adopters successfully appealed and the matter was remitted for rehearing.  The main judgment of this court, given by McFarlane LJ, considers the approach to be taken once a child has become fully settled in a prospective adoptive home and, late in the day, a viable family placement is identified.  Of relevance to the present case, he said this:  </p>

In a case such as the present, where the relationship that the child has established with new carers is at the core of one side of the balancing exercise, and where the question of what harm, if any, the child may suffer if that relationship is now broken must be considered. The court will almost invariably require some expert evidence of the strength of the attachment that exists between the particular child and the particular carers and the likely emotional and psychological consequences of ending it. In that regard, the generalised evidence of the ISW and the Guardian, which did not involve any assessment of [the child] and [the prospective adopters], in my view fell short of what is required.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The guiding principles for the exercise of the court’s power to grant leave to oppose an adoption application are clearly set out in the authorities to which I have referred.  The essence of the court’s task when considering an application for leave to oppose is to decide whether in all the circumstances it is in the child’s interests for fresh and upto-date consideration to be given to the question of whether parental consent to adoption should be dispensed with: see <span style="font-style:italic">Re B-S </span>at [13].  The statutory scheme is designed to ensure that when the court hears an adoption application it does not have to return to issues that were determined when the placement order was made, thereby causing delay and hindering the finalisation of plans for the child’s future.  Leave to oppose can therefore only be granted on welfare grounds if two hurdles have first been cleared: change of circumstances and prospects of success.  Where there has been no sufficient change, the statutory answer to the welfare question is a clear ‘no’.  Where there is no solid prospect of anything other than an adoption order being made, the answer will similarly be ‘no’.  There may then be other reasons connected to the child’s welfare that might lead the court to refuse leave: for example, where the existence of contested proceedings would have a harmfully destabilising effect upon the child or the placement.  However, there will be cases where there has been sufficient positive change, where there are solid grounds for opposing adoption, and where there are no overriding welfare considerations to prevent leave being granted.  It is for those cases, however few, that s. 47(5) exists.     </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">A decision about whether to grant leave under s. 47(5) should be taken promptly once the adoption application has been issued and the parents have indicated a wish to oppose.  It requires ‘proper evidence’ (<span style="font-style:italic">Re B-S</span> at [74(iv-v)]), but that should be gathered with a degree of determination that reflects the fact that critical time is passing for a young child awaiting a final decision about his or her future.  The decision can usually be made on the basis of written evidence.  Even allowing for factors beyond the court’s control (particularly the need for a change of Guardian), the six months that it took to decide this application was on any view far too long, particularly when set alongside previous proceedings that had lasted for a year in B’s case and two years in the case of his siblings. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It is well-established that where substantial change has taken place, the likelihood of the parents being able to show a solid case for opposing adoption will be the greater.  To be solid the case must have substance: see <span style="font-style:italic">Re B-S </span>at [57-59].  It must be a case that needs to be fully considered before a decision can be taken about adoption.  This calls for a broad and practical balancing up of the welfare advantages and disadvantages of granting leave.  I would not expect expert evidence or oral evidence to feature: indeed, if the court is seriously thinking that either might be necessary, it may be an indication that leave should be granted.  At all events, the decision on the grant of leave under s. 47(5) should not be allowed to develop into a trial of the adoption application on incomplete evidence. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">With those observations, I turn to the present appeal.  I approach it on the basis that the judge, who had been concerned with decision-making about this child since birth, was well aware of the legal framework for his decision.  It is also important to acknowledge that where there is more than one proper outcome, this court cannot substitute its own assessment for that of the judge.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.08in;margin-right:0.00in">To rule out the possibility of a birth family placement for B, even at this late stage, was premature.  The decision depended on a view of attachment that was not agreed as between the social work witnesses or supported by expert evidence.  This was a case where all the evidence, including expert evidence about the emotional and psychological effect on B of a further move, needed to be fully considered.  Nothing less than that could adequately resolve the professional disagreement in this case.  The firm stance taken by the Guardian and his own initial instinct that expert evidence may be needed should have alerted the judge to the fact that the parents’ opposition to B’s adoption needed to be fully considered.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:1.08in;margin-right:0.00in">By excluding the possibility of B being cared for by his parents the judge was inevitably prevented from weighing up all the matters that are likely to be relevant to his lifelong welfare.  The factors he found compelling (attachment and lack of a birth family relationship) could not be accurately evaluated on the available evidence.  Nor were they the only factors affecting B’s welfare, when there was evidence of considerable parental change leading to the return of his siblings to the family home.  The fact that a move would carry disadvantages is not in doubt, but it may not be the whole picture.  Even if B is to be adopted it is important for him to know in later life that he really could not have been cared for by his parents.    </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.08in;margin-right:0.00in">The negative aspects of a contested adoption hearing must always be taken into account, but in the absence of specific disadvantages, they cannot in themselves be given much weight.  Nor, despite the judge’s understandable concerns, can further short-term delay be very influential when seen alongside the lifelong significance of the decision about adoption.   </p>

There being no purpose in the matter being remitted, we granted leave to the parents to oppose the making of an adoption order and remitted the adoption application for an urgent case management hearing before the Designated Family Judge so that directions can be given for the gathering of the necessary evidence and the listing of the adoption application for an early final hearing.   </p>
