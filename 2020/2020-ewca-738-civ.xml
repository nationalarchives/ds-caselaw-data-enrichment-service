She had Down’s Syndrome, in addition to learning disabilities and behavioural difficulties, as well as some physical limitations.  Since 1993 she had lived in a residential care home in Lytham St Anne’s which was managed by United Response.  Her placement was paid for and supervised by Blackpool Council.  The home provided accommodation for adults with learning disabilities who required personal care.  It was not a nursing home.  Its staff had neither medical nor nursing training.  At the time of these events there were five residents living at the home. Jackie was subject to a standard authorisation granted by Blackpool Council pursuant to the Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (“DoLS”) set out in Schedule A1 to the Mental Capacity Act 2005.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.99in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Jackie died in hospital on 22 February 2017.  The cause of her death was: (i) perforated gastric ulcer and peritonitis; and (ii) pneumonia.  Jackie became ill over the two days before her death.  On 21 February a call to NHS 111 resulted in advice to consult a general practitioner.  The consultation took place over the telephone but continuing concerns later in the evening led to an ambulance being called.  The paramedics wished to transfer Jackie to hospital but she would not co-operate.  They concluded that manhandling her might cause injury.  An out of hours GP was telephoned who advised that attempts should be made to persuade Jackie to go to hospital but that if she refused, she should stay in the care home and be monitored overnight.  That was what happened.  The following morning Jackie’s condition was worse.  An ambulance attended and she was taken to hospital.  She was found to be severely dehydrated with kidney failure and metabolic acidosis. She had severe infection.  She died following a cardiac arrest later that day.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.99in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Before the coroner, Jackie’s family argued that the circumstances of the death dictated that there should be an inquest which satisfied the procedural obligation under article 2 of the European Convention of Human Rights (“ECHR”).  The coroner initially agreed. He called evidence at the inquest between 20 and 29 June 2018 which is accepted on all sides as satisfying the evidential obligations of the procedural duty.  However, before the jury was asked to perform its function under section 5 of the 2009 Act at the conclusion of the inquest, the coroner revisited his earlier decision.  In the light of recent authority, namely <span style="font-style:italic">R (Parkinson) v. HM Senior Coroner for Inner London South </span>[2018] 4 WLR 106, he decided that the evidence did not suggest that Jackie’s death might have resulted from a violation of the positive obligation to protect life imposed by article 2 ECHR, also known as the operational duty.  In consequence the procedural duty did not apply.  The jury’s conclusion was thus limited by section 5(1).  It decided who the deceased was and how, when and where she came by her death.  In answer to the question “how did Jackie come by her death?”, the jury concluded that her death came about by natural causes.  The jury also produced a short narrative description of the events of 21 and 22 February 2017. </p>

HM Coroner for North Humberside ex parte Jamieson </span>[1995] QB 1 at 24G to 25F.  They argued that the jury should be able to say that Jackie died of natural causes aggravated by neglect.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.99in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">A 40 year old man died after routine surgery to remove nasal polyps.  His widow argued that his death was the result of a hospital acquired infection and negligence in postoperative care.  Disciplinary, civil and criminal proceedings in Portugal concluded that there was no negligence.  The Chamber of the Strasbourg Court found a violation of both the substantive and procedural obligations under article 2.  Whilst not speculating on the chances of survival, it concluded that the risk of infection warranted immediate medical intervention, which had not occurred.  It identified a lack of cooperation between departments in the hospital amounting to a failing of the hospital service which deprived the deceased of the opportunity to have access to appropriate emergency care.  That was the foundation of the conclusion that the state had failed to protect the life of the applicant’s husband.  </p>

He was addicted to alcohol and prescription drugs and suffered from schizophrenia and depression.  On 1 April 2000 he attempted to commit suicide and returned voluntarily to hospital under a restrictive regime.  His condition improved sufficiently for him to be allowed to move within the grounds of the hospital.  He spent Easter with his family but was taken by his mother on 25 April to the emergency department of the local hospital because he had consumed a very large amount of alcohol.  He returned to the psychiatric hospital and to the same regime.  He spent most of the day of 26 April in bed.  There were no records of his condition or movements between 16.00 on 26 April and 08.00 on 27 April.  At 16.00 on 26 April he was noted to be calm and strolling outside the pavilion where he resided.  His mother was told that he was fine but he did not appear for dinner at 19.00.  A search failed to find him by 20.00 when he was reported missing.  It was not known when he left the hospital grounds, but he had in fact jumped in front of a train at a nearby station at 17.37. </p>

First, the positive obligation “on the state to put in place a regulatory framework compelling hospitals to adopt appropriate measures for the protection of patients’ lives.”  Secondly, the positive obligation “to take preventive operational measures to protect an individual from another individual or … from himself.”  The Grand Chamber then summarised the regulatory framework obligation by reference to <span style="font-style:italic">Lopes de Sousa </span>and stated that “the mere fact that the regulatory framework may be deficient in some respects is not sufficient in itself to raise an issue under art.2 of the Convention.  It must be shown to have operated to the patient’s detriment.” (paras. 105 to 107).  So far as the second obligation was concerned, the court referred to the well-known test derived from <span style="font-style:italic">Osman v United Kingdom </span>(2000) 29 EHRR 245 at para. 115 relating to imminent threats of death from third party criminal action.  It must be established that the authorities knew, or ought to have known, of the existence of a real and immediate risk to the life of an identified person from the criminal acts of another; and that they failed to take measures within the scope of their powers which, judged reasonably, might have been expected to avoid that risk (para. 109).

The Grand Chamber continued by reiterating the need for the authorities to discharge their duties in a manner compatible with the rights and freedoms of the individual concerned which diminishes the risk of self-harm, without infringing personal autonomy. In this regard, it referred to articles 3, 5 and 8 of the ECHR (para. 112).  The Strasbourg Court had always considered mentally ill persons to be particularly vulnerable: </p>

The House of Lords concluded that there was no difference in principle.

Many of those in hospital, or using the emergency services, are at real and immediate risk of death, and rely upon paramedics, doctors and other medical professionals to take urgent action to preserve their lives; yet there is no operational duty under article 2.  The existence of such a risk is not sufficient to trigger the operational duty.  The court did not have the benefit of the decision of the Grand Chamber in <span style="font-style:italic">Lopes de Sousa</span> which also was long in the future.

Lord Dyson (para. 21 et seq) then sought to “discover the essential features” of the cases where the operational duty to protect life had been recognised by the Strasbourg Court.  There were cases involving the assumption of responsibility, the paradigm of which was a person detained as a prisoner or a psychiatric patient.  He also noted that in circumstances of “sufficient vulnerability” the Strasbourg Court had applied the duty, citing <span style="font-style:italic">Z v. United Kingdom </span>(2001) 34 EHRR 79 which concerned a known risk of neglect and abuse of children ignored by social services for four and a half years.  The nature of the risk played a part in determining whether the operational duty was in play.  If the risk was an ordinary risk there was no such duty, but an exceptional risk might support it.  In the military context the Strasbourg Court (in <span style="font-style:italic">Stoyanovi v. Bulgaria </span>App. No. 42980/04) had considered a soldier’s death arising from a parachute accident.  It drew a distinction, at paras 59-61, between risks which were an ordinary incident of military life and “dangerous situations of specific threat to life which arise exceptionally from the risks posed by violent, unlawful acts of others or man-made or natural hazards” where the operational duty would arise.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.99in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Although these factors provide pointers, Lord Dyson acknowledged at para. 25 that they were not a sure guide to whether the Strasbourg Court would hold that the operational duty applies in any given circumstances which it had not considered before.  The jurisprudence on the operational duty was young and the boundaries were being explored by the court as new circumstances arose.  Nonetheless, for reasons in essence the same as those of Lady Hale he considered that the operational duty should apply to voluntary psychiatric patients. Melanie Rabone had been admitted to the psychiatric hospital because she was suffering from a psychiatric condition and had previously attempted to commit suicide.  There was a marked contrast with patients in hospital for treatment or surgery and a psychiatric patient who presents a real and immediate risk of suicide.  Lord Dyson concluded by observing that “the Strasbourg jurisprudence shows that there is such a duty to protect persons from a real and immediate risk of suicide at least where they are under the control of the state.”   </p>

The coroner declined to conduct an article 2 inquest.  The claimant argued that the fact that the death occurred in custody was sufficient to trigger the requirement of a <span style="font-style:italic">Middleton </span>compliant inquest.  Having reviewed the Strasbourg jurisprudence, the Divisional Court, at para. 24, extracted two principles.  First, that whenever someone dies in custody there is a positive obligation on the state to provide an explanation of the cause of death.  Secondly, that a suspicious death in custody inevitably raises the question of a breach of the operational duty under article 2 ECHR to protect life which means that the procedural obligation also arises.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.99in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Ms Butler-Cole QC for the appellant submits that the DoLS authorisation is not decisive of the question whether the operational duty was owed to Jackie, recognising that it is of a different character from custody, detention in a psychiatric hospital or admission to a psychiatric hospital as an involuntary patient.  She submits that it is relevant to an assessment whether Jackie’s overall circumstances, in particular her vulnerability, triggered the duty.  Although the Strasbourg Court has not considered the circumstances of adults, including the elderly, in care homes in the context of deaths following the suggestion of inadequate medical intervention, parity of reasoning with <span style="font-style:italic">Rabone</span> suggests that the operational duty is owed to those in care who lack capacity.  She submits that there was a systemic or structural failure by the care home to have an advance plan to make sure that Jackie could be transferred to a hospital if she resisted, there being an intermittent history of reluctance to cooperate with doctors.  There was a failure by the paramedics (or the ambulance service) in not having a plan for transferring to hospital a reluctant patient in Jackie’s position.  She submits that there was a real and immediate risk of death for the purposes of article 2 by the evening of 21 February of which the paramedics and GP should have been aware.  There was reason to suppose that the state failed in its operational duty to protect Jackie’s life.  Therefore, the procedural obligation arose and the coroner should have allowed the jury to return an expanded conclusion in accordance with section 5(2) of the 2009 Act.   </p>

She had learning disabilities which affected her ability to make choices for herself.  She lacked capacity to make decisions affecting her living arrangements, healthcare and welfare.  She shared those characteristics with a large number of young adults who, for a wide variety of reasons, are in a similar position.  An increasing number of elderly adults are in a parallel situation as a result of the infirmities of old age, especially diminished mental faculties or dementia. Individuals who share these characteristics may be accommodated in a range of different circumstances.  Many live at home cared for by family members.  Large numbers live in care or nursing homes, some paying for the care themselves, others with public funding.  Others are under the more direct care of a local authority or the NHS.  Since the amendment to the Mental Capacity Act 2005 made in 2007, and more particularly since the decision of the Supreme Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Cheshire West, </span>a substantial number of them will be subject to DoLS with the consequence that were they to seek to leave the home or hospital in which they reside their carers would have lawful authority to stop them.     </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.99in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The need to determine the nature or scope of any operational duty owed under article 2 becomes clear in the reasoning of the Strasbourg Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Dumpe</span>.  The applicant’s contention was that her son had been the subject of protracted sub-standard medical attention for some time both in the home in which he resided and also at the hands of a general practitioner.  He was, of course, vulnerable as a result of his impaired intellectual functioning and his mental illness.  Indeed, his circumstances are not dissimilar from those of Jackie.  He was also restricted in his liberty, as is clear from the use of the language of “escape”, although there is no discussion in the judgment of whether Latvia has an equivalent of DoLS as part of its legal system.  The court decided that the facts in <span style="font-style:italic">Dumpe </span>supported the conclusion that it was a medical case in the sense discussed in <span style="font-style:italic">Lopes de Sousa.  </span>That was despite the underlying suggestion that the failures in treatment and care were not isolated.  There was no breach of the operational duty owed under article 2.  The operational duty did not apply to the provision of medical treatment to someone in a care home.  Had the death resulted from neglect or abuse of the sort in play in <span style="font-style:italic">Nencheva </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">Câmpeanu </span>the position would have been different.

It was reported that the staff had noted blood in Jackie’s urine and there had been an episode of vomiting.  The receptionist at the surgery asked if Jackie could be brought to the surgery, but she was told that was not possible.  The receptionist said that a GP would attend at approximately 18.00.   </p>

As the decisions of the Strasbourg Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Nencheva </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">Câmpeanu</span> show, the article 2 operational duty is owed to vulnerable people under the care of the state for some purposes.  If a death in this jurisdiction in a hospital or care home for which the state was responsible resulted from conditions described in either of those cases, the substantive or operational duty under article 2 ECHR would be engaged.  So too if the state was aware of the shortcomings, through regulatory inspections, and did not act on them.  There would be a direct analogy in the latter situation with the failure of social services to protect children over a prolonged period when they knew of serious abuse (<span style="font-style:italic">Z v.

The coroner referred the details of Jackie’s case to the local area contact for the Review.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.99in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">There is nothing in the materials before us which suggests that there is a widespread difficulty in taking individuals with learning disabilities (or elderly dementia patients) to hospital when it is in their interests to do so.  The criticism of the care home, the paramedics and the out of hours GP is that between them they failed to get Jackie to hospital on the evening of 21 February; and that a plan, protocol or guidance should have been in place that would have achieved that end.  That is remote from the sort of systemic regulatory failing which the Strasbourg Court has in mind as underpinning the very exceptional circumstances in which a breach of the operational duty to protect life might be found in a medical case.  The making of plans in individual cases and the detail of guidance given to paramedics is far removed from what the court describes in the passage we have set out.  </p>
