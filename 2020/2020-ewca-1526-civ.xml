He also told us that threats have been made against his life, though I did not understand this to have been by the present Respondents. We are of course in no position to decide on the merits of these allegations. But <span style="font-style:italic">Curless, </span>and the many appellate authorities cited in it, make it clear that “due to the importance of the principle of open justice, it will usually only be in an exceptional case, established on clear and cogent grounds, that derogation from the principle of open justice (including the freedom to publish court proceedings) will be justified”. I do not consider that there are any clear or cogent grounds for granting anonymity in this appeal.  </p>

Allegations of discrimination in employment covered by Part 5 of the Act are within the exclusive jurisdiction of the ET by virtue of s 120. Allegations of discrimination in contravention of Part 6 of the Act dealing with education are among those within the exclusive jurisdiction of the County Court by virtue of s 114(1). An employment tribunal cannot hear a claim which is not within its jurisdiction, however convenient it might be to do so. Jurisdiction cannot even be conferred by consent. </p>

Paragraph 37 of the ET’s substantive decision (cited by the EAT at the start of its paragraph 4) indicates that “it is accepted that Mr Burke is disabled and [has] been decided by a previous tribunal at a previous hearing that both Respondents are qualification bodies.” It appears that there was no appeal from that determination. There is nothing in the judgments of the EAT or of this court to suggest that before them the jurisdiction of the ET was called into question on the grounds that the College of Law (not at that stage it seems, referring to itself as a university or using the word “university” as part of its name) could not be sued in an employment tribunal; moreover, the 2010 Act had not been enacted. I do not think any purpose would be served by excavating the now replaced provisions of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 which applied in 2009 to see how closely, if at all, they resembled ss 54 and 91 of the 2010 Act. The issue was simply never raised or considered on appeal.  I also note that the Second Respondent was the regulator, the SRA, which was and is a qualifications body rather than a university or higher education institution. </p>

In a comprehensive and learned judgment of Underhill LJ (with whom Patten and Lewison LJJ agreed) it was held that the employment tribunal did have jurisdiction.

In looking at s 54(4)(c) the choice is binary. Either an authority or body is the governing body of a s 91 institution or it is not; and likewise under s 54(4)(b) either it is the responsible body of a school to which s 85 applies or it is not. But I can see that there may be authorities some of whose functions are exercised under the Education Acts and some not, so that under s 54(4)(d) the words in question do mean “to the extent that”.  </p>

The degree course for which the Appellant was studying included seven modules which were compulsory in order to meet the requirements of the Solicitors Regulation Authority’s Legal Practice Course, and two additional modules which were not so required. It would, in Ms Davies’ words, be chaotic if the Appellant had to divide his complaints by reference to particular modules, claiming in relation to the seven compulsory modules in the ET and at the same time claiming in the county court relating to the rest. </p>
