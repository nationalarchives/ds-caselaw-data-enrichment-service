	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The Appellant, Mr Varma, appeals against the order made on 13 July 2020 by HHJ Johns QC sitting as a judge of the High Court following his judgment handed down on that day ([2020] EWHC 1868 (Ch)).  In that judgment, Judge Johns held that he was satisfied to the criminal standard of proof that Mr Varma had committed eight contempts of court by breaching court orders and by making false statements in affidavits and a witness statement made in these proceedings.  The underlying proceedings are brought by the Respondents who are the joint liquidators of a company called Grosvenor Property Developers Ltd (‘Grosvenor’).  The court orders were designed to identify, locate and recover for the benefit of Grosvenor’s creditors about £6 million of Grosvenor’s money which the Respondents claimed had been misappropriated such that the money or its traceable proceeds was now in the defendants’ hands.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">HHJ Johns’ judgment dealt with issues relating to Mr Varma’s liability and adjourned the issue of sentence to a later date.  Permission to appeal on four grounds was granted by Floyd LJ on 24 August 2020. Floyd LJ stayed the further hearing on sentence and expedited the hearing of this appeal.  A few days before the hearing of the appeal, Mr Varma replaced his legal team and Mr McCormick QC, who had not appeared below, was instructed to represent him on the appeal.  Mr McCormick demonstrated an impressive grasp of the complexities of the case and a more realistic assessment of the merits of the different aspects of the case than his predecessors.  We are grateful to him and to Mr Brown, who has acted for the Respondents from the start of the proceedings, for their cooperative approach which narrowed the issues before us and enabled them to focus their submissions on the most important points.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Grosvenor was incorporated on 16 December 2016 for the purpose of acquiring the Grosvenor Hotel in Bristol.  The hotel was derelict at the time and investors were sought to fund the redevelopment of the premises into studio flats to be used for student accommodation.  The only step that appears to have been taken to further that purpose was collecting in about £7.6 million from investors.  The hotel was never purchased and nothing was done towards redevelopment — it appears that the whole enterprise was a fraud. The Respondents estimate that at most about £540,000 was spent on what might be regarded as legitimate company expenditure, the rest was misappropriated. A winding up petition was presented against Grosvenor on 26 July 2018 and it was placed in compulsory liquidation by order made on 14 November 2018.   </p>

An order in that application was made by ICC Judge Jones on 2 April 2019 requiring the delivery up by Mr Varma of all documents belonging to Grosvenor or evidencing his dealings with the company or its property.  </p>

Siddhant Varma was a respondent named in the Birss order but was not subject to the freezing injunction. Paragraphs 9 and 10 of the Birss Order provided that Mr Varma, Mr Khadka, GCFZE and Siddhant Varma must within 48 hours disclose their assets exceeding £2,000 in value to the Respondents’ solicitors and confirm that information by affidavit within seven working days.   </p>

The Birss order provided that Mr Khadka must deliver up to the Respondents’ solicitors by 4 pm on 6 May 2019 those diamonds and jewellery that he and Mr Varma asserted that he was at that time holding for Grosvenor.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Those diamonds and jewellery (‘the Jewellery’) became an important part of the case pursued by the Respondents not only against Mr Varma and Mr Khadka but also against Siddhant Varma.  In brief, it was Mr Varma’s case that a substantial proportion of the money which the Respondents alleged had been misappropriated had in fact been paid by Grosvenor to Mr Varma’s company, GCFZE, when Grosvenor bought from GCFZE a large amount of jewellery belonging to Mr Varma’s mother. That Jewellery had been gifted by her to Mr Varma and then by him to GCFZE. This was the justification, he said, for a series of payments made by Grosvenor to GCFZE during the second half of 2017, amounting in total to £3,122,841.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Varma’s evidence about the sale of the Jewellery, which he claimed was worth more than Grosvenor had paid for it, was initially supported by two of the documents that he delivered up in response to the order of 2 April 2019 made by ICC Judge Jones.  The first document was an invoice dated 27 June 2017 for the sale of the Jewellery from GCFZE to Grosvenor for £4.95 million.  The second document was dated 11 June 2018 between Grosvenor and GCFZE and entitled “Settlement, Receipt, Release and Discharge”. This included recitals stating that Grosvenor had asserted claims against GCFZE, that the parties wished to settle the claims, and that Grosvenor accepted receipt of assets listed in a schedule in settlement of its claims against GCFZE. The assets listed in the schedule were the Jewellery referred to in the earlier invoice.  Mr Varma’s case appeared to be that Grosvenor had bought the Jewellery from GCFZE in June 2017 paying the £4.95 million price in part by the transfers of the £3,122,841 shortly thereafter and in part by releasing a year later unspecified claims it had against GCFZE.  As to why Grosvenor had bought the Jewellery from GCFZE, Mr Varma’s explanation has varied over time.   </p>

They have also maintained, as they are entitled to do, that even if the Jewellery did exist and was bought by Grosvenor, that amounted to a misuse of the company’s money. Such a purchase was outside the purpose for which Grosvenor was set up and there appears to be no good reason why money provided by investors intending to acquire an interest in flats to be let out as student accommodation should be spent on buying Mr Varma’s mother’s jewels. </p>

Subsequently, the Points of Claim were amended in November 2019 to add a claim that Siddhant Varma had received £2 million of Grosvenor’s money, channelled through one of Mr Varma’s personal Dubai bank accounts, and had used it to invest in a property in Charles Street, Mayfair. It was alleged that Siddhant Varma ‘well knew’ that the money was the traceable proceeds of a breach of fiduciary duty by Mr England and/or Mr Varma so that it was unconscionable for him to retain it.  In his robustly worded Amended Points of Defence served on 23 March 2020, Siddhant Varma pleaded that he did not know how his father and Mr England had conducted the business of the company. He set out his explanation for the £2 million paid to him as follows.  He said that his paternal grandmother Nirmala Varma spoke to him in mid-2017 at which time her health was failing.  She told him that she had given Mr Varma his share of his inheritance from her estate whilst she was still alive and that this consisted primarily of jewellery.  She said she had told Mr Varma to sell the jewellery and give Siddhant Varma £2 million which would represent his inheritance from her estate.  This intention on her part had been confirmed to him later by both Mr Varma and by a handwritten letter from his grandmother to Mr Varma which his father had shown him.  When he received the £2 million from Mr Varma’s Dubai bank account on 8 August 2017, therefore, he assumed that that was where it came from and, given that he knew his grandmother to be a wealthy woman with a great deal of jewellery, he had no reason to question the source of or reasons for the £2 million.  </p>

Judge Agnello handed down her judgment on 13 May 2020.  She recorded that Mr Varma had appeared before her acting in person and that there had been no attendance or representation of the other defendants although she was sure that they had all been served with the applications and evidence in support.  She noted that Mr Varma and GCFZE were debarred from defending the claims against them because they had failed to comply with ‘unless’ orders directing them to file Points of Defence.  She said that the Respondents still had to satisfy her on the balance of probabilities that they had established their case and that judgment should be entered in their favour.  Mr Khadka was not debarred from defending the claim, though he had failed to serve Points of Defence and was by then out of time to do so.

She referred to his assertion that he had acted at all times as a consultant to Grosvenor and/or that he acted on behalf of a ‘controlling person’ called Maneet Singh who he said was the beneficial owner of Grosvenor. Judge Agnello concluded at [42] that the evidence before her did not support the existence of Mr Singh or indicate that he played any role in Grosvenor and its affairs as described by Mr Varma. She concluded at [58] that Mr Varma was a de facto director of the company.  She considered a payment of £925,000 made into Mr Varma’s account in an Emirates Bank from an account held by Grosvenor’s solicitors Kennedys on Mr Varma’s instructions.  Although Mr Varma had originally asserted that this money was needed to pay an invoice for contractors working on the Bristol hotel development, he later said in his eighth witness statement that the payment was his commission for the sale of the Jewellery by GCFZE. The judge said that she was not satisfied that either explanation was true, and held that this sum was clearly misappropriated by Mr Varma: [62].   </p>

His case, she said, was that the payments had been made at the instruction and direction of Mr Singh and that they were made for the acquisition of diamonds and jewellery by </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">Grosvenor from GCFZE: [102].  She recorded Mr Varma’s explanation as to why Grosvenor had bought the Jewellery as being that Mr Singh had been concerned about Grosvenor’s bank deposits losing value during the period between collecting in the funds from investors and paying out the money for the purchase and development of the hotel.  He had therefore decided to invest those funds in the Jewellery which had been bought from GCFZE and ultimately delivered to Mr Khadka when he became the director of Grosvenor.  Judge Agnello regarded this explanation as implausible and lacking in credibility: [112].  Although Mr Khadka had stated that he had the Jewellery, he had failed to hand it over or produce any evidence that it actually existed and was in his possession. No valuations had been provided and there were no photographs or evidence of any bank safe where the Jewellery was kept.  There was also a complete lack of evidence about the existence and role of Mr Maneet Singh. The invoice and the Settlement Agreement were before her and, despite Mr Varma and GCFZE being debarred from defending the application, she addressed the question of what they showed.  The ‘most suspicious document’ was the Settlement Agreement, apparently signed by Mr Varma on 11 June 2018 in Mumbai.  The Respondents asserted this was fabricated, particularly because among other sums claimed in the account was money spent at Selfridges in London by Mr Varma using the company bank card on that day. The Settlement Agreement, Judge Agnello said, raised more questions than it answered. She explained why she did not regard the invoice as defeating the Respondents’ claim: [119].  She had no doubt that the £3,122,841 was paid over to GCFZE by Mr Varma in breach of the duties he owed to Grosvenor and that GCFZE was a knowing recipient of the money. She made orders accordingly that Mr Varma pay over sums of £1,361,513 (which sum included the £950,000 supposedly paid as Mr Varma’s commission on the Jewellery sale) and £3,122,841 and that GCFZE also pay over £3,122,841.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The third reason for rejecting the evidence of the transaction was the conflict between the explanation of the payment of £925,000 given by Mr Varma and the description of that payment in the instructions given by Mr Varma for the making of the payment at the time. Mr Varma now said that this was his commission on the sale of the Jewellery but the documents at the time of the transfer of the money described it as payment in relation to the building project at the hotel.  Judge Johns said that there was no legitimate purpose for that payment “but rather a series of pretended bases of which payment in respect of the jewellery and diamonds was just one”.  The fourth reason was that the judge rejected the evidence of the involvement of Mr Singh in Grosvenor and therefore the evidence that it was he who had decided that Grosvenor should buy the Jewellery.  Fifthly, the Settlement Agreement was “a very odd document” and did not fit with the rest of the story about the Jewellery transaction.  He found that the document had been created to make the pursuit of Grosvenor’s money more difficult and was not reliable evidence of a jewellery sale.  Sixthly, he rejected Mr Varma’s evidence that there had been a deed of gift by which he had gifted the Jewellery to GCFZE but that he was unable to produce it because it was locked in a fingerprint lock safe in Dubai.  Judge Johns said he was satisfied that there was no such safe and no cache of exculpatory documents. Seventhly, he referred to the findings of Judge Agnello that the £3,122,841 was not paid in respect of the Jewellery though he could give that finding only limited weight since Mr Varma had been debarred from defending the claim and a higher standard of proof applied in the committal application.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Judge Prentis dealt first with the claim against Mr England for paying away the bulk of Grosvenor’s money.  He described Mr England’s defence which was, broadly, that he was acting at all times as a nominee for Maneet Singh and had himself very limited control over the business of the company. Mr England’s account in his Defence was that Mr Singh would send him WhatsApp messages instructing him to make certain payments and Mr Singh would follow this up with a more formal letter of instruction if the payment amount was over £5,000.  A number of these purported authorisation letters were produced to the court.  Judge Prentis found that these were fabrications and that Mr England’s account of his dealings with Mr Singh was false, not least because a forensic expert testing the letters using Electro Static Detection Apparatus concluded that the pattern of impressions on the paper indicated that they were signed in a stack one on top of another at or near the same time.  Judge Prentis concluded that Mr England was “not a misled innocent” and that he had acted dishonestly throughout.  He was liable for over £6.5 million.   </p>

The relief sought against him as set out in the Points of Claim was, as I have described, that he deliver up the Jewellery.  Judge Prentis described the documents purporting to evidence the sale of the Jewellery between GCFZE and Grosvenor.  In addition to the invoice and the Settlement Agreement, he described a purported letter before him, dated the same day as the invoice, by which Mr Singh (acting for Grosvenor) asked Mr Varma (acting for GCFZE) to hold the Jewellery just sold to Grosvenor on trust for Grosvenor and to keep it at Mr Varma’s parents’ home in Mumbai.  The letter from Mr Singh said “I understand these will be kept at your parents’ home in Mumbai where I inspected &amp; checked the items earlier today.  I confirm they are in accordance to the details mentioned in your invoice and as per the valuation carried out by me last week.”  There was a further purported letter before Judge Prentis dated 9 June 2018 from Mr Singh to Mr Varma instructing him to hand all the assets of the company including the Jewellery to Mr Khadka who had just taken over from Mr England as the sole de jure director of Grosvenor.  The judge quoted from the various statements of Mr </p>

These included the email of 3 April 2019 to the Respondents’ solicitors in which Mr Khadka had confirmed that he still held the Jewellery and invited the Respondents to let him know if they wanted the Jewellery or would prefer that he sell it and transfer the proceeds to them.  Mr Khadka had not been heard from since that email; he had not responded to the proceedings nor acted on the Birss order that he deliver up the Jewellery.  Judge Prentis concluded that Mr Khadka’s failure to deliver up the Jewellery was an ongoing breach of his fiduciary duties and the claim against Mr Khadka in misfeasance was therefore made out. Mr Khadka was liable to Grosvenor for the value of the Jewellery which the judge took from the June 2017 invoice to be £4.95 million. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Judge Prentis then dealt with the claim against Siddhant Varma.  The key question was what he had known about the fraud from which he received various sums, in particular the £2 million. Siddhant had later transferred that sum to his solicitors as a part contribution to the purchase price of a property in Charles Street, Mayfair. The money was then lost because the property had been sold and the proceeds had been insufficient to satisfy charge holders taking priority over Siddhant.  Siddhant therefore also raised a change of position defence to the claim for the recovery of the money. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The claim against Siddhant Varma required the judge to grapple with the version of events pleaded by Siddhant Varma. Judge Prentis noted that Siddhant did not formally challenge the Respondents’ evidence that the £2 million transferred by Mr Varma was Grosvenor’s money.  He found that it was the traceable proceeds of Mr Varma’s and Mr England’s breaches of fiduciary duty.  Judge Prentis referred to Siddhant’s case that he had been told that his paternal grandmother had decided to sell some of her jewellery in order to anticipate the inheritance that Siddhant and Mr Varma would otherwise receive on her death and that Siddhant was to receive £2 million from the proceeds. Acknowledging that this was inherently implausible, Judge Prentis was nevertheless satisfied that it was true and that Siddhant’s receipt of the money was not unconscionable.  Judge Prentis accepted the evidence given at the trial before him by Siddhant’s mother that they were a wealthy family such that she and Siddhant were used to a lavish lifestyle of conspicuous consumption here and abroad.  He also accepted evidence that the Punjabi Indian community from which the family came traditionally held their wealth in jewellery and gemstones and used it to transfer wealth between the generations. Although Siddhant Varma had been caught out in various lies both in other documents and in some of his evidence before the court, Judge Prentis was not prepared to treat him as a wholly unreliable witness.  He accepted Siddhant’s evidence that he had no knowledge of the business in Bristol and that he had trusted and respected his father as a wealthy and successful businessman. He accepted Siddhant’s evidence about the phone call from his grandmother in mid2017 telling him about her intentions that he receive the £2 million and that this had been followed up by his being shown a letter from her to Mr Varma to the same effect.  His defence was also supported by the way that the grandmother’s estate had been divided when she died in January 2018 and by evidence from Ms Dumra, Siddhant’s mother, that her mother-in-law had owned a great deal of valuable jewellery.  After a careful and comprehensive analysis of many different pieces of evidence pointing in opposing directions, Judge Prentis held that the claim of knowing or unconscionable receipt against Siddhant therefore failed.  </p>

Judge Johns had questioned the very existence of the Jewellery and had upheld a finding of contempt arising from a statement in Mr Varma’s affidavit referring to the sale of the jewellery from GCFZE to Grosvenor.  That must have been because he was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that there had been no transaction by which the Jewellery had been acquired by Grosvenor from GCFZE.  By contrast, Judge Prentis had not only found that the Jewellery did exist but had ordered Mr Khadka to deliver up the Jewellery or its value. Such an order could only be based on a finding that Mr Khadka had held the Jewellery in his capacity as director of Grosvenor, that is to say that the Jewellery now belonged to Grosvenor and must have been bought by Grosvenor from GCFZE.  Judge Prentis further dismissed the claim against Siddhant Varma on the grounds that he accepted that Siddhant had genuinely believed that the £2 million paid to him was the share of the value of the Jewellery that his grandmother had wanted him to inherit.   </p>

What is the relevance of those matters to the grounds of appeal challenging the findings of Judge Johns at the committal trial?  Mr McCormick did not put his case too high but argued that, given that findings of contempt have to be established to the criminal standard, it is at least possible that if this evidence of Mr Singh’s existence, of the existence of the Jewellery and of the sale of the Jewellery from GCFZE to Grosvenor had been before Judge Johns, he might not have been satisfied to the required standard that Mr Varma’s evidence was untruthful. Mr Varma’s version of events was roundly rejected by the judge when he was standing alone at that hearing.  If Mr Varma had been able to rely on this evidence from his family - evidence which Judge Prentis later accepted as credible despite extremely competent cross-examination of the witnesses - there must be a real prospect that Judge Johns would not have been satisfied that the allegation that Mr Varma had made a false statement in his affidavit of 16 May.  That finding of falsehood had then infected Mr Varma’s credibility before the judge in respect of his evidence in relation to the other findings, whereas he might have been given the benefit of the doubt if the new evidence had been presented to Judge Johns.   </p>

Judge Johns’ statement at [45] that the evidence overall “does not support the involvement or even the existence” of Mr Singh does not amount to a finding that Mr Singh did not exist.  His focus, correctly, was on whether there was any evidence to support Mr Varma’s case that Mr Singh was the controller of Grosvenor and that it was Mr Singh who had decided that Grosvenor should acquire the Jewellery from GCFZE.  Both Judge Johns and Judge Prentis rejected the evidence of Mr Singh’s involvement in the management of Grosvenor, Judge Prentis in the context not only of the Jewellery transaction but as an important plank of the defence put forward by Mr England.  Even if the new evidence establishes that Maneet Singh was involved in an earlier receivership of a company in which Mr Varma was also involved, that does not negate the reasons Judge Johns gave for rejecting Mr Varma’s evidence about Mr Singh.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">As to Finding 1, I have set out the seven reasons Judge Johns gave why he was satisfied that Mr Varma’s story about the sale of the Jewellery was untrue. One must bear in mind that at that stage Mr Varma was not seeking to explain the transaction between Grosvenor and GCFZE by reference to his mother’s wish to make a substantial gift to him and to Siddhant.  Instead, Mr Varma said that he had given the Jewellery to GCFZE under a deed of gift kept in a fingerprint locked safe in Dubai and that Mr Singh had then decided that Grosvenor should buy it. The only explanation Mr Varma had given as to why Mr Singh wanted Grosvenor to buy the Jewellery was the explanation recorded in Judge Agnello’s judgment that Mr Singh had been concerned to maintain the value of the invested funds prior to their use to buy the hotel and pay for the redevelopment. Even if the new evidence had been before Judge Johns and he had accepted, as Judge Prentis did, that the Jewellery had come from Mrs Varma and had been intended to form part of the inheritance of Mr Varma and Siddhant, that does not provide any plausible reason why Mr Varma would gift the jewels to GCFZE or why Grosvenor would then buy the jewels from GCFZE.  </p>

In order to conclude that the defence was made out, the judge did not have to find that the Jewellery actually existed or that it had been bought and sold as between Grosvenor and GCFZE.  His findings as regards the Jewellery and Siddhant Varma do not touch on the transaction between Grosvenor and GCFZE since whether or not it was true, the money was still the result of a breach of fiduciary duty.</p>

It was clear that Mr Varma had not sworn an affidavit on behalf of GCFZE so the question for Judge Johns was whether that put Mr Varma in breach of the order. Judge Johns referred to the principle that a director may be personally liable in contempt for a breach of an order by a company if he is responsible for the act or omission constituting the breach: [117].  He held that Mr Varma’s evidence was that he performed the role of director for GCFZE and no other person had been identified as able to make an affidavit on the company’s behalf. Mr Varma’s position was that he did not realise that the order placed him under any obligation to make the affidavit for GCFZE. The judge held that that was no defence because it is not a necessary ingredient of contempt that the contemnor knows that he is breaching the order or that he intends to breach the order.</p>

In para. 12-101, the learned authors refer to the case of <span style="font-style:italic">Irtelli v Squatriti </span>[1993] QB 83 as hinting at “a degree of apparent coalescence between the requirements for mens rea in civil and criminal contempt”.  In that case the defendants were injuncted from selling, disposing or otherwise dealing with a property of which they owned the freehold. They later executed a charge over the property in favour of another.  At the first instance hearing they did not attend and were found liable for contempt.

There are various unsatisfactory features about the judgments in <span style="font-style:italic">Irtelli</span>.
