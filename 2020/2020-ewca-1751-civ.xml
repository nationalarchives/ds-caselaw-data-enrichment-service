	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">These issues arise in the context of a challenge by the Appellant, a local resident, to the decision of the Respondent local planning authority (“the LPA”) of 8 November 2018 to grant conditional planning permission for land described as “off Greenfields Recreation Ground, Falstaff Street, Shrewsbury, Shropshire” (“the Site”) for development comprising the building of 15 dwellings on the application of the Second Interested Party (“the Developer”).   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The relevant land was subject to a statutory trust for public recreational purposes, and had been sold by the local council which owned it (not the LPA) without compliance with the mandatory statutory requirements for advertising such a disposal.  In her judgment ([2019] EWHC 3539 (Admin)), Lang J held that, if the disposal of the land did not bring the trust to an end, the trust obligations were nonetheless unenforceable as against the Developer as purchaser.  She held that, in determining the planning application, the LPA acted unlawfully in failing to take reasonable steps to acquaint itself with the Site’s history and legal status and to consider the legal implications of the sale, but went on to hold that, had the LPA acted lawfully, it would have recognised the unenforceability of the trust obligations against the Developer and it would still have granted the planning permission that it did.  Thus, applying section 31(2A) of the Senior Courts Act 1981, she concluded that no relief should be granted; and she refused the judicial review.  In this appeal, the Appellant contends that Lang J was wrong to refuse his application.             </p>

At that time, it was unaware that the trust applied to this land, and so did not disclose that fact in its application.  On 10 February 2012, the LPA’s Central Planning Committee approved the application; and, on 23 March 2016, the LPA granted outline planning permission subject to an agreement under section 106 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (“the 1990 Act”).  In respect of that grant, reserved matter approvals have not been granted and the planning permission has not been implemented.

However, for the purposes of this appeal which power was used is immaterial; because, as Lang J herself recognised (see [78]), although the 1875 Act contains no express trust comparable with section 10 of the 1906 Act, it is wellestablished (and common ground in this case) that land acquired under either provision is held on a similar trust for public enjoyment (see, e.g., <span style="text-decoration:underline">Attorney General v</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">Sunderland Corporation</span> (1876) 2 Ch D 634 at page 641 per James LJ, and <span style="text-decoration:underline">R (Friends</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">of Finsbury Park) v Haringey London Borough Council</span> [2017] EWCA Civ 1831; [2018] PTSR 644 at [16] per Hickinbottom LJ).  Indeed, section 122(6) of the 1972 Act defined the term “public trust land” as used in that section as originally enacted to mean “land held as public walks or pleasure grounds [i.e. held under section 164 of the 1875 Act] or in accordance with section 10 of [the 1906 Act]”; and, now, section 122(2B) of the 1972 Act (which concerns the appropriation of land by local authorities) expressly refers to “land held <span style="font-style:italic">in trust</span> for enjoyment by the public in accordance with [section 164 of the 1875 Act]” (emphasis added).  For convenience, in this judgment, we shall use the term “section 10 trust” to cover both a trust arising under section 10(a) of the 1906 Act and the similar implied trust on land owned by a local authority under the 1875 Act.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">However, a section 10 trust is not a trust in the usual private law sense because, although the local authority is clearly obliged to hold the relevant legal title for the benefit of the public, the trust does not have any beneficiary recognised as such in equity; nor is it a charitable trust or one of the small band of non-charitable purpose trusts (such as for the upkeep of a grave) which equity recognises.  It is a statutory construct, in respect of which Parliament alone has determined the obligations and rights involved.  Having said that, at first blush, it appears to have some similarities with a purpose trust; but there is a significant difference relevant in the context of this appeal.  In a charitable or other purpose trust recognised by equity, the trustees generally hold the trust property on trust to apply the capital and/or income of the property in furtherance of the charitable or other purpose.  However, in the case of section 10 trust, the land is held and administered by the local authority to allow <span style="font-style:italic">its</span> enjoyment by the public as an open space, and there are no residuary beneficiaries entitled in the event that the purpose fails.  In this sense, the land and the trust are inseparable.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Thus, a section 10 trust imposes an obligation on a local authority in respect of the relevant land that requires the authority to hold, maintain, control and regulate the land to allow the enjoyment of it by the public as open space and for no other purpose.  It includes a primary obligation on the authority to allow public access – “they must allow the public the free and unrestricted use of it” (<span style="text-decoration:underline">Lambeth Parish</span>, cited at paragraph 20 above, at page 631 per Lord Halsbury LC), an obligation described by </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Section 10 attaches the obligations of the statutory trust, and the duty to maintain etc, only where a local authority has acquired an “estate or interest in or control over…” the relevant open space: on the face of the statute, the trust obligations on the authority therefore go hand-in-hand with ownership or control.  Indeed, for the primary obligation to allow the public free access to be satisfied, some control over the relevant land must generally be essential.  The power in a local authority to lease land that is subject to a trust does not diminish this proposition because, in circumstances in which an authority has acquired land exclusively for the purposes of public recreational purposes, the statutory scheme envisages temporary, relatively short-term lets for some other purpose, e.g. where the land is not yet required for the purpose for which it has been acquired (<span style="text-decoration:underline">Attorney General v Hanwell Urban District</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">Council</span> [1900] 2 Ch 377, a case concerning a local authority’s purchase of land for sewerage works under section 175 of the 1875 Act, at page 383 per Lord Alverstone MR).  Section 164 of the 1875 Act also allows for both purchase or lease of land by an authority, and support by that authority of public walks or pleasure grounds provided by someone else; but it seems to us that trust obligations would equally apply only in the former case. </p>

However, the Act does not appear to envisage any circumstances in which any obligations of or powers in a local authority arise other than in the context of (i) ownership or control of the relevant land, or (ii) agreement with someone else who owns or controls the relevant land.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Goodman’s primary submission on this issue was focused and attractively simple.  A section 10 trust is a creature of statute, and it cannot be discharged except under express statutory provision.  The only such provision is section 123(2B) of the 1972 Act, which expressly frees land from such a trust on disposal where the statutory requirements have been met.  Where, as here, the statutory requirements have not been met, the trust remains extant.  It is a tenet of statutory construction that Parliament does not use empty words; and so it must be inferred that, but for section 123(2B), the trust would subsist on disposal.  By making specific provision for the discharge of the trust when the statutory requirements had been met, it must be inferred that, although section 128(2)(a) ensured that the disposal of the land to the disponee Developer was valid and legal title to it passed, it was the Parliamentary intention that the trust subsists when those requirements have not been met.  It would be wrong to imply any power to discharge over and above section 123(2B); and, Mr Goodman submits, unnecessary because there are other statutory powers that are available for that purpose.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Garvey denied that section 123(2B) is determinative in that way.  He accepted that an express provision that, where statutory requirements are met, then on disposal land that had been the subject of a section 10 trust shall be freed from such a trust, might create an inference of construction that, where such requirements were not met, then the trust shall continue.  However, looking at the statutory scheme as a whole, he submitted that that inference could not be sustained.  In particular, a section 10 trust effectively runs with the land, in the sense that section 10 trust obligations on a local authority cannot be divorced from ownership and/or control over the relevant land by that authority; and the statute does not impose any obligations on a third party.  Therefore, on a disposal of land, the disponee (whose legal title and interests are protected by section 128(2)(a)) is not obliged to allow the public access to the land at all.  The trust, if it were to continue, would be wholly empty and unenforceable.  However, section 123(2B) only being effective on a disposal, there would be no statutory mechanism by which that trust could be brought to an end.  Parliament cannot have intended that there should be a perpetual unenforceable trust attaching to such land.  As his primary argument, he submitted that Parliament can only have intended that the trust cease upon a disposal, even where the statutory requirements have not been met. </p>

Thus, whatever the circumstances of the disposal and irrespective of what is or should be in the mind of the authority and the disponee, it overcomes any argument that the disposal was void (and therefore the disponee has no legal title) because the authority had no power to make it.  </p>

In other words, he will take the land without the burden of the section 10 trust unless he has actual knowledge that the requirements have not been met. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">First, Mr Goodman submitted that this section 128(2) “safeguards the validity of title but imports no expectation to the landowner to develop the site as they wish”.   However, section 128(2)(b) provides that a person claiming under the authority (e.g. a disponee such as the Developer in this case) “shall not be concerned to see or enquire” whether any of the statutory consents or requirements has been complied with.  In our view, that is inconsistent with the trust continuing.  It is to be noted that it is in negative mandatory terms (“… shall not…”).  Such a provision would be odd – indeed, positively misleading – if Mr Goodman’s construction were correct.  In our view, it clearly <span style="font-style:italic">does</span> give rise to an expectation by a “person claiming under the authority”, such as the purchaser of the freehold, that the disponee will not be constrained in law by any aspect of a statutory trust where the statutory requirements have not been complied with by the disposing authority.  On Mr Goodman’s construction, if a purchaser of the freehold followed – indeed, given the mandatory terms of section 128(2)(b), one could say “obeyed” – section 128(2)(b) and did not concern himself with the question of whether the necessary consents had been given and requirements complied with, he would risk obtaining legal title to land subject to a perpetual statutory trust which, leaving aside the inherently unlikely (e.g. he was committed to building only a bandstand on land which he properly considered to have no relevant restriction on development), may effectively deny him the opportunity to develop or use the land at all whilst leaving him with that interest in the land which he purchased (and any private law remedies the purchaser may have).  As Mr Garvey submitted, that would make the apparent benefit given by section 128(2)(a) a positive burden, and belie the heading and apparent purpose of the section, namely “… protection of purchasers”.  That the trust ceases on disposal in these circumstances is, in our view, entirely unsurprising, given the general inseparability of the land and the trust that we have described (see paragraphs 21-23 above). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Third, we do not consider that Mr Goodman’s submission that it is unnecessary to imply the power to discharge such a trust over and above the power in section 123(2B) because there are other statutory powers that are available for that purpose to be of any great force.  As an example – we assume the most compelling example he was able to find – Mr Goodman referred us to section 203 of the Housing and Planning Act 2016 and its predecessor, section 237 of the 1990 Act.  However, these are/were aimed at a different matter, namely the overriding of rights etc which attach to land at the expense of other land in the form of (e.g.) an easement.  Thus, section 237 of the 1990 Act allowed the overriding of interests or rights defined (in section 237(2)) as “… any easement, liberty, privilege, right or advantage annexed to land <span style="font-style:italic">and adversely affecting other land</span>…” (emphasis added).  Section 203 of the 2016 Act is in very different terms, but it still purports to deal with “Power to override easements and other rights”; and, where such rights are overridden, the relief available under section 204 is compensation in money terms.  Although we did not hear full submissions on this issue, section 203 is clearly not aimed at statutory trusts for public benefit.  In our view, these provisions do not assist with the interpretation of the 1972 Act.      </p>

Indeed, it seems to us that that (and the possibility of sanctions against local authorities and individual officers and councillors) would act as a salutary constraint on an authority and a potential developer agreeing to a sale of land subject to a section 10 trust without complying with the relevant statutory requirements.

The lodge, it was held, formed part of a country park pursuant to the Countryside Act 1968.  The relevant local authorities wished to recover the building so that it could be used as an information centre; but the lessee applied to buy the freehold of the lodge and served a right-to-buy notice under section 5 of the Housing Act 1980.  In response, the authorities purported to lease the lodge to one of their number (Plymouth City Council) without complying with the statutory requirements.

However, the confirmation in those cases that that provision protects the validity of title says nothing about whether public recreational rights over the land sold – which did not feature in either case – subsist.

Mr Goodman relies upon the observations of Elias J at [28]-[30], in which, while noting that section 128(2)(a) protects a disponee from invalidity of title, the judge particularly emphasised “that this is not the same as saying that the purchaser should be treated as if the consent [of the Secretary of State] had been given” (at [28]).  However, the straightforward and obvious point Elias J was making there, not relevant in the case before us, was that the statute gives no protection from unlawfulness by the authority other than the failure to comply with the relevant statutory requirements (in that case, to obtain the consent of the Minister).   </p>

It would be strange if this subsection meant that the authority was relieved of its duties once a contract to sell was made.  One would not expect it to be free of its duties until it was no longer in a position to control the land in question, and that would be on conveyance.  Yet if the respondent is right and the contact fixes the time of disposal, the making of the contract itself brings the trust to an end.  If for some reason the conveyance never took effect, such as where there was a termination of the contract by mutual agreement, then it would seem that the authority would retain control of the land but apparently unencumbered by the former trust duty.” </p>
