His landlord is The Royal Borough of Kingston-upon-Thames (“Kingston”). His weekly rent includes a charge for water. Like many local authority landlords, Kingston has a written agreement with the water undertaker (in this case Thames Water Utilities Ltd or “TWU”) for the supply of water to its thousands of let properties. The relevant agreement was made on 14 January 2003 (“the 2003 agreement”). If Kingston was a re-seller for the purposes of the Water Resale Orders 2001 and 2006 then the amount that Kingston can pass on to its tenants is capped. The main issue on this appeal is whether Kingston, under the terms of the 2003 agreement, was a water re-seller before it was varied in 2017. Morgan J held that it was. His judgment is at [2019] EWHC 3261 (Ch). Like the judge, I have set out the text of the agreement in an Appendix to this judgment. It is common ground that if Kingston was a water re-seller, the charge that it has made to Mr Moss exceeds the cap. </p>

Under section 6 of that Act the Secretary of State has the power to appoint a company to be a water undertaker for an area within England and Wales. As mentioned, TWU is the undertaker for Kingston’s area. A water undertaker has a statutory duty to supply water to domestic premises (“the domestic supply duty”); and to maintain the connection between the undertaker's water main and the service pipe by which that supply is provided to those premises: section 52 (1).

Where the later contract differs from the earlier contract, prima facie the difference is a deliberate decision to depart from the earlier wording, which again provides no assistance. Therefore a cautious and sceptical approach to finding any assistance in the earlier contract seems to me to be a sound principle.” </p>

In a number of instances we were asked to infer that there had been communications between Kingston and Thames Water Authority (TWU’s predecessor) that were undocumented. The totality of that material goes far beyond anything sanctioned by the principle that a contract must be objectively interpreted. Although there is some similarity between parts of the 2003 agreement and the earlier correspondence, there are also significant differences between them. Mr Bhose pointed to the similarities, while glossing over the differences. It must also not be forgotten that one of the purposes of entry into a formal written agreement (especially one with an “entire agreement” clause) is that the written agreement will contain a definitive record of the parties’ rights and obligations. In addition, clause 9.1 of the 2003 agreement states that the agreement would supersede all previous arrangements or agreements relating to the matters referred to in it. That is a clear recognition of a fresh start. The attempt to match clauses in the 2003 agreement to parts of the earlier correspondence is not, in my judgment, the correct way to interpret a formal written contract of this kind. </p>

That, he said, was an offer which Kingston had accepted such as to bring a binding contract into existence. That submission depended on selecting parts of the letter, much of which is expressed in very tentative terms, as identifying the terms (or, as Mr Bhose put it, the “core terms”) of the putative contract. But in the case of the proposal about void allowances, for example, two methods of calculation were proposed neither of which was quantified. The only document amounting to an alleged acceptance that we were shown was a resolution of Kingston’s finance and general purposes sub-committee, dated over four months later, which purported to accept “arrangements” with Thames Water Authority, including a void allowance of 1.75% in respect of water rates. That figure does not feature in the letter of 27 October 1977.

This means that Kingston will be paying water charges in circumstances in which there is no occupier liable to pay; and hence no other person potentially liable to TWU. This can only be a primary liability. It is difficult to see how payments made by Kingston to TWU have different characteristics when they are paid under a single agreement.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Although the reduction under clause 3.2 is referred to as “commission” it does not carry any of the hallmarks of a commission. Moreover, it is referred to in clause 2.2 simply as a “reduction” or “allowance”. A commission is usually a payment due from principal to agent where the agent has effected some actual transaction on the principal’s behalf. Typically, the agent will have sold goods or collected monies on behalf of the principal. The commission will generally be a percentage of the proceeds of what the agent has actually achieved. But in this case the commission is not dependent on what Kingston actually collects from its tenants. What it is liable to pay TWU is fixed by the agreement, whether the tenants pay or not. Although called a “commission,” it is in reality no more than a reduced price reflective of the fact that Kingston has relieved TWU not only of the administrative burden of collecting water charges from tenants individually; but also the risk of non-payment and late payment.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The provision of water and sewerage services is zero rated for VAT. So the requirement of an invoice under clause 4.2 is said to show that there was an agency relationship between TWU and Kingston. But, as the judge pointed out at [63], the clause refers to “any” VAT payable; so the agreement contemplated that there might be none to pay. The so-called “commission” encompassed both the risk of nonpayment by individual tenants, and also the administrative burden of collection. Mr Bhose asserted and accepted that on his analysis only the latter could be a taxable supply; and that each of the 8 payments in any given year was a separate supply. There would, therefore, have to be a series of apportionments between that part of the so-called “commission” referable to the risk of non-payment, and that part which was referable to the supply of a service. The 2003 agreement contained no machinery or guidance about how to do it. Depending on how much Kingston actually managed to recover from its tenants during the relevant period, the apportionment might be different each time. This is an improbable exercise for the parties to have intended. </p>

That element of retrospectivity, he said, showed that the parties intended to achieve continuity. In the first place, that argument is inconsistent with clause 9.1 which states expressly that the 2003 agreement was intended to supersede all previous arrangements. Second, since the previous arrangements themselves lead to no clear answer, the effect of the 2003 agreement must be found within its own terms. </p>

The only result of referring to authorities for that purpose is confusion and error, in this way, that if you look at a similar instrument, and say that a certain construction was put upon it, and that it differs only to such a slight degree from the document before you, that you do not think the difference sufficient to alter the construction, you miss the real point of the case, which is to ascertain the meaning of the instrument before you. It may be quite true that in your opinion the difference between the two instruments is not sufficient to alter the construction, but at the same time the Judge who decided on that other instrument may have thought that that very difference would be sufficient to alter the interpretation of that instrument. You have, in fact, no guide whatever; and the result especially in some cases of wills, has been remarkable. There is, first, document A, and a Judge formed an opinion as to its construction. Then came document B, and some other Judge has said that it differs very little from document A—not sufficiently to alter the construction— therefore he construes it in the same way. Then comes document C, and the Judge there compares it with document B, and says it differs very little, and therefore he shall construe it in the same way. And so the construction has gone on until we find a document which is in totally different terms from the first, and which no human being would think of construing in the same manner, but which has by this process come to be construed in the same manner.” </p>

These possible meanings of "on behalf of" were taken from the earlier decision in <span style="font-style:italic">R (on the application of S) v Social Security Commissioner</span> [2010] PTSR 1785 where the decision was that these formulations were narrower than “for the benefit of”.

	    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.00in">“In deciding whether a charge is a fixed charge or a floating charge, the court is engaged in a two-stage process. At the first stage it must construe the instrument of charge and seek to gather the intentions of the parties from the language they have used. But the object at this stage of the process is not to discover whether the parties intended to create a fixed or a floating charge. It is to ascertain the nature of the rights and obligations which the parties intended to grant each other in respect of the charged assets. Once these have been ascertained, the court can then embark on the second stage of the process, which is one of categorisation. This is a matter of law. It does not depend on the intention of the parties. If their intention, properly gathered from the language of the instrument, is to grant the company rights in respect of the charged assets which are inconsistent with the nature of a fixed charge, then the charge cannot be a fixed charge however they may have chosen to describe it. A similar process is involved in construing a document to see whether it creates a licence or tenancy.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">As far as loss of rights is concerned, Mr Bhose’s point was that if Kingston was “the consumer” as defined by the legislation, then the obligations of the water undertaker were owed to it, rather than to the occupier. The loss of these rights seems to me to be more of a theoretical than a practical concern. In any event since the Act expressly permits the water undertaker to enter into an agreement placing liability for water charges on someone other than the occupier, that potential mismatch is inherent in the scheme of the Act. But even if I am wrong about that, the loss of those rights is simply a consequence of the agreement that Kingston in fact made. </p>

The agreement was thus an agreement “to the contrary” for the purposes of section 144.  It follows that under that agreement Kingston was a re-seller with the meaning of the Water Resale Orders.  </p>
