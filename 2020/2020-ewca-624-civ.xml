In the Decision Ofcom granted authorisation to Inmarsat Ventures Limited (“<span style="font-style:italic">Inmarsat</span>") for the use of 2GHz spectrum by ground stations in connection with the operation of an in-flight mobile communication service which used both ground stations and satellites. The authorisation was to “…<span style="font-style:italic">establish, install and use</span>” wireless telegraphy apparatus (i.e. the ground stations) in connection with the in-flight mobile service. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The issue arises in the following way.  On 13th May 2009 Inmarsat was selected by the European Commission to be the grantee of authorisations to use the 2GHz spectrum for pan-European mobile satellite services or “<span style="font-style:italic">MSS</span>”. The 2GHz spectrum is scarce bandwidth and the Commission initiated an allocation procedure whereby applicants for selection were required to submit applications which contained details of the MSS they were contemplating.  In the event there were four applicants of which Inmarsat was one.  After initial screening the number of eligible applicants reduced to two and this included Inmarsat.  As it turned out the combined amount of spectrum the two remaining applicants sought did not exceed the total amount available and they were therefore both selected.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">To be eligible for selection, applicants had to commit to meeting certain conditions and milestones. These included launch of a satellite within a prescribed timeframe which had an ability to meet a minimum (50%) geographical coverage with the MSS. The Tribunal found that Inmarsat satisfied the Commission at the time that it would meet the requisite conditions and milestones in relation to its proposed MSS. There was no charge payable for the authorisation which under the relevant legislation was to last for 18 years.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Following selection, the actual authorisation and licensing process was delegated, under the legislation, to the competent authorities in the Member States. This was because many conditions to be attached to authorisations derived from national law. The conditions to be imposed included those required under EU law and, for instance, incorporated the coverage and timeframe requirements referred to above. In accordance with the Commission selection process in August 2010, Ofcom granted to Inmarsat an authorisation and licence to use the 2GHz spectrum in connection with a satellite to provide the MSS. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Inmarsat did not however launch the MSS in question. The commercial and other reasons behind this are not germane to this appeal. Subsequently, in the Decision under challenge Ofcom granted an authorisation and licence to Inmarsat for the use of so-called “<span style="font-style:italic">Complementary Ground Components</span>” or “<span style="font-style:italic">CGCs</span>” (ie ground stations) in conjunction with a different MSS using the 2GHz spectrum.  This new service concerned the use of mobile phones during flight on aircraft and would be provided over a “<span style="font-style:italic">European Aviation Network</span>” or “<span style="font-style:italic">EAN</span>”. Paragraph [57] of the Judgment described the proposed EAN: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.00in">“The object of the system … is to provide Europe-wide internet services to passengers (and crew) on aircraft both in terms of emails and in terms of other internet access. The standard of service is intended to emulate the standard provided by home broadband. The satellite provided by Inmarsat would not have the capacity to do that by itself on any simultaneous and widespread scale, so the relevant signal is sent to and from aircraft by two routes – to and from the satellite, and to and from ground stations. So there are two principal elements to the EAN – the satellite and the ground station element. The signals are fed into a central server on the plane and distributed to passengers who communicate with the server via their mobile telephones or table (via wifi which is internal to the aircraft).” </p>

Satellites have substantially greater “<span style="font-style:italic">area coverage</span>” than an individual ground station but due to distance and power constraints the capacity of a satellite to transmit and receive data was significantly less than that of a ground station which could transmit a materially greater volume of data.  Nonetheless, in relation to the EAN, there would be large areas of the English Channel, North Sea, Bay of Biscay, Mediterranean and Baltic which would not be covered by a terrestrial transmitter or receiver.  The EAN thus provided full coverage for European passengers by a combination of the CGC and the satellite (Judgment paragraphs [60] and [61]). </p>

Third, that the CGC element of the EAN service was dominant relative to the satellite element.

The riposte of Inmarsat is that Viasat had the chance to compete for selection in 2008 but it chose not to. It was now seeking to rewind time and undermine a key rival in the market. Its motives were purely commercial and its arguments technical and unmeritorious. </p>

It maintains that the intention of the scheme was for a satellite focused system which would provide useful benefits for people on the ground in the form of a signal which would not otherwise be available for them because commercial providers had not provided it. The spectrum which was the subject of the application was valuable, but the selection mechanism did not require any payment to be made for it, presumably on the basis that there was an element of public benefit in the use of the spectrum. Inmarsat have now departed from that scheme by providing a commercial service, using valuable but free (to Inmarsat) spectrum, to a limited number of paying airlines (or their customers), and it has done so by devising a service with heavy use of ground based components which was not originally anticipated. If that sort of use had been apparently on offer at the time then others, including Viasat, would have wished to be able to apply for the free use of the spectrum as well. What has happened is said by Viasat to be unfair and anticompetitive.” </p>

In a judgment dated 23rd January 2019 the Court (Market Court Section, 19th chamber A, Market Chamber) made a reference to the Court of Justice on various questions.  A stated reason for this was that a ruling of the Court of Justice would benefit all competent authorities and courts in the EU where similar issues arose.  The gist of the questions referred queried whether non-compliance by Inmarsat with the initial conditions (in particular relating to coverage requirements) necessarily meant that national competent authorities were empowered to refuse to grant authorisations to Inmarsat to deploy CGCs (and should do so).

Typically CGC can improve the quality of service available to users by ensuring that MSS services can be extended into areas where traditionally service availability has been poor – for example, in buildings, in vehicles, in urban ‘canyons’, and in regions where the topography creates large satellite ‘shadows’ – for example mountainous regions, or regions at the very edge of the satellite footprint. Furthermore, they may play an important role in enhancing the efficiency of use of the radio spectrum. Some types of CGCs can transit traffic from one end user to another without passing through the satellite component of the system, reusing spectrum used by the satellite in another geographical area. Such direct routing would temporarily bypass the satellite component to provide communications services which are identical to and fully integrated with the service offered by the whole MSS system footprint.

It was more fully implemented by the Commission Decision of 10th October 2011 on the co-ordination of the rules on enforcement in relation to mobile satellite services (the “<span style="font-style:italic">Enforcement Mechanism Decision</span>”). This compelled a co-ordinated approach to enforcement.  If a Member State considers that an operator of a mobile satellite system is in breach of relevant common conditions, it must inform the Commission which must then refer the matter to a Communications Committee. This Committee comprises the EU and Member States. National authorities may not reach a final decision on sanctions pending its deliberations. Following such deliberation, a national authority can apply a sanction short of withdrawal or suspension of licence. If the breach persists or is repeated, the authority can withdraw or suspend a licence but the matter must first be re-referred to the Commission and to the Communications Committee.  No decision can be taken pending that determination.   Under the Authorisation Directive (see paragraph [31] above) the conditions may be varied by the national authorities. The Court of Justice in <span style="font-style:italic">Viasat v BIPT</span> has made clear that because of the overriding policy need to ensure consistency of administrative decisions and to avoid fragmentation, substantive decisions on breach are to be taken at the EU level even if then implemented at the national level.  </p>

By 2014 Inmarsat had found what it considered to be a commercially exploitable manner of using its part of the spectrum, namely providing a pan-European service for airline passengers in aircraft, and this ultimately became the EAN for which its 2017 authorisation was obtained. It had changed its satellite plans in the course of this (and missed one of the milestones, because it did not launch on time); it decided to share a satellite with a Greek broadcaster and this satellite was launched in 2017.

Viasat argues that Ofcom had no power to authorise Inmarsat to use the CGC in conjunction with the 2GHz spectrum for the EAN in circumstances where the service for which the CGC was authorised was significantly different to that initially authorised. The power to authorise is governed by the principles of transparency and equality and the Tribunal erred in finding that those principles had no application to the Decision. In written submissions Viasat argued that these principles served to prohibit Ofcom from authorising any material post-award variation.  This stark point was expressed in the following way: </p>

It argues that it submitted unchallenged evidence to the Tribunal (which was ignored) that it would have tendered.  It is common ground that these principles do indeed apply to procurement processes and that they applied to the selection process adopted by the Commission in 2008.  In fact they are explicitly identified as relevant in the recitals to the Selection Mechanism Decision.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Fourth, the conclusion arrived at by the Court and derived from the strict language of Article 8 of the Selection Mechanism Decision was consistent with a purposive or contextual analysis of the provision.  The court referred to the “<span style="font-style:italic">context</span>” or purpose of the regime. Reference was made to recitals [18] and [25] (in paragraph [58] – see above) and also to recital 8 of the Enforcement Decision which cites in imperative terms (cf “<span style="font-style:italic">requires</span>”) the need for coordinated action to avoid a “…<span style="font-style:italic">patchwork of enforcement decisions in contradiction of the pan-European nature of MSS</span>”.  I would add that the policy considerations which permeate the legislation in this field strongly support this conclusion.  An operator is authorised for 18 years, during which, inevitably, technology changes and evolves.  What might be state of the art in year 1 may be redundant or uneconomic by year 7.  It would make no sense to fix an operator with a permanent commitment to implement one MSS (that referenced in the initial application for selection) and not cater for and permit change and adaptation.  This would undermine the principle of technological neutrality by preferring old technology over new technology.  It would hinder investment – why would an operator invest if the rules precluded an ability to adapt to new circumstances?  It would deny consumers the benefit of the most innovative services. A coordinated approach to enforcement enables the Commission and national authorities collectively to weigh up all such considerations and if needs be take steps to adapt the authorisation in an objective and proportionate way. A coordinated approach enables a pan-European view to be taken to modification of conditions if, for example, it was concluded that operators needed to be released from old conditions in order to permit adaptation to evolving circumstances. All these factors reinforce the judgment of the Court of Justice. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Next, there is the argument under this general heading that had Viasat known that the system would permit an operator, such as Inmarsat, to acquire scarce spectrum and then avoid its commitments and conditions, it also would have participated in the selection process.  In fact, the Tribunal made no finding that Viasat would have so acted. But in any event the premise that this is relevant and bespokes unfairness is not sustainable. At one level the answer is obvious.  The Court of Justice has now clarified that the system <span style="text-decoration:underline">does</span> operate in the flexible manner complained of by Viasat. If Viasat decided not to participate in 2008 in the call and selection procedure, then this was a consequence of its <span style="text-decoration:underline">own</span> mistaken view of the law.  That fault cannot be laid at the door of Inmarsat, the EU or Ofcom.   If that therefore is the essence of the complaint it must fail. The law being what it was then Viasat was in the same position as Inmarsat in terms of equality of treatment and transparency.  Moreover, were there any merit in the argument it would have prevailed before the Court of Justice in <span style="font-style:italic">Viasat v BIPT</span> where it would have led to the conclusion that national authorities were obliged to refrain from authorising CGCs to operators in breach of conditions attaching to earlier authorisations conferred following a selection or procurement procedure.  Yet the Court concluded that national competent authorities were stripped of the power to refuse authorisations where the two conditions in Article 8(1) were met.  I therefore reject the argument that there has been any breach of the principle of equality or transparency. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The final argument advanced by Mr Moser QC, on behalf of Viasat, under this heading is that Ofcom acted unlawfully in not imposing upon Inmarsat, as a condition of authorisation of the CGC, a condition that it install and operate the satellite (issue (iii) at paragraph [18] above). The sub-text to the argument was that Viasat did not trust Inmarsat to comply with the conditions attached to its CGC authorisation, given its history of recidivism. This is untenable.  In the Decision (at paragraphs [4.4] – [4.6] - see above at paragraph [75]) Ofcom expressed itself satisfied, based upon information provided to it by Inmarsat, that the company would use the spectrum in connection with a satellite.  Ofcom recognised (see paragraphs [4.9] – [4.12]) that the EAN service could technically be provided without the satellite terminal being installed and that there might be a commercial incentive for airlines not to install the satellite terminal, despite having purchased an integrated system from Inmarsat.  Ofcom stated that it would collect information from Inmarsat to verify use of the satellite and if it found that Inmarsat was providing services to aircraft exclusively by means of the terrestrial segment, it would consider enforcement action. When the Decision is properly construed, Ofcom identified the risk in question and exercised its judgment in order to ensure that the risk was appropriately managed.  Ofcom accepted that there was a proper public interest in the scarce 2GHz spectrum being efficiently used. It identified the risk of non-use of the satellite in conjunction with the spectrum. It addressed appropriate remedial action.  </p>

The core of Mr Moser QC’s argument can be summarised as follows. First, there is a strong EU policy in scarce radio spectrum (ie the 2GHz) being fully utilised and not left fallow; second, this was secured by ensuring that the CGC component was not dominant in a hybrid radio communication service which mixed terrestrial ground stations with satellite capacity; third, this meant that operators would concentrate their effort and investment on the satellite element ensuring that it was fully used; fourth, this analysis was borne out by the reference in the legislation to phrases such as “<span style="font-style:italic">complementary</span>” as a descriptor and qualifying characteristic of a ground station (i.e. the “C” in “CGC”), and in recitals which referred to the satellite as the “<span style="font-style:italic">primary</span>” component, and which referred to the CGC as “<span style="font-style:italic">improving</span>” or “<span style="font-style:italic">enhancing</span>” MSS.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I do not accept these submissions. It is important to stand back.  There is of course a legitimate policy interest in the limited 2GHz spectrum being efficiently used and not left “<span style="font-style:italic">fallow</span>”, as Mr Moser QC observed.  But this has nothing to do with the number of CGCs used in an overall system or the relative balance of capacity or utility as between CGCs and satellites.  This can easily be demonstrated.  A satellite might be optimally (and therefore efficiently) used yet <span style="font-style:italic">still</span> account for considerably less than 50% of the data carrying capacity of a hybrid system. Efficiency of use of scarce bandwidth is not necessarily connected to the (relative) capacity of other apparatus (such as CGCs) used in conjunction with it. Indeed, as the Tribunal acknowledged CGCs are capable of carrying far more data than satellites. The argument can be turned around.  What (rhetorically) would be the consequence for innovation, investment and competitiveness if every mobile satellite system using the 2GHz spectrum could only deploy such CGC capacity as amounted to less than 50% of the satellite capacity?  If that were the rule, which is what Viasat contends, this would risk deterring investment in the satellite in the first place because it would dramatically curtail the ability of an operator to use it in conjunction with the sort of overall service that would be most economically viable.  The present facts can be said to reflect this reality.   </p>

There would be thresholds such as 40/60 or 45/55 or 49/51.  There would also be some metric of measurement, such as economic value or data carrying capacity, and there might have to be some system of weighted averaging to reflect the fact that the satellite and the CGC components might perform different (complementary) functions in an overall service so that (absent adjustment) they could not be compared like for like. There would be rules determining how relative importance was to be measured when the facts changed: does the analysis change if the flight using the EAN is largely over sea or mountains when the satellite is more important or is over land when the CGC might be most important?  There are however no such rules anywhere to be found which, itself, is a fact militating against Viasat’s argument.  </p>

The aircraft has two spatially discrete communications modules: (i) a module which communicates with the satellite and (ii) a module which communicates with the CGC. Viasat adopts an unbundled view and contends that there are therefore two quite discrete entities or systems. At the functional level Viasat explains that the module communicating with the CGC has a different positioning, design, function and language to the module communicating with the satellite.

They both feed into the same central system in the aircraft including (we were told) a central controller which chooses from where to take and send a signal under control from the ground (via the satellite).  The routed signal then feeds a central server, which accepts and distributes it to and from the passenger devices on the aircraft.  The whole thing is, in our view, a mobile earth station as much as a single handset would be.  There is therefore a mobile earth station in every path.  The satellite-facing part of the system is undoubtedly capable, by itself, of constituting a mobile earth station, and we consider that the addition of a part which is designed just to address the ground, as part of the overall system on the plane, is an addition to a mobile earth station, bearing in mind that such things are entitled to address CGCs.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">First, the relevant optic through which the capability to communicate with the satellite must be measured is the system taken as a whole.  The language used in Article 2(2)(a) reflects a systems-based analysis. It uses the phrases: “<span style="font-style:italic">mobile satellite systems</span>”, “<span style="font-style:italic">communications networks and associated facilities</span>”, “<span style="font-style:italic">a system</span>”, and a “<span style="font-style:italic">service</span>”.  It is the overall system, service or network which must have the capability that is referred to in the definition.  When the EAN is looked at through this end of the telescope it does have these capabilities, as the Tribunal correctly found. Whilst it is true that when viewed in a disaggregated way and in isolation the CGC does not permit radio communication with the satellite it is still capable of so doing when it is viewed as one integral component of a system which includes an module communicating with a satellite. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Second, there is no logical policy basis which could inform a purposive construction of the relevant terms supportive of Viasat’s argument. CGCs must be “<span style="font-style:italic">integral</span>” parts of the overall system. That is how CEPT contemplated their usage and that is consistent with the definitions under the EU regime: see Article 8(3)(b) of the Selection Mechanism Decision (paragraph [55] above). The characteristic of being “<span style="font-style:italic">integral</span>” indicates no more than that the CGC must play an important role complementary to that of the satellite – they work together to create a single overall service.  There is no sensible basis upon which the rules drill down into the technical nuts and bolts of the overall system or service and then draw fundamental legal and jurisdictional distinctions based upon such differences as whether the two modules speak the same language. A rule which had that effect would distort technical neutrality, force operators to devise artificial engineering solutions to overcome problems created by legal definitions as opposed to being truly needed, and would curb the ability of competent authorities to authorise systems which matched contemporaneous technology and economics and which maximised consumer choice. These are the purposes and objectives of the legislative regime and any construction of individual terms and phrases should be consistent with such purposes.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Third, in relation to the argument based upon reference to the ITU Regulations, the Tribunal was not convinced: See Judgment paragraphs [95] – [105]. I accept that in this regime the ITU regulations are at least relevant to the construction of the relevant EU measures, but they are not to be treated without more as dispositive.  I agree with the Tribunal’s analysis on this. Article 1 paragraph 1.1 of the ITU Regulations provides: “<span style="font-style:italic">For the purposes of these Regulations, the following terms have the meanings defined below.</span><span>  </span><span style="font-style:italic">These terms do not, however, necessarily apply for other purposes</span>.” The definition in the ITU Regulation is used as part of the definition of “<span style="font-style:italic">mobile satellite service</span>”, and “…<span style="font-style:italic">would indeed seem to point upwards (as it were) rather than downwards” </span>(Judgment paragraph [96]). But the definition of “<span style="font-style:italic">mobile satellite service</span>” excludes an equivalent of the CGC component provided for by the Selection Mechanism Decision and it is not therefore an accurate guide to the meaning of “<span style="font-style:italic">mobile earth station</span>” for the purpose of that Decision.  Further, the relevant definition in the Selection Mechanism Decision (unlike that in the ITU Regulations) contemplates that a mobile earth station can point towards the earth as described in the third pathway in the definition of a “<span style="font-style:italic">mobile satellite system</span>” in Article 2(2)(a).  These reasons are in my view compelling in distinguishing between the ITU Regulations and the definition in the Selection Mechanism Decision. Like the Tribunal I do not consider that the Regulations provide support for Viasat’s arguments. I reject this ground of appeal. </p>
