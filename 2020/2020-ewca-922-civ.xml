The judge expressly made no “determination about the duration of A’s visit to the UK” but gave directions so that a decision could be made about arrangements for her care in England at a hearing which was listed to take place prior to A’s arrival in England.  These included directing a local authority to prepare a report pursuant to s.37 of the Children Act 1989 (“the 1989 Act”) and requiring each of the parents to set out their respective proposals for A’s care.  The passport order provided for the father’s passports to continue to be held by the court until A’s “return to this jurisdiction in accordance with this order”.  The judge refused to make a Forced Marriage Protection Order (“FMPO”) and there is no appeal from this part of his decision. </p>

The father’s overarching contentions are that the judge was wrong to exercise the jurisdiction in the circumstances of this case and was wrong to make the order which he did.  A number of grounds are advanced in support of these arguments including that the judge failed to apply the law correctly because the circumstances of this case do not justify the exercise of the inherent jurisdiction; that the judge’s order was an improper use of the inherent jurisdiction both because it effectively conflicted with the provisions of the Family Law Act 1986 and more generally; that the judge’s findings were not supported by the evidence; that the order was not justified; that the judge was wrong to order that A be removed from her home and brought to England when he had, what he considered to be, “little evidence” of her wishes and feelings and with the prospect of her being placed in the care of the Local Authority. </p>

A was then less than 12 months old.  As set out in the judgment below, at [24], the mother accepted in her oral evidence, having said in her statement that it had been for a holiday, that she “and the father made a joint decision to take A and Z to Algeria in 2008.  This was to avoid any applications by the local authority in respect of these children.”  The mother returned after about seven weeks, leaving the children in the care of the paternal grandparents.  The father then also went to Algeria in May 2008, in breach of an order prohibiting him from leaving the jurisdiction, and remained there, it appears, until August 2018.

There had been “periodic domestic abuse and extreme household rules and controls”; the mother’s “were seemingly informal and flexible and [the] father’s impressed as harsh and rigid”.  The children had been “exposed to matrimonial tension and difficulties”.  Among the agreed threshold findings (made at a hearing which the father did not attend and at which he was not represented) were that Y had suffered “physical and verbal abuse by the father” and had been assaulted by him on two specific occasions.

HHJ Cox decided that the harm which the child had suffered had had “a lasting impact” on her development and that the mother was not able to meet the child’s needs.  Additionally, in the course of her judgment, HHJ Cox set out that it had “proved impossible for the moment to secure the return [of the two youngest children] to this jurisdiction, although [the mother] is still engaged in strenuous attempts to do so and has instructed a specialist firm of international lawyers to assist her in this very difficult task”. </p>

However, he was faced with difficulties with his wife’s immigration issues.  After obtaining their British passports, the father had a change of heart about A travelling to see her mother but allowed Z to come to the UK.  Z came to the UK in August 2018.  Regrettably, Z’s reunification with his mother has been less than successful.  His behaviour has been challenging and this has at points culminated in physical assaults upon his mother with the last being on the 22 November 2019.  The father came to the UK within days of Z’s arrival.  Save for living with his mother initially and later a very short period living with his father in February or March 2019, Z has been voluntarily accommodated by the local authority.” </p>

He did not give oral evidence.  He dealt in some detail with “protective measures” available in Algeria in respect of a child who is alleged to be the victim “of violence or inappropriate physical chastisement”; with forced marriage; and with orders which the mother could seek to obtain in Algeria in respect of the care of A.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In respect of protective measures, the expert set out the steps which could be taken in Algeria to protect a child.  The police could be asked to investigate “any violence or bad treatment”.  Proceedings could be commenced in the local tribunal including for urgent interim measures of protection.  In addition, there are “many” agencies available to undertake an investigation into a child’s situation.  Some are funded by the state and some are “more independent and managed by volunteers such as medical staff, lawyers and social workers”.   He identified the “most prominent” which include an NGO called NADA as being available “to assist parents, children or women in difficulties”.  NADA stands for the Algerian Network for the Defence of Children and was referred to by the FCO in an email to the mother in 2018 as “the competent child safeguarding body in Algeria” and an organisation which the FCO had “worked closely with on other cases”. </p>

He later added, when asked about legal aid and the cost of proceedings, that “there are many NGOs such as NADA [which] would represent women victims of domestic violence or children at risk and the NGOs would predominantly use pro-bono” lawyers.  For criminal matters, there are “many lawyers [who] operate a pro bono scheme”.  In his conclusions he reiterated that “in view of the alleged violence and abuse” the mother could obtain assistance from “local Child and Family support groups … to obtain urgent interim measures of protection of” A. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In addition to dealing with protective measures, the expert also dealt with the equivalent of welfare proceedings.  The mother could apply for, what was described as, the equivalent of residence and for permission to remove A from Algeria.  The outcome would be based on the court’s assessment of A’s best interests but the expert pointed out a number of difficulties that the mother would face in particular in respect of any application to remove A from Algeria, meaning that the prospects of this succeeding were remote.   </p>

Inevitably, he said that this would depend on the nature of the proceedings (which could include validating the parties’ English divorce in Algeria) and their length.  The full cost was “likely to run into £4/5,000” plus a similar amount for an interpreter.  However, he also said that the “starting fee” would be around £3/400 and, as referred to above, that there are support groups who could assist and that once the court was made aware of “any bad treatment”, the judge would start an investigation. </p>

In addition, during “our brief call I repeatedly heard voices in the background possibly of her younger paternal siblings, which left me questioning what level of privacy A had for the call”.  The Cafcass officer sought to explain her role but A “said she was no longer able to hear the interpreter again”.  The Cafcass Officer then tried to explain that she would place another call and ended the call.

The mother relied on photographs and on a recording from July 2019 of a video conversation between the father and his wife in Algeria.

The father denied referring to a cable and stated that he would use a ‘flip flop’ to chastise the children.  He also denied that he had ever carried out the threat of burning the children with a hot spoon.  He stated that sometimes he would threaten the children by not buying ‘them sweets’.  He was pressed as to why he said during the conversation that the children would “pee their pants” if he looked at them.  The father explained that, as the head of the family, he sets the rules that must be followed.  He denied that such a reaction suggests that his children fear him.  He explained this to be not a ‘high degree’ of fear but respect for their father.   When questioned further about the mother’s concerns that saw her go to the Algerian Embassy on two occasions, he dismissed those as “nonsense” and it seemed to him to be a “set up”.” </p>

He was given many opportunities to soften his views or to distance himself from the contents of that conversation.  He resolutely refused to do so.  The father displayed a most concerning lack of awareness of the impact of his threats on his children.  He did not recognise anything wrong in encouraging A to physically chastise her younger siblings.  Most concerning was his profound lack of any insight into the impact of the level of his children’s fears of their father that would cause them to urinate when he looks at them.  His explanation that this was out of respect and not fear did nothing to lessen my concerns about the environment of violence and fear that the children have become accustomed to living in.  In this context, the father’s evidence corroborated Z’s allegations of ill-treatment.

A’s welfare is my paramount consideration and having considered all of the welfare considerations, I have concluded that A does require the court’s protection.  In my judgment there are no applicable jurisdictional schemes that would conflict with my decision.  Furthermore, there is no evidence before me that would suggest that there is any risk of a conflicting decision being taken in Algeria.  The evidence of [the expert] does not raise this as an issue.   Finally, there is no suggestion that orders of this court may be unenforceable in Algeria.  Accordingly, I will make A a ward of the court and exercise the <span style="font-style:italic">parens patriae</span> jurisdiction of the court by ordering her return to England forthwith.  I am not making any determinations about the duration of A’s visit to the UK.  Such a determination will be made at subsequent hearings when further appropriate evidence will be available to the court.” </p>

He was not determining “the duration of A’s visit to the UK” which would be determined after she came.

The mother gave birth to a fourth child while in Pakistan.  On her return to England, without the children who continued to be retained in Pakistan, the mother applied for orders in respect of all four children.  At first instance, the court determined that all of the children were habitually resident in England giving the court here substantive jurisdiction.  The father’s appeal in respect of the three elder children was dismissed by the Court of Appeal but allowed in respect of the youngest child.  The mother appealed to the Supreme Court which decided that the court had jurisdiction in respect of the youngest child based on his being a British national. </p>

That would leave the court in wardship free to order the minor's return to the jurisdiction; once returned to the jurisdiction, the plaintiff could then apply for a custody order.  Arguably, in that event, jurisdiction could arise on the ground provided by s. 2(2)(b), namely that the ward is present in England or Wales on the relevant date – the date of the new application – and the court considers that the immediate exercise of its powers is necessary for his protection.  By this procedural device, the court might then make the custody order.  But should that be permitted?

Various words have been used down the years to describe the kind of circumstances in which it may be appropriate to make an order: “only under extraordinary circumstances”, “the rarest possible thing”, “very unusual”, “really exceptional”, “dire and exceptional”, “at the very extreme end of the spectrum”.  The jurisdiction, it has been said, must be exercised “sparingly”, with “great caution” (the phrase used by Lord Hughes JSC in <span style="font-style:italic">A v A (Children: Habitual Residence)</span> [2014] AC 1, para 70(v)) and with “extreme circumspection.”  We quote these words not because they or any of them are definitive—they are not—but because, taken together, they indicate very clearly just how limited the occasions will be when there can properly be recourse to the jurisdiction. </p>

It is not in doubt that the restrictions on the use of the inherent or parens patriae jurisdiction of the High Court in the Family Law Act 1986 do not exclude its use so as to order the return of a British child to this country: this court so held in <span style="font-style:italic">A v A (Children: Habitual Residence) (Reunite International Child Abduction Centre intervening) </span>[2014] AC 1.

It is, however, one thing to approach the use of the jurisdiction with great caution or circumspection.  It is another thing to conclude that the circumstances justifying its use must always be “dire and exceptional” or “at the very extreme end of the spectrum”.  There are three main reasons for caution when deciding whether to exercise the jurisdiction: first, that to do so may conflict with the jurisdictional scheme applicable between the countries in question; second, that it may result in conflicting decisions in those two countries; and third, that it may result in unenforceable orders.  It is, to say the least, arguable that none of those objections has much force in this case: there is no applicable Treaty between the UK and Pakistan; it is highly unlikely that the courts in Pakistan would entertain an application from the appellant; and it is possible that there are steps which an English court could take to persuade the respondent to obey the order. </p>

The real question is whether the circumstances are such that this British child requires that protection.  For our part we do not consider that the inherent jurisdiction is to be confined by a classification which limits its exercise to “cases which are at the extreme end of the spectrum”, per McFarlane LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">In re N (Abduction: Appeal)</span> [2013] 1 FLR 457, para 29.  The judgment was ex tempore and it was not necessary to lay down a rule of general application, if indeed that was intended.  It may be that McFarlane LJ did not so intend, because he did not attempt to define what he meant or to explain why an inherent jurisdiction to protect a child's welfare should be confined to extreme cases.  The judge observed that “niceties as to quite where the existing extremity of the jurisdiction under the inherent jurisdiction may be do not come into the equation in this case”: para 31. </p>

Considerations of comity cannot be divorced from that objective.  If the court were to consider that the exercise of its inherent jurisdiction were necessary to avoid B's welfare being beyond all judicial oversight (to adopt Lord Wilson JSC's expression in para 26), we do not see that its exercise would conflict with the principle of comity or should be trammelled by some a priori classification of cases according to their extremity.” </p>

Thirdly, this last point is reinforced by the consideration that the appellant's application in the English courts is for contact and shared residence.  This is not relief which the statute permits to be ordered under the inherent jurisdiction, in a case where there is no jurisdiction under the Council Regulation or the 1996 Hague Convention.  I do not accept that the inherent jurisdiction can be used to circumvent principled limitations which Parliament has placed upon the jurisdiction of the court.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">There are two aspects of Lady Hale and Lord Toulson’s judgment which I must specifically address.  First, they set out, at [59], “three main reasons for caution when deciding whether to exercise the jurisdiction”, also described as “objections”.  To repeat, they are: “first, that to do so may conflict with the jurisdictional scheme applicable between the countries in question; second, that it may result in conflicting decisions in those two countries; and third, that it may result in unenforceable orders”.  Do these potential objections to the exercise of the jurisdiction provide an alternative guide to when the jurisdiction should be exercised? </p>

They are general reasons explaining why the court should take a cautious approach although, no doubt, they will provide a specific reason or reasons why the jurisdiction should not be exercised in an individual case.  The difficulty in using them as a guide to the exercise of the jurisdiction is that they would, in practice, provide a very low threshold which would not support the need for “great caution or circumspection”, <span style="font-style:italic">In re B</span> at [59]. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In respect of the first reason, there are numerous countries with which the UK has no applicable reciprocal jurisdictional scheme.  For example, whilst it has achieved significant support around the world, the main international convention, the 1996 Hague Child Protection Convention, applies in only 52 countries (including the UK).  As for the second reason, there are likely to be many situations when conflicting decisions are, in fact, unlikely because, for example, the parent in the other state will not seek to invoke that court’s jurisdiction.  In addition, I can see evidential difficulties if the court is to be expected to make a specific determination as to whether the exercise of the jurisdiction “may result in conflicting decisions”.   </p>

However, the judge concluded, at [54], that there was “no suggestion that orders of this court may be unenforceable in Algeria”.  It is not clear to me how orders would be enforceable in Algeria, given the absence of any reciprocal jurisdictional scheme, but this demonstrates the approach a court might understandably take to this question in the absence of expert evidence, which is likely in many private law cases.  In addition, it is not clear what weight the court should give to this question when, as suggested in <span style="font-style:italic">Re B</span> at [59], there may be steps which the “court could take to persuade the respondent to obey the order”.

This would, however, seem immediately to conflict with the need for great circumspection and, if applied generally, would also seem likely to lead the court in practice to address welfare issues connected with care and contact when the court is prohibited from making orders directly dealing with either of these matters. </p>

It would, again, be difficult to see how this would be consistent with the need to “approach the use of the jurisdiction with great caution or circumspection”, at [59].  It is not just a matter of procedural caution; the need to use great caution must have some substantive content.  In this context, I have already explained why I consider that the three reasons set out in <span style="font-style:italic">In re B</span> would not provide a substantive test and, in practice, would not result in great circumspection being exercised. </p>

This can, of course, apply whenever the jurisdiction is exercised but, in my view, it provides an additional reason for limiting the exercise of the jurisdiction to compelling circumstances.

There was no suggestion in the expert evidence that they were other than effective remedies.  Indeed, as referred to above, he made clear that there are “many” agencies available to undertake an investigation and to act to protect A.  It is also right to note that NADA was identified by the FCO as a relevant safeguarding body which they had worked closely with on other cases. </p>

As set out above, the “FCO’s Social Work Adviser specialised in child safeguarding” did not consider that there was anything arising from A’s “visit” which raised concerns about her health or welfare.  Ms Kirby put forward a number of reasons why, in her submission, the judge had been entitled to attach little weight to this report.  The difficulty I have with this submission is that, in my view, it is clear from the judgment that the judge did not take this evidence into account either when making his substantive finding nor in any assessment of whether this court should exercise its jurisdiction. </p>

Whilst no order had yet been made providing for A’s care when she was in England, it is inevitable that the judge would have had to make such an order prior to her arrival.  This was why the judge required the Local Authority urgently to address the question of A’s accommodation, “including whether either of A’s parents are able to care for A” and, if not, what “other accommodation is available”; and why the parents were also required to set out their proposals for A’s care so that a decision could be made at the next hearing.  An order providing for her care needed to be made <span style="font-style:italic">before</span> A arrived here because the necessary arrangements needed to be in place.  Such an order would either have conflicted with the provisions of the 1986 Act or, if it gave care to a Local Authority, would have conflicted with s.100 of the 1989 Act. </p>

In my view, this would be using the inherent jurisdiction directly for the purpose of avoiding the effect of the 1986 Act and would, in the circumstances of this case, improperly have subverted Parliament’s intention (to adopt Lord Wilson’s words whilst recognising that this was <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> his conclusion).  I deliberately say, in the circumstances of this case, because I can see that there may well not be a bright line between an order which conflicts with the limitations imposed by the 1986 Act and one which does not.  In my view, it would be doing so in this case because the judge’s order was expressly for the purpose of enabling this court to decide who should care for A and whether here or in Algeria. </p>

As I have described, the purpose of the proceedings and of the order he made was to deal with the issue of who should care for A.  I would add that the instinct of every family judge would be to act to safeguard a child’s welfare and, in pursuit of that aim, to seek to ensure that any available jurisdiction is exercisable to achieve that outcome.  However, Parliament has expressly limited the types of orders which can be made under the inherent jurisdiction and the order made in this case cuts across those statutory limitations. </p>

I question, therefore, whether, as submitted by Mr Gupta, the judge was properly able to decide that it was in A’s best interests for her to be brought to England and, as was likely, be placed in the care of a Local Authority.  How were, for example, the “complex” implications and the “potential harm” caused by A being brought to England going to be “carefully weighed in the balance”, as described by the judge, at [47], prior to A’s arrival in England and, consequently, how could the court make a proper welfare assessment that justified A being brought to England?  This factor also supports the conclusion that agencies in Algeria are better placed to make any decision as to A’s welfare needs as well as undermining the judge’s conclusion that it was in A’s welfare interests to be brought to England. </p>

In summary, this is because the substantive threshold required to justify the exercise of the inherent nationality jurisdiction was not crossed in this case in that the circumstances did not <span style="font-style:italic">require</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">this</span> court to act to protect A.
