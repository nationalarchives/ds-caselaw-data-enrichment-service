	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The proceedings initially had a much wider compass but, in so far as relevant to this appeal, concern the interpretation and operation of a material breach clause in a consultancy agreement (“the Agreement”) between the claimant and Arunvill Capital Ltd (“Arunvill”).  The core issue raised by this appeal is whether the claimant, as he alleged, had remedied a material breach within the required, 21-day, period.  If he had not, Arunvill was entitled summarily to terminate the Agreement; if he had, the claimant was entitled to a termination payment equal to 6 months’ remuneration. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">HHJ Dight found that the claimant was in material breach of the Agreement in that, in summary, at [130], his “refusal to provide the services in clause 2.1” was a “refusal to work”.  He also determined that a letter written on 20 April 2016 by solicitors on behalf of the claimant, in which it was said that the claimant “confirms that he does intend to perform his contractual obligations”, did not remedy the breach.  The “proper remedy” was, at [130], “not merely the communication of an intention to work in an unspecified way, but it is to continue to provide the services which the claimant was contracted to provide under” the Agreement. </p>

He challenged the judge’s conclusion that the breach had not been remedied.  Fancourt J dismissed the appeal, rejecting the argument that the letter of 20 April 2016 had remedied the breach.  He decided, at [21], that “a remedy of the breach required the appellant not just to write a letter saying that he would perform in the future, and then wait to be asked to do something, but to resume work within the 21-day period”. </p>

The background to the breach notice as found by the Judge was the following.  First, the obligation of the appellant to provide the Services was not dependent on any cooperation or input of Arunvill.  Second, Arunvill had declined to make use of the NCS that the appellant had devised, on the ground that they amounted to a fraud.  Third, the appellant had been doing other work for Arunvill, since the rejection of the NCS, though Arunvill had refused to accept that the expenses of his trip to Hong Kong in early 2016 were their responsibility on the ground that he went there for his own purposes.  Fourth, Arunvill had decided by early 2016 that it was unwilling to continue to employ the appellant.  Fifth, the reason why the appellant said that he would not perform his contractual obligations was that Arunvill would not pay his bonus, a profit share and/or his expenses.  Sixth, the appellant made an unequivocal statement in a meeting of 24 February 2016 that he would not provide any more Services to either of the respondents until he was paid the sums that he claimed were due.  The Judge found that he "plainly showed an intention no longer to perform his obligations for either Hollbeach or Arunvill unless he were paid …" There is no challenge by the appellant to any of these conclusions. </p>

He should have been, but was not, providing the Services to Arunvill.  The notice stated that, by his actions, the appellant was in material breach, in particular by advising of his intention not to perform his contractual obligations.  The material breach specified is therefore not, properly construed, simply that the appellant had indicated that he would not work in future.  It is that the appellant was refusing to resume work for Arunvill.  In those circumstances, a remedy of the breach required the appellant not just to write a letter saying that he would perform in future, and then wait to be asked to do something, but to resume work within the 21-day period.  The letter was a statement intended to countervail previous contrary statements and was asserted to be a remedy of the breach, but it was at best (if taken at face value) an indication that the appellant would work if and when asked to do something.   </p>

Fancourt J rejected this argument because the “Services” which the claimant was required to provide under the Agreement were not confined to the NCS but included other services.

It is not clear to me that this was, in fact, the effect of [131] because HHJ Dight specifically referred to “other things” the claimant had been doing and which “he did not … do … in the period after the notice of termination had been served”.

The specified breach, as described by HHJ Dight, was the “refusal to work” which was “a refusal to provide the services in clause 2.1”.  This was, as Mr McCluskey submitted, an actual state of affairs.  The remedy was, as set out by both judges below, for the claimant to provide the required Services, which he did not.   </p>

HHJ Dight’s conclusions were plainly open to him on the evidence.  I also do not consider that either judgment contains any error of law in respect of the conclusion that the letter of 20 April 2016 did not remedy the claimant’s breach.  I agree with HHJ Dight that the breach identified in the letter of 5 April 2016 was “sufficiently clear” in that “a refusal to provide services in the future” was a “refusal to work”.  As Patten LJ observed during the hearing, the fact that the claimant was not doing any work was part of the material breach on which the defendants relied.  It had not merely been a theoretical threat of how the claimant might, or proposed to, act at some point in the future; it was a threat which he had carried out, and as found by the judge continued to carry out until the expiry of the 21-day period, by not providing the contracted Services. </p>

The issue in the litigation, as described by Teare J, at [15] of his judgment reported at [2013] 2 All ER (Comm) 246, was “whether payment of the deposit can be enforced by the seller notwithstanding the termination of the contract”.  The sellers argued that their right to be paid the deposit had accrued before the contract was terminated.  The argument advanced by the buyers was that the contract, properly construed (in particular clause 13), meant that the sellers had no such right and were only entitled to claim “compensation for their losses”.  This had been accepted by an arbitration tribunal which had decided, at [17], that clause 13 had “the effect of depriving the sellers of their right to claim the deposit which had fallen due before the MOA was terminated so that, on the true construction of the MOA as a whole, the deposit did not fall due unconditionally”.  This was because clause 13 “excluded the implied term in favour of forfeiture (or its equivalent) that might otherwise have been derived from clause 2”. </p>

The basic fallacy in this argument is that limb 1 of clause 13 does not prescribe what is to happen if the deposit is unpaid.  It does no more than to afford to sellers an express contractual right or rights exercisable in the event that the deposit is not paid.  These contractual rights are to be distinguished from those which arise under the general principles governing discharge by breach.  The right to cancel given by limb 1 of clause 13 is not dependent upon proof that failure to pay the deposit on time is repudiatory in nature.  Indeed, until the decision of this court in <span style="font-style:italic">Samarenko v Dawn Hill House Ltd</span> [2013] Ch 36, it would not have been clear that a failure to pay the deposit on time is, without more, repudiatory of the buyers' obligations.  Limb 1 of clause 13 therefore confers upon sellers a valuable contractual remedy over and above the remedy which they already enjoy at common law, the availability of which latter remedy is however attended by uncertainty.  That uncertainty was greater before the decision of this court in <span style="font-style:italic">Samarenko</span>, and thus at the time when limb 1 was introduced.  Whatever the position now, a contractual remedy of termination which has no need to characterise the defaulting buyers' conduct as repudiatory is a valuable addition to sellers' armoury.  The circumstances out of which buyers' repudiation must be spelled are not always clear cut.  A contractual right of termination exercisable upon the happening or non-happening of an event usually brooks of less argument.  The express entitlement to compensation together with interest for losses and expenses is also at the least a valuable clarification of a right to which the sellers were in any event entitled at law, which is henceforth made available as an express term of the contract.” </p>

Tomlinson LJ was addressing a different contract and his observations were concerned with an issue that does not arise in the present case, namely the relationship between common law rights and contractual rights (as provided by the MOA in that case).  It was in that, latter, context that he said that the express right to terminate the contract provided by clause 13 was in addition to any common law rights available to the sellers.  This was also the context for his general observation that a contractual remedy of termination is valuable because the availability of the common law remedy is “attended by uncertainty”.  Neither of these observations impact on the approaches taken by the judges below nor do they support the submission that the judgments in the present case undermine, or devalue, the “valuable addition” provided by a contractual remedy of termination.</p>
