Cynergy, an English retail bank, had borrowed £30 million from Lamesa, a company registered in Cyprus, as Tier 2 Capital for a term of 10 years, with interest payable at half yearly intervals on 21 June and 21 December. The Facility Agreement provided for English governing law and exclusive English jurisdiction.  </p>

	      </authorialNote> The judge said that it had long been recognised in English law in the context of whether a contract was to be held void for illegality that a contract could be prohibited by implication.

Moreover, Lamesa submitted that the judge was wrong to construe clause 9.1 as if it were a one-off negotiated provision when in fact it was common ground that it was a standard form of wording which appeared in many credit-linked notes and financing agreements. </p>

First that it would require clear wording in a contract of loan to enable the debtor to escape its payment obligations, and secondly, that the court had to take account of the commercial interests of both parties in interpreting the contract. There was, at best, ambiguous wording that might be construed as excusing payment. Such a clause cannot relieve Cynergy from complying with its fundamental payment obligations. Mr Crow made clear that the purpose of Lamesa’s application for declaratory relief was to clarify the legal position going forward. Lamesa accepted that, in respect of past interest payments,<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="9">

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.19in">This first problem feeds into a second. The judge’s focus seems to have been on the probabilities of what these parties may or may not have intended by the use of the words in clause 9.1. Whilst it is relevant to consider the context of the Facility Agreement that led to the inclusion of this standard term, that consideration has to be against the background of two more general considerations: (i) that it would take clear words to abrogate a repayment obligation in a loan agreement (see Teare J’s eloquent exposition of this point in an insurance context at [49] in <span style="font-style:italic">Mamancochet Mining Limited v. Aegis Managing Agency</span> [2018] EWHC 2643 (Comm)), and (ii) that, in construing a commercial contract, the court must always take into account the commercial interests of both parties. There are indications in his judgment that the judge was rather more focused on the commercial interests of Cynergy than of Lamesa. For example, he said at [29] that clause 9.1 was “drafted in wide terms in order that it could effectively protect [Cynergy] from the risk of breaching an express or implied prohibition against payment that exposed it to potentially severe penalties or sanctions as a result of making a payment” to Lamesa. </p>

The court must consider the contract as a whole and give more or less weight to elements of the wider context in reaching its view as to its objective meaning. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.19in">In my judgment, one of the most important pieces of context to clause 9 is that it does not extinguish the entitlement to be paid interest and to be repaid capital under the Facility Agreement. That much is common ground. The proviso to clause 9.1 merely says that, if it is engaged, Cynergy shall not be in default, so that it would not be open to Lamesa to seek to enforce payment by presenting a winding up petition. It is to be noted also that clause 9.2 anyway prevents a normal debt action against Cynergy in respect of principal or interest, as part of the regime of a Tier 2 Capital loan. Thus, the argument about whether or not the proviso to clause 9.1 is engaged will normally be about the timing of payments rather than about whether those payments will ever be made. This is an important factor when considering Lamesa’s submission that clear words are needed to abrogate a payment obligation. In short, the proviso to clause 9.1 does not abrogate a payment obligation, it abrogates a default and delays the obligation itself. Admittedly, that delay might be for a prolonged period. </p>

Likewise, the part of clause 9.1 that applies the proviso only if the borrower “satisfies” the lender that it is engaged emphasises the balance between the parties within the provision itself. </p>

It refers to compliance “whether directly or [indirectly] with any requirement or prohibition … resulting directly or indirectly from the laws specified …”. But the important point is that its language refers to the provisions of US secondary sanctions legislation (in substantially the same terms as section 5 of UFSA) as imposing a “requirement or prohibition” on EU entities. That is the reality of the position. An EU entity cannot ignore such legislation, because if it does so, its business will be disrupted (albeit that, in the case of the particular legislation referred to in the Annex to the Blocking Regulation, article 5 prohibits such compliance).  </p>

I reiterate this is not a parochial loan agreement. It is an international facility entered into in the context of international banks, and of the provisions of the Capital Regulation and of CRD IV.  </p>

The parties sensibly agreed a statement of agreed facts and a list of issues for the purposes of the hearing before the judge. This recorded at paragraph 30 that it was “common ground that … (a) OFAC could impose secondary sanctions on Cynergy under section 5 of USFA … if OFAC were to determine that the payment of interest by Cynergy to Lamesa was ‘significant’ … (b) The President has the power to waive the application of sanctions under section 5 of USFA …”.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.19in">It follows that the judge was correct to proceed on the basis that, if Cynergy made interest payments in accordance with the Facility Agreement while Lamesa was a blocked person, there was “a risk” that Cynergy would be sanctioned. Although the judge did not attempt to quantify the risk, it is apparent from his judgment that he proceeded on the basis that the risk was a significant one. There is no challenge by either party to this aspect of his judgment. As counsel for Lamesa pointed out, it follows that it cannot be assumed that, if Cynergy made the payments in question, it would be sanctioned. Indeed, there has been no finding (nor is there any evidential basis for a finding) that the imposition of a sanction is more probable than not. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.19in">Counsel for Cynergy argued that there would always be some uncertainty as to whether non-payment was strictly necessary to comply with a mandatory provision of law: even if the law in question clearly and expressly prohibited the payments, the competent authority might, for example, exercise a prosecutorial discretion not to bring proceedings against Cynergy. Counsel for Lamesa argued that what matters is whether, objectively considered, the relevant law, regulation or court order prohibits payment by Cynergy; and not whether, in practice, Cynergy could get away with noncompliance with such a prohibition. </p>
