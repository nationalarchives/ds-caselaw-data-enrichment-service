The underlying claim is for relief in respect of subject access requests under the Data Protection Act 1998 (“the 1998 Act”) with which the claimants, Mrs Ashley DawsonDamer (“Ashley”) and her children Piers and Adelicia, contend that the first defendants, Taylor Wessing LLP (“Taylor Wessing”), have not complied. In the judgment under appeal, Mr Hochhauser (“the Judge”) concluded (amongst other things) that certain paper files held by Taylor Wessing constituted a “relevant filing system” for the purposes of the 1998 Act, and that Taylor Wessing could claim legal professional privilege (“LPP”) in respect of some of the data covered by the requests. Taylor Wessing now challenge the Judge’s decision on the “relevant filing system” point, Ashley his conclusion as regards LPP. </p>

In 1973, a Bahamian settlement (“the 1973 Settlement”) was established for the benefit of legitimate descendants of Mr Skelton’s grandson, Viscount Carlow, who had himself been killed during the Second World War, and their spouses. The beneficiaries of that trust included Viscount Carlow’s two sons, George, now the Seventh Earl of Portarlington (“Lord Portarlington”), and John (“Mr John Dawson-Damer”), who died in 2000, as well as Lord Portarlington’s wife, their four children, his three daughters-in-law and his 11 grandchildren and Ashley, </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Between 1988 and 1992, the trustee of the 1973 Settlement, Arndilly Trust Company Limited, instructed Mr Robert Walker QC and Taylor Garrett (later Taylor Joynson Garrett) to advise on a possible restructuring of the 1973 Settlement and other family trusts. In 1992, a resettlement was effected under which four new discretionary trusts were established: the Willards Settlement, which was for the benefit of Mr John Dawson-Damer and his family; two trusts for the benefit of Lord Portarlington and his family; and the Glenfinnan Settlement, which was originally for the benefit of Lord Portarlington, Mr John Dawson-Damer, their spouses and their legitimate children. In each case, the trustee was initially Grampian Trust Company Limited (“Grampian”), a Bahamian company, although new trustees were subsequently appointed in respect of the Willards Settlement. Taylor Joynson Garrett and its successor, Taylor Wessing, have acted for Grampian ever since its incorporation in 1992. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In 2006 and 2009, Grampian appointed funds from the Glenfinnan Settlement to be held in four new discretionary trusts in favour principally of Lord Portarlington’s children and remoter issue. However, in a letter to Grampian dated 18 February 2014 solicitors for Ashley and her children asserted that the appointments were invalid and also challenged the validity of the 1992 restructuring. Later in 2014, Grampian applied in The Bahamas for a “put up or shut up order” against Ashley. In March of the following year, Ashley herself issued proceedings in The Bahamas challenging the 2006 and 2009 appointments. The trial of that claim is pending. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The present proceedings concern subject access requests which Ashley and her children made to Taylor Wessing under the 1998 Act on 4 August 2014. Taylor Wessing having responded that LPP applied to the data they held, Ashley and her children brought this claim, for relief under section 7(9) of the 1998 Act. In a judgment dated 6 August 2015 ([2015] EWHC 2366 (Ch)), Judge Behrens, sitting as a Judge of the High Court, dismissed the application, but on 16 February 2017 the Court of Appeal allowed an appeal (see [2017] EWCA Civ 74, [2017] 1 WLR 3255). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The Judge decided the first of these issues in favour of Ashley and her children and the second in favour of Taylor Wessing. He held in paragraph 56 of his judgment that “the 35 paper files under the client description, ‘Yuills Trusts’, arranged in chronological order, are a ‘relevant filing system’ for the purposes of s1(1) of the [1998 Act] and [Taylor Wessing] are required to search these for personal data of the Claimants”. He further concluded that “under English trust law, joint privilege would arise”, with the result that, aside from the Bahamian Trustee Act 1998 (“the BTA”), Taylor Wessing would not be able to assert LPP as against Ashley in relation to information pre-dating the letter of 18 February 2014 in which the 2006 and 2009 appointments were challenged. On the other hand, the Judge agreed with Taylor Wessing that section 83(8) of the BTA means that, “where Bahamian law applies to a trust, a beneficiary has no automatic right to see the legal advice to a trustee prior to any threatened litigation and no proprietary right to documents containing that advice, and so no ‘joint privilege’ can exist under that law” (paragraph 153). The Judge, moreover, rejected an argument advanced on behalf of the claimants to the effect that privilege had been waived in relation to certain documents: there had, the Judge held, been “no collateral waiver of privilege” (paragraph 213). The result was that Taylor Wessing could claim LPP over documents “if they were subject to legal advice privilege between [Taylor Wessing] and their client, Grampian, the trustee of the Glenfinnan Settlement” (paragraph 213). Taylor Wessing were “entitled to rely on the [LPP exemption] even as against [Ashley] because [Ashley] does not have any trust law rights which cut across, limit or qualify the trustee’s claim to legal professional privilege” (paragraph 156). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">There are two species of LPP: litigation privilege and legal advice privilege. It is common ground that Taylor Wessing can invoke litigation privilege as regards the period since 18 February 2014, when the letter challenging the 2006 and 2009 appointments was sent. The issue before the Judge was whether Taylor Wessing could rely on LPP in relation to data to which litigation privilege did not attach. Ashley argued that they could not, on the basis that there was “joint privilege” as between herself as a beneficiary of the Glenfinnan Settlement and Taylor Wessing’s client, Grampian, as the trustee of the trust. Taylor Wessing, on the other hand, maintained that the availability of “joint privilege” depended on Ashley’s rights as a beneficiary of the Glenfinnan Settlement and that, the governing law of the Glenfinnan Settlement being Bahamian, the BTA was in point. Section 83(8) of that Act states: </p>

The “joint privilege” of trustee and beneficiary, Mr White argued, is not an aspect of trust law, but part of the law of procedure and evidence, where the <span style="font-style:italic">lex fori</span> is applicable. In the present context, the Court of Appeal has already held that the LPP exemption applies only to documents which carry LPP for the purposes of English law and so the BTA is immaterial. </p>

Ashley is seeking to go behind the LPP to which English law entitles Grampian by asserting a beneficiary’s rights under trust law. Since the proper law of the Glenfinnan Settlement is that of The Bahamas, Ashley’s rights as a beneficiary fall to be determined on the basis of Bahamian trust law and so by reference to the BTA. Mr Pitt-Payne stressed that Taylor Wessing are not contending that paragraph 10 of schedule 7 to the 1998 Act imports any foreign species of privilege. The position is instead, it was suggested, that Bahamian trust law is relevant when assessing the <span style="font-style:italic">content </span>of English LPP. </p>

In that case, a beneficiary having asked for copies of documents relating to an appointment which the trustees had made, the trustees applied for a determination as to the extent of their disclosure obligations. Harman LJ noted that there was at least an apparent conflict between two principles: first, that “trustees exercising a discretionary power are not bound to disclose to their beneficiaries the reasons actuating them in coming to a decision” (see 928) and, second, that it is open to beneficiaries to inspect documents which “came into existence for the purposes of the trust and are in the possession of the trustees as such and are, therefore, trust documents, the property of the beneficiaries” (see 929). He concluded at 933 that certain documents were, “in the absence of an action impugning the trustees’ good faith, documents which a beneficiary cannot claim the right to inspect” since, if the beneficiary were allowed to examine these, she would “know at once the very matters which the trustees are not bound to disclose to her, namely, their motives and reasons”: “even if documents of this type ought properly to be described as trust documents, they are protected for the special reason which protects the trustees’ deliberations on a discretionary matter from disclosure”. However, “very different considerations apply when it comes to a question of discovery in an action where a beneficiary is impeaching the validity of the trustees’ actions”, Harman LJ said at 934. </p>

Of course, if a case is made of lack of bona fides, that is an entirely different matter. In that case I agree it becomes necessary to examine exactly what has happened because that is in an action and not in a theoretical application for directions, as the present case appears to me to be.

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.00in">“10.  … In its simplest form, the problem may arise because a beneficiary asks the trustees for disclosure, without threat of litigation, or even because, in the absence of any request, a trustee is uncertain whether to include a wish letter with the settlement deed, when initially appraising beneficiaries of their status as such…. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.00in">11.  The second typical circumstance in which the issue may arise is indeed that in which the court has been invited to resolve the question, as a discrete issue between trustees and beneficiaries. This may occur either because the trustees have, on their own initiative, sought directions from the court, or because, as in the present case, the beneficiaries have responded to a refusal by issuing a CPR Pt 8 claim for disclosure. In such a case disclosure is not said to be justified on the grounds of its relevance to some other pleaded issue between the trustees and the beneficiaries, such as the question whether a particular purported exercise of a discretionary power was invalid….  </p>

The third category of case in which the question of disclosure may arise is in the context of existing litigation about an issue in respect of which the wish letter is alleged to be a relevant document. In that context, disclosure of wish letters is merely an aspect of the general law and practice as to disclosure. Generally speaking, relevance and necessity are the governing criteria and confidentiality plays a very subordinate role. It is tempting to think that, because a determined beneficiary might circumvent the obstacle of confidentiality by litigating an issue to which the wish letter was said to be relevant, confidentiality could in truth be nothing but a temporary rearguard to cover a slow retreat by the trustees. But English law has developed a robust approach to ‘fishing’ litigation of that kind.” </p>

For those purposes, the relevance of the foregoing detailed analysis of the status of a wish letter is that identified by Danckwerts LJ in the <span style="font-style:italic">Londonderry </span>case [1965] Ch 918, 936B, namely that if the document in question does no more than illuminate the trustees’ reasons for the making of a discretionary decision, it may be simply irrelevant, unless the trustees by a partial disclosure of their reasons have put into play the issue as to their rationality.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It is Mr Pitt-Payne’s case that the relevance of Bahamian law does not stop there. He points out that “the relationships between the trustees and the beneficiaries” of a trust are also a matter for its governing law (see article 8(g) of the Hague Convention on the law applicable to trusts and their recognition, which has the force of law in the United Kingdom pursuant to the Recognition of Trusts Act 1987). Ashley, Mr PittPayne argues, is asserting that the relationship between herself as beneficiary and Grampian as trustee is such as to entitle her to access to documents which, at least as against third parties, are protected by LPP. In essence, she is relying on trust law, and, the governing law of the relevant trust being Bahamian, her rights must be assessed on the basis of Bahamian law. The BTA is therefore in point and precludes “joint privilege”. </p>

That is especially so since the Courts have not always distinguished between what a trustee must disclose in hostile litigation and what a beneficiary can insist on seeing in other circumstances. Mr PittPayne’s contentions might also be said to chime with Salmon LJ’s remark in <span style="font-style:italic">In re Londonderry’s Settlement </span>that “In some instances … the fact that they are trust documents may nullify the privilege that would otherwise exist” (see paragraph 36 above). </p>

As mentioned in paragraph 6 above, the Court of Appeal’s answer to the first of the issues before it was that the LPP exemption for which paragraph 10 of schedule 7 to the 1998 Act provides “applies only to documents which carry legal professional privilege for the purposes of English law” and that this “does not include documents by virtue only of the fact that a trustee may refuse to disclose to a beneficiary”. It is reasonable to assume that the Court would not have expected there to be further argument as to the impact of the BTA. However, Mr Pitt-Payne puts his case on the basis that the BTA is relevant to the content of English LPP and so that there is no inconsistency with what </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In the first place, the Courts have distinguished disclosure in litigation from a beneficiary’s rights under trust law in a number of the more modern authorities. In <span style="font-style:italic">O’Rourke v Darbishire</span>, Lord Wrenbury said that a beneficiary’s “proprietary right” to see trust documents “has nothing to do with discovery”. In <span style="font-style:italic">Schmidt v Rosewood Trust Ltd</span>, Lord Walker saw Lord Wrenbury’s observations as “a vivid expression of the basic distinction between the right of a beneficiary arising under the law of trusts (which most would regard as part of the law of property) and the right of a litigant to disclosure of his opponent’s documents (which is part of the law of procedure and evidence)”. In <span style="font-style:italic">Breakspear v Ackland</span>, Briggs J said that, where disclosure of a wish letter is sought from the Court in existing litigation to facilitate the determination of an issue to which it is alleged to be relevant, “different considerations” arise which are “governed by the law and practice as to disclosure in civil proceedings”. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Secondly, it is significant that “joint privilege” has been recognised in contexts other than trusts. The fact that it applies as between shareholder and company is especially important. As Mr Taube accepted in submissions, the fact that a company engaged in litigation with a shareholder must disclose documents which, as against third parties, would attract LPP cannot be explained as merely a reflection of a right which a shareholder would have anyway. Absent litigation, a shareholder’s rights to access any company documents, let alone those within the scope of LPP, are extremely limited (compare e.g. <span style="font-style:italic">R v Masters and Wardens of the Merchant Tailors </span>(1831) 2 B &amp; Ad 115). That strongly suggests that the “joint privilege” which has long been held to exist between shareholder and company should not be regarded as an aspect of company law. It is more plausibly seen as one emanation of a wider principle of procedure to the effect that “privilege cannot be claimed in circumstances where the parties to the relationship have a joint interest in the subject matter of the communication at the time that it comes into existence” (to use the formulation in Thanki, “The Law of Privilege” – see paragraph 26 above). That view is also supported by Stephenson LJ’s endorsement in <span style="font-style:italic">CIA Barca de Panama SA v George Wimpey &amp; Co Ltd </span>of the passage from the then-current edition of Phipson on Evidence reading: </p>

Had Ashley been seeking to defeat Taylor Wessing’s LPP by, say, claiming that she had ownership rights in respect of the relevant information, or even that she was entitled to invoke the jurisdiction of the Court to supervise, and if necessary to intervene in, the administration of trusts recognised in <span style="font-style:italic">Schmidt v Rosewood Trust Ltd</span>, the issue before us might correctly have been characterised as one of trust law and so governed by the law of The Bahamas. A claim founded in trust law might have had implications for Taylor Wessing’s ability to rely on LPP, but the dispute would essentially have been about trust law, not procedure or evidence. As it is, however, it seems to us that Ashley is relying, not on trust principles, but on a facet of the law relating to privilege whose application is not even limited to trusts. In the circumstances, what is at issue is appropriately characterised as procedure and so governed by English law as the (hypothetical) <span style="font-style:italic">lex fori</span>.  </p>

To say, therefore, that a beneficiary has no automatic right to see a trustee’s privileged documents “as a matter of <span style="text-decoration:underline">English trust law</span>” is beside the point, particularly when Mr Pitt-Payne did not propose a synthesis of trust law and procedural law.

If the position on the Data Protection Issue then remained as the Judge had declared it to be, then the personal data in the documents uncovered by the search and for which legal advice privilege was claimed would have to be disclosed.  He submitted, further, that the appeal was not academic, despite Taylor Wessing’s compliance with the order made by the Judge, at least in circumstances where there was the possibility of the Judge’s order on the LPP Issue being reversed. Finally, he submitted that the meaning of the term “relevant filing system” was an important issue which justified consideration at this level, given the state of the English and CJEU authorities on the topic. </p>

Subject to the fact that Taylor Wessing decided to comply with the order notwithstanding receipt of Ashley’s Notice of Appeal, we consider that they did have a good reason.  It was a matter for Taylor Wessing’s judgment whether they thought that an appeal was worthwhile when there appeared to be no intention on the part of the claimants to disturb the findings on LPP.  It is clear that Taylor Wessing took the view that, in these circumstances, an appeal was not worthwhile.  Ashley’s Notice of Appeal was a material change in circumstances amounting to a valid reason for changing tack. </p>

The decision to comply was, in those circumstances, an understandable and pragmatic one, taken in circumstances where the LPP exemption still operated to protect personal data in the documents to which it applied.

For the respondent, it was argued that manual records were intended to be covered by the legislation only to the extent that such records are broadly comparable with computerised records in terms of ease of access to and retrievability of data.

That seems to me entirely consistent with the Directive, in particular in the latter's emphatic emphasis in Art. 2(c) and Recital (27) on a file so structured by reference to “specific criteria” about individuals as to provide “easy access” to “the personal data in question”. When considered alongside the narrow meaning of personal data in this context and when read with Recital (15) indicating that the required "easy" access to such data must be on a par with that provided by a computerised system, the need for a restrictive interpretation of the definition "relevant filing system" is plain. It is not enough that a filing system leads a searcher to a file containing documents mentioning the data subject. To qualify under the Directive and the Act, it requires, as Mr Sales put it, a file to which that search leads to be so structured and/or indexed as to enable easy location within it or any sub-files of specific information about the data subject that he has requested.” </p>

Paragraph 56 of the CJEU’s judgment explains that, in accordance with the objective set out in paragraph 53 of avoiding circumvention of the protection, Article 2(c) broadly defines the concept of “filing system”, in particular by referring to “any” structured set of personal data.  The Court of Appeal’s conclusion in paragraph 50 is, in some respects, more restrictive and cannot be fully reconciled with the CJEU’s interpretation.  Thus, we do not see how, in the light of the CJEU’s judgment, the requirement in paragraph 50(1) of <span style="font-style:italic">Durant</span> can be justified.  That requirement is that files forming part of the system must be structured in such a way as clearly to indicate <span style="font-style:italic">at the outset of the search</span> whether specific information relating to an individual is held in the system and if so in which file or files it is held.  If the structure is such that ready access to the information is in fact enabled, then, following paragraph 57 of <span style="font-style:italic">Tietosuojavatuutettu</span>, that is sufficient.

Perhaps more fundamentally, the CJEU’s broad interpretation does not sit happily with this court’s conclusion in <span style="font-style:italic">Durant</span>, for example at [48], that the Act applies to manual records only if they are of sufficient sophistication to provide the same or similar ready accessibility as a computerised filing system.</p>

A Member State making use of that margin of discretion would, it seems to us, define the scope of Article 2(c) of the Directive by some express words.  The Court of Appeal did not conclude, however, that the 1998 Act had taken this approach.  Instead, the court concluded that its narrow interpretation of section 1(1) of the 1998 Act “accords with the Directive in its equally restrictive definition in Art.2(c) of “a personal data filing system” as a “structured set of personal data which are accessible according to specific criteria…,” and also with Recitals (15) and (27), which emphasise that it is intended to cover only files “structured according to specific criteria relating to individuals”.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In the light of the judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Tietosuojavatuutettu</span>, we think that the questions which must be asked are the following.  First, are the files a “structured set of personal data”?  Secondly, are the data accessible according to specific criteria?  Thirdly, are those criteria “related to individuals”?  Fourthly, do the specific criteria enable the data to be easily (or “readily” as the 1998 Act puts it) retrieved?</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr White challenged the Judge’s conclusion (relevant to the third question) that the specific criteria needed to be “related to individuals”.  We consider, however, that that requirement is implicit in Article 2(c).  It is difficult to see how personal data could be accessible according to specific criteria unless those criteria are in some way related to individuals.  That interpretation is consistent with Recitals (15) and (27) which expressly refer to “specific criteria relating to individuals”.  Moreover, in paragraph 57 of <span style="font-style:italic">Tietosuojavatuutettu, </span>the CJEU confirmed that the specific criteria must be related to individuals.  The requirement in section 1(1) of the 1998 Act that the set of information is structured “by reference to individuals or by reference to criteria relating to individuals” is therefore entirely in conformity with the Directive as interpreted by the CJEU.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Posing the fourth question in terms of “easy” or “ready” retrieval is, again, a gloss on the literal words of Article 2(c). However, in paragraph 57 of its judgment the CJEU put the question in that way when stating the principle, and used the same phrase when suggesting how the principle might apply to the facts at paragraph 61.  This way of putting the question also finds support in Recitals (15) and (27) (“easy access”).  Again, therefore, the requirement in section 1(1) that the information is structured in such a way that specific information relating to an individual is readily accessible is entirely in accordance with the Directive as interpreted by the CJEU. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It is convenient, next, to consider Taylor Wessing’s fourth ground of appeal<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>which is that the Judge was wrong to place reliance on the Charter in reaching his conclusion. <span style="font-style:italic"> </span>For our part we do not think that anything is added by the reliance on the Charter.  It is clear from Recital (10) to the Directive that the legislator had well in mind that the object of laws on the processing of personal data was to protect fundamental rights and freedoms recognised by EU law, and for that reason are entitled to “a high level of protection”.  It is notable, in that connection, that the CJEU was able to reach the conclusions on which we rely without the need to place reliance on the Charter.  Given that the Judge correctly approached the matter in accordance with the CJEU’s judgment, however, his reliance upon the Charter to support that approach does not undermine his judgment on this issue. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Taylor Wessing’s second ground of appeal was that the Judge ought to have found that the 35 files were not structured by reference to criteria “related to individuals”.  Mr Pitt-Payne submitted that the files were held by reference to the corporate client, the trustee.  They were not structured by reference to particular individuals.  Mr White submitted that the Judge had been right to give the phrase an expansive construction.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Viewed in isolation there would not appear to be much force in this point.  A criterion may be closely related to an individual (for example it might be his or her name or National Insurance number), or it may be remotely related to an individual (for example the street in which he lives).  The degree of specificity of the criterion does not preclude a finding that the criterion relates to an individual.  One needs to bear in mind, nevertheless, that a very general criterion may be less likely to enable easy or ready access to the data.  The Directive and the Act are clear in requiring a causative link between the criterion and ease of access of the data.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">That leads us naturally to the third ground of appeal which focuses on the fourth question posed above, namely whether the criterion by which the 35 files were structured <span style="font-style:italic">enabled</span> the relevant data to be easily or readily retrieved.  Mr Pitt-Payne submitted that the files were not structured in any way that enabled the data to be easily retrieved.  The only way that data could be retrieved was by physically examining the files page by page.  The criterion “Yuills Trusts” was so unspecific as to be of little or no assistance in the retrieval of personal data relating to the individual beneficiaries.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">We do consider that the Judge fell into legal error in answering the fourth question we have identified in paragraph 90 above.  Having concluded that the criterion “Yuills Trusts” related to individuals in a very broad sense, he then formed an assessment of how easy he thought the process of recovery of the personal data would be, relying on evidence that a trainee lawyer and an associate solicitor had in fact been able to extract personal data from the files, as well as the ability of a senior lawyer to identify documents subject to legal professional privilege.  That was an incorrect approach.  The “ready access” required under the Directive and the Act must be enabled by the criteria, that is to say by the structure of the files.  If access to the relevant data requires the use of trainees and skilled lawyers, turning the pages of the files and reviewing the material identified, that is a clear indication that the structure itself does not enable ready access to the data.  In fact, the 35 files were completely unstructured beyond their chronological compilation under the description “Yuills Trusts”.  The Judge lost sight of the need for the causative link between that criterion and the ease of retrieval of the data.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In that connection we consider the “temp test” to which the Judge referred to be of more assistance to Taylor Wessing than to Ashley.   The temp is postulated to be “reasonably competent but without any particular knowledge of the type of work or the documents you hold”.  None of the evidence which the Judge relied on could sensibly be regarded as satisfying that test.  Whilst this is no more than a rule of thumb, its application in this case did nothing to support a finding of ready access to personal data.</p>
