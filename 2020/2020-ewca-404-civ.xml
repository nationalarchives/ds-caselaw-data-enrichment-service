	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The judge refused to enforce the adjudicator’s decision because he found that the respondent could properly argue that the adjudicator’s decision had been procured by fraud. Although permission to appeal was granted to the appellant on two limited grounds only, this appeal therefore provides a further opportunity, following the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Gosvenor London Ltd v Aygun Aluminium UK Ltd</span> [2018] EWCA Civ 2695, to address the interface between the ‘pay now, argue later’ philosophy inherent in construction adjudication, and allegations of fraud raised on enforcement applications. <span style="font-style:italic">Gosvenor</span> was a case where the allegations of fraud could and should have been raised in the underlying adjudication; this is a case where, on the judge’s findings, that would not have been possible. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">A further relevant matter concerns the final resolution of the disputes between the parties. Mr Judkins’ decision was properly based on an earlier adjudicator’s decision that the appellant had been entitled to terminate the relevant sub-contract. In a recent TCC judgment concerned with all the disputes between the appellant and the respondent, Cockerill J held that the appellant had <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> been entitled to terminate and that the respondent had lawfully terminated the sub-contract. As Dr Sampson accepted on behalf of the appellant, that gives rise to a separate ground supporting the judge’s order, refusing to enforce the decision of Mr Judkins. In one sense, therefore, this appeal was principally about costs. </p>

The following month, on 10 May 2016, the respondent engaged the appellant to act as sub-contractor in respect of the engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning of the plant. The sub-contract price was £14,230,000 plus VAT.  </p>

In consequence, Equitix called on the performance security provided by the respondent under the main contract, which then triggered similar guarantees provided by the appellant under the sub-contract in the sum of £2.7 million. Eventually, Equitix gave notice and subsequently terminated the main contract with the respondent, and the subsequent dispute involved an adjudication and then enforcement proceedings in the TCC (see <span style="font-style:italic">Equitix ESI CHP (Wrexham) Ltd v Bester UK Ltd</span> [2018] EWHC 177 (TCC)).  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">There have been two separate strands to the sub-contract disputes between the appellant and the respondent. First, there were two adjudications. In the first adjudication, conducted by Mr Simon Tolson, the parties argued about the appellant’s entitlement to terminate the sub-contract. By a decision dated 23 January 2018, Mr Tolson decided that the appellant had validly terminated the sub-contract. Although he concluded that the respondent had to repay the performance security of £2.7 million, Mr Tolson did not otherwise deal with quantum. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">On 5 November 2018, the appellant began a second adjudication seeking to quantify and recover their losses arising from the termination. The second adjudicator, Mr Judkins, had to calculate the value of the work which the appellant had carried out prior to the termination and then, having allowed for the sums previously paid to the appellant, to work out the respondent’s net liability to the appellant. He calculated that net liability in the sum of £1,701,287.22. That was the subject of his adjudication decision dated 7 December 2018 which the appellant was seeking to enforce before the judge. </p>

The respondent counterclaimed in those proceedings, maintaining its contention that the appellant wrongfully terminated the sub-contract. At the time of the hearing before the judge, the TCC action was due for trial in July 2019. That trial duly went ahead before Cockerill J and, following final submissions at the end of October, her detailed judgment was handed down on 7 February 2020 ([2020] EWHC 223 (TCC)). Contrary to the decisions in the adjudications, she found for the respondent on all issues. </p>

In paragraph 2.90 of his decision, Mr Judkins disagreed. He said that it was the respondent who had caused the appellant to manufacture the plant items and, he said, that the evidence showed that those items of plant “are now stored at [the appellant’s] factories in the Czech Republic. When the relevant proportion of the Contract Price has been fully paid over to [the appellant] the plant belongs to the respondent which is responsible for collecting and disposing of the plant as it sees fit.” </p>

Examples of the first category are where it is later discovered that the certificate upon which an adjudication decision is based is discovered to have been issued by a certifier who has been bribed or by a certifier who has been fraudulently misled by the contractor into issuing the certificate by a fraudulent valuation. Examples of the second category are fraud on another contract or cross claims arising on the contract in question which can only be raised by way of set off or cross claim. Whilst matters in the first category can be raised, generally those in the second category should not be. The logic of this is that it is the policy of the 1996 Act that decisions are to be enforced but the Court should not permit the enforcement directly or at least indirectly of fraudulent claims or fraudulently induced claims; put another way, enforcement should not be used to facilitate fraud; fraud which does not impact on the claim made upon which the decision was based should not generally be deployed to prevent enforcement.”  </p>

As Fraser J rightly observed, the court must be robust not to allow such policy to be undermined simply by the assertion of fraud. In my judgment, such policy consideration must, however, yield to the wellestablished principle that the court will not allow its procedures to be used as a vehicle to facilitate fraud. Where, exceptionally, it is properly arguable on credible evidence that the adjudication decision was itself procured by a fraud that was reasonably discovered after the adjudication, the court is unlikely to grant summary judgment. I say unlikely rather than never since it is possible to conceive of a case in which the claimant might be able to establish that the defendant has no real prospect of successfully defending the claim and there is no other compelling reason why the case should be disposed of at trial even without relying on the impugned adjudication.”  </p>

In addition, I note that none of the evidence relied on by the respondent (as to how and why these allegations of fraud could not have been raised until enforcement) was challenged by the appellant at the enforcement hearing. It was therefore unsurprising that at [60] the judge concluded that the respondent “could not reasonably have been expected to have argued its fraud allegation in the adjudication.” For these reasons, permission to appeal on Ground 2 was also refused. </p>

In accordance with the principles noted in paragraph 23 above, that was sufficient to justify the judge’s refusal to enforce the adjudicator’s decision, subject only to Grounds 3 and 4.</p>

There will always be a residual risk to any claimant seeking to use the accelerated procedure that something may arise on enforcement which had not arisen in the adjudication. The only way to eliminate that risk is to wait until the defendant had pleaded a defence and then seek summary judgment. In this case, it was the appellant’s decision not to wait.</p>

Dr Sampson endeavoured to persuade us that the absence of a pleading ran the risk that the fraud allegations would be unclear or unfocussed, but that was plainly not the case here. No-one has suggested that either the parties or the judge were in any doubt as to the complaints being made. In addition, in so far as the requirement to plead fraud provides an important general safeguard (because of the obligation not to plead a case of fraud without proper evidential foundation), precisely the same is true for allegations of fraud made in a witness statement or in the submissions of counsel in open court. It was not controversial that IB5.7 and IB5.8 of the Solicitors Regulation Authority’s Code of Conduct (version 21) requires that fraud cannot be alleged unless the allegation goes to a matter in issue which is material to the client’s case and is “supported by reasonable grounds”. Similarly, paragraph rC9 of the Bar Standards Board’s Code of Conduct (9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> edition) says that a barrister cannot draft a document containing an allegation of fraud without both clear instructions and “reasonably credible material which establishes an arguable case of fraud”. That paragraph plainly extends to skeleton arguments.

In addition, strictly speaking, if the appellant had been successful on Ground 3, then it would have been for the respondent to raise an issue as to a stay, not the appellant.

The philosophy behind the adjudication process is the production of a quick decision which is temporarily binding until the underlying issues are either agreed, or the subject of final determination by the court or an arbitrator. In the present case, the underlying issues have been finally determined by Cockerill J. Her judgment therefore supersedes the decisions of both adjudicators.

CPR 24.4(2) provides to the contrary. Moreover, in a case where substantial allegations of fraud are found to be arguable, the right course will usually be the one taken by the judge, namely to refuse summary judgment. In such a case, no question of a stay of execution then arises. Further and in any event, the final determination of the issues by Cockerill J in favour of the respondent provides a separate, stand-alone reason why the adjudicator’s decision cannot now be enforced.</p>
