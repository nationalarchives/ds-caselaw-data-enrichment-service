The issue, shortly stated, is whether Article 31(2), on its true interpretation as a matter of EU law, applies to an agreement conferring exclusive jurisdiction on the courts of a Member State of the EU, in circumstances where the exclusive choice of court agreement applies to proceedings initiated by one party, but not (or not necessarily) to proceedings initiated by the other party. Agreements of this type are commonly referred to as “asymmetric”, although that is not a legal term of art or an expression used in Brussels Recast itself. </p>

The loan facility formed part of a package of financial support provided to Air Berlin by Etihad, which had acquired a 29.21% shareholding in Air Berlin in 2011. Despite this and other measures of financial support, however, Air Berlin encountered severe operational difficulties during the summer of 2017 which had an adverse effect on its revenues, costs and liquidity. As a result, Air Berlin applied to the Berlin court to open insolvency proceedings on 15 August 2017, and on 27 October 2017 it ceased operations. The defendant and appellant, Professor Dr Lucas Flöther, is the insolvency administrator of Air Berlin. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The parties therefore agreed that: (a) the Facility Agreement, and all non-contractual obligations arising from or connected with it, were to be governed by English law (clause 32); (b) the courts of England were to have “exclusive jurisdiction” to settle any dispute arising out of or in connection with the Agreement (clause 33.1.1); and (c) the courts of England were “the most appropriate and convenient courts” to settle any such disputes (clause 33.1.2). Nevertheless, clause 33.1.3, which (like the whole of clause 33) was stated to be “for the benefit of [<span style="font-style:italic">Etihad</span>] only”, reserved to Etihad the right to take proceedings relating to a dispute “in any other courts with jurisdiction”, so that “[t]o the extent allowed by law, [<span style="font-style:italic">Etihad</span>] may take concurrent proceedings in any number of jurisdictions.” The result is that Air Berlin was bound to invoke the exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts in order to settle any dispute arising from the Facility Agreement, but Etihad was free to take proceedings in any other (i.e. non-English) courts with jurisdiction. That is the nature of the asymmetry. So far as Air Berlin was concerned, it had entered into a choice of jurisdiction agreement which compelled it to litigate any disputes in England, but the same was not true of Etihad, which on the face of it reserved an unfettered freedom to “take concurrent proceedings in any number of jurisdictions.” </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It is convenient to note at this point that asymmetric jurisdiction clauses of this general type have been in widespread use for at least twenty five years, and it is common ground that they serve a legitimate commercial purpose. As Dr Louise Merrett (Reader in Private International Commercial Law at Cambridge) observed in an article in the International &amp; Comparative Law Quarterly in 2018 (<span style="font-style:italic">The future enforcement of asymmetric jurisdiction agreements</span>, I.C.L.Q. 2018, 67(1), pp 37-61 at page 40), quoting various sources, such clauses “are widely used in international financial markets”. Their aim is to “ensure that creditors can always litigate in a debtor’s home court, or where its assets are located”, and they “also seek to reassure the creditor that it can only be sued in its preferred jurisdiction”. It also appears (ibid) that the form of clause with which we are concerned is probably based on a standard form jurisdiction clause in the Loan Market Association Single Currency Term Facility Agreement.  </p>

The context for the support package, very briefly, was that between 2011 and 2016 Etihad had provided a combination of equity and debt finance to Air Berlin amounting to approximately €721 million. Air Berlin had a long history of financial difficulties, and in 2016 it began work on a proposed restructuring of its business. Since Air Berlin was a UK public limited company with its registered office in London, its annual financial statements had to be prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006. In late 2016, KPMG, Air Berlin’s external auditors, identified going concern and funding as significant issues for the forthcoming audit. With a view to ensuring that KPMG would sign off on Air Berlin’s financial statements at the end of April 2017 on a going concern basis, Air Berlin’s management then made various requests for financial support to Etihad. During March and April 2017, KPMG identified some further requirements which would need to be satisfied before it could sign off the financial statements on a going concern basis, and negotiations continued on the form and content of the support package.  </p>

The jurisdiction clause in the Facility Agreement does not do this. It is an asymmetric clause expressly designed to confer a wide range of possible jurisdictions for the benefit of Etihad. An asymmetric jurisdiction clause of this type is not an agreement conferring exclusive jurisdiction on the English Court (the court second seised) for the settlement of all disputes that may arise between Etihad and Air Berlin in connection with their particular legal relationship. Nor can it be said that the English court is “seised on the basis of” such an exclusive jurisdiction agreement as is required under Article 31(2). No court or courts are designated by the parties for the exclusive resolution of claims brought by Etihad against Air Berlin relating to the Facility Agreement. In relation to such claims, Etihad is entitled to invoke any head of jurisdiction available to it under Brussels Recast, including: (a) the place of Air Berlin’s domicile, i.e. Germany (Article 4(1)); (b) the place of performance of the obligation in question (Article 7(1)(a)); and (c) non-exclusive jurisdiction in England pursuant to clause 33 of the Facility Agreement and Article 25.

Neither proposition is correct. The wording of Article 31(2) is clear and has to be applied as it stands.

Since Article 29(1) begins with the words “Without prejudice to Article 31(2)”, it seems to me that, if anything, Article 31(2) is expressly accorded priority over Article 29(1), and the correct approach is therefore to construe Article 31(2) in accordance with its terms and in the light of the legislative purpose reflected in recital (22). So viewed, I can see no good reason why the concept of “a court… on which an agreement… confers exclusive jurisdiction” should be construed as excluding asymmetric jurisdiction clauses, and therefore as not applying to cases where the party which invokes the jurisdiction of the court first seised is bound by an agreement on choice of jurisdiction which, so far as that party is concerned, is indeed exclusive.  </p>

In view of the consequences that such an option may have on the position of the parties to the action, the requirements set out in Article 17 governing the validity of clauses conferring jurisdiction must be strictly construed. By making such validity subject to the existence of an “agreement” between the parties, Article 17 imposes on the court before which the matter is brought the duty of examining, first, whether the clause conferring jurisdiction upon it was in fact the subject of a consensus between the parties, which must be clearly and precisely demonstrated.

By April 1999, the working party had reached general agreement on a revised text for the two conventions, Brussels and Lugano. Introduction of the revised Lugano Convention was delayed, however, until 2007 because of the need to obtain a ruling from the CJEU on the question whether conclusion of the new Lugano Convention fell within the exclusive competence of the Community, or within the shared competence of the Community and the Member States. </p>

The 1988 Convention lays down that a prorogation clause that meets the requirements of the Convention always confers exclusive jurisdiction on the designated court or courts. But under the laws of some of the States bound by the Convention - under English law in particular - the parties will often agree a choice of forum clause on a non-exclusive basis, leaving other courts with concurrent jurisdiction, and permitting the plaintiff to choose between several forums; and English case-law has accepted that a non-exclusive clause constitutes a valid choice of forum under the Convention. On a proposal from the United Kingdom delegation, the <span style="font-style:italic">ad hoc</span> working party re-examined the question of the exclusive effect of a choice of forum clause, and reached the conclusion that, since a clause conferring jurisdiction was the outcome of an agreement between the parties, there was no reason to restrict the parties’ freedom by prohibiting them from agreeing in the contract between them that a non-exclusive forum should be available in addition to the forum or forums objectively available under the Convention. </p>

That provision was obviously to the advantage of the stronger party in the negotiation of a contract, without producing any significant gain for international commerce. The 1988 Convention has now been amended to give general recognition to the validity of a non-exclusive choice of forum clause, and at the same time the provision in the 1988 Convention that allowed a clause to be concluded for the benefit of one party only has been deleted. </p>

With that I can readily agree. He also submitted that the passage provides further support for his taxonomy because Professor Pocar’s discussion of the English proposal shows that the working party had asymmetric jurisdiction agreements firmly in mind, and it dealt with them not by providing that they were to count as exclusive jurisdiction clauses, but rather by recognising that parties were free to enter into a non-exclusive jurisdiction agreement in the interests of party autonomy. That may be so, but I can find nothing in this passage to suggest that Professor Pocar was addressing his mind to the question whether the exclusive part of an asymmetric jurisdiction clause can properly be regarded as an exclusive agreement in relation to claims brought by the party who is bound by it and does not have the benefit of a wider choice of forum. The focus of the discussion is on the validity of the non-exclusive part of the agreement, not on the exclusive nature of the agreement for the party who has no choice of forum. </p>

The relevant contract in that case was made between a German manufacturer of windows (Meeth) and a French supplier of glass (Glacetal). The contract was for the supply of glass by Glacetal to Meeth, and the contract provided that “if Meeth sues Glacetal the French courts alone shall have jurisdiction. If Glacetal sues Meeth the German courts alone shall have jurisdiction”. In other words, each party could be sued only in the courts of its own country. Glacetal sued Meeth in Germany to obtain payment for glass which it had delivered to Meeth.

On further appeal to the Bundesgerichtshof, the latter court referred two questions of law concerning the interpretation of Article 17 to the CJEU. The first question was whether the first paragraph of Article 17 permitted a reciprocal jurisdiction clause involving the courts of two contracting States. The second question, if the agreement was valid, was whether the effect of Article 17 was to prohibit the court before which a dispute has been brought from taking into account a set-off connected with the dispute.

Indeed, it is probable that no doubt would have arisen if the clause had been worded differently; that is, if it had prescribed that each party could be sued only before the courts of his domicile (or perhaps the State of which he is a national: in the present case the two links coincide). In those circumstances an identical intention would have been expressed in such a way as to emphasise the concern of the parties to establish a single criterion as being decisive: the domicile (or the nationality) of the defendant. Nevertheless, quite apart from the foregoing, it can be recognised that the parties to a contract may stipulate that the courts of two States shall have jurisdiction to settle disputes arising from that contract, provided that each jurisdiction is restricted to a specified class of dispute. In short, there is nothing to preclude the parties, instead of treating all disputes which could arise from their contract as a whole, from dividing them into two or more groups in accordance with criteria which they are free to establish and prescribing the courts of a different State for each group. This is not a common step but there are no grounds for considering it unlawful.” </p>

Recital (22) explains that the new rule was introduced “in order to enhance the effectiveness of choice-of-courts agreements and to avoid abusive litigation tactics”. In an asymmetric agreement, the borrower has promised not to sue anywhere other than the chosen jurisdiction. The question of whether the other party did or not agree to do the same does not arise when the bank is seeking to enforce the agreement  and should be irrelevant. Thus, the point is not so much that “considered as a whole” they are agreements conferring exclusive jurisdiction, as the judge put it in <span style="font-style:italic">Commerzbank</span>. Rather, each obligation can be considered on its own; the clause includes a promise by the borrower not to sue in any other jurisdiction and that promise is capable of being protected by Article 31(2). Each different obligation necessarily falls to be considered separately and the fact that the bank is not under a similar obligation is neither here nor there.” </p>

The European Court of Justice held that the designated (Austrian) court had to await the decision of the non-designated (Italian) court as to whether the latter had jurisdiction. If the Italian court decided that it had jurisdiction, the court second seised would have to decline jurisdiction in its favour. The outcome is sometimes referred to as the “Italian torpedo”.” </p>

Although asymmetric clauses are a familiar and widely-used feature of international financing transactions, the party which had bound itself to accept the exclusive jurisdiction of a chosen court would remain free to adopt the same abusive tactics as the Italian party in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Gasser</span>, with precisely the same adverse consequences.

I consider that there can be no logical justification for this difference in approach. In the present case, Air Berlin entered into an agreement that proceedings that it commenced would be brought exclusively in England; it had no option to bring proceedings elsewhere, and Air Berlin agreed not to bring such proceedings elsewhere. It is accepted that such clauses are effective under Article 25 of Brussels Recast. The clauses are therefore entitled to be enforced like any other jurisdiction clause. </p>

It is in my view not possible to see why these conclusions should follow simply because the clause leaves open the possibility that, in relation to another “group” of disputes, namely those where Etihad may wish to begin proceedings, the parties agreed that Etihad was not confined to the jurisdiction of the English courts.” </p>

Moreover, once it is accepted that asymmetric clauses are within Article 25 as a matter of EU law – so that any national laws which may cast doubt on the validity of such clauses are not relevant – it makes little sense to say that the effectiveness of such clauses should be decided in the first instance by a non-designated court, if first seised.” </p>

National law does therefore have a role to play in deciding whether an agreement falls within Article 25, and it remains open to a Member State which is radically opposed to asymmetric clauses on policy grounds to treat such agreements as void under its national law. Furthermore, if asymmetric jurisdiction clauses were really as unpopular across the English Channel as Mr Joseph at times appeared to suggest, one would expect to find some reflection of this in the Commission’s proposal for Brussels Recast, and an explanation of why their exclusion from the ambit of Article 31(2) would not undermine “the legal certainty and predictability of dispute resolution which choice of court agreements should bring about.” </p>

Like Cranston J and Merrett [<span style="font-style:italic">at page 58 of her article</span>], I consider that there are good arguments that the rules in the Hague Convention are engaged by an asymmetric clause. But in any event, I am concerned here with the rules in Brussels Recast which are differently worded and also have the important Recital (22). I have come to a clear view, based on the wording of Brussels Recast, its aims and background, as well as the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Meeth </span>and the three prior cases on Article 31(2), that Article 31(2) of Brussels Recast does apply to asymmetric clauses. I am far from convinced that even if a different result might arguably be reached under the Hague Convention, that this should dictate the answer under Brussels Recast. Indeed, there is a powerful case for saying that the conclusions reached in relation to Brussels Recast should assist in dictating the answer under the Hague Convention.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I am prepared to proceed on the basis that the Hague 2005 Convention should probably be interpreted as not applying to asymmetric jurisdiction clauses, although I emphasise that it is unnecessary for us to decide that question, and I do not do so. A strong indication that this was the deliberate intention of the framers of the Convention is provided by the Explanatory Report of Professors Trevor Hartley and Masato Dogauchi, who in their discussion of asymmetric agreements said at paragraph 106: </p>

The minutes show that a proposal by the Swiss delegate to amend the proposed definition of an “exclusive choice of court agreement” so as to make it clear that it included asymmetric jurisdiction agreement (by inserting the words “for some or all of the parties to the agreement”) was debated, but found no support. The amendment was then withdrawn. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Despite the force of that point, and despite the general desirability (which I acknowledge) of interpreting the Hague 2005 Convention and Brussels Recast in conformity with each other where it is reasonably possible to do so, I consider that on this issue the position under Brussels Recast is clear for all the reasons which I have already given. The result may be that, in this respect, the Brussels Recast regime goes further than the Hague 2005 Convention, but that is not necessarily surprising. As Mr Dicker points out, the Hague 2005 Convention deals solely with jurisdiction agreements, whereas Brussels Recast contains a comprehensive system of allocation of jurisdiction based on various potential grounds, of which jurisdiction agreements are but one example. This means that application of Brussels Recast regularly results in the attribution of  jurisdiction to the courts of more than one Member State. Furthermore, even in relation to jurisdiction agreements, the Hague 2005 Convention (on the assumption I have made) deals only with exclusive jurisdiction agreements, whereas Article 25(1) of Brussels Recast also extends, on any view, to non-exclusive jurisdiction agreements. Nor does the Hague 2005 Convention have any equivalent to the <span style="font-style:italic">lis pendens </span>rule in Article 29 of Brussels Recast. I agree with Mr Dicker that this is a significant point, given that Article 31(2) itself operates as a modification of the first seised rule which has no counterpart in the Hague 2005 Convention.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Finally, Brussels Recast nowhere refers explicitly to the Hague 2005 Convention, nor does it contain any explicit requirement that the two instruments should be interpreted consistently. There is no incompatibility in any formal sense between the two instruments, because they contain provisions which ensure that their scope is mutually exclusive: see Article 26(6) of the Hague 2005 Convention and Article 71 of Brussels Recast. So although consistency of interpretation is a desirable general objective, it cannot be elevated into a controlling principle, not least because the Hague 2005 Convention is an international agreement to be construed according to the principles of international law, and is not subject to the jurisprudence of the CJEU. </p>

It forms part of the tenth proposition, and raises the question whether the English court can properly be said to be “seised on the basis of” such an exclusive jurisdiction agreement as is required under Article 31(2). The argument, in short, is that the English court is seised by Etihad under Brussels Recast on the basis of its right to choose the court in which to bring proceedings, as expressly contemplated by Article 25(1), and not on the basis of the exclusive jurisdiction agreement which required Air Berlin to take proceedings in the English courts. </p>

It was rejected by Cranston J in paragraph [75] of his judgment, and in my view, he was right to do so. Etihad has seised the English court for the simple reason that the agreement provides for the exclusivity of the English court in relation to proceedings commenced by Air Berlin, and Etihad has brought the present proceedings on the basis of that agreement. There is no difficulty in saying that, in those circumstances, the English court is “seised on the basis of the [<span style="font-style:italic">exclusive jurisdiction</span>] agreement”. Etihad is able to rely, and does rely, on Clause 33.1.1 and the agreement of the parties that the courts of England have exclusive jurisdiction.” </p>
