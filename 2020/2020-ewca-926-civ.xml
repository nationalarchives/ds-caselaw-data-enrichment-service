The basis of the contribution claim is the statutory liability laid down by the 1978 Act.  The relevant sections from the 1978 Act are sections 1, 2(3), 6(1) and 7(3).  For convenience, they are annexed to this judgment.  As I have said, the critical point is whether the 1978 Act has extraterritorial effect. It is agreed that under the operation of private international law, the proper law of the liability for contribution would be German law.  It is also agreed that if German law applies to the contribution, then the claim for contribution will be out of time.  If however the 1978 Act has extraterritorial effect, and the liability arises under the Act, the contribution claim will be in time. </p>

The statute introduced the concept of contributory negligence. Against that background the distinguished jurist Prof Glanville Williams considered the law of contribution in relation to the conflict of laws, in his book entitled “<span style="font-style:italic">Joint Torts and Contributory Negligence</span>” 1951.  At page 414, he wrote:  </p>

There appear to be two possible ways in which the choice of law may be made.  Since the right of contribution arises out of a tort, it may be held to be governed by the same law as the tort, namely the <span style="font-style:italic">lex loci delicti</span>.  An analogy for his might be found in the Law Reform (Frustrated Contracts) Act, 1943, s.1(1), which makes the claim for restitution consequent upon a frustrated contract dependent on the law governing the contract.  Alternatively, since the right of contribution rests upon the notion of unjust enrichment, it may be held to be governed by the law of the place of enrichment.  This raises the question where is the place of enrichment.  The defendant’s enrichment occurs because the plaintiff, by satisfying the judgment debt or tortious liability, has satisfied a liability that ought sue D2 for contribution, notwithstanding that it may be just as difficult for D2 to resist the claim for contribution after the lapse of this time as if he were being directly sued for damages by P.  It is submitted that while D1 should have an extra period of time after satisfying P’s claim in which to sue D2, he does not need as long a period as six years.  It might be provided by legislation that D1 should be able to enforce his right to contribution within either of two periods, whichever is the greater:  (1) the same period as that in which the injured plaintiff can enforce his claim against the contributor, (2) the period of say one or two years after the liability of the claimant is ascertained or the injured plaintiff’s damages paid, with a discretion in the court to extend the period in meritorious cases (as where it has been practically impossible to serve the defendant). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.00in">Where a claim for contribution is made under the heading of damages in accordance with the argument in §§32-3, time commences to run when the cause of action accrues.  This means, where the action is for negligence, that it accrues on the first occurrence of damage.  Suppose that P is a passenger in a car driven by D2, whom he has exempted from liability for negligence:  there is a collision between this car and a lorry driven by D1, owing to the negligence of both drivers, and P and D1 are injured.  P sues D1, and D1 sues D2 for damages for his own injuries and damages for the damages that he has had to pay P.  Time runs from the accident, for that was when D1 suffered the first damage.  But now suppose that D1 was not injured, and that his only damage was his liability to P.  Did his damage occur when this liability arose (i.e. when P was first damaged), or does it occur only when he pays damages to P?  The question has not been decided, but it is suggested that the simpler alternative and on the whole the better one is the first.  This would mean that when contribution is claimed by way of damages, time runs from the same moment as in the injured plaintiff’s action. </p>

It may therefore be thought that the place of enrichment is the country where the tortious liability arose – which puts us back to the <span style="font-style:italic">lex loci delicti</span>.  Alternatively, it may be thought that the place of enrichment is the place where the present plaintiff made the payment to the victim of the tort.  This place, however, is perfectly fortuitous so far as the defendant is concerned, for the payment was not made to him and he was no party to it.  On the whole, therefore, the argument seems to be in favour of the <span style="font-style:italic">lex loci delicti</span>.  This means that the Tortfeasors Act should apply to torts committed in England, while for torts committed in other jurisdictions the question of contribution should be regulated by the law of the place of commission of the tort.” </p>

If P has recovered damages from D1, should D1’s right to contribution from D2 be affected by the fact that P could no longer sue D2 because of the expiry of the relevant limitation period?  It was the rule under the Law Reform (Married Women and Tortfeasors) act 1935 that D1 could recover in the situation just given and D2 could not shelter behind the Limitation Act 1939.  However, if P had in fact sued D2 and the court had held that the claim was statute-barred, D1 could recover no contribution.  We recommended that the law should be altered so that when D1 sued D2 for contribution, D2’s liability should be the same whether he had been sued by P and won on a ‘limitation’ point or had never been sued at all. </p>

The effect of this subsection is that D1 can recover contribution from D2 even if D2 has defeated a claim by P on a ‘limitation’ point.  However, D2 can resist a contribution claim if the expiry of a period of limitation or prescription has the effect of extinguishing P’s right of action against D2, rather than just barring his remedy.  The effect of the Limitation Act 1939 is usually to bar the remedy and not extinguish the right, but such extinction of the right of action does occur under sections 3 and 16 of the 1939 Act and as such is also the effect, as we have seen, of many foreign statutes of limitation. </p>

The charterers applied to strike out the notice on the ground that, the proceedings against them having been stayed, they were no longer a party to the action.  The application was dismissed on the ground that despite the stay, the action against them remained a pending or subsisting action, and they were still “a party to the action” within RSC O16 r8.  Hobhouse J concluded that, for the purposes of recovering a contribution under the 1978 Act, the liability of the person from whom contribution was sought did not need to be procedurally enforceable as a current and subsisting liability, provided it had had the character of a liability at the time the damage was suffered by the injured party. </p>

Such considerations are alien to the substantive scheme that is being provided for in the Civil Liability (Contribution) Act 1978 and would serve no purpose relevant to the scheme of the Act which I am able to discern. If the respondent to the contribution claim is, as here, a foreigner then before such a foreigner can be made the subject of a contribution claim the claimant must establish some procedural right recognisable under R.S.C., Ord. 11, or other relevant provision, which entitled him, the claimant, to proceed against the respondent in this country. If he cannot establish such a procedural entitlement no question of liability under the Act of 1978 will arise; if he can then there is no need for any further inquiry and the provisions of the Act should be applied. I have not, of course, lost sight of the fact that section 1(6) deals not with the liability of the respondent to the contribution claimant, but with the liability of either or both of them to the person who has suffered the damage. If the respondent is present within the jurisdiction then his liability could be established here; if the claimant, however, was not, what purpose is served by asking purely hypothetically whether he would if sued in this country have chosen to submit to the jurisdiction or could have been compelled to appear before the English courts under some provision of<a href="https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I849386A0E42311DAA7CF8F68F6EE57AB/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&amp;transitionType=DocumentItem&amp;contextData=(sc.Search)">

Similarly, what useful purpose is served by asking similar questions about a foreign respondent once one has established that it is proper for the claimant to proceed for contribution against that respondent in this country.

Devco applied under RSC O12 r8 to set aside the third-party proceedings and to set aside service of those proceedings, on the ground that Skaarup had failed to establish any basis for the proper exercise of jurisdiction to order service of the third-party proceedings in Canada.  Hirst J rejected that argument on grounds not relevant for our case.  However, he went on to consider in the alternative the implications of the 1978 Act.  He found that s1(6) of the 1978 Act created a cause of action in its own right.  There was nothing in the Act to limit its scope to liabilities incurred in England and Wales. On the contrary, the terms of section 1(6) with its reference to private international law, represented a “small pointer” in favour of an international dimension. Even if there had been no good foundation for a claim in tort, the judge found that Skaarup’s alternative reliance on the 1978 Act was sound.  Once again, Mr Hollander argues this case supports the contention that the 1978 Act represents a complete code with extraterritorial effect. Mr Dougherty submits that it does not.

In a case involving foreign elements that approach requires the Court to decide whether, upon a true construction of the Act, the legislature intended to confer on the claimant (B) in the contribution proceedings which are before it a right of contribution against the respondent to those proceedings (C) which was to be recognised and enforced in England. </p>

The English Court is concerned with what – to borrow the geometric model described by Donaldson LJ – may be referred to as the other two sides of the triangle, AB and AC.  If those two sides are established – in the sense that both B and C are or were (or would be or would have been) liable to A in respect of the same damage – then (subject to any express contractual provision between B and C relating or excluding contribution) the third side BC – which may be regarded as representing C’s liability to contribute to B – is put in place by the statute.   </p>

For this purpose the existence of liability is to be determined in the light of the provisions of ss1(6) and 6(1) of the Act.  Section 1(6), and other sections, contemplate that the Court may be required (by its own rules of private international law) to answer those questions by reference to some system of foreign law.  If those questions are answered in the affirmative, then s7(3) of the Act provides that the statutory right to contribution supersedes any right (other than an express contractual right) which might arise or exist otherwise than under the Act. </p>

To ask whether a right of contribution arising out of any relationship between B and C other than their relationship as persons each of whom is liable to A in respect of the same damage ought to be determined by English domestic law would be to ignore the basis upon which the right arises under that law.  To ask whether a right of contribution arising out of the relationship between B and C as persons who are each liable to A in respect of the same damage would be to ask the very question to which the 1978 Act provides the answer.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.00in">“The 1935 Act contained no indication whether "liable" in s 6 (1) (c) was restricted to liability under English domestic law or extended to liability under some foreign system of law. Following the enactment of the 1978 Act it is, of course, not only "possible ... literally speaking" for parties to be "liable", in the context of the contribution legislation, in respect of the same damage under a foreign system or systems of law; the Act itself recognises that foreign law may determine or affect liability see ss 1 (3), 1 (6) and 2 (3) (c). As Hirst J pointed out in The Kapetan Georgis (supra, (1988) 1 Lloyd's Rep 352 at page 359) the provision in s 1 (6) goes beyond anything contained in the 1935 Act. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.00in">It does not follow that the 1978 Act "is capable of being applied indiscriminately" whenever two parties are liable for the same damage under foreign law. The criteria, under s 1 (6) of the Act, is that the liability has been or could be established in an action brought in the English court by the person who has suffered the damage. Although it is immaterial that, in deciding whether or not liability is established, the Court may (in accordance with its own rules of private international law) apply foreign law, the "liability" is a liability which could be established in an English court. So, for example, liability under foreign law alone in respect of a tortious act committed abroad would not be sufficient; liability under English law also would need to be established in accordance with the test of double actionability recognised in Boys -v- Chaplin [1971] AC 356, [1969] 2 All ER 1085, But if that test is satisfied, then it is immaterial whether a right of contribution between the tortfeasors exists under any foreign law. That right is conferred by s1(1) of the 1978 Act and the English court must give effect to it. </p>

It would be remarkable if the Court could not do so. It would be a surprising defect in the law if the English court, having decided in an action to which A B and C were party that B and C were each liable to A in respect of the same damage - suffered in, say, a collision between motor vehicles in Ruritania in which the three were involved - and having assessed that damage, were precluded by the absence of any law of contribution in Ruritania from deciding also how its judgment for that sum against each of B and C should be apportioned <span style="font-style:italic">inter se</span>.

True, the power given to the court to award whatever is just and equitable also looks unobjectionable; but is that sufficient? Maybe not. A close analogy exists in the power to assess contributory negligence between a plaintiff and defendant under the Law Reform (Contributory Negligence) Act 1945. Suppose that a plaintiff has been injured in circumstances in which an English court, left to its own devices, would reduce damages on account of contributory negligence. But suppose that the tort took place in Ruritania. And suppose that Ruritanian law on contributory negligence was different: a different fractional apportionment, or a last opportunity rule to bar recovery altogether. Would the 1945 Act apply to the exclusion of the Ruritanian rule? Common law authority was thin, but a modem consensus would accept that the issue was one of substance, and should on that account be governed by the law governing the substance of the claim. Now that this is declared by statute<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller"> </span>to be Ruritanian law, would an English court still apply its own provisions on contributory negligence? Almost certainly not: it would apply those of the <span style="font-style:italic">lex loci delicti</span>.  </p>

The wording of the two statutes is strikingly similar, and neither gives any indication that it is to apply notwithstanding, or is not to apply in the face of, international elements in the claim. One arguable distinction may be that there is a clear choice of law rule for tort (hence for contributory negligence as an issue) but that, as clarity is rather lacking for quasi-contractual or restitutionary claims, the case for applying the 1978 Act <span style="font-style:italic">faut de mieux </span>is stronger.

	    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.00in">“Two things follow from this procedural murk. First, a court should be willing to accept jurisdiction over contribution claims when it has jurisdiction over the claim of P against D: one single determination binding on all will be a solution much preferable to the anarchy of separated parts of a single story being litigated in separate courts. <span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller"> </span>This insight tipped the balance and led the Privy Council to issue an injunction in <span style="font-style:italic">S.N.I.

The blanket application of English law to the substance of the contribution claim is inappropriate, at least in cases where the claim, when seen in simple isolation, would not otherwise have belonged within the jurisdiction of the English court or to English law. In other words, the relationship created or arising between D and R should be treated as self-contained, and the law appropriate to it selected to govern the claim. No doubt it is then true to say (i) that this should be that with which the claim for contribution has its closest and most real connection<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller"> </span>and (ii) that such claims should be accommodated within the emerging choice of law rule for restitutionary claims.

However, it is unequivocal in its application to all proceedings brought in England, and there is nothing in the Act, or in particular in s.1(6), to limit the right of contribution to liabilities incurred in England and Wales: see the observations of Hirst J in `<span style="font-style:italic">The Kapetan</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">Georgi</span>s' at p.357-9. Contribution proceedings are in turn generally proceedings appropriate to be tried in the course of proceedings already afoot. The draftsman of the 1978 Act and the Supreme Court Rules Committee may be taken to have had in mind that the combined effect of the 1978 Act and O.11 r1(1)(c) would be to permit joinder of a foreign party who would not be liable if sued directly in his own country. Similar issues arise in cases where the limitation period in the foreign country may be different from that in England. Depending on the overall circumstances, a shorter local time bar may on occasions be an argument for confirming the need to serve out of the jurisdiction. </p>

In my opinion, in relation to a question of contribution, the court should similarly be guided by the interests of the parties and considerations of practical justice. This is a case where plainly Fortum are acting reasonably in seeking to issue contribution proceedings against Saudi Aramco in proceedings in which Fortum have themselves been sued and require to protect their position. So far as practical justice is concerned, while Saudi Aramco would be under no liability if sued in Saudi Arabia, it will only be held liable to contribute in this country if it is in truth directly liable to Mellitus pursuant to a claim for damage already asserted and required to be determined in England under English law (albeit in arbitration proceedings). In such circumstances, as it seems to me, the demands of practical justice plainly favour joinder of Saudi Aramco.” </p>

Subsequent to her husband’s death, the widow entered into another relationship and had two children with her new partner.  It was accepted that German law governed the issue of liability, but the widow contended that the quantification of damages recoverable from the defendant was governed entirely by English law and by the provisions of the Fatal Accidents Act 1976 [”the 1976 Act”]. If the 1976 Act applied, the widow would recover more than if her claim fell to be decided by German law.  The question therefore was whether the 1976 Act had extraterritorial effect. </p>

There are two distinct questions, which are not always distinguished in the case-law. The first question is what is the proper law of the relevant liability. The answer will usually depend on the extent of any connection between the facts giving rise to liability and England or English law. If the proper law of the liability is English law, no question of extraterritorial application arises. In principle the exercise is no different from that which the court performs when it identifies the proper law of a non-statutory tort, by reference to the connection between the facts and the various alternative systems of law.

He first looked at history.  At the time of commencement, the question of extraterritorial application could not have been in issue, because at that time actions brought in England on a foreign tort were subject to the doubleactionability rule.  Hence, reliance on a foreign proper law of the tort was “pointless” since the elements of the English tort had in any event to be satisfied.  Secondly (para 33) Lord Sumption considered the purpose of the 1976 Act, which was to correct an anomaly in the English law of tort.  There was nothing in the mischief addressed by the legislation requiring it to be applied to foreign fatal accidents.  Thirdly, Lord Sumption considered (paragraph 34) that he could see nothing in the terms of the Act which depended on its having extraterritorial effect.  Here Lord Sumption continued: </p>

Some foreign laws governing the availability of damages for fatal accidents may no doubt be so offensive to English legal policy that effect would not be given to them in an English court.  A rule of foreign law that women or ethnic minorities should have half the damages awardable to white males similarly placed was cited as an example.  But the German rules with which this case is concerned are based on a perfectly orthodox principle which is by no means unjust and is accepted in principle by English common law in every other context than statutory liability for fatal accidents.” </p>

The purpose of the 1978 Act cannot effectually be achieved unless it has extraterritorial effect; and the legislation gives effect to a policy so significant in the law of the forum that Parliament must be assumed to have intended that policy to apply to anyone resorting to an English court regardless of the law that would otherwise apply.

He submits firmly that<span style="font-style:italic"> Hashim</span> was wrongly decided at the time.  Nothing in the wording of the Act points unequivocally or even clearly to extraterritorial effect.

There is nothing objectionable about the application of the German law of limitation.  Mr Dougherty does lay emphasis on the fact that Lord Scarman promoted the Bill in its final form in such a way that demonstrates beyond doubt Lord Scarman himself did not consider this measure to have a general extraterritorial effect.  The authorities relied on by the respondent are all jurisdiction cases.  They are not directly on point.  They must be considered carefully in context.  The question of “what is the applicable law?” was simply not in issue.  The risk and difficulty attending an application to set aside service forms a real disincentive in such cases.  The relevant point may simply never have been taken.  Finally, the principles laid down by Lord Sumption in<span style="font-style:italic"> Cox</span> are unequivocal.

All these provisions bear the appearance of a complete code addressing all contribution claims arising under the Act.  If the appellant were correct and the statute only applied where the right to contribution is governed by English law, what would be the point of superseding any other right to recover contribution?  In the respondent’s submission<span style="font-style:italic"> Hashim</span> was correctly decided. Chadwick J was correct as to the defect in the law which would follow were it not so.  The academic comment, including that from the editors of Dicey and Morris, represents (as often) a tension or blurring between what the author considered what should be and what is the law.  The only really detailed analysis in the academic literature was in the article by Prof Briggs.  One must set the academic comment against the detailed analysis in the reported cases.  It would be remarkable if the distinguished advocates and judges appearing or sitting in<span style="font-style:italic"> the Benarty, the Kapetan Georgis</span> and<span style="font-style:italic"> the Baltic Flame</span> all missed this point. Mr Hollander commented that the analysis of principle by Lord Sumption in<span style="font-style:italic"> Cox</span> was, strictly speaking,<span style="font-style:italic"> obiter.</span>  Nevertheless, he accepted the authority of those passages and that analysis. In addressing the application of Lord Sumption’s analysis to this statute, it was noteworthy that Mr Hollander was unable to say that there was any passage in the Act which would be redundant unless the Act had extraterritorial effect.  Mr Hollander’s central point was that it is apparent from the terms of the Act, in particular sections 1(6) and 7(3), that the draftsman was contemplating a position where this Act would apply to any case in the English courts where the pre-requisites in sections 1 (1) and 1 (6) were satisfied.  In the end, this was a compelling matter of construction of the statute. </p>

Thirdly, in the context of this case, does the approach laid down by Lord Sumption in<span style="font-style:italic"> Cox</span> enfranchise an interpretation of the statute which gives it extraterritorial effect?

	    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.00in">“Statutory interpretation is an exercise which requires the court to identify the meaning borne by the words in question in the particular context. The task of the court is often said to be to ascertain the intention of Parliament expressed in the language under consideration. This is correct and may be helpful, so long as it is remembered that the “intention of Parliament” is an objective concept, not subjective. The phrase is a shorthand reference to the intention which the court reasonably imputes to Parliament in respect of the language used. It is not the subjective intention of the Minister or other persons who promoted the legislation. Nor is it the subjective intention of the draftsman, or of individual members or even of the majority of individual members of either House. These individuals will often have widely varying intentions. Their understanding of the legislation and the words used may be impressively complete or woefully inadequate. Thus, when courts say that such and such a meaning “cannot be what Parliament intended”, they are saying only that the words under consideration cannot reasonably be taken as used by Parliament with that meaning.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Adopting that approach, I turn to the 1978 Act. Entitlement to the contribution claim under the Act, provided for in section 1 (1), is dependent upon threshold provisions in section 1 (2), (3) and (6). Since the instant primary case is a tort case, I shall illustrate the provisions by referring to the “person[s]” in these subsections as “the claimant”, “tortfeasor one” and “tortfeasor two”. Beginning with section 1 (6), the liability of tortfeasor one and tortfeasor two to the claimant is confined to “liability which has been or could be established in an action brought against him in England and Wales by or on behalf of the person who suffered the damage”. This threshold condition arises in respect of each of tortfeasor one and tortfeasor two. In my view, the second part of section 1 (6), in making the qualification which follows, (“ it is immaterial whether any issue arising in any such action was or would be determined (in accordance with the rules of private international law) by reference to the law of a country outside England and Wales”) makes two things clear, as a matter of ordinary language. Firstly, the relevant liability must have been or must be able to be established in an English court, but not necessarily by an application of English law. For example, in a case where the application of private international law has or would result in a ruling that an English court would be the<span style="font-style:italic"> forum conveniens</span>, then the threshold condition would be satisfied even though the English court would apply foreign substantive law. It seems to me that the phrase “any issue” cannot naturally be read down to mean “any single issue”. On the face of it, therefore, the necessary threshold condition could be established where an English court gave or would give judgment against tortfeasor one and tortfeasor two, even when applying foreign law to all the issues in the case(s). </p>

This seems to me a problematic argument, if I am right about the natural meaning of the language in section 1 (6). It is not a straightforward question of the Act providing a “complete code”. The question is crisper. Provided liability can be established against tortfeasor one and tortfeasor two, so as to gain judgment in an English court whether or not any issue or issues are decided by foreign law, the threshold condition for a contribution claim is fulfilled. If by its own terms the Act applies in relation to the principal liability of the tortfeasors, even where the proper law of the tort is foreign law, then why should a consequential contribution claim where the proper law of the claim is foreign law, fall outside the ambit of the Act? I shall return to this point when considering a purposive interpretation of the statute, but as a matter of ordinary language it seems to me the meaning of section 1 (6) is tolerably clear. </p>

An example might be a rule under Ruritanian law, being the proper law, that any right to contribution be limited to 50%.” Mr Hollander says that Chadwick J was therefore right to hold this section overrode any such foreign law. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Looking at the provisions themselves, it seems to me that the purpose of Parliament is tolerably clear. At the forefront, was the object of simplifying and standardising contribution claims, whatever form of liability gave rise to the common liabilities to the “person… [suffering]… damage”. This was the main thrust of the interpretation of liability and damage set out in section 6 (1).  As the clear purpose for change in domestic law, this was well articulated by the Law Commission in paragraphs 73 and 74 of the Working Paper No 75, see paragraph 9 above. As Professor Briggs accepted in his 1995 article quoted in paragraph 32 above, there is an ‘immediate attraction’ to that result. Parliament then had in contemplation the two important criteria by which the liability of those in respect of whom contribution might arise to be established. Section 1 (6), stipulating that liability must be capable of being established in England, also stipulated that it might be established on the basis of foreign law. If so established in a given action, there was an obvious question as to what law would govern contribution claims in such cases. The Act is wholly directed to contribution claims. It would have been simplicity itself to provide that where the proper law of the contribution claim was a foreign law, then the statutory right did not arise. Parliament set no such limit or exclusion. As we have seen, in section 7 (3) much narrower limits were set. In my judgment, the natural interpretation of the language of the Act sits well alongside a presumed purpose of a standardisation and simplification of limits on the statutory claim for contribution which otherwise would be affected by foreign law. </p>

Whilst I accept  Mr Dougherty’s comment that there is no inherent defect in German law, it is nevertheless logical, in a standardising and simplifying statute, that such considerations should be set aside once it is shown that primary liability can be established, if necessary by reference to the relevant foreign law. </p>

His further observations are developments of that principle.

Therefore the question becomes: is there anything in the language of the 1978 Act “to suggest that its provisions were intended to apply irrespective of the choice of law derived from ordinary principles of private international law”, as Lord Sumption expressed it in the first part of paragraph 29 of his judgment.

At that point one looks for an implied extraterritorial effect, which he says will not arise unless the legislation cannot effectually be applied or its purpose effectually achieved, setting aside the case where the legislation gives effect to policy so significant that Parliament must be taken to have intended that policy. Mr Hollander conceded that the provisions of the 1978 Act could be applied, absent extraterritorial effect. In my view he was right to make that concession. However, it does seem to me that the policy to be construed from the Act, and in particular from section 7 (3), would not be achieved otherwise than through extraterritorial effect. </p>

The creation of (i) a statutory right of contribution as between persons notwithstanding that the liability of one or more of them arises under foreign law and (ii) the exclusion of other rights of contribution (save for express contractual rights) can and should be read together as giving rise to the plain implication that the 1978 Act has extraterritorial effect.               </p>

This would be so whether the claim was made in proceedings brought by the claimant against tortfeasor one or against both of the tortfeasors or was made in separate proceedings. </p>

The effect may significantly enhance the position of tortfeasor one and correspondingly worsen the position of tortfeasor two, even (as in this case) depriving tortfeasor two of an accrued limitation defence and therefore exposing him to a liability which would not arise under the law which would otherwise govern the contribution claim. </p>

As he also observes, the Act must be construed in the light of the presumption against a statute having extra-territorial effect.  This is a longstanding principle of statutory construction, discussed in detail by the Supreme Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Cox v Ergo Versicherung AG</span> [2014] UKSC 22, [2014] AC 1379. Like other presumptions applying to the construction of statutes, it requires Parliament to be clear when it wishes a statute to have extra-territorial effect and thereby to provide assurance that Parliament has confronted the issue.  Some presumptions, such as those designed to protect the civil liberties of citizens or the independence of the courts, may require language that leaves no room for doubt at all: see <span style="font-style:italic">R (Evans) v Attorney General</span> [2015] UKSC 21, [2015] 1 AC 1787.

I am grateful to Irwin LJ for reviewing these judgments and texts.

I have earlier cited from Lord Sumption’s judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Cox</span>. He identified the two circumstances in which most, if not all, cases of implied effect would arise.  The first was that the terms of the legislation could not effectually be applied, or its purpose effectually achieved, unless it had extra-territorial effect.  Mr Hollander accepted that this could not be said of the 1978 Act.  The second was that the legislation gives effect to a policy so significant in English law that Parliament must have intended it to apply to anyone having resort to the English courts.  The example given in argument and recorded by Lord Sumption at [34] was the exclusion of a rule of foreign law that discriminated in the award of damages on grounds of race or sex.  It cannot be said that the 1978 Act embodies any policy of such significance that it can by implication have extra-territorial effect. </p>
