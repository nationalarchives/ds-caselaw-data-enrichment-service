	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The question has arisen in proceedings concerning two children, now aged 11 and 9.  They are Indian nationals who were born in the United Kingdom.  Their parents, who came to this country in about 2004, were unsuccessful in obtaining leave to remain.  In August 2015, for reasons which it is not now necessary to describe, the children were removed from their parents and placed in a foster home where they have lived ever since.  Contact with the parents has not taken place since that time.  The mother left the UK in November 2015 while pregnant and now lives in Singapore.  The father has remained in England, but his antagonism towards the local authority has made contact unachievable.  In the course of a complex set of proceedings, the children became the subject of placement orders.  However, the search for adoptive parents was not successful and in December 2018 the local authority applied to discharge the placement orders.  The parents responded with an application to discharge the underlying care orders in order to secure the children’s return to their care or to the care of family members in India or Singapore.  Those proceedings were heard by Her Honour Judge Tucker.  By an order made on 19 December 2019, she discharged the placement orders but refused to discharge the care orders.  The consequence is that the plan is for the children to remain in long-term foster care for the remainder of their childhoods.  During the course of the proceedings, the local authority stated that it would seek to secure the children’s immigration status by making applications for British citizenship, which would have the effect of removing their Indian nationality.  </p>

Citizenship was memorably described by the political theorist Hannah Arendt as “the right to have rights”, because it is through membership of a nation state that a person acquires and exercises legal rights.  In addition to the practical benefits conferred by citizenship, a person’s nationality may be a matter of profound psychological importance to them.  Article 8.1 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989) emphasises that nationality is part of one’s identity: </p>

Such decisions have chiefly related to serious medical treatment, although in <span style="font-style:italic">Re C (Children)</span> [2016] EWCA Civ 374; [2017] Fam 137 (<span style="font-style:italic">Re C</span>), the issue related to a local authority’s desire to override a mother’s choice of forename for her children.

Instead the local authority has simply said that it is going to make the application.  The issue was then missed in the lower court.  The matter should be remitted for proper evaluation to the Family Court before a judge sitting as a deputy judge of the High Court, or to the High Court. </p>

She emphasised nationality as being fundamental to a person’s life, and of an importance that is on a par with serious medical treatment.  In seeking to change the children’s nationality the local authority must, as she put it, hit that target.  Deprivation of Indian citizenship has consequences for succession and for the children’s ability to own land. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Day accepted that the court did not have the evidence that would have been expected when there was an immigration issue of this nature, either in relation to English law or to Indian law.  Nor had any distinction been drawn between immigration status, passports and travel documentation, and citizenship.  In written submissions, he argued that the local authority does not require court approval for any steps other than those explicitly specified in s. 33 (7), but he accepted that that argument was not open to him in this court.  He therefore fell back on the argument that a decision about a change of citizenship was not one of such magnitude that it had to be put before the court.  It was akin to routine vaccination and not to serious medical treatment.  Despite conceding that a change of citizenship is a permanence provision, Mr Day argued that the judge was entitled to sign off the care plan without giving specific consideration to the issue.  She was entitled to assume that the local authority would deal with the matter under s.33.  Requiring family courts to scrutinise the care plan in all cases where the child’s immigration status was doubtful would have profound consequences for the conduct of care proceedings.  The provisions of s.100 (4) CA 1989 would present the local authority with problems in applying for court approval.  Finally, it was said that as long as the local authority consulted, it could act to take necessary steps.  The remedy for parents would be to apply to the High Court, whether it be for an injunction under s.8 of the Human Rights Act 1998, or by judicial review proceedings, or by issuing an application to discharge the care order (a remedy described by Mr Day as a sledgehammer).  If there was no parent in a position to take these steps, the matter would remain in the hands of the local authority. </p>

She conceded that the question of nationality was not properly addressed in the lower court and that the appeal should therefore be allowed.  She argued that the matter should now be referred to the High Court and not to the Family Court and that ideally the local authority should make the necessary application, with an application by the parents or the Children’s Guardian being a possible alternative. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Every local authority will encounter situations where action is needed to secure the immigration position of a child in its care.  In some cases an application will be made for leave to remain.  In others it may be possible for a child to have dual citizenship.  These cases, where the child is gaining a benefit and losing nothing, are to be contrasted with cases where a child may lose his or her original nationality.  In those cases the issue is of a magnitude that cannot in my view be resolved by a local authority acting in reliance upon its general statutory powers.  In the absence of parental consent, it requires a decision of the High Court under its inherent jurisdiction.  That is so whether the issue arises within or outside proceedings.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Although these children had been in the care of the local authority for several years, no steps had been taken to regularise their immigration position.  That is a matter of justified concern, even though there is no immediate threat of removal.  The children would clearly benefit emotionally from their position being regularised and from being able to travel in and out of the country, for example if opportunities for school trips or holidays were to arise.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The children’s immigration status, as opposed to the question of nationality, could and should have been addressed within the existing proceedings.  The judge is not to be criticised for not doing so: she was dealing with more immediate issues in difficult circumstances, but it is clear that this important question did not receive the attention it required.  Even so, the court would surely have approved steps being taken to regularise the children’s immigration position, short of an application for citizenship, and such steps can now be taken by the local authority under its s.33 powers.  The integrity of the care orders is unaffected by this appeal. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">As to citizenship, the local authority had sought some advice, but there was no evidence about the options for securing the children’s position in the UK through applications short of an application for citizenship.  There was a general understanding that the granting of British citizenship to the children would lead to the loss of their Indian citizenship, but there was no formal evidence to this effect.  There was no acknowledgement of the intrinsic gravity of a change of nationality, to the extent that the issue did not feature in the care plans or in the judgment.  No consideration was given by any of the agencies to any disadvantages that might flow to the children from the loss of their nationality of birth.  Nor was any consideration given to whether it was appropriate to apply now, or whether it would be more appropriate to defer an application to a time when they could express a more informed view, as the Guardian at one point seems to have contemplated. </p>

Meantime, it was open to the judge to give directions for the necessary evidence of UK and Indian law to be gathered.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.75in;margin-right:0.00in">The characterisation of a change of citizenship as akin to routine vaccination is misplaced.  Changing a child’s citizenship is a momentous step with profound and enduring consequences that requires the most careful consideration.  Recognising that fact does not have far-reaching consequences for the conduct of care proceedings, as claimed, and it is not asking too much of a local authority to put its case before the court for scrutiny.  This case, in which local authority has arrived at a settled position without any of the necessary data, provides a good example of why such scrutiny is needed. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.75in;margin-right:0.00in">It is no answer to say that the remedy for dissenting parents is to take legal action against the local authority.  The difficulties with this course were touched upon in <span style="font-style:italic">Re C </span>at [76].  Further, for many parents, and particularly those whose immigration status is insecure, that will not be an effective remedy.   They will only have legal representation within care proceedings, and they may have neither the knowledge nor the means to seek an injunction under the Human Rights Act or to bring judicial review proceedings.  It is conceded that an application to discharge the care order would be disproportionate.  Similarly, the children themselves have a central interest in the matter and in the absence of proceedings they will not have a Children’s Guardian and will not be legally represented.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.75in;margin-right:0.00in">The suggestion that the local authority would be prevented from seeking a judicial ruling by the terms of s.100 CA 1989 is not persuasive.  The very existence of s.100 (3)  and (4) demonstrates that there will be residual cases where the local authority’s statutory powers under s.33 are inadequate.  In the present case the local authority would require leave to apply for the court to exercise its inherent jurisdiction (ss. (3)) and the court could only grant leave if the result sought could not be achieved by other means (ss. (4) (a)) and where there is reasonable cause to believe that the children would be likely to suffer significant harm if the inherent jurisdiction was not exercised (ss. 4 (b)).  The court would in my view be likely to find that these conditions were met in this case.  Condition (a) is met as a matter of law.  Condition (b) would be met by the court finding that, if it was in the children’s interests for them to become British citizens, there is reasonable cause to believe that they would be likely to be significantly harmed by that course not being pursued; the nature of the harm being their liability to removal from their lifelong home country on reaching adulthood. </p>

Depending upon expert advice, it may not need to be made as a matter of urgency, and consideration might be given to whether it should be taken at a time when the children would be more able to express their own views.  That of course does not prevent an application being made now as it would be open to the court to approve an application being made at a later date. </p>

However, reflecting the appellants’ success on the issue of law that led to permission to appeal being granted, I would declare that s.33 CA 1989 does not entitle the local authority to apply for British citizenship for these children, in the face of parental opposition and where that may lead to a loss of their existing citizenship, without first obtaining approval from the High Court.  The local authority should now indicate whether it wishes to progress the matter, in which case we will give appropriate directions. <span style="font-weight:bold">Lord Justice McCombe </span></p>
