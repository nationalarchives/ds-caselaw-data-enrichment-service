It all depends on the wording of the contract. In the<span style="font-style:italic"> Jowitt </span>case the phrase “return to work” was not used in the critical paragraph; and clause 5.3 was contrasted with the next clause which dealt with employees who were unable to pursue their pre-accident or preillness job but were capable of alternative work within the organisation. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In the present case the section of the LTDB document which we have to interpret begins by providing that disability income is payable “should you be absent from, and unable to, work due to sickness or injury for a continuous period of 26 weeks or more”. It is common ground between Mr Duggan and Mr Oliver Isaacs for the Claimant that this “trigger” provision comes into effect when the employee has for 26 weeks been absent from, and unable to perform, his previous work: in Mr Visram’s case, his work for ICTS as their International Security Co-ordinator at Heathrow. So in that sentence “work” clearly refers to the specific occupation. It seems to me to follow clearly that “your return to work” in the next sub-paragraph must likewise mean “your return to your previous work” that is, as an International Security Coordinator. That is in any event a natural construction of the phrase “return to work”. If the drafters of the LTDB Plan had wished to say that the benefit would only be payable for so long as the individual was unable to perform any full time remunerative employment it would have been easy enough so to provide.  </p>
