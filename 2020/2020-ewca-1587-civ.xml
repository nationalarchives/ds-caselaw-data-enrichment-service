It also decided that the period of accommodation at Bravington Road was not settled accommodation capable of breaking the causal connection between the earlier intentional homelessness in 2016 and the homelessness that arose in November 2018. A review officer confirmed that decision. The sole issue is whether the respondent’s review officer erred in law in reaching that decision.  </p>

It offered her suitable accommodation in Barking in east London but the appellant declined to accept that accommodation.

On 19 September 2016, she was granted an assured shorthold tenancy by a private landlord of Flat 7 Bravington Road in London (which was in the area of Westminster City Council). The term was for 1 year at a rent of £302.33 a week. The property comprised a single room, with a kitchen area, and containing bunk beds and a mattress. There was a toilet and shower room shared with other residents (there being 10 such flats at the property). The appellant lived there initially with her two younger daughters and was joined by her eldest daughter. Hammersmith and Fulham provided financial assistance to pay the deposit. The rent was paid from housing benefit and discretionary payments made by the local authority. </p>

She explained that she had been living in Seagrove Hostel but had been evicted when she refused alternative accommodation in Barking. She was advised that it was not in her best interests to make an application for assistance under the homelessness legislation because she had refused an offer of suitable accommodation previously. She was also advised that she would not be eligible to register for housing via the housing register as she had not been resident in the respondent’s area for three years. </p>

That agreement was to last until 18 September 2017 with a rent of £302.33 a week. It was again a single room, with a kitchen area, but was larger than Flat 7. There was a toilet and shower room used only by the appellant and her family. The rent was paid, as before, from housing benefit and discretionary payments.

The review officer in her decision accepted that. There is a letter dated 13 February 2017 from the director of the landlord stating that the property had been let on the understanding that the appellant and one daughter only would live there. The letter stated that the appellant and her three daughters now lived there and the property had become severely overcrowded. The letter said either two daughters would have to leave or the premises would have to be vacated. We were told a notice seeking possession was served in June 2017. In any event, the landlord did not seek to recover the property at that stage. The appellant and her three daughters continued to live there. The tenancy continued as a periodic tenancy after the end of the agreed term.  </p>

There are, however, circumstances where but for the applicant’s earlier deliberate act giving rise to the earlier period of homelessness, the applicant would not have become homeless on the current occasion. That appears from the following passages of the judgment of Lord Reed, with whom Baroness Hale and Lord Clarke agreed and with whose reasons Lord Neuberger agreed, in Haile v Waltham Forest LBC  [2015] A.C. 1471: </p>

		<span style="font-size:11pt">“22. As I have explained, the effect of the requirement in section 193(1), and its statutory predecessors, that the authority must not be satisfied that the applicant became homeless intentionally has caused difficulties of interpretation, linked to difficulties in construing the meaning of “homelessness”. The purpose of the requirement is however not difficult to discern. As was explained by Lord Lowry in Din [1983] 1 AC 657 , 679, and as counsel for the appellant emphasised in the present case, it is designed to prevent “queue jumping” by persons who, by intentionally rendering themselves homeless, would (in the absence of such a provision) obtain a priority in the provision of housing to which they would not otherwise be entitled.  </span>

		<span style="font-size:11pt">“23. Consistently with that rationale, it cannot be intended that an applicant is to be disqualified for accommodation if he has ever, at any time in his life, become intentionally homeless. For example, an elderly man who becomes homeless when his care home is closed cannot be intended to be denied assistance merely because, 60 years earlier, he was evicted from his student digs for holding rowdy parties. As counsel for the appellant submitted, the homelessness with which the words “became homeless intentionally” are concerned must be the homelessness which the authority have found to exist: “is homeless” and “became homeless” must refer to the same current state of being homeless. It is therefore in relation to the current state of being homeless that the question has to be answered, did the applicant become homeless intentionally? </span>

		<span style="font-size:11pt">“24. On the other hand, section 193(1) cannot be concerned only with the reason for the loss of accommodation which the applicant occupied immediately before he became homeless. If that were its effect, the legal consequences of becoming homeless intentionally could readily be avoided by obtaining temporary accommodation, so that the applicant ceased for a time to be homeless, and then waiting to be evicted from it, so bringing about a state of homelessness consequent on the involuntary loss of that accommodation. The aim of the provisions relating to intentional homelessness would then be circumvented.  </span>

Section 193(1) must therefore be understood as being concerned with the question whether the applicant's current homelessness has been caused by intentional conduct on his part, in consequence of which he ceased to occupy accommodation which was available for his occupation and which it would have been reasonable for him to continue to occupy: either the accommodation which he was occupying immediately before he became homeless, or previous accommodation. Whether the applicant “became homeless intentionally” thus depends in the first place on the application of the definition of “becoming homeless intentionally” in section 191(1) : in short, on whether he deliberately did or failed to do anything in consequence of which he ceased to occupy accommodation meeting the requirements of that provision. If that question is answered in the affirmative, the further question then arises under section 193(1) whether the applicant's current homelessness was caused by that intentional conduct.”  </span>and  </p>

That has to be determined having regard to all relevant circumstances and bearing in mind the purposes of the legislation. As I have indicated, a later event constituting an involuntary cause of homelessness can be regarded as superseding the applicant's earlier deliberate conduct, where in view of the later event it cannot reasonably be said that, but for the applicant's deliberate conduct, he or she would not have become homeless. Where, however, the deliberate conduct remains a “but for” cause of the homelessness, and the question is whether the chain of causation should nevertheless be regarded as having been interrupted by some other event, the question will be whether the proximate cause of the homelessness is an event which is unconnected to the applicant's own earlier conduct, and in the absence of which homelessness would probably not have occurred.”  </span>

By way of example only, the grant of an assured shorthold tenancy of six months or more, which is currently the prevailing tenure in the private sector, is likely to be settled rather than temporary, accommodation. Other factors, however, such as the expectations of the parties as the outset, may indicate that it was temporary, not settled, accommodation, such as where the parties expressly agreed at the outset that the tenancy would not be renewed as the landlord would wish to sell the property at that time. See Knight v Vale Royal Borough Council [2003] H.L.R. 9 at paragraphs 12 and 24-26. A local authority was also entitled to reach the conclusion that a six month shorthold tenancy was not settled accommodation, in circumstances where the accommodation was overcrowded, was not affordable and the context in which the applicant entered the tenancy was to enable her to re-apply for accommodation from the local authority. On that combination of factors, the local authority was entitled to conclude that the accommodation was not settled: see Mohammed v Westminster City Council [2005] H.L.R. 47, per Wilson J, as he then was at paragraph 20, Rix LJ at paragraphs 22 to 23,  and Tuckey LJ at paragraph 29 who  agreed with the reasons given in both judgments. </p>

The Court held that Mr Doka did not have settled accommodation in circumstances where he was allowed to stay for two years, for payment, at his former employer’s house whilst that person’s son was away at university on the basis that Mr Doka gave up the room when the son came home and would vacate the property when the son completed his studies. The occupation was pursuant to “an intermittent licence under which the prospect of continuation was always uncertain” (per Patten LJ at paragraph 20). Given the facts of that case, the decision reflects the established case law and there is nothing to suggest that the decision itself is wrong.  </p>

That approach is consistent with the existing case law of the Supreme Court and of this Court. The ultimate question is whether the causal link between the earlier and the later periods of homelessness has been broken. One situation where that may occur is where there has been a period of settled, or non-temporary accommodation after the earlier homelessness. Whether that is the case is a question of fact and degree to be determined having regard to all the facts of the case and bearing in mind the legislative purpose. The reference in the second part of the sentence to whether the applicant’s position was more precarious than it was previously is a description of the consequences on the facts of that case of applying the established approach. I do not read the judgment as requiring the court to carry out some kind of comparison of the precariousness of the earlier and the later accommodation in order to determine if the causal connection between the two has been broken. That does not form part of the ratio of the decision. Both parties submit, and I agree, that the observations of the Supreme Court were directed at that part of the judgment. In the circumstances, as that element of the reasoning does not form part of the ratio, it is not binding. It is not necessary to consider what the status of the observations would be if they were part of the ratio of the decision. </p>

Rather, the reviewing officer looked at one factor only, namely the overcrowding, and decided that the accommodation was not settled because the overcrowding made it unsuitable for occupation. Ms Davies submitted that the review officer did not have regard to a number of other factors such as the tenancy, the length of occupation, the fact that a deposit had been paid, that the accommodation was affordable and that it was a commercial relationship not a case of staying temporarily with friends or family. Further, while overcrowding was a relevant factor if it indicated the accommodation was only temporary, it would not necessarily indicate that. Here the review officer accepted that the landlord and the appellant knew and agreed at the outset that the accommodation would be overcrowded. That fact did not prevent them entering a tenancy agreement for a year with the tenancy continuing as a periodic tenancy thereafter. In any event, the landlord clearly knew about, and acquiesced, in the flat being used for the appellant and the three daughters from February 2017 and did not take steps to issue for a further year. In either of those scenarios, the fact that the accommodation was overcrowded was not inconsistent with it being settled, or non-temporary, accommodation. </p>

The review officer was entitled to focus on the overcrowding in the present case as that was the critical factor in deciding whether the accommodation was settled. The review officer would have been aware that the property was let on an assured shorthold tenancy and was aware and referred to the period of time for which the accommodation was in fact occupied by the appellant. The review officer was entitled, nonetheless, to regard the overcrowding as the critical factor here. The flat was a studio flat, or one room, in which four people (two adults and two teenagers) were living. It was inevitable, given the overcrowding, that the appellant would have been evicted and the arrangement was doomed from the start. Consequently, Mr Peacock submitted, the review officer was entitled to conclude the accommodation was temporary, not settled, and did not break the causal connection with the earlier intentional homelessness. </p>

The review officer does not refer to the nature or length of the tenancy of 9 Bravington Road or the circumstances in which the tenancy was granted. There is no reference to the fact that it was a commercial relationship or that a tenancy agreement of just under a year was entered into after it was made clear to the appellant that she would not be eligible for assistance from the authority (and not as a means of enabling her to apply for assistance from the local authority).

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Secondly, it is not enough simply to identify a potentially relevant factor. It is necessary to identify how that factor is relevant to the question of whether the accommodation is settled or temporary. In the present case, there is no real analysis either of the relevance of the overcrowding on the facts of this case or its relationship with the other factors. On the facts as accepted by the review officer, the landlord, the previous local authority (Hammersmith and Fulham), and the tenant all knew at the outset that the flat would be occupied by four people when the appellant moved in: see paragraph 13 of the decision letter. Hammersmith and Fulham provided a deposit. The rent was paid for out of housing benefit and discretionary payments made by the local authority. I do not accept that in those circumstances, the arrangement was doomed to fail or that the landlord would inevitably have sought to recover possession. It may well be that the accommodation, unsuitable though it was, was the best that the appellant could find for herself and her family, given their limited financial resources and the shortage of accommodation in London. The overcrowding in the flat would not necessarily mean that the accommodation would be temporary. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Thirdly, the review officer does not relate the overcrowding to the other factors to assess whether those other factors mean that, taken overall, the accommodation could properly be seen as temporary or not settled. In paragraph 14, the review officer acknowledges that the appellant spent two years in the property but did not consider that that made the accommodation any more settled. No explanation for that view is given. The review officer says that she cannot have regard to the length of occupation alone but must look at all the facts of her case. That is correct – but she does not, however, refer to any other facts (other than the overcrowding previously referred to). The review officer states that she is aware that it is possible to occupy insecure, unreasonable or temporary accommodation for an extended period of time. That may be correct but does not provide an analysis, or explanation, of why the accommodation in this case was temporary rather than settled. Nor does the review officer consider all the relevant facts, including the tenancy, the length of occupation, the commercial nature of the relationship, and the basis upon which the property was let (i.e. that it was known that all four family members would be living there or, at the very least, that was known from February 2017).  </p>
