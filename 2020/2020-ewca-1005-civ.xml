The first case (<span style="font-style:italic">R. (on the application of Christopher Packham) v Secretary of State for Transport</span> [2020] EWCA Civ 1004) amounted to a full-scale challenge to the scheme itself, and to the decision of the Cabinet to approve it. The present appeal arises within a far narrower compass and concerns the respective duties and obligations imposed by Parliament upon High Speed Two (HS2) Limited (“<span style="font-style:italic">HS2 Ltd</span>”) and local authorities in relation to the actual implementation of HS2 as it affects localised planning concerns. In neither case is the Court engaged with the political debate that surrounds the HS2 project; the task of the Court in both cases is to rule upon points of law.  </p>

It is within the Colne Valley Archaeological Protection Zone (“<span style="font-style:italic">APZ</span>”). Part of it is within the Mid-Colne Valley Site of Importance for Nature Conservation (Metropolitan Grade). The proposed earthworks would provide a mitigation pond, a reptile basking bank and two hibernacula for a community of great crested newts whose present habitat would be affected by the Colne Valley Viaduct South Embankment Works. The new habitat would be enclosed by a permanent fence. The Decision, upheld in the Judgment, concerns the impact of the development upon both ecological and archaeological interests. The appeal, however, concerns only the impact of the development on archaeological interests and we confine our description of the facts accordingly.</p>

The Act, which received the Royal Assent on 23 February 2017, authorises Phase One of HS2, comprising a high-speed railway between London and the West Midlands.

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.30in;margin-right:0.00in">The dispute relates to the failure on the part of HS2 Ltd to submit any information or evidence, as part of its formal request for approval, to the Appellant which would enable it to conduct what it says are its statutory duties to evaluate the plans and specifications for their impact upon relevant planning interests – here potential archaeological remains. The nub of the reasoning of the Council Decision, refusing approval to the request, was that HS2 Ltd had failed to furnish the Council with adequate information and evidence. HS2 Ltd however has argued throughout that it is under no obligation to furnish such information and evidence. It says that this is because it will, in due course, conduct relevant investigations <span style="font-style:italic">itself</span> into the potential impact of the development upon any archaeological remains and take all necessary mitigation and modification steps. HS2 Ltd says that it will do this under a guidance document which forms part of its contract with the Secretary of State for Transport which sets out its obligations as the nominated undertaker for the HS2 Project.

The key to this case lies in a careful reading of Schedule 17 and the powers and obligations it imposes upon local authorities and upon HS2 Ltd. In our judgment, the duty to perform an assessment of impact, and possible mitigation and modification measures under Schedule 17, has been imposed by Parliament squarely and exclusively upon the local authority. It cannot be circumvented by the contractor taking it upon itself to conduct some non-statutory investigation into impact. We also conclude that the authority is under no duty to process a request for approval from HS2 Ltd unless it is accompanied by evidence and information adequate and sufficient to enable the authority to perform its statutory duty.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.30in;margin-right:0.00in">The context to this judgment is, however, important. A central tenet of Schedule 17, the surrounding Statutory Guidance and the other relevant guidance, planning materials and memoranda, is that authorities and HS2 Ltd should work in a proportionate, effective and collaborative way which balances important local interests with the much broader national interest in the delivery of the HS2 project, which Government and Parliament has approved. The object of this cooperation is to prevent the planning process creating an undue hindrance to the delivery of that broader national interest whilst giving proper weight to local concerns. We are clear that our judgment is consistent with that important aim.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.30in;margin-right:0.00in">On the facts of this case, for whatever reason, the system did not work as it should have: HS2 Ltd did not submit the information necessary for the local authority to perform its statutory duty to evaluate the proposed building works for their potential impact upon relevant planning interests. The reasons for this were said to be due to a temporary inability on the part of HS2 Ltd experts to gain access to the site for the purpose of conducting investigations. But that was some two years back and during the appeal we were given no information as to the present position. Schedule 17, the Statutory Guidance and the EMRs, however, set out what should occur when there are delays in the submission of evidence. They include the holding of fruitful discussions to determine the best way in which the relevant information can be provided and, if needs be, extending the time for completion of the approval process.   </p>

The IP was well aware of the position at this Site and could have chosen to postpone if it thought it appropriate to do so. The Defendants considered that the IP was best placed to oversee the programme of applications (DL41). It would have been a misuse of the Claimant’s powers under paragraph 3(6) of schedule 17 to withhold approval because it believed that the application was premature, as this is not a permissible ground for refusal.” </p>

We start by considering the scope and effect of the powers and obligations imposed upon authorities by Schedule 17 and the implications of this for the right of authorities to decline to determine approvals absent adequate information. We then turn to consider the duty on HS2 Ltd to furnish the authority with sufficient information and whether documents such as the Statutory Guidance and the EMRs can serve to oust or modify the allocation of powers and duties set out in Schedule 17. We finally turn to a particular issue which arose during the hearing relating to the jurisdiction to make conditional approvals. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.30in;margin-right:0.00in">In our judgment, Schedule 17 operates upon the clear premise that an authority is under a duty to perform an evaluation of the impact of submitted plans and specifications on the identified planning interests. The Schedule reflects a deliberate decision by Parliament in the apportionment of democratic responsibility and accountability so that decisions on matters of local concern are determined by local planning authorities who are accountable to their council tax payers. There is no basis in the Schedule for the duty that is imposed upon an authority to be delegated or sub-contracted to any third party, including of course HS2 Ltd, or for that duty to be abrogated by any other instrument (save for primary legislation) and in particular non-legislative guidance material. Nothing in the Statutory Guidance or the EMRs can, in law, oust the statutory duty or in any way modify or limit it; and indeed nothing in those instruments even purports so to do (see paragraphs [33] and [43] above). At their highest, they contain matters which, in the performance of its statutory duty an authority should take into account.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.30in;margin-right:0.00in">With respect, in our judgment, both the Judge and the Secretaries of State erred in concluding that the references in the Statutory Guidance which urged planning authorities to avoid modifying or replicating “<span style="font-style:italic">controls already in place</span>” (see paragraph [36] above) served to limit the power and duties of an authority. Such Guidance simply cannot in law have the effect of stripping from an authority the powers and duties it has imposed upon it under statute in relation to “<span style="font-style:italic">control</span>”. If the Guidance is, fairly read, to be construed otherwise then, as the Guidance itself expressly acknowledges the Act, including Schedule 17, take precedence. The same inevitably goes for the EMRs. </p>

It is also evident from the statutory scheme (see paragraph [21] above) that, since HS2 Ltd cannot proceed to carry out works without an approval, it has a concomitant duty to furnish an authority with such evidence and information as is necessary and adequate to enable the authority to perform its allotted statutory task. If, for some reason, HS2 Ltd does not do this then the correct approach is not to refuse the request for approval (as occurred in this case) but instead to decline to process the request until such time as adequate evidence and information has been furnished. The eight-week period for consulting and then deciding upon the request will not start to run until adequate information has been provided.  </p>

The grounds upon which an application can be refused are specified in paragraph 3(6) and they are limited (see paragraphs [24] and [25] above). The Judge concluded that the scope of the exercise of discretion by the authority was highly constrained and limited and essentially endorsed the submission of HS2 Ltd that because of the Statutory Guidance the authority had “<span style="font-style:italic">no meaningful control</span>” (see Judgment paragraph 77 cited at paragraph [65] above).

The Table identifies the specified grounds but each such ground has its own proper scope and it remains the duty of the authority to address these particular grounds fully and objectively, taking into account the information and evidence relevant to the evaluation that Parliament has said must be undertaken. Put another way – within the bounds of paragraph 3(6) the authority must address relevant considerations, ignore irrelevant considerations, and must perform its evaluation fairly and objectively on the basis of evidence. It has, in this exercise, a certain margin of discretion or judgment, albeit one circumscribed by the limited specified grounds for refusal. We have set out in broad terms the sorts of matters that any authority would have to consider under paragraph 3(6) at paragraph [26] above; and we have recorded the view of the Appellant on the evidence actually considered necessary in relation to the site in question at paragraph [46] above. </p>

It is not, in fact, argued by the Secretaries of State or by HS2 Ltd that the actual decision on approval or rejection can be taken by anyone other than the authority; their argument is that the decision of the authority simply has no evaluative content to it. In our view, this cannot be correct given that under paragraph 3(6) the decision on refusal must be on specified grounds only, which indicates that the authority must have addressed itself to those very grounds which, plainly, refer to matters of fact and evidence. The same goes for a decision by an authority to impose conditions on an approval under paragraph 3(7) which can only be exercised “<span style="font-style:italic">on a ground specified in the table</span>”, which again presupposes that the authority will evaluate the evidence and facts relevant to the matters in the Table.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.30in;margin-right:0.00in">In the Decision, however, at the same time as they concluded that HS2 Ltd was not obliged to provide evidence to the authority, the Secretaries of State also concluded that when an authority refuses a request for approval it is required to address itself to the specified grounds in paragraph 3(6) (Decision paragraph 29) and that a failure to provide fully evidence-based reasoning was wrong in law and principle. The logic of the Decision is that in a refusal decision authorities <span style="text-decoration:underline">must</span> address whether the proposed works ought to be, or could reasonably be, constructed in some other way to preserve the site; or that the development ought to be and could reasonably be carried out elsewhere. The Secretaries of State criticise the Appellant for failing to provide “<span style="font-style:italic">explanations</span>” or “<span style="font-style:italic">evidence</span>” to “<span style="font-style:italic">substantiate</span>” its conclusions on these matters (Decision paragraph 28) and they say that the burden of proof lay with the Council “<span style="font-style:italic">to demonstrate</span>” that the design or appearance of the proposed works should reasonably be altered (Decision paragraph 30). It was, accordingly, a premise of the Decision that authorities <span style="text-decoration:underline">were</span> required to consider fully the evidence. Yet simultaneously with criticising the Council for demanding the evidence it needed to provide the reasons and explanations, the Secretaries of State: (i) condoned the refusal of HS2 Ltd to provide that self-same information; and (ii) did not challenge the conclusion of the Appellant, of Historic England and the Inspector, that HS2 Ltd had not provided evidence relevant and adequate to the task. Nowhere do the Secretaries of State explain <span style="font-style:italic">how</span> any local authority could address the evidential matters that HS2 Ltd and the Secretaries of State demand <span style="font-style:italic">should</span> be addressed in a refusal decision, without evidence.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.30in;margin-right:0.00in">The reference in the Statutory Guidance to an authority not replicating or modifying “<span style="font-style:italic">controls</span>” set out in the EMRs, relied upon in the Decision, does not alter the analysis. There are many reasons for this. First, nothing in the Statutory Guidance or the EMRs is capable in law of altering the system of statutory “<span style="font-style:italic">control</span>” set out in Schedule 17. Secondly, as the Statutory Guidance and EMRs themselves make clear, they are, at best, matters for authorities to take into account but they do not bind authorities. Thirdly, nothing in the EMRs indicate that HS2 Ltd can decline to furnish the authority with the relevant and necessary information in order for the authority to perform its statutory duty; but, to the contrary, the thrust of the EMRs is to set in place a system whereby HS2 Ltd and authorities cooperate to avoid just a problem as has arisen in the present case. Whilst ultimately it is for the authority to determine what information it needs (and it has a relevant margin of discretion in this regard), nonetheless the duty of mutual cooperation encompasses liaison over the nature and depth of information and evidence that the authority needs to make its assessment. Fourthly, the reference in the Statutory Guidance to the need to avoid replication and modification of control must be seen in this light and cannot amount to a reference that the entire system of statutory “<span style="font-style:italic">control</span>” set out in the Act is to be stripped from the authority simply because HS2 Ltd declines to submit relevant evidence and promises to perform the evaluation itself in accordance with somewhat loose contractual obligations in its agreement with the Secretary of State.  And the same goes for the Secretary of State who has defined roles under Schedule 17 (concerning appeals and in some cases a power to call in the initial decision) but who cannot, through the secondary instruments of a contract with HS2 Ltd and a power to extract undertakings, create a new system of non-statutory “<span style="font-style:italic">control</span>” differing from that which Parliament has mandated.  </p>

Mr Mould QC, for the Respondents, was correct to accept that the counterfactual was not arguable, viz. that HS2 Ltd had a right to submit inadequate information. We are in no doubt that the scheme contemplated by Schedule 17 – characterised as it is by duties of mutual cooperation on the parts of HS2 Ltd and the authority – must be construed to imply a duty of adequacy. We do not see how the system, which Parliament has carefully designed, can work absent HS2 Ltd being under an obligation to enable the authority to perform its task. We agree with the Judge on this point that the duty on HS2 Ltd to furnish information is commensurate with the task the authority must perform (see paragraph [64] above). Since we consider that the authority must perform the evaluative assessment implicit in paragraph 3(6) it follows that HS2 Ltd must provide information necessary to enable that duty to be performed. We also take the view that the Statutory Guidance and the EMRs, properly read, operate upon this premise. It is important to note the common ground in this case that HS2 Ltd did not provide such information and evidence. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.30in;margin-right:0.00in">What if HS2 Ltd does not furnish adequate information? Paragraph 16 provides that the authority need not “<span style="font-style:italic">consider a request</span>” “<span style="font-style:italic">unless</span>” HS2 Ltd has deposited a document setting out the proposed programme and the request is accompanied by a document explaining how the matter to which the request relates fits into the overall scheme of the works authorised by the Act (see paragraph [22] above). We have also set out above (see paragraphs [21]-[23]) that HS2 Ltd has a discretion as to the point in time at which it submits a request for approval and that the eight-week period for the evaluation starts to run from receipt by the authority of the request. The situation that arose in this case is the very antithesis of what should have occurred. Here HS2 Ltd submitted its request for approval prematurely and then used that prematurity to argue that it was under no obligation to furnish the necessary evidence. The scheme set up under Schedule 17 contemplates that a request will be submitted only when it contains adequate information. There may always be some leeway and room for debate as to what is adequate and under the cooperative procedure which has been instituted there will often be scope for discussion between HS2 Ltd and the authority as to what is required, but that does not alter the underlying point which is that the request <span style="font-style:italic">as deposited” </span>should be </p>

In the present case, the statutory consultee complained (see paragraph [48] above) that absent HS2 Ltd submitting relevant evidence it was unable to make representations. In our judgment, Parliament did not intend to create a hollow consultation process but, on the contrary, assumed that the consultee would be able to make fully informed representations which, under the scheme of Schedule 17, would address in a meaningful way the exercise that the authority was in due course (being in receipt of the representations) to perform under paragraph 3(6). The fact that Parliament included a consultation mechanism in Schedule 17 supports our conclusion that HS2 Ltd is required to provide information and evidence which is adequate to enable the authority to consult and, once properly informed, conduct the paragraph 3(6) evaluation. There would have been no point in including such a consultation process otherwise.

Our conclusion on the construction to be placed upon Schedule 17 is supported by the Parliamentary purpose behind the Act and Schedule 17 which, in our view, is clear. We have made reference to this in paragraph [68] above. Parliament was prepared to grant deemed planning approval to the overall HS2 scheme, given its importance to the public interest. But it was recognised at the time that implementation could have multiple potential impacts at the local level along the proposed route which were unforeseeable (and hence could not be resolved) at the point of Royal Assent. A balance thus had to be struck: as the HS2 project unfolded, the nominated undertaker – HS2 Ltd – would submit requests for approval to the relevant authorities who would have a relatively constrained power of rejection. Local authorities would also be encouraged to participate in a scheme (the qualifying authority undertakings scheme) whereby the planning approval process was expedited, and this would be achieved by close and mutual cooperation between the nominated undertaker and the authority. As we have emphasised, this scheme balances the important public interest in the timely execution of a major infrastructure project of national importance with the democratic need to ensure that local environmental and planning concerns and interests are protected.   </p>

It was argued that as a document the EMRs did not therefore modify or replicate the “<span style="font-style:italic">control</span>” allocated to the authority. We were taken through the relevant document to demonstrate the point. It is unnecessary to go into detail. We see the force in this argument but it follows from our analysis above that, even if the EMRs had modified or fully replicated the control systems under Schedule 17 (which it does not), that could still not serve to oust the statutory duty of control imposed by the Act upon the authority to conduct the impact evaluation.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.30in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Howell Williams QC also pointed out in relation to control that the EMRs had no inbuilt system of formal enforcement whereas there was such a system under the Act and Schedule 17 so that, come what may, the EMRs did not replicate or modify key enforcement controls. Again, we see the force in this. Under section 20 of the Act, planning permission is deemed to have been granted under Part 3 TCPA 1990. Section 336 TCPA 1990 defines planning permission as “<span style="font-style:italic">permission under Part III</span>.” Under section 171A, a mechanism of enforcement of planning control is provided for where, for example, development is carried out without planning permission, or where there is permission in place, but there has been a failure to comply with any condition or limitation subject to which permission was granted. Section 172(1) provides that an enforcement notice may be issued by a local planning authority “<span style="font-style:italic">where it appears to them … that there has been a breach of planning control</span>” and it is “<span style="font-style:italic">expedient</span>” to issue the notice. Section 187A provides a mechanism for the enforcement of conditions subject to which planning permission has been granted. It follows from the operation of section 20 of the Act that these provisions of the TCPA 1990 relating to enforcement action are effective in respect of deemed planning permission granted by section 20 of the Act, and a breach of condition subject to which planning permission is deemed to have been granted by section 20 of the Act may be enforced against under the provisions of the TCPA 1990. On the basis of the logic of the Decision, the authority must approve a request absent any evaluation of any matter which might be made the subject of a condition which could later be enforced. In contrast, the complete absence of any conditions (see paragraph [63] above) in the Decision is a reflection of how the </p>

If it is irrational to grant planning permission subject to a condition which has no reasonable prospects of being implemented then it must be no less irrational to refuse planning permission on the ground that a desirable condition has no reasonable prospects of implementation and therefore cannot be imposed. In truth, neither course is irrational. What is appropriate depends on the circumstances and is to be determined in the exercise of the discretion of the planning authority. But the mere fact that a desirable condition appears to have no reasonable prospects of fulfilment does not mean that planning permission must necessarily be refused. Something more is required before that can be the correct result.”  </p>

The purpose of this is to allow the nominated undertaker and the planning authority the opportunity to agree whether the condition is necessary and appropriate, and would not unreasonably impede the building and operation of the railway, prior to the planning authority issuing its decision. It also avoids the potential for delay that would result from decisions being issued with inappropriate conditions. In the event that the nominated undertaker and the planning authority cannot agree on the inclusion of a condition, the planning authority may choose to refuse the request for approval. </p>
