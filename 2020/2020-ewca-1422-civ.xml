	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">This appeal concerns the validity of a landlord’s notice served under the Housing Act 1988 (<span style="font-weight:bold">“the 1988 Act”</span>) in respect of an assured shorthold tenancy.  Where a landlord wishes to take proceedings for possession, s. 8 of the 1988 Act requires him or her to serve a notice in a prescribed form (a <span style="font-weight:bold">“s. 8 notice”</span>) before doing so.  The particular question raised by the appeal is whether the s. 8 notice has to contain the landlord’s own name and address, as opposed to the name and address of the landlord’s agent, either in every case, or at any rate if the landlord wishes to rely on arrears of rent as a ground for possession.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The appeal is brought by the tenant, Ms Cynthia Prempeh, against the Order of HHJ Lethem sitting in the County Court at Central London dated 16 December 2019.  By his Order HHJ Lethem allowed an appeal on a number of grounds against the Order of Deputy District Judge Goodman dated 25 July 2019 in which she had ordered possession in favour of Mrs Ferakh Lakhany, the present respondent.  HHJ Lethem did not however accept the argument for Ms Prempeh that the landlord’s s. 8 notice in this case was invalid and of no effect because of the failure to give Mrs Lakhany’s name and address.  The submission advanced on appeal to this Court by Mr Toby Vanhegan, who appeared with Mr Robert Brown for Ms Prempeh, is that he should have accepted that argument.  Permission to appeal was granted by Arnold LJ on 4 May 2020. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeal and hold that the s. 8 notice served on behalf of Mrs Lakhany was valid and effective, or to be more precise, that it is not invalidated by the failure to give her own name and address: as explained below, there is in fact an unresolved question whether Mrs Lakhany is or is not Ms Prempeh’s landlord.  As Mr Vanhegan pointed out, if Mrs Lakhany is not her landlord, the s. 8 notice would no doubt be invalid, but that is likely to be of no significance as in that case the entire claim will fail in any event as she will have no standing to seek either possession or any other relief.   </p>

Ms Prempeh’s case is that it has, and she has produced a copy of a further tenancy agreement dated 17 December 2017 (<span style="font-weight:bold">“the 2017 tenancy agreement”</span>).  This again is expressed to create an assured shorthold tenancy of the flat at a rent of £1500 per month but with a number of differences.  These included the following: first, it let the flat to Ms Prempeh alone, Ms Appiah-Baker having (according to Ms Prempeh) left the flat; second, the term </p>

Mrs Lakhany’s case is that no such 2017 tenancy agreement was ever entered into, and that Ms Prempeh simply continued to occupy the flat under the 2016 tenancy agreement.  This dispute has not yet been resolved and is not a matter for us: it is a matter that will fall to be determined at trial.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It appears that the rent was duly paid down to the end of 2017 or so, but thereafter the rent fell into arrears.  By October 2018 these amounted to over £11,000.  From October 2018 to April 2019 regular payments amounting to £1500 per month were made, but these did nothing to reduce the arrears.  On 23 April 2019 Mrs Lakhany’s solicitors, Philip Ross Solicitors, served a s. 8 notice addressed to Ms Appiah-Baker and Ms Prempeh at the flat.  I will have to give more details of the notice in due course but in summary it was a notice warning the tenant that the landlord intended to apply to court for an order for possession on Grounds 8, 10 and 11 in Schedule 2 to the 1988 Act (all of which concern default in paying rent), giving details of the arrears of rent (amounting to £11,238.44 as at 18 April 2019) and stating that proceedings would not be brought until after 10 May 2019.  It was signed by Philip Ross Solicitors as the landlord’s agent and it gave their name, address and telephone number.  Nowhere in the s. 8 notice did it refer to Mrs Lakhany by name or give her address; Philip Ross’s covering letter did say that they acted for “your Landlord, Mrs F Lakhany”, but that did not give her address either.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The first hearing of the claim took place on 25 July 2019 before DDJ Goodman sitting in the County Court at Barnet.  This was a short hearing at the end of the day in the undefended possession list.   The defendants were represented by the duty solicitor Mr Smith.  He took three points.  One was that the tenancy agreement in force was the 2017 tenancy agreement and hence that the wrong party had brought the claim.  The second was that the s. 8 notice was invalid as it was a “demand for rent” within the meaning of s. 47 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1987 (<span style="font-weight:bold">“the 1987 Act”</span>) and hence had to have the name and address of the landlord herself, not just that of her agent.  The third was that Ms Prempeh had a claim against Mrs Lakhany in respect of the deposit which it was alleged had not been dealt with as it should have been under the Housing Act 2004; Mr Smith accepted that the maximum amount of such a claim would be £6,000, and that there were rent arrears of £11,173.54, and so accepted that this would not amount to a complete defence (either to the money claim or to the claim for possession), but it would still amount to a partial defence to the money claim. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Ms Prempeh appealed.  There were 6 grounds of appeal, but they effectively amounted to three points.  Grounds 1, 4, 5 and 6 challenged DDJ Goodman’s decision that the relevant tenancy agreement in force was the 2016 tenancy agreement, largely on the basis that various aspects of the hearing were unfair to Ms Prempeh although Ground 4 also criticised her reasoning.  Ground 2 raised the point about the s. 8 notice being invalid because it was a demand for rent within the meaning of s. 47 of the 1987 Act and did not give Mrs Lakhany’s name and address.  Ground 3 was that the claim in respect of the deposit raised an arguable case of set-off and directions should have been given for its trial before the money judgment was entered. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The appeal was heard by HHJ Lethem sitting in the County Court at Central London on 10 December 2019.  He gave judgment on 16 December 2019.  In a careful and thorough judgment he first discussed the question whether the s. 8 notice was a demand for rent (Ground 2).  He was invited to follow the decision of HHJ Saunders, also sitting in the County Court at Central London, in <span style="font-style:italic">CY Property Management Ltd v Babalola</span> (25 Jan 2019) in which HHJ Saunders had been persuaded by Mr Brown to hold that a s. 8 notice was a demand for rent, but HHJ Lethem, recognising that that judgment was persuasive but not binding, declined to follow it, and concluded that the s. 8 notice was not a demand for rent (at [48]).  He then considered the hearing before DDJ Goodman, and although expressing considerable sympathy for her, concluded that her decision could not stand and did not represent a fair trial (at [72]).  He therefore allowed the appeal on Grounds 1, 5 and 6.  He did not need to consider Ground 4.  He then dealt with the claim in relation to the deposit (Ground 3) and concluded that it was wrong in principle that that claim should be dealt with separately as it amounted (if valid) to a set-off and hence a partial defence (at [76]). </p>

Although he directed that it be heard on the first open date after 10 February 2020, we were told that the trial has not yet in fact taken place, being initially listed in May and then adjourned due to the Coronavirus restrictions on possession claims.  It is now expected to be heard some time next year. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">We are not concerned on this appeal with either the fairness of the trial before DDJ Goodman or the set-off point.  We are only concerned with whether the s. 8 notice was invalidated because it was signed by Philip Ross and gave their name and address, but did not give Mrs Lakhany’s name and address.   The substance of HHJ Lethem’s Order remitting the matter for a new trial will therefore stand whatever the outcome of the appeal.  But it was not suggested that the appeal infringed the wellknown principle that appeals only lie against orders not the reasons for them, and in my view rightly so.  What Mr Vanhegan seeks if he succeeds in the appeal is to replace HHJ Lethem’s Order (allowing the appeal against DDJ Goodman’s Order on Grounds 1, 3, 5 and 6) with an Order allowing that appeal on Grounds 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6.  That may seem a slight difference but it would radically alter the shape of the trial: as explained below, it would prevent Mrs Lakhany from relying on Ground 8 in her s. 8 notice, which is the only mandatory ground for possession, and confine her to Grounds 10 and 11, which are discretionary grounds, and it would also require her to persuade the trial judge that it was just and equitable to dispense with the requirement </p>

Ground 1 is the same point as was unsuccessfully advanced before DDJ Goodman and HHJ Lethem, namely that Mrs Lakhany’s s. 8 notice is a demand for rent within the meaning of s. 47 of the 1987 Act; it therefore had to give the landlord’s (own) name and address; and having failed to do so, it was invalid. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Ground 2 is that the failure to include Mrs Lakhany’s own name and address in the s. 8 notice meant that the notice was not in the prescribed form required by s. 8 and regulations made under it, and hence again was invalid.  This was a point in fact left open by HHJ Lethem, but it is clearly appropriate for us to deal with it and it has been fully argued. </p>

The version of Form 3 relevant to the present case is that substituted by the Assured Tenancies and Agricultural Occupancies (Forms) (England) (Amendment) Regulations 2016 (SI 2016/443).

It is noticeable that if it is, it has the curious result that certain s. 8 notices are subject to the requirements of s. 47(1), but others are not.  There are many grounds in Schedule 2 to the 1988 Act which have nothing to do with the non-payment of rent, and so on any view, as Mr Vanhegan accepted, notices relying on such grounds alone cannot be said to be demands for rent.  That suggests that if Mr Vanhegan is right that the 1987 Act does apply to those s. 8 notices that do rely on non-payment of rent, this is unlikely to be a consequence deliberately intended by Parliament.  What is now the 1988 Act replaces similar provisions dating back to the Housing Act 1980 which means that the requirement for notices to be given in a prescribed form before taking proceedings for possession pre-dates the 1987 Act.  If Parliament had intended when enacting the 1987 Act to apply s. 47 to such notices, one would expect Parliament to have extended the provisions of s. 47 expressly to such notices, and to all of them, not just those that happened to rely on non-payment of rent.  That does not mean that Mr Vanhegan is wrong, but merely that if he is right, the requirement for the landlord’s name and address to be included on certain s. 8 notices (but not others) has been brought in by a sidewind.    </p>

The effect of s. 1(1) of the 1919 Act is that every document containing “a demand for rent or receipt for rent” which includes any sum for rates paid by the owner instead of the occupier has to state the amount of such rates.  s. 2 of the 1919 Act provides: </p>

We are left with the undefined term “demand for rent”.  “Demand” is an ordinary English word, not one with a technical legal meaning, and on general principles should be given its ordinary meaning.  Mr Vanhegan referred us to <span style="font-style:italic">Borealis AB v Stargas Ltd</span> [2001] UKHL 17 at [33] per Lord Hobhouse where he said that a demand might be an invitation or request or perhaps even implied from making arrangements, or it might mean something more formal.  I accept that “demand” like most words can have a range of meanings, although I myself would have thought that while a politely worded request to pay (“Please pay me the rent you owe me”) might well be a demand, a mere invitation seems quite a long way from the core concept of a demand.  It is noticeable that in the particular context (which was the meaning of “demands delivery” in s. 3(1)(a) of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992) Lord Hobhouse concluded that what was required was a formal demand asserting a contractual right; and also that at </p>

On its face the s. 8 notice here does not say anything about requiring payment.  Nor indeed did Mr Vanhegan suggest that it did.  His submission was that although there was no express request to pay, there was an implicit request, backed by the threat of proceedings which might lead to eviction of the tenant from her home, a money judgment and costs. </p>

That is how it is described in s. 8(3) of the 1988 Act where it is referred to as a notice in the prescribed form <span style="font-style:italic">informing </span>the tenant of various things.  There are four matters referred to in s. 8(3) which the notice has to inform the tenant of.  The first is that the landlord intends to take proceedings for possession; the second is the ground or grounds on which the landlord will rely (both in s. 8(3)(a)).  The third is the earliest date on when proceedings might be brought (s. 8(3)(b)).  The fourth is the date when the notice will lapse if no proceedings are brought (s. 8(3)(c)).   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">This is easiest to see in the case of Ground 11.  As appears above (paragraph 18), this does not require there to be any arrears at all at the date that proceedings are begun; all it requires is that the tenant has persistently defaulted in paying rent.  Two consequences follow.  First, it would seem that there is no requirement that there be any arrears outstanding at the date of the service of the s. 8 notice either.  This is the view taken in <span style="font-style:italic">Woodfall on Landlord and Tenant </span>(at §24.064 fn 3) and seems to me probably right, although it is not necessary to reach any conclusion on the point.  If it is right that a s. 8 notice relying on Ground 11 can be served where there are no arrears at the date of notice, it could not be said to be a demand for rent, as there would be nothing outstanding for the tenant to pay.  But it would seem distinctly odd if such a notice were outside s. 47 of the 1987 Act and yet a very similar notice, also relying on Ground 11 and a similar history of default, were to be within s. 47 simply because there was some amount, possibly very small and possibly only a matter of days late, outstanding at the date of the notice.  Second, and more significantly, whether or not the view taken in <span style="font-style:italic">Woodfall </span>is right, what is entirely clear is that a tenant cannot prevent a landlord from proceeding to issue proceedings based on Ground 11 even if all arrears are cleared before the landlord does so.   So in such a case the notice cannot be read as conveying the implicit message “Pay me the arrears or else I will take you to court”; the message actually conveyed is “You have persistently defaulted in paying rent and I am going to take you to court”.  That cannot in my view be equated with an implicit request or demand to pay anything. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">A similar point arises under Ground 8.  Here what the landlord needs to establish is that there are arrears of the requisite amount (2 months’ rent in a case like the present where rent is payable monthly) at two particular points in time, namely at the date of service of the notice and at the date of the hearing (see paragraph 18 above).  But Mr Jones submitted, and I agree, that they need not be the same arrears on the two occasions.  Indeed very often they will not be.  Take a case where rent of £1500 is payable on the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> of each month and where the tenant misses two payments (say January and February) but thereafter resumes paying £1500 per month from March onwards.  This is probably not an uncommon situation – indeed in the present case Ms Prempeh was paying her current rent in full when the notice was issued but not paying anything towards the arrears.  The landlord can in such a case serve a s. 8 notice on 2 February relying on the January and February payments having been missed as at that stage 2 months’ rent is unpaid; if he does so and issues proceedings in March and there is a hearing in May, the rent will still be £3000 in arrear and the landlord will therefore establish that at that date as well 2 months’ rent is unpaid.  But although there will be £3000 arrears at both dates, they will usually technically not be the same arrears, as in a running account such as a rent account payments will usually be taken to discharge the oldest debts first.  That means that by the time of the hearing in May, the March and April payments will have discharged the January and February arrears.  None of this however prevents the landlord from establishing Ground 8 and therefore a mandatory ground for possession. </p>

Suppose that the tenant pays the £3000 arrears on 3 February, but thereafter misses the March and April payments.  The landlord can still take proceedings and make out the Ground 8 claim in May based on (i) the January and February payments being outstanding at the date of service of the notice and (ii) the March and April payments being outstanding at the date of the hearing.

The only accurate message that it conveys is “I am intending to take you to court; if you are still 2 months in arrears at the date of the hearing, I will ask for (and expect to obtain) possession.”  That no doubt gives the tenant an opportunity to avoid judgment for possession if they are in a position to ensure that there are by the time of the hearing no, or insufficient, arrears outstanding.  But I still do not regard it as appropriate to describe the s. 8 notice as requiring payment, and in my judgment it is not a “demand for rent” within the meaning of s. 47 of the 1987 Act.   </p>

It is, as I have said, accepted that in such a case the notice would not have complied with the requirement in s. 47(1) that it contain the name and address of the landlord, but it is unclear what the consequence of such non-compliance would be.  It is an oddity of s. 47 that it undoubtedly applies to demands for rent as well as demands for service charges and other sums payable under the terms of the tenancy (see s. 47(4)), but the only express sanction for noncompliance is that in s. 47(2), which provides that any part of the amount demanded which consists of a service charge or an administration charge shall be treated as not being due.  That can be contrasted both with s. 48 under which the effect of noncompliance is expressly extended to rent, and with the recommendation of the Nugee Committee which had not made any such distinction between rent and service charges (paragraph 30 above). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It is therefore an inescapable inference that Parliament deliberately excluded rent from s. 47(2) and intended that rent should remain due despite a demand for rent not complying with s. 47(1), as Mr Vanhegan accepted.  (We have not seen any material on the passage of the legislation through Parliament, and have no information as to when or why this was done).  There is usually of course no requirement that rent be demanded before it falls due – it falls due simply under the terms of the tenancy (and indeed, as Henderson LJ pointed out in argument, rent has a special quality, being regarded historically as “issuing out of the land” and akin to real property) – and Mr Vanhegan accepted that once rent had become due, the service of a demand which did not comply with s. 47 did not suspend the liability to pay it. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">But that still leaves entirely unclear what the effect of s. 47 is on a non-compliant demand for rent.  The choice would appear to be between (i) accepting that there were no consequences at all, which would render s. 47(1) merely aspirational in the case of demands for rent; or (ii) accepting that although the non-compliance did not affect the tenant’s liability for rent, it did, albeit without the Act expressly saying so, prevent the demand for rent from having any other effect – in this case, operating as an effective notice under s. 8 of the 1988 Act.  Neither of these seems very satisfactory.  Since it does not arise in the present case, I prefer not to express a view on it and to leave it to be decided if it is ever necessary to do so. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">There was no dispute about the answer to this third question.  If the s. 8 notice is not to substantially the same effect as Form 3, it is invalid.  That means that Mrs Lakhany has not served a valid notice as required by s. 8(1)(a) of the 1988 Act.  That does not prevent her from proceeding with her claim for possession, as s. 8(1)(b) enables the Court to dispense with the requirement of such a notice if it considers it just and equitable to do so.  But by s. 8(5) the Court cannot do this if the landlord seeks to recover possession on Ground 8.  The practical effect is that if the s. 8 notice were invalid, Mrs Lakhany would have to abandon Ground 8 and rely solely on Grounds 10 and 11, both of which are discretionary grounds.  She would therefore have both to persuade the Court to dispense with the requirement for a notice under s. 8(1)(b) on the basis that it is just and equitable, and persuade the Court to make an order for possession on the basis that it is reasonable to do so.  All of this is common ground, and it is also common ground that the question of whether it is just and equitable to dispense with the requirement of notice would not be a matter for us, but for the District Judge holding the substantive hearing. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Second, in the course of the hearing a question was raised as to whether any assistance could be obtained from the other forms in the regulations.  In principle I agree that they are admissible as a potential aid to interpretation being part of the same statutory instrument (technically the current version of Form 3 was added by subsequent amending regulations, but on the relevant point the original Form 3 was in identical form).  This exercise produced some points for both sides: Mr Vanhegan pointed to a number of forms (Nos 2, 4, 5 and 6) where there is express reference to details of the “landlord(s) / agents” and the like; Mr Jones pointed to the fact that paragraph 6 in Form 3 is similar to Form 1 paragraph 5 and Form 9 paragraph 4, including in each case the lack of a gap between the heading and the space for signature.  But the most telling point, which I think does give some support to the view I take, is that in every case where it is clear that a form requires a name and address to be given, there is a delineated space for this to be done, with “Name” and “Address” and dotted lines.  Examples can be found in Form 7 paragraph 2 and Form 8 paragraph 5.  Nowhere in the 10 forms can there be found an example where a name and address is clearly intended to be given without “Name” and “Address” and dotted lines.    </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Vanhegan said that it was important for a tenant receiving a s. 8 notice not only to know that proceedings were being threatened but also who was threatening them, not least because if a tenant wished to pay off arrears, they needed to know that they were being paid to the correct landlord.  I have some sympathy with that view, and it has a particular resonance in a case like the present where there is an uncertainty over who Ms Prempeh’s current landlord actually is (although here Ms Prempeh in fact knew that Philip Ross were acting for Mrs Lakhany as their covering letter told her that, and the lack of an address is of far less practical significance).  But in the vast majority of cases it is difficult to suppose that this will give rise to real problems.  If the tenant is unclear who is giving the s. 8 notice, they will no doubt contact the agent who signed and ask them.  One would not have thought the agent would have any reason not to </p>

This is that the forms are evidently designed to be capable of being used by ordinary citizens without the benefit of professional advice: that is apparent for example by the explanation of what it is for a person to act as agent of another, which would be unnecessary if it was expected that those using the forms would always have the benefit of lawyers.  That explains why the forms indicate in non-technical language what the person filling them in needs to do. </p>

If we read the form as requiring this, then those who are professionally advised will no doubt usually get it right, but those who are not may easily make the mistake of thinking that they need only give their agent’s name and address and then find that they lose perfectly sound claims for possession against defaulting tenants for want of something that may very well in the particular case be a purely formal defect that has not in fact caused the tenant any prejudice at all.
