	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">This appeal concerns the lawfulness of the use of live automated facial recognition technology (“AFR”) by the South Wales Police Force (“SWP”) in an ongoing trial using a system called AFR Locate. AFR Locate involves the deployment of surveillance cameras to capture digital images of members of the public, which are then processed and compared with digital images of persons on a watchlist compiled by SWP for the purpose of the deployment. On the facts of the present case, AFR Locate has been used in an overt manner. It was not deployed as a form of covert surveillance.  For that reason it is common ground that this case does not raise issues that might otherwise arise under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000. </p>

The AFR system was live from 8:00 am to 4:00 pm.  There were three watchlists for this deployment: one was of a person suspected of having committed a serious crime, another comprised 382 people wanted on warrants, and the third comprised 536 suspects (in effect, every person suspected of committing a crime in SWP’s area). There were ten possible matches during the deployment. Of these two were not true matches. In one of those cases there was no intervention. Of the eight true matches there were two arrests. </p>

No arrests were made during this deployment.  There were no false alerts. There was one correct match: one of the six people who had been arrested the previous year was correctly identified as being at the event. She had made a false bomb report the previous year, and had been convicted of that offence and sentenced to a suspended sentence order of 18 months’ imprisonment.

For pragmatic reasons SWP has accepted the Appellant’s evidence that he was present on both occasions and that on those occasions his image was recorded. SWP does not dispute that the Appellant is a victim for the purposes of section 7 of the HRA. Permission to apply for judicial review was granted by consent, SWP and the Secretary of State opposing the grounds for judicial review on the substantive merits. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The Divisional Court held that Article 8 was engaged. They considered that, like fingerprints and DNA, AFR technology enables the extraction of unique information and identifiers about an individual allowing his or her identification with precision in a wide range of circumstances, and that AFR-derived biometric data is information of an intrinsically private character. They said (at [57]) that the fact that the biometric data is derived from a person’s facial features that are manifest in public does not detract from that. They said (at [59]) that Article 8 is triggered by the initial gathering of the information and that it is sufficient if biometric data is captured, stored and processed, even momentarily. </p>

They rejected the Appellant’s primary argument that the use of AFR Locate by SWP was not “in accordance with the law” for the purposes of Article 8(2) because (1) there is no legal basis for the use of AFR Locate and so SWP does not, as a matter of law, have power to deploy it, and (2) in any event, any interference with Article 8 rights is not subject to a sufficient legal framework.  </p>

This is not an issue which we have to address in this appeal, since it is now common ground that SWP do have the power to deploy AFR Locate. </p>

They referred, in particular, to the provisions in Part 3 of the DPA 2018. They observed (at [88]) that the requirements arising under the DPA 2018 are mirrored in the Code of Practice on the Management of Police Information, issued by the College of Policing under section 39A of the Police Act 1996, and that section 39A(7) of the 1996 Act requires chief police officers to have regard to that Code.  </p>

The Divisional Court addressed the data protection claims under three headings: (1) the claim under the DPA 1998, (2) the claim under section 35 of the DPA 2018, and (3) the claim under section 64 of the DPA 2018. </p>

Having referred to the judgment of the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Vidal-Hall v Google Inc</span> [2015] EWCA Civ 311, [2016] QB 1003, and to the decision of the CJEU in Case C-212/13 <span style="font-style:italic">Rynes v Urad</span> [2015] 1 WLR 2607, the Divisional Court concluded (at [122]) that the processing of the Appellant’s image by the AFR Locate equipment was processing his personal data because the information recorded by AFR Locate individuated him from all others, that is to say it singled him out and distinguished him from all others. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">On the second issue, the Divisional Court found that AFR Locate meets the first requirement of section 35(5). They held (at [136]) that, for all the reasons given by them in relation to proportionality in the context of Article 8, the first of the requirements at section 35(5), namely “the processing is strictly necessary for the law enforcement purpose”, was satisfied. The Divisional Court held (at [137]) that the second requirement of section 35(5), that the processing must meet at least one of the conditions in Schedule 8 to the DPA 2018, was satisfied because of compliance with paragraph 1 of Schedule 8, the processing being necessary for the reasons given by the Divisional Court in the context of proportionality and Article 8, and the relevant rule of law being the common law duty to prevent and detect crime. As to the third requirement, that the controller has an appropriate policy document in place in relation to the sensitive processing in accordance with section 42, the Divisional Court said (at [139]) that they thought it was open to question whether the policy document relied upon by SWP, entitled “Policy on Sensitive Processing for Law Enforcement Purposes” dated November 2018 (“the November 2018 Policy Document”), fully met the standard required by section 42(2). They added the following at [141]: </p>

The Divisional Court rejected that claim on the grounds that at all material times the processing by SWP was supported by a relevant data protection impact assessment (“DPIA”) and that, approaching the matter on the footing that SWP had brought to bear a conscientious assessment, the impact assessment prepared by SWP did meet the requirements of section 64. </p>

The Divisional Court said (at [153]) that there was no suggestion that, as at April 2017 when the AFR Locate trial commenced, SWP either recognised or ought to have recognised that the NeoFace Watch software it had licensed might operate in a way that was indirectly discriminatory, and even at the date of the hearing there was no firm evidence that the software did produce results that suggested indirect discrimination. The Divisional Court concluded (at [158]) that the Equality Impact Assessment prepared by SWP in April 2017 demonstrated that due regard was had by SWP to the section 149(1) matters. </p>

Having in place such a document is a condition precedent for compliance with the first data protection principle (lawful and fair processing) contained in section 35 of the DPA 2018 where the processing of personal data constitutes “sensitive processing” within the meaning of section 35(8) of the DPA. </p>

We respectfully endorse both sentiments, in particular the latter.

We do not accept that, in the present case, it is either necessary or helpful to consider hypothetical scenarios which may arise in the future, as Mr Squires urged us to do.  We consider that what must be examined is the particular interference with Article 8 rights which has arisen in this present case and in particular whether that interference is in accordance with the law.  Whether other uses of police power in other contexts will be lawful in the future will be a matter to be considered if the facts of such a case arise in practice.  This is consistent with the approach of the European Court of Human Rights, which usually asks whether there has been a violation of an applicant’s rights on the particular facts of the case before it.

This appeal is not concerned with possible use of AFR in the future on a national basis.  As Mr Sharland submits, it is well-established in the caselaw of the European Court of Human Rights that local policies can be relevant to satisfy the requirement of “in accordance with the law”.  Such policies do not necessarily have to be at a national level.  He cited the decision of the European Court of Human Rights in <span style="font-style:italic">Munjaz v United Kingdom </span>[2012] MHLR 351, at [83]-[95].  In that case what was in issue was the policy on seclusion of patients at a “special hospital”, Ashworth, which was a high security hospital.  The European Court of Human Rights concluded that the hospital’s policy of seclusion did give sufficient indication of the scope of discretion which the hospital enjoyed and that the manner of that discretion was exercised with sufficient clarity to protect the applicant against arbitrary interference with his Article 8 rights.   </p>

Although that case is often cited (and was cited before us) in relation to the requirement that interference with Article 8 rights must be in accordance with the law, it should be noted that the European Court of Human Rights in fact declined to answer that question: see [95]-[99] of the judgment.  This was because it considered that the questions raised in that context were closely related to the broader issue of whether the interference was necessary in a democratic society and, in view of its analysis of that issue at [105]-[126], it was not necessary to decide whether the wording of section 64 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 was compatible with the “quality of law” requirements of Article 8(2). </p>

That case concerned the retention of fingerprints and DNA records.  Furthermore, the legislation in issue permitted that retention even in the case of people such as the applicants who, having been arrested, had been acquitted and perhaps never even charged with an offence.  The legislation permitted the blanket and indiscriminate retention of such personal data.  There were no time limits and no restriction by reference to the type of offence.

It seems to us that the answer to that point is that, in the present context, as the Divisional Court found, SWP did all that could reasonably be done to bring to the public’s attention that AFR Locate was being deployed at a particular place at a particular time.

On the former occasion it led to two arrests. On the latter occasion it identified a person who had made a bomb threat at the very same event the previous year and who had been subject to a (suspended) custodial sentence. On neither occasion did it lead to a disproportionate interference with anybody's Article 8 rights. Nobody was wrongly arrested. Nobody complained as to their treatment (save for the Claimant on a point of principle). Any interference with the Claimant's Article 8 rights would have been very limited.

The present challenge, however, was not to such a general measure.  The challenge was to a very specific deployment of AFR Locate on two particular occasions and the argument made in the Statement of Facts and Grounds was simply that this Appellant’s Article 8 rights had been violated. </p>

First, the DPIA’s analysis of the application of data protection principles contained no recognition that AFR entails the processing of the personal data (and still less the biometric data) of persons not on watchlists. Second, the DPIA did not acknowledge that the Article 8 rights of such persons are engaged. Third, the DPIA was silent as to the risks to other rights which are likely to be affected by the use of AFR: the rights to freedom of assembly under Article 11 of the Convention and freedom of expression under Article 10 of the Convention. There is no further elaboration of those points. The skeleton argument concludes, on this ground of appeal, that in the light of those three alleged deficiencies, the DPIA fell foul of the test specified by the Divisional Court itself (at [146]), namely: </p>

First, the DPIA contained no assessment of the impact of the deployment of AFR on the protection of the personal data of members of the public who might be affected by the measures. Secondly, it contained no assessment of the risks to their rights and freedoms, so that, for example, there was little or no engagement with the fact that SWP’s use of AFR involved the collection of data on a blanket and indiscriminate basis, and it placed too little weight on the interference posed by the initial collection itself and the plainly ambitious scale of the collection, particularly bearing in mind that it involved the sensitive processing of biometric data. Thirdly, the assessment did not adequately address the risk that a false positive would result in innocent members of the public having their biometric data retained for longer periods and place them at risk of being subjected to more intrusive interventions by police. Fourthly, the assessment of the right to privacy under Article 8 of the Convention, privacy risks, and possible mitigation of those risks, was negligible at best, being more concerned with the technical operation of AFR.  </p>

Generally, he submitted that there was a failure in the DPIA to provide an assessment of the risks and mitigation of them, as required by section 64 of the DPA 2018. He said that the Divisional Court’s dismissal of the claim under section 64 has to be seen in the context of the conclusion of the Divisional Court that Article 8 was not infringed for non-matched members of the public. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0.04in">We agree with the Divisional Court that some of the criticisms of the DPIA made by Mr Squires and Mr Facenna are unjustified. The DPIA specifically acknowledged that AFR might be perceived as being privacy intrusive in the use of biometrics and facial recognition and that Article 8 of the Convention was relevant. It sought to explain that AFR would only avoid being in breach of Article 8 if it was necessary, proportionate, in pursuit of a legitimate aim and in accordance with the law but that all those requirements would be satisfied if AFR Locate was used in the manner set out. The DPIA explained how AFR Locate operates. It is obvious from that explanation that large numbers of the public would be caught through CCTV cameras used in the deployment. It specifically stated that: “It is the intention during each deployment to allow the AFR application to enrol and therefore process as many individuals as possible”. That the public at large was potentially affected was reflected in the statement that: “in order to ensure that the public are engaged in the use of the technology every opportunity has been taken to demonstrate its use, to include during Automated Facial Recognition deployments”. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0.04in">This Ground of Appeal is, however, correct insofar as it states that the DPIA proceeds on the basis that Article 8 is not engaged or, more accurately, is not infringed. We have found, when considering Ground 1 above, that AFR Locate fails to satisfy the requirements of Article 8(2), and in particular the “in accordance with the law” requirement, because it involves two impermissibly wide areas of discretion: the selection of those on watchlists, especially the “persons where intelligence is required” category, and the locations where AFR may be deployed.   </p>

In the circumstances of the present case, this meant that the processing had to satisfy the requirements in section 35(5), which included (in section 35(5)(c)) that, “at the time when the processing is carried out, the controller has an appropriate policy document in place”.

A section 42 document is an evolving document, which, in accordance with section 42(3), must be kept under review and updated from time to time. At the time of the hearing before the Divisional Court no guidance had been issued by the Information Commissioner as to the contents of a section 42 document. The Divisional Court said (at [140]) that it would be desirable to see specific guidance from the Information Commissioner, in exercise of her powers under Schedule 13 to the DPA 2018, on what is required to meet the section 42 obligation. The Information Commissioner herself expressed the view to the Divisional Court that the November 2018 Policy Document contained sufficient information to comply with the requirements of section 42(2), if barely so. That view has been repeated by the Information Commissioner on this appeal. In the event, on 4 November 2019, after the Divisional Court’s judgment, the Information Commissioner did publish guidance on what a section 42 document should contain – “Law Enforcement Processing: Part 3 Appropriate Policy Document Template”. SWP have now revised their November 2018 Policy Document in the light of that guidance.  </p>

It is said that there is scientific evidence that facial recognition software can be biased and create a greater risk of false identifications in the case of people from black, Asian and other minority ethnic (“BAME”) backgrounds, and also in the case of women. </p>

There is no suggestion that as at April 2017 when the AFR Locate trial commenced, SWP either recognised or ought to have recognised that the software it had licensed might operate in a way that was indirectly discriminatory. Indeed, even now there is no firm evidence that the software does produce results that suggest indirect discrimination. Rather, the Claimant's case rests on what is said by Dr Anil Jain, an expert witness. In his first statement dated 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2018, Dr Jain commented to the effect that the accuracy of AFR systems generally could depend on the dataset used to ‘train’ the system. He did not, however, make any specific comment about the dataset used by SWP or about the accuracy of the NeoFace Watch software that SWP has licensed. Dr Jain went no further than to say that if SWP did not know the contents of the dataset used to train its system ‘it would be difficult for SWP to confirm whether the technology is in fact biased’. The opposite is, of course, also true.” </p>

Thus, SWP may now, in light of the investigation undertaken to date by Mr. Edgell, wish to consider whether further investigation should be done into whether the NeoFace Watch software may produce discriminatory impacts. When deciding whether or not this is necessary it will be appropriate for SWP to take account that whenever AFR Locate is used there is an important failsafe: no step is taken against any member of the public unless an officer (the systems operator) has reviewed the potential match generated by the software and reached his own opinion that there is a match between the member of the public and the watchlist face.  </p>

Our conclusion is that SWP did have the due regard required when in April 2017 it commenced the trial of AFR Locate. At that time, there was no specific reason why it ought to have been assumed it was possible that the NeoFace Watch software produced more or less reliable results depending on whether the face was male or female, or white or minority ethnic. As we have explained, even now there is no particular reason to make any such assumption. We note that although Dr Jain states that ‘bias has been found to be a feature of common AFR systems’ he does not provide an opinion on whether, or the extent to which, such bias can be addressed by the fail-safe, such as ensuring that a human operator checks whether there is in fact a match. </p>

In any event, as matters had developed in the course of the trial since April 2017, it is apparent from Mr. Edgell's evidence that SWP continues to review events against the section 149(1) criteria.

The General Race Equality Duty in the amended section 71 of the RRA required that listed public authorities had ‘due regard’ to the need ‘to eliminate unlawful racial discrimination’ and ‘to promote equality of opportunity and good relations between persons of different racial groups’.  The Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000 and the General Race Equality Duty within it were enacted to give effect to the recommendations in the Stephen Lawrence Inquiry Report and the Inquiry’s findings of ‘institutional racism’.  The purpose of the General Race Equality Duty was to create a strong, effective, and enforceable legal obligation which placed race equality at the heart of the public authority’s decision making.  The new duty was intended to mark a major change in the law.  It represented a move from a fault-based scheme where legal liability rested only with those who could be shown to have committed one or other of the unlawful acts.

This means that a positive match made by the automated system will never by itself lead to human intervention.  Before such an intervention (for example a stop of a member of the public for a conversation with a police officer) can take place, there must be two human beings, including at least one police officer, who have decided to act on the positive match.   </p>

As a matter of principle, it is not material to the PSED, which as we have observed, is a duty as to the process which needs to be followed, not what the substance of the decision should be.  Secondly, as was acknowledged at the hearing before us, human beings can also make mistakes.  This is particularly acknowledged in the context of identification.  We would note the well-known warnings which need to be given to juries in criminal trials about how identification can be mistaken, in particular where a person has never seen the person being identified before: see <span style="font-style:italic">R v Turnbull </span>[1977] QB 224.  Further, and in any event, this feature of the present case does not seem to us to go to the heart of the Appellant’s complaint under Ground 5, which is that SWP have not obtained information for themselves about the possible bias which the software they use may have. </p>

He did not know, for obvious reasons, the racial or gender profiles of the total number of people who were captured by the AFR technology but whose data was then almost immediately deleted.  In order to check the racial or gender bias in the technology, that information would have to be known.  We accept Mr Beer’s submission that it is impossible to have that information, precisely because a safeguard in the present arrangements is that that data is deleted in the vast majority of cases.  That does not mean, however, that the software may not have an inbuilt bias, which needs to be tested. In any event, with respect to Mr Edgell, he is not an expert who can deal with the technical aspects of the software in this context.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0.04in">When the claim for judicial review was first lodged, reliance was placed in the Statement of Facts and Grounds on the first witness statement of Dr Anil Jain, dated 30 September 2018.  Dr Jain is a professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Michigan State University in the United States.  In his first witness statement he explains that the performance of AFR technology is affected by a number of variables, including “training datasets”:  see para. 38(a).  What this means is that the particular software which is used is “trained”.  At para. 47, Dr Jain says that the accuracy of an AFR system depends to a considerable extent on the training dataset.  He goes on to say, at para. 48, that AFR systems can suffer from training “bias”.  At para. 49, he says that one cause of such training bias can be any imbalance in the demographic of subjects in the training datasets, resulting in the AFR system having a high false alarm rate or a high false reject rate for that particular demographic.  At para. 51 Dr Jain states that it would appear that SWP were not aware of the dataset used to train the AFR system in this case.  For that reason, he states, it would be difficult for SWP to confirm whether the technology is in fact biased.  As a minimum for confirming whether an AFR system is biased, the database statistics, such as the number of males to females, and different races considered, would need to be known.   </p>

He states that the NeoFace algorithm is trained in laboratories and, on a typically annual basis, a new version of the algorithm is released containing improvements from, amongst other things, additional training.  No further training is carried out by the system in any customer environments: see para. 10 of his witness statement.   At para. 20, Mr Roberts states that the precise makeup, scale and sources of the training data used are commercially sensitive and cannot be released.  He was, however, able to share certain facts, which he sets out in the following paragraphs.  At para. 22 he states that: </p>

He fairly acknowledges, at para. 15, that he cannot comment on whether AFR Locate has a discriminatory impact as he does not have access to the datasets on which the system is trained and therefore cannot analyse the biases in those datasets.  He goes on to say, however, that bias has been found to be a feature of common AFR systems and that SWP themselves are not in a position to evaluate the discriminatory impact of AFR Locate.   </p>

He expresses the opinion that what Mr Roberts says is not sufficient to be able to determine that the NeoFace algorithm is not biased towards a particular demographic group.  To make this determination, he says, a thorough evaluation needs to be done of the demographic composition of the NeoFace algorithm training dataset.  Dr Jain states at para. 28, without that information SWP are not able to assess whether the training dataset is biased or may be.   </p>

That would not be appropriate in a claim for judicial review, still less on appeal.  The fact remains, however, that SWP have never sought to satisfy themselves, either directly or by way of independent verification, that the software program in this case does not have an unacceptable bias on grounds of race or sex.  There is evidence, in particular from Dr Jain, that programs for AFR can sometimes have such a bias.  Dr Jain cannot comment on this particular software but that is because, for reasons of commercial confidentiality, the manufacturer is not prepared to divulge the details so that it could be tested.  That may be understandable but, in our view, it does not enable a public authority to discharge its own, non-delegable, duty under section 149. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0.04in">Finally, we would note that the Divisional Court placed emphasis on the fact that SWP continue to review events against the section 149(1) criteria.  It said that this is the approach required by the PSED in the context of a trial process.  With respect, we do not regard that proposition to be correct in law.  The PSED does not differ according to whether something is a trial process or not.  If anything, it could be said that, before or during the course of a trial, it is all the more important for a public authority to acquire relevant information in order to conform to the PSED and, in particular, to avoid indirect discrimination on racial or gender grounds. </p>

This technology can be a valuable tool in the management of public safety and security, in the protection of people and property, in the prevention and investigation of crime, and in bringing crimes to justice. Technological advances can also provide greater opportunity to safeguard privacy.

The Human Rights Act 1998 gives effect in UK law to the rights set out in the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). Some of these rights are absolute, whilst others are qualified, meaning that it is permissible for the state to interfere with the right provided that the interference is in pursuit of a legitimate aim and the interference is proportionate. Amongst the qualified rights is a person's right to respect for their private and family life, home and correspondence, as provided for by Article 8 of the ECHR.” </p>

In general terms, one of the variables is situational, and in a public place there is a zone of interaction with others which may fall within the scope of private life. An individual can expect to be the subject of surveillance in a public place as CCTV, for example, is a familiar feature in places that the public frequent. An individual can, however, rightly expect surveillance in public places to be both necessary and proportionate, with appropriate safeguards in place.” “2.4 The decision to use any surveillance camera technology must, therefore, be consistent with a legitimate aim and a pressing need. Such a legitimate aim and pressing need must be articulated clearly and documented as the stated purpose for any deployment. <span style="text-decoration:underline">The technical design solution for such a</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">deployment should be proportionate to the stated purpose rather</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">than driven by the availability of funding or technological</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">innovation.</span> Decisions over the most appropriate technology should always take into account its potential to meet the stated purpose without unnecessary interference with the right to privacy and family life.
