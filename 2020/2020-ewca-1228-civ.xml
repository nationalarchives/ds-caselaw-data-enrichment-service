	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In late 2012, the parties began discussions relating to the potential sale to Triumph of two aerospace manufacturing companies, one based in Farnborough in the UK, and the other based in Rayong in Thailand (“the companies”). As part of these discussions, Primus - who owned the companies, sometimes referred to in the papers as the Target Group - provided Triumph with a set of financial forecasts for the companies extending to 2017. These were known as the “Long Range Plan” (“the LRP”). The LRP predicted that the companies would be profitable in the future. That was important because, at the time of the sale, the companies were making a loss. </p>

Pursuant to its terms, Triumph purchased shares in the companies, which ultimately conferred ownership upon them. The sale was completed on 3 May 2013. The original purchase price was $63,530,145. Following an adjustment to reflect changes in the book value of the companies’ assets, the final purchase price increased by $13 million to $76,530,145.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The trial in the TCC before the judge took five weeks in 2018. She had to deal with a raft of issues which do not arise on this appeal. She concluded that Primus were in breach of the 19.5 warranty because the LRP failed to take into account, properly or accurately, key operational and financial assumptions relating to planned transfers of production lines from the Farnborough company to the Thai company. As a result, the LRP overestimated the rate at which production could be transferred and overstated the future profitability of the companies. The judge found that the purchase price paid by Triumph for the companies would have been lower if they had been provided with a proper LRP. </p>

When she came to assess the quantum of the claim, the judge had regard to the speech of Lord Hoffmann in <span style="font-style:italic">Lion Nathan Ltd v C-C Bottlers Ltd </span>[1996] WLR 1438. When addressing the measure of loss in a case of this kind, he said that “…the crucial question...is the ascertainment of what a properly prepared forecast would have been”. The judge adopted that approach. She went on to explain that there was a dispute between the experts as to the methodology for valuing the companies and the impact of the breaches of warranty, and noted at [494] that, because the experts had not quantified the loss in accordance with the <span style="font-style:italic">Lion</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">Nathan</span> guidance, she would direct them to carry out that exercise.  </p>

Primus relies on paragraph 3.1(f) of Schedule 8 to the SPA, which provides that the Sellers shall not be liable in respect of any claim to the extent that the matter to which the claim relates is in respect of lost goodwill. I reject the submission by Primus that the claims made by Triumph for breaches of warranty are claims for lost goodwill. The plain and natural meaning of goodwill in a commercial contract is business reputation. The losses sustained by reasons of the breaches are lost revenues and increased costs, leading to reduced profitability and loss of share value. The exclusion relied on by Primus does not affect the claims for breaches of warranty.” </p>

There was a deductible of $1.5 million stipulated in the SPA, which left the damages awarded by the judge to Triumph in the sum of $4,201,570. </p>

At the appeal hearing, Mr Morgan QC put it slightly differently, submitting that loss of goodwill was “a loss of share value, where that value represents the difference between the cost of acquisition and the fair value of its identifiable net assets and/or where that loss of share value is caused by the impairment of the value of non-identifiable assets.” It was agreed that, in either of the appellants’ formulations, this was essentially an accounting definition.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="1">

Mr Morgan QC does not contend that any part of the factual background to the SPA, or any part of the SPA itself, points to or justifies the adoption of the accounting definition.

The goodwill of a business must emanate from a particular centre or source. However widely extended or diffused its influence may be, goodwill is worth nothing unless it has power of attraction sufficient to bring customers home to the source from which it emanates. Goodwill is composed of a variety of elements. It differs in its composition in different trades and in different businesses in the same trade. One element may preponderate here and another element there. To analyze goodwill and split it up into its component parts, to pare it down as the Commissioners desire to do until nothing is left but a dry residuum ingrained in the actual place where the business is carried on while everything else is in the air, seems to me to be as useful for practical purposes as it would be to resolve the human body into the various substances of which it is said to be composed.

A possession comprising the goodwill of a business is the product of past work: "by dint of their own work, the applicants had built up a clientele". Goodwill is the present value of what has been built up. It is to be distinguished from the value of a future income stream. From an accountants' point of view, this distinction may make little practical sense. But it is the distinction that has been clearly drawn by the ECtHR for the purposes of A1P1.” </p>

He used the ordinary legal meaning instead. So too did the Supreme Court of Canada in <span style="font-style:italic">Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin v Boutique Clicquot Ltée</span> [2006] SCC 23 when, by reference to a Canadian statute concerned with trademarks, the court defined ‘goodwill’ as </p>

It seems to me that "goodwill" in this context is not being used in the technical accounting sense of the difference between the cost of an acquired entity and the aggregate of the fair values of that entity's identifiable assets and liabilities (see, for example, Financial Reporting Standard 10). Goodwill is there used to fill a gap in the balance sheet that would otherwise arise, may well be transient, is exclusively the result of acquisition and cannot be internally generated. It appears that "goodwill" is being used rather in the economic sense of the capitalised value of a business or part of a business as a going concern which, according to modern theory of corporate finance, is best understood as the expected free future cash flows of the business discounted to a present value at an appropriate after tax weighted average cost of funds (see Brealey and Myers, Principles of Corporate Finance, 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> edition, 2003 at sections 4.5 and 19.1). There is, of course, a connection with the accountancy concept of goodwill, which arises simply because the present value of net future cash flows on the economic model exceeds, or is thought to exceed, the aggregate of the fair values of the identifiable net assets that will be employed to generate those cash flows.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The starting point is clause 13, set out at paragraph 15 above. The undertakings referred to in clause 13.4 were plainly designed to protect the companies’ goodwill, in the sense of their good name, reputation and business connection. It was for that reason that, for example, certain named employees of the companies were prohibited from working for Primus for a period of 2 years after the sale of the companies. As Mr Pillai QC rightly pointed out, that was inconsistent with Mr Morgan QC’s interpretation, that ‘goodwill’ always fell to be valued at the date of the sale. Clause 13 emphasises that the companies were an ongoing concern and that what was being protected by these provisions was their ongoing goodwill, at least for the two year period after the sale. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Furthermore, the agreed facts mean that clause 13.4 could not be construed as referring to ‘goodwill’ in the accountancy sense. It was common ground between the experts at trial that the companies had no goodwill recorded in their balance sheets at the time of the sale. In those circumstances, if ‘goodwill’ were given the accountancy definition, there would have been no goodwill to protect, and the entirety of clause 13 would have been otiose.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It is also instructive to look at some of the other warranties at Schedule 3. Warranties 4.1 and 6.1 are concerned respectively with the accuracy of the register of members of the companies, and compliance with licences, permits and consent. Those are general: breach of those warranties would give rise to a claim, regardless of whether or not the breach was connected to the assets in the balance sheet (which, if Primus’ construction of the 3.1(f)(i) exclusion was correct, they would have to be). Even more importantly, warranty 12 is entitled ‘Assets’ and again draws no distinction between assets on the balance sheet and any other type of assets. Warranty 12 would have to be completely rewritten if Primus’ interpretation was correct. Indeed, as Mr Pillai QC correctly observed, if all claims were excluded except in relation to the value of the identifiable assets on the balance sheet, the warranties would have been very differently expressed. </p>

I disagree. This was not a claim for loss of share value: it was a claim for overpayment as a result of the careless LRP. The loss was the difference between the price actually paid, and the lower price which Triumph would have paid if they had known the true position. A businessman or a lawyer would consider that such a claim was an entirely different sort of claim to one for loss of goodwill. This was therefore not a claim where “the matter to which the claim relates … is in respect of lost goodwill”, so it was not excluded by the 3.1(f)(i) exclusion.  </p>

Take the facts of this case. There was a failure to prepare an LRP for the companies with proper care. Such a failure inevitably affected the overall value of those companies. If Primus were right in their construction, such a claim would be caught by the exclusion clause, because it went to that part of the purchase price not covered by the value of the net assets of the companies at the time of the sale: what Mr Morgan QC called “the top slice over and above net assets”<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="4">
		<p class="footnotedescription"> This again demonstrates the significant difference between the ordinary legal meaning of the term ‘goodwill’ and the accounting definition.
