The first appeal in time is by the Fifth Defendant (“Mr O’Boyle”) against an order of His Honour Judge Keyser QC sitting as a High Court Judge dated 13 September 2019 and primarily concerns the granting of permission to bring committal proceedings and litigation privilege. The second appeal is by the Claimant (“TBD”) against an order of Marcus Smith J dated 17 January 2020 and primarily concerns the interpretation of a search order and the granting of permission to bring committal proceedings. For reasons that will appear, it will be convenient to deal with the interpretation of the search order before turning to consider the other issues on the appeals. </p>

My account is fuller than that given by either Judge Keyser in his judgment dated 13 September 2019 [2019] EWHC 2390 (Ch) or Marcus Smith J in his judgment dated 17 January 2020 [2020] EWHC 30 (Ch), since it appears that the procedural history was investigated in more detail in this Court than it was in either court below. </p>

From 20 August 2007 until 9 June 2016 the First Defendant (“Mr Simons”) was employed by TBD. Mr Simons brought a claim for unfair dismissal against TBD that was settled by a conciliation agreement on 16 September 2016. After leaving TBD, Mr Simons went to work for, and became a director of, the Second Defendant (“G2A”), a competitor to TBD. Mr O’Boyle was also a director of G2A until it entered liquidation.  </p>

No attempt was made to particularise the copyright works. The letters alleged infringement by G2A and Obcon, again without giving particulars. The letters stated that, unless within seven days G2A and Obcon gave undertakings in terms enclosed with the letters and gave extensive disclosure, TBD would pursue the matter without further notice, including by applying for an urgent injunction. The enclosed undertakings required wide-ranging undertakings to be given in respect of the unspecified copyright works, which were not limited to acts which amounted to infringements, but extended to acts which would not have amounted to infringements by virtue of section 51 of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988. Both letters stated that infringement of copyright was both a civil and a criminal offence. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The letter to Mr Simons traversed the same ground as the letters to G2A and Obcon, but added four points. First, it stated that TBD had reported Mr Simons’ infringements of copyright to the police. This was an early indication of the aggressive approach to the litigation adopted by Acuity on the instructions of TBD. Secondly, the letter alleged that Mr Simons was not only personally liable for copyright infringement, but also in breach of a confidentiality clause in his contract of employment (although again no particulars were given) and had tried to solicit employees of TBD on condition that they bring confidential information with them </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">(again without particulars).

Fourthly, it reminded Mr Simons of his obligation under the conciliation agreement not to make any critical statements concerning TBD and threatened to obtain an injunction if he made any such statements. </p>

TBD alleged that G2A and Obcon had procured those breaches of contract. There were also claims for infringement of copyright against Mr Simons and G2A, although the works in which copyright was claimed were almost wholly unparticularised in the Particulars of Claim. Given the claims for misuse of trade secrets and copyright infringement, the claim form should have been issued in the Chancery Division (see CPR rule 63.13 and Practice Direction 63 paragraph 16.1), but instead it was issued in the Queen’s Bench Division. Under “value” the claim form stated that TBD did “not expect to recover more than £100,000”. </p>

She went on in paragraph 26 to say that, should the court consider it necessary, TBD expected that it would “in due course” be able to give “specific details of the respects in which Mr Simons had breached the 4 July 2018 Order”, but hoped that the court would be prepared to deal with application “without the need for that step to be undertaken”.

It mentioned some of the relevant provisions of Part 81, but not rule 81.14(1)(a). Nor did it draw the judge’s attention to paragraph 26 of Ms Wardell’s affidavit and the implications of that paragraph.

For reasons that will appear, I consider that TBD should have made an application for the court to determine the scope of the analysis of the Images at the hearing. In any event, the Original Defendants’ failure to raise the matter cannot be construed as amounting to consent to TBD’s course of action given that TBD was asserting that it had the right to proceed unilaterally. That is particularly so given that both Mr Simons and G2A were unrepresented.

As noted above, two devices belonging to Mr O’Boyle were also imaged, but the Search Order in respect of Mr O’Boyle’s home was set aside. It follows that the images of Mr O’Boyle’s devices should have been either deleted or returned to Mr O’Boyle prior to the commencement of the analysis of the Images. It is not entirely clear that that was in fact done, but I shall assume that it was. </p>

In Mr Roberts’ witness statement dated 19 November 2018 Mr Roberts had given evidence about filings at Companies House to record a change in ownership of G2A from Obcon to Joma. Acuity’s letter to Langtons enclosed a copy of the 1 April 2019 Letter and its enclosures (referred to as “the Letter”), asserted that it was “not possible to reconcile” the evidence in the Letter with Mr Roberts’ witness statement and listed some “serious questions which need addressing”.

Various questions were raised about the contract.

Instead, he decided to make orders (i) requiring TBD to provide a comprehensive list of Searched Documents and certain other information, (ii) requiring TBD to hand over the Images to an independent firm of solicitors to (a) weed out privileged and self-incriminatory material and (b) identify documents that would fall within the scope of standard disclosure, (iii) requiring TBD to identify communications with third parties using material derived from the Images, (iv) requiring TBD to pay the costs of these exercises and (v) giving the parties permission to apply to the court for further directions (including, if so advised, a further application to strike out the claim) once steps (i) to (iii) had been completed. In the meantime, the proceedings were stayed. Marcus Smith J also dismissed TBD’s application to bring committal proceedings against Mr O’Boyle and revoked the permission to bring committal proceedings against Mr Simons.

First, after Marcus Smith J had circulated his judgment in draft, but before he made his order, Acuity filed a note summarising what had been done and explaining that, in the circumstances, Acuity had decided to withdraw from acting for TBD (“the Acuity Note”).

Thirdly, the O’Boyle Defendants subsequently applied to this Court for permission to adduce further evidence consisting of a sixth witness statement of Mr Ingram. Mr Ingram exhibited a copy of the Acuity Letter and some of its enclosures together with excerpts from a few of the documents in question. He also set out the results of a search he had carried out of the Searched Documents looking for privileged documents. Although TBD initially opposed the application to adduce further evidence, it sensibly withdrew its opposition during the course of the hearing. Some of what Mr Ingram says is argument, or at least comment, and I shall disregard that. The factual content is not, however, disputed by TBD. On the other hand, I bear in mind that, in so far as what Mr Ingram says goes beyond the Acuity Note and the Acuity Letter, Acuity have not had the chance to respond to it. </p>

Mr Ingram sets out a number of examples of documents amongst the 82 and explains his reasons for contending that they are clearly privileged. I bear in mind that TBD </p>

On the face of it, however, the claim to privilege appears well founded. Thus the documents include, for example, a detailed letter of advice sent by Simon Burn to the Original Defendants on 30 July 2018 and a draft witness statement of Mr Ingram in support of an application that in the event was not made dated 21 August 2018. Counsel for TBD submitted that TBD would, or at least might, be able to rely upon the iniquity exception to privilege (as to which, see below). I am sceptical that the iniquity exception would defeat the claim to privilege in respect of all of the documents in question, even if it applied to some of them.  </p>

It is clear that the Images did include a large number of such documents which were copied from Mr Simons’ mobile phone and portable hard drive. Given the breadth of the keyword searches employed, I consider it probable that at least some of the Searched Documents fall into this category. It follows that the privacy interests not only of Mr Simons, but also of other members of his family are engaged.    </p>

The claimants therefore applied without notice for an order permitting them to enter the premises for the purposes of (i) inspecting and photographing pre-recorded tapes and other infringing material, invoices, bills and other documents relevant to the claim, (ii) removing infringing items and (iii) inspecting, photographing and testing typewriters (with a view to identifying the typewriter used to produce the forged letter).  </p>

Nevertheless, in my judgment, if it appears that the object of the plaintiffs’ litigation will be unfairly and improperly frustrated by the very giving of the notice which is normally required to protect the defendant, there must be exceptional and emergency cases in which the court can dispense with the notice and, either under power in the rules to dispense with notice or by the exercise of its inherent jurisdiction, make such a limited order, albeit ex parte, as will give the plaintiffs the relief which they would otherwise be unable to obtain.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It can be seen from Templeman J’s judgment that his order was made in order to achieve two purposes. The first, and most important, purpose was to preserve evidence and property, so that it could not be altered, destroyed or hidden by the defendant. The second purpose was to enable the claimants to obtain discovery (now disclosure) of documents. Although Templeman J referred to “discovery”, and not inspection, of documents in the passage at 307G-308A, his order permitted inspection of documents, and it seems tolerably clear that it was intended to enable the claimants to use the information gained from the inspection for the purposes of the proceedings.  </p>

The claimant was tipped off by two employees of the first defendant that the defendants were secretly negotiating with two of the claimant’s competitors to supply them with drawings and confidential information to enable the competitors to manufacture power units copied from the claimant’s. The claimant applied without notice for an interim injunction to restrain the defendants from infringing its copyrights and misusing its confidential information and for a search order following the precedent of the order in <span style="font-style:italic">EMI v Pandit</span>.

It puts them in peril not only of proceedings for contempt, but also of adverse inferences being drawn against them; so much so that their own solicitor may often advise them to comply. We are told that in two at least of the cases such an order has been effective. We are prepared, therefore, to sanction its continuance, but only in an extreme case where there is grave danger of property being smuggled away or of vital evidence being destroyed. </p>

That was an early case about infringement of copyright in films through the large-scale production of illicit video cassettes. The claimants obtained an <span style="font-style:italic">Anton Piller</span> order which not only required the defendants to<span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:13.5pt;color:#3D3D3D"> </span>permit the claimants to enter the defendants’ premises and seize infringing copies of the films, but also required the defendants immediately to produce relevant documents and to provide information relating to the supply and sale of infringing copies which had to be verified on affidavit subsequently. The defendants applied to have the orders discharged or varied on two main grounds. The first was that the court had no jurisdiction to make such orders, but this ground was rejected by the Court of Appeal (which included Lord Denning MR and Templeman LJ) and was not seriously pursued in the House of Lords. The second was that, by disclosing the documents and answering the interrogatories, the defendants might expose themselves to criminal proceedings, and therefore were entitled to invoke the privilege against self-incrimination. </p>

The first is <span style="font-style:italic">LT Piver Sarl v S &amp; J Perfume Co Ltd</span> [1987] FSR 159. In that case, while executing an <span style="font-style:italic">Anton Piller</span> order made in favour of the claimant against the defendant, a private investigator, Mr Lake, saw a number of empty boxes bearing a trade mark used by another client, Revlon, which had instructed him to keep an eye open for counterfeiting of its products. Mr Lake picked up one of the empty boxes and removed it. Subsequently another box of the same kind was obtained from a different source. Revlon then applied for an <span style="font-style:italic">Anton Piller</span> order against the defendants, relying upon the evidence of Mr Lake and the two boxes. On the application Revlon explained the circumstances in which Mr Lake had obtained the first box and sought the court’s permission to use it. Walton J granted the order sought, and a large quantity of allegedly counterfeit perfume was seized when it was executed. The defendants then applied for an injunction against the claimants in the first action, their solicitors, the investigation agency and Mr Lake requiring them to deliver up to the defendants’ solicitors any documents and materials which did not fall within the scope of the first <span style="font-style:italic">Anton Piller</span> order. They also sought a similar order against the investigation agency and Mr Lake in relation to the second <span style="font-style:italic">Anton Piller</span> order. Walton J dismissed these applications on the grounds that (i) even if he had not picked up the first box, Mr Lake could have given evidence as to what he had seen during the execution of the first order and supported it with the second box; (ii) although, strictly speaking, Mr Lake had converted the first box, the court had given its permission to use that evidence; and (iii) there was no evidence that anything else had been improperly removed during the execution of either order. It should be noted that, so far as point (i) is concerned, there is no mention in Walton J’s judgment of the implied undertaking on discovery or of the relevant authorities.  </p>

He went on to hold that the defendants could rely upon the privilege against self-incrimination to resist the seizure of documents (as opposed to articles), discovery and the provision of information.  </p>

The terms of the order included a provision requiring the defendants to permit the claimants’ solicitors to list any articles in the defendants’ possession which the claimants’ solicitors reasonably believed to infringe the rights of third parties. The order contained an undertaking by the claimants’ solicitors not to disclose any information obtained as result of the search except to such third parties or their solicitors. After the execution of the order the first defendant applied to vary the order so as in effect to delete these provisions on the ground that they infringed the defendants’ privilege against self-incrimination.

Anything beyond that is, in my judgment, impossible to justify. For example, I do not understand how an order can be justified that allows the plaintiffs’ solicitors to take and retain all relevant documentary material and correspondence. Once the plaintiffs’ solicitors have satisfied themselves what material exists and have had an opportunity to take copies thereof, the material ought, in my opinion, to be returned to its owner.

In view of the circumstances in which <span style="font-style:italic">Anton Piller</span> orders are customarily executed (the execution is often aptly called ‘a raid’), I would not, for my part, be prepared to accept that an apparent consent by a respondent had been freely and effectively given unless the respondent’s solicitor had been present to confirm and ensure that the consent was a free and informed one. </p>

The fact that there is overwhelming evidence that the defendant has behaved wrongfully in his commercial relationships does not necessarily justify an <span style="font-style:italic">Anton Piller</span> order.

The more intrusive orders allowing searches of premises or vehicles require a careful balancing of, on the one hand, the plaintiff’s right to recover his property or to preserve important evidence against, on the other hand, violation of the privacy of a defendant who has had no opportunity to put his side of the case. It is not merely that the defendant may be innocent. The making of an intrusive order ex parte even against a guilty defendant is contrary to normal principles of justice and can only be done when there is a paramount need to prevent a denial of justice to the plaintiff. The absolute extremity of the court’s powers is to permit a search of a defendant’s dwelling house, with the humiliation and family distress which that frequently involves.” </p>

Even if it was thought that the defendants were the kind of dishonest people who would conceal or destroy incriminating documents, it would surely have been sufficient at the ex parte stage to allow the plaintiff's solicitors to remove the documents and make copies for their own retention pending an application by the plaintiff inter partes for leave to inspect them.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">There are three fundamental points which emerge from this survey of the law with respect to search orders. First, the purpose of a search order is to preserve evidence, whether documentary or real, and/or property in order to prevent the defendant from altering, destroying or hiding such evidence or property if given notice. The purpose of inspecting documents during the course of the search, to the extent permitted by the order, is to identify documents which should be preserved. Secondly, the facts that justify a search order being made may also in appropriate cases justify the making of without notice orders for the disclosure and inspection of documents and/or the provision of information pursuant to either CPR Part 18 or the court’s inherent jurisdiction, but nevertheless the two types of orders are distinct, require separate justification, have different effects and must not be conflated. Thirdly, both search orders and without notice orders for the disclosure and inspection of documents and/or the provision of information must contain proper safeguards for the respondent, and those safeguards must be respected during the execution of the order. It follows from the second point that the safeguards required for without notice orders for the disclosure and inspection of documents and/or the provision of information are different to those required for search orders.          </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In the present context, imaging has both advantages and disadvantages. The key advantages are that (i) it is a relatively non-intrusive process which does not involve any removal of documents and (ii) it enables all digital evidence to be preserved for subsequent analysis. The key disadvantage is that imaging is, by its very nature, incapable of discrimination between information that is relevant to the issues in the proceedings and information that is irrelevant, or between business information and personal information, or between information that is subject to legal professional privilege and information that is not. Thus imaging can only ever be a preservation step, and it must be followed by proper consideration of the issues of disclosure and inspection of the documents preserved by the imaging process.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The availability of imaging has important consequences for search orders which in my experience have frequently been disregarded. The first is that, if what is needed is a remedy to preserve evidence in order to ensure that it cannot be altered, destroyed or hidden, then in many cases an order requiring the respondent to permit imaging of its digital devices and cloud storage (“an imaging order”) will be the most effective means of achieving that objective. The second, which follows from the first, is that, if an imaging order is made, then that may well make a traditional search order unnecessary, or at least may enable the scope of the search order to be significantly restricted e.g. to articles as opposed to documents. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It has become increasingly common for claimants in cases like the present one to make without notice applications seeking both a traditional search order and an imaging order. In my view, any court confronted with such an application should first consider whether to grant an imaging order. If the court is prepared to grant an imaging order, then it should be presumed unless the contrary is shown that a traditional search order is unnecessary. Even if the court is prepared to grant a search order at all, careful consideration should be given as to the scope of the order having regard to the imaging order. </p>

Experience shows, however, that applicants and courts do not always give proper consideration to the safeguards that should be provided. By contrast with search orders, no standard form of imaging order has been developed. In my view this case demonstrates there is an urgent need for the Civil Procedure Rules Committee to promulgate a standard form of imaging order. Until such time as a standard form is available, however, it is incumbent upon solicitors and counsel representing applicants, and judges hearing applications, to give careful consideration to the provision of appropriate safeguards.

The first two defendants were ex-employees of the claimant and the third defendant was a company they had set up in competition with the claimant. The claimant commenced proceedings for breach of restrictive covenants and misuse of confidential information. On a without notice application by the claimant, the judge granted (i) an interim injunction, (ii) a search order and (iii) an imaging order. The imaging order made no provision for inspection of the imaged documents. The order was executed and images made (including, disturbingly, of two computers owned by Mr Brown’s wife and used by her for her own business). On the (adjourned) return date, the court refused the claimant permission to examine the images save that the claimant’s forensic computer expert was permitted to search the images by keyword and report the number of hits produced by the search. The claimant subsequently applied for permission to carry out a keyword search of the images for the purpose of identifying documents relevant to the claim. The effect of the order proposed by the claimant was that the claimant would be able to search using its own choice of keywords, but that the defendants would be able to propose a “blacklist” of keywords which would result in documents being produced to the Defendants’ solicitors for review as to relevance and privilege prior to disclosure. By the time this application came to be heard, the defendants had served defences denying any wrongdoing and disclosure was due. Tugendhat J refused to grant the order sought by the claimant, and instead ordered that the defendants should give standard disclosure in relation to the images </p>

The reason that, to a degree, the old form of [search order] in relation to documents seems to involve a disclosure exercise is because the exercise of preservation in relation to physical documents necessarily involves a search and assessment by the claimant. If one is preserving physical documents from a potentially predatory party then there is no other way of going about it. The same is true of digital documents which are not imaged (see the standard form of order). But that should not disguise the fact that the exercise is usually intended to be a preservation one, not (at that stage) a disclosure one. </p>

It is not necessary to carry out any searching or identification for that purpose; the image is safe. Any searches carried out in relation to those documents cannot be justified on the footing that it is necessary for the preservation of those documents. I can see no justification for a search of those documents being, as a general rule, carried out by the claimant and/or at that stage. </p>

They should at least inform the defendants of the keywords that they are proposing to use, so that if the defendants have some form of objection they have an opportunity to have their concern ventilated at a hearing. Keywords are, of course, important. They are the way in which the large amounts of data relied on by the defendants in opposition to the order are reduced to manageable proportions. Anyone reviewing this data would have to do so via keyword searches. A review of the proposed keywords by the defendants is also a mechanism pursuant to which they can form a view as to whether or not the searches might go too far, though I accept that it is a pretty blunt instrument in that respect.” </p>

It is unacceptable for claimants to be able unilaterally to decide what keywords to employ, since experience shows that, as in this case, parties all too often propose keywords that are far too all-embracing. Considerable care is required when selecting keywords, and often it will be necessary for an intelligent combination of keywords to be employed.

If there is to be any departure from this, it will require a very high degree of justification, and must be specifically and explicitly approved by the court. On the return date, consideration must be given to the timing and methodology of disclosure and inspection of documents captured in the images. The presumption should be that it will be for the defendant to give disclosure of such documents in the normal way, but this presumption may be departed from where there is sufficient justification. Even if the presumption is departed from, there should be no unilateral searching of the images by or on behalf of the claimant: the methodology of the search must be either agreed between the parties or approved by the court.    </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I now turn to paragraph 18 of the Search Order (set out in paragraph 26 above). The following points should be noted about this paragraph. First, it authorises the computer experts to do three things: (i) “take a copy of the files on any computers found on the premises”, (ii) carry out “analysis … following completion of the search” in order to “recover” listed items and (iii) “deliver” listed items “into the safekeeping of the Claimant’s solicitors”. It does not authorise the computer experts to do anything else.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Secondly, paragraph 18 does not authorise anyone other than the computer experts to carry out the “analysis”. This implies that the “analysis” is an exercise that requires the computer experts’ expertise, which in turn implies that it will involve the use of technical tools. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Thirdly, paragraph 18 does not specify how the computer experts are supposed to identify listed items in order to “recover” them. Taken together with the preceding point, however, the implication is that the computer experts should use technical tools which enable them to identify listed items. The most obvious tool for this purpose is keyword searching using carefully selected keywords. Although paragraph 18 does not explicitly say so, this implies that TBD’s solicitors may provide the computer experts with a list of keywords to use, provided that the keywords are capable of discriminating between listed items and other items. </p>

In my view paragraph 18 must be understood as overriding that undertaking, but only in respect of listed items.    </p>

They do not, and cannot, apply to the subsequent “analysis” carried out pursuant to paragraph 18. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In addition to the points noted above, I consider that the following general considerations are pertinent to the interpretation of paragraph 18. First, the Search Order was granted on an application made without notice to Mr Simons, G2A or Mr O’Boyle. Secondly, the Search Order is by its nature highly intrusive. Thirdly, paragraph 18 permits the computer experts to take a copy of all files found on any computer (an expression which is widely defined) found on the premises, no matter how confidential and/or private and/or privileged and/or irrelevant to the proceedings they may be. In my judgment each of these considerations militates in favour of a narrow interpretation of paragraph 18. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Taking all of these points into account, I conclude that paragraph 18 did not authorise Acuity to inspect listed items recovered by the computer experts. Still less did it authorise them to inspect documents which did not qualify as listed items or documents which did qualify as listed items but were privileged. Nor did paragraph 18 authorise Acuity or TBD to use information obtained as a result of such inspection for the purposes of the proceedings. Still less did it authorise Acuity or TBD to use such information for extraneous purposes, such as making a complaint to the SRA or challenging Obcon’s claim to be a creditor of G2A in the liquidation.  </p>

TBD did not apply to the court for an order, as in my judgment it should have, but asserted that it was entitled to proceed unilaterally without putting the court fully into the picture. For the reasons I have given, TBD was not entitled to proceed unilaterally. Moreover, if the full picture had been disclosed, I cannot believe that any judge would have made an order approving the keyword search which Acuity instructed CY4OR to carry out. Moreover, in the event, CY4OR and Acuity went beyond even what Acuity had proposed. </p>

TBD’s second ground of appeal is that Marcus Smith J was wrong to order a review of the Searched Documents by independent solicitors at TBD’s expense. His reasons for making this order were, in summary, that he considered that, if the question had been properly canvassed before the court on 18 February 2019, the court would probably have ordered independent solicitors to undertake a privilege, selfincrimination and relevance review because it would not have been appropriate to entrust that task to Acuity as TBD’s solicitors and neither Mr Simons nor G2A had solicitors on the record.  </p>

It turned out that what counsel meant by this were (i) documents which TBD itself had obtained by its own investigations, (ii) documents contained in the nine lever arch files of exhibits to Mr Simons’ second affidavit, (iii) documents which were inspected by Acuity during the course of the execution of the Search Order and (iv) a statement of affairs for G2A obtained by TBD from the liquidator as a creditor. As counsel was forced to accept, however, there is no evidence that copies of any of these documents were included in the Searched Documents. Even if they were, it is plain from the sheer number of Searched Documents that they vastly exceeded the number available to TBD from other sources. Moreover, the Search Order contained some restrictions upon what could be done with documents in category (iii). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Thirdly, counsel for TBD placed reliance upon two consents for the use of documents given by G2A’s liquidator on 24 May 2019 and 16 August 2019. I shall have to consider the terms, and effect, of those consents when I come to the question of litigation privilege. Let it be assumed for the moment, however, that the liquidator has given a blanket consent to the use of G2A’s documents for the purposes of these proceedings, and has waived any privilege of G2A. Marcus Smith J held that the consents could not justify prior breaches of the Search Order. Counsel for TBD submitted that the question was not whether the consents justified the breaches, but what relief should be granted as a result of the breaches. I accept that the consents were relevant to the latter question, but I do not accept that they were a “significant, if not decisive, factor” as counsel for TBD submitted, for two reasons. First, the liquidator could not consent to the use of Mr Simons’ documents or waive any privilege of Mr Simons (leaving aside the position of Mr O’Boyle discussed below). Thus it would remain necessary for someone to review the Searched Documents for documents which are either (a) Mr Simons’ personal documents and irrelevant to the issues in the proceedings or (b) documents which are relevant but subject to privilege which can be asserted by Mr Simons. Secondly, although the liquidator could consent to the use of G2A’s documents, the mere fact of such consent would not mean that all the Searched Documents were relevant to TBD’s claims. Thus, even in the case of G2A’s documents, it would remain necessary for someone at some stage to review the Searched Documents to ascertain which are relevant.<span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif"> </span>It will save costs if this review is undertaken by the same solicitors who undertake the review of Mr Simons’ documents. </p>

I do not accept that this is a relevant factor for two reasons. The first is that the Searched Documents were obtained as a result of a court order.

As I have explained, Mr Simons objected promptly, but Acuity simply brushed his objections aside and proceeded unilaterally. Secondly, Simon Burn acting on behalf of the O’Boyle Defendants complained promptly in their letter dated 8 May 2019 (quoted in paragraph 94 above) once they became (partially) aware of what Acuity had done, but by then it was too late and in any event Acuity again brushed the complaint aside. </p>

This does not help for TBD for two reasons. First, the question of whether TBD had breached the Search Order was not fully considered by Judge Keyser, and he made no finding on the issue, whereas it was fully considered by Marcus Smith J, who did make a finding. Secondly, Marcus Smith J did not suggest that either TBD or Acuity had acted in bad faith.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The conclusion I reach is that the judge’s exercise of his discretion cannot be faulted upon the basis of the materials which were before the judge. Ordinarily, that would be the end of the matter. During the course of the appeal, however, TBD offered for the first time to agree to Simon Burn being permitted to conduct the review on behalf of all the Defendants, rather than an independent firm of solicitors. The O’Boyle Defendants consented to this course, Mr Simons raised no objection to it and it appears unlikely that the liquidator of G2A would have any objection. While this course of action has certain hazards associated with it, due to the conflict of interest between Mr Simons and the O’Boyle Defendants, I consider that those hazards are manageable, and it will have the considerable merit of saving costs in circumstances where it seems clear that the costs incurred are already disproportionate to what is at stake. Accordingly, I would vary the judge’s order to the extent of substituting Simon Burn for an independent firm of solicitors. </p>

Counsel for TBD submitted that this was unjustified, since in the absence of any breach of the Search Order, the Defendants would have had to give disclosure and inspection of relevant documents anyway, and in the first instance they would have had to pay for the necessary review of documents in their possession, custody or power. I do not accept this submission. The problem which confronts the court has been caused by TBD’s breaches of the Search Order. In those circumstances I consider that the judge was entitled to conclude that TBD should bear the cost of cleaning up the mess. I would add that G2A, being insolvent, obviously cannot pay anyway, and Mr Simons says he has limited means, which is why he is acting in person. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">A procedural question which was not canvassed during the course of argument, and only occurred to me when writing this judgment, is whether the court’s permission is also required to bring applications for committal for swearing a false affidavit. In the case of applications for committal for breaching a court order, permission is not required: see rule 81.12(1), (3). In <span style="font-style:italic">Hydropool Hot Tubs Ltd v Roberjot</span> [2011] EWHC 121 (Ch) I held at [58]-[60] that what was then rule 32.14 did not apply to affidavits, and this was followed in relation to rules 81.17(4)(a) and 81.18(1)(a), (3)(a) by Green J in <span style="font-style:italic">International Sports Tours Ltd v Shorey</span> [2015] EWHC 2040 (QB) at [39]-[42]. It is arguable, however, that the effect of rule 81.12(1), (3) is nevertheless to require permission. Fortunately, it is not necessary to reach a conclusion on this point. Either way, TBD could have brought an application for the committal of Mr Simons without the court’s permission on at least ground 1 (breaching the 4 July 2018 Order) even if it required permission to do so on ground 2 (swearing a false affidavit) as well as on ground 3 (making a false statement of truth in his Defence). Similarly, TBD did not need the permission of the court to apply for Mr O’Boyle’s committal on ground 1 alleged against him even if required permission to do so on grounds 2 and 4 as well as on grounds 3 and 5. </p>

If parties thought that they could gain an advantage by singling out these statements and making them the subject of a committal application, the usual process of litigation would be seriously disrupted. In general the proper time for determining the truth or falsity of these statements is at trial, when all the relevant issues of fact are before the court and the statements can be considered against the totality of the evidence. Further, the court will then decide all the issues according to the civil standard of proof and will not be applying the criminal standard to isolated issues, as must happen on an application under CPR Part 32.14.” </p>

Because of the close connection between that issue and the issues in the substantive claim against Mr O’Boyle, that seems to me to be an unattractive course.

The matters relied on by TBD are such that the possibility of committal proceedings cannot be ruled out, at least until after trial.

That should have led the judge to conclude that the application should be dismissed. Upon analysis, the only reason given by the judge for not taking that course in [6] was that it would be open to TBD to bring a further application later, and in particular after trial.

Secondly, TBD had served the affidavit of Mr Hitchcock relying upon evidence obtained from Searched Documents. Thirdly, Marcus Smith J had found that TBD had breached the Search Order in the ways discussed above. Fourthly, evidence had emerged of TBD’s “regrettable over-enthusiasm” in its pursuit of committal proceedings against Mr O’Boyle. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It follows, in my view, that the key question is whether those changes of circumstances justified Marcus Smith J in revoking the permission having regard to points (i) and (ii). If TBD had confined its application for committal of Mr Simons to ground 1, and had only relied in support of that ground upon Mr Simons’ admissions in his second affidavit, then no permission would have been required and it may be doubted whether a stay would have been justified. If permission was not required for ground 2, then the same might have gone for that ground. TBD has never sought to confine its application in that manner, however, but on the contrary seeks even now to maintain the full width of the application, including its reliance upon evidence obtained from Searched Documents. In those circumstances, I consider that Marcus Smith J was entitled to take the course that he did for the reasons he gave. A further consideration that supports his decision is that the allegations made against Mr Simons overlap with those made against Mr O’Boyle and raise matters which will have to be investigated at trial. As with the application against Mr O’Boyle, this means that an application against Mr Simons at this stage is premature. </p>

Counsel for Mr O’Boyle complained that Judge Keyser ought not finally to have determined this issue, but I do not understand this complaint. Mr O’Boyle raised the claim to privilege, and the judge ruled on it. That ruling was necessarily a final ruling which precluded the issue being argued again at the same level.

As I have explained, the text messages contained in the Transcript were found by Acuity amongst the Searched Documents as a result of the keyword searches carried out by CY4OR or Acuity acting on behalf of TBD, and subsequent reviews of Searched Documents by Acuity, over Mr Simons’ objections. It follows that there can be no question of Mr Simons having waived any privilege he may have in the Transcript. (The judge went on in [34] to say that Mr Simons could not claim privilege due to the iniquity exception, but as he recognised at [54] the view he expressed is not binding on Mr Simons.) </p>

Both Mr Simons and G2A were defendants to the litigation, and both Mr Simons and Mr O’Boyle were directors of G2A. The discussions in the Transcript are about obtaining evidence for the defence of the claim, obtaining advice from Mr Simons’ and G2A’s lawyers and the advice the lawyers have given. Counsel for TBD submitted that litigation privilege was restricted to (i) evidence (as opposed to communications about obtaining such evidence) and (ii) communications which revealed either what advice had been requested or what advice had been given. I do not accept that it is so narrowly confined, however. In any event, some of the texts fall into one or other of these categories. </p>

He also relied upon the fact that, as he put it, G2A did not have any money whereas Mr O’Boyle did. Finally, he relied on the fact that TBD had subsequently included Mr O’Boyle’s home among the premises to be searched under the Search Order. I am not persuaded that any of these points demonstrates that the judge was wrong. I would add that, so far as the second point is concerned, there is no evidence that G2A was in financial difficulty at the time, nor were we shown any evidence of Mr O’Boyle’s means.

That is a privilege in aid of anticipated litigation in which several persons have a common interest. It often happens in litigation that a plaintiff or defendant has other persons standing alongside him - who have the self-same interest as he - and who have consulted lawyers on the self-same points as he - but these others have not been made parties to the action. Maybe for economy or for simplicity or what you will. All exchange counsel's opinions. All collect information for the purpose of litigation. All make copies. All await the outcome with the same anxious anticipation - because it affects each as much as it does the others. Instances come readily to mind. Owners of adjoining houses complain of a nuisance which affects them both equally. Both take legal advice. Both exchange relevant documents. But only one is a plaintiff. An author writes a book and gets it published. It is said to contain a libel or to be an infringement of copyright. Both author and publisher take legal advice. Both exchange documents.

I have found it helpful, as both counsel did in argument, to go back to the examples given by Lord Denning, and in particular the example of the author and the publisher who exchange legal advice which they have separately obtained, but only one is sued – let us say, the publisher. It must, of course, be assumed for this purpose that litigation was not reasonably contemplated against the author at the relevant time (and that the author cannot claim legal advice privilege in respect of all of the relevant documents e.g. because some of documents merely record evidence that has been obtained). When the publisher is sued, the publisher can claim privilege in the documents relating to the advice it obtained in the ordinary way. And the author can claim common interest privilege to protect the copies of his or her documents that are in the hands of the publisher from being inspected by the claimant. </p>

I am not convinced that the authorities on waiver of privilege go that far, nor am I convinced that this letter does demonstrate that the liquidator does not care whether the documents are privileged or not.

It seems that the judge was assuming for this purpose that Mr O’Boyle was the innocent tool of Mr Simons, who was procuring a false document for the defence of the claim. There are a number of problems with this, however. First, Mr Simons and Mr O’Boyle (in his capacity as a director of G2A and Obcon) were both clients of the lawyers, while Mr O’Boyle in his personal capacity was not a client at all. Secondly, it is not entirely clear to me how, on that assumption, the communications were supposed to be furthering the fraud. Thirdly, TBD’s case is not that Mr O’Boyle was an innocent tool of Mr Simons, but the prime mover in a dishonest conspiracy to concoct a false defence. That would seem to require a determination as to whether there was a strong prima facie case that Mr O’Boyle was engaged in iniquity, but for the reasons touched on above Judge Keyser studiously (and understandably) avoided making any such determination.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">First, counsel for TBD submitted that the judge had wrongly failed to take into account the failure of the Original Defendants to respond to the pre-action correspondence. In my view this is a hopeless submission. Counsel argued that, if the Original Defendants had given the undertakings demanded, there would have been no proceedings and therefore no costs would now be being incurred by the O’Boyle Defendants. But this would have required the Original Defendants to capitulate, not merely to respond, and moreover to capitulate to demands that no properly advised defendant could have agreed to. Furthermore, there is no reason to believe that TBD would not have brought proceedings when it got the further evidence about G2A’s alleged infringements and every reason to think that it would have done. Yet further, the costs in question are costs being incurred by the O’Boyle Defendants, not the Original Defendants, and the O’Boyle Defendants deny liability. (In saying this, I have not overlooked the fact that Obcon is a member of both groups of Defendants.) Unsurprisingly, when asked whether TBD would waive its claim to damages against the O’Boyle Defendants, counsel’s reply was no. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Secondly, counsel for TBD submitted that the judge had wrongly failed to take into account TBD’s strong prospects of success. It is evident, however, that Marcus Smith J did not accept this argument even though he did not expressly deal with it. Counsel for TBD accepted in his skeleton argument before the judge that “parties should not attempt to go into the merits of the case unless it can be clearly demonstrated one way or another that there is a high degree of probability of success or failure – <span style="font-style:italic">Porzelack KG v Porzelack (UK) Ltd</span> [1987] 1 All ER 1074” (approved by this Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Keary Developments Ltd v Tarmac Construction Ltd </span>[1995] 3 All ER 534). Although he went on to submit that TBD’s case against Mr O’Boyle was sufficiently strong for this purpose, the submission was expressed to be contingent on the correctness of TBD’s reading of the Transcript (which is relied upon by TBD in support both of its application for permission to bring committal proceedings against Mr O’Boyle and of its underlying claims). Marcus Smith J did not accept that submission. Counsel for TBD endeavoured to argue before this Court that the Transcript realistically admitted </p>

I would dismiss TBD’s appeal against the order of Marcus Smith J, except that I would vary paragraph 2 of the order to provide for a review by Simon Burn instead of by an independent firm of solicitors.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I also agree. I would in particular like to endorse Arnold LJ’s view that a standard form of imaging order should be prepared as a matter of urgency. The present case underlines the need for imaging orders to strike a proper balance between the rights and interests of the parties. It is not satisfactory for this to be attempted on an <span style="font-style:italic">ad hoc </span>basis whenever an application for an imaging order is made. These applications are often made in a hurry and invariably on an <span style="font-style:italic">ex parte </span>basis. Essential safeguards may be omitted, as in this case, and inevitably there will be a lack of consistency in the safeguards that are included. As experience with the standard forms of freezing and search orders has shown, a particular advantage of a standard form of order is that the applicant must show the judge any proposed variation and justify it. </p>
