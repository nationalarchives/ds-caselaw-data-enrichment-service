	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Maesllech Farm, Radyr (“the farm”) lies on the outskirts of Cardiff. It consists of 240 acres of mostly arable land. In the local development plan it is identified as a strategic site for development. Outline planning permission has been granted to the freeholders for large scale housing development and other facilities. In order to comply with conditions attached to the planning permission, the freeholders have undertaken certain activities (in particular a habitat survey) on the farm. But the farm is let to Mr Jenkin Rees. The issue on this appeal is whether the landlords’ rights of entry under the tenancy agreements under which Mr Rees holds the farm were wide enough to permit them to carry out the activities that they wish to undertake. HHJ Keyser QC decided that some activities that the landlord proposed to carry out were permitted under the terms of the tenancy agreements; but that others were not. His judgment is at [2019] EWHC 1008 (Ch), [2019] 4 WLR 74. </p>

They have, by agreement with the tenant, dug trial pits for which they paid the tenant compensation. At other times, the landlords have also carried out a survey of a high-pressure gas main which required staking out the pipeline and taking GPS readings. It is not entirely clear what actual or proposed activities are now in issue. The landlords proposed to carry out an ecological survey in September 2016. The tenant initially refused access. That is what appears to have triggered the current dispute. The main focus of the ecological survey appears to be bats (although previous surveys have focussed on great crested newts). The bat survey, as I understand it, is carried out partly by surveyors physically present on site, counting bats into the night; and partly by remote bat detectors which are left on the farm for four or five days at a time. There is very little evidence before us about the nature of the remote bat detectors. In the trial bundle there were plans showing the location of 3 bat detectors called “Anabat”. We were also told in the landlords’ skeleton argument that these are boxes about 7 x 4 x 2 inches which are strapped to trees. </p>

He also complains that surveyors’ marking pins have been left in a field. We have photographs of those pins. They are about 1 inch across and 3 inches long. We do not know how many there were or where they were left. In his evidence Mr Jenkin Rees said that these were nails from the surveyors’ equipment; and were “extremely dangerous for humans, livestock and machinery”. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The judge considered a number of authorities on the interpretation of both exceptions and reservations in leases. He noted that there were cases that had held that a reservation of rights to the landlord under a lease should be narrowly interpreted; and cases that had held that a reservation of rights took effect as a regrant with the result that the tenant was the grantor. That led to the principle that a grant is construed against the grantor. He said at [55] that if it were the case that the court must construe a reservation restrictively against the landlord unless it cannot decide between alternative constructions, in which case it must choose on the basis of an expansive interpretation in favour of the landlord, the law would be incoherent. He continued at [56]: </p>

	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.01in;text-indent:0.00in">“In my judgment, the correct position is not that there is a rule of interpretation, as such, that a reservation is construed restrictively against the landlord. Rather, as part of the normal method of construing written instruments, the court will have regard to the entirety of the text and to the main subject matter of the agreement and, in the normal course of things, is likely to suppose that the intention of the parties is to advance the main purpose of the agreement as shown by its subject matter. Thus in the case of a lease, which necessarily grants exclusive possession and the right to quiet enjoyment, the court will naturally be inclined to suppose that qualifications on these rights will emerge clearly from the lease. This is not a matter of applying a special rule that a certain kind of provision must be construed against a particular party. It is simply a matter of applying the normal approach to construction. Accordingly, if, having regard to all relevant matters, the court finds that the normal approach to construction results in ambiguity, there is nothing irrational in resorting to the <span style="font-style:italic">contra proferentem</span> rule.” </p>

However, clause 7 does not mention any particular acts that may be performed once entry has been gained and to which the right of entry is ancillary. In this respect it differs from other express or implied rights of entry…This suggests that under clause 7 the reasonable purposes are to be achieved by either the mere fact of entry and presence on the land (notably, inspection and observation) or the performance of specific obligations under the tenancy agreement (such as repair of buildings). As the right of entry in clause 7 is not tied to a specific right or obligation (such as, the obligation to repair and the right to enter for the purpose of effecting repairs), it is reasonably construed as being wide enough to cover both instances.” </p>

It follows from what I have said already that such purposes ought to be construed as relating to inspection and observation. The extent of the activities thus permitted cannot be properly considered in the abstract and without regard to particular cases. However, in my judgment, the permissible activities do not extend to those which cause damage to the land or involve cordoning off parts of the land or significant interference with the operation of the working farm. First, the right is stated to be a right to enter; no other right is mentioned. Second, if the intention were to permit specific activities, not otherwise mentioned in the tenancy agreement, such as would tend to interfere with possession or quiet enjoyment, one would have expected that to have been stated rather than left for inference. Third, if intrusive activities were envisaged, the tenancy agreement would probably have mentioned the need to minimise disruption (see for example clause 3). Fourth, if the permitted activities were liable to cause damage, the tenancy agreement would probably have provided for the possibility of compensation (see for example clauses 3 and 4) or for the exclusion of compensation (see clause 3). I consider, accordingly, that the digging of excavations, the sinking of boreholes and the erection of structures all fall outside the limited rights in clause 7. The installation of monitoring devices, being a form of extended inspection, would I think be capable of falling within the scope of the rights in clause 7; much would depend on the position, nature and effect of the devices. I should consider that, absent special circumstances that I cannot now envisage, the installation of remote bat detectors would be permitted. I do not know enough about other kinds of device to speculate. Similarly, I consider that it would be permissible under the terms of clause 7 for a surveyor to place discreet reference points on the land in order to assist in conducting a visual survey and inspection; on the other hand, anything that involved significant interference with use of areas of the land or intrusion below its surface, or activities such as trial pegging out of intended development sites, would not be within the scope of the reserved rights.” </p>

If a landlord exercises rights in accordance with the terms of the lease or tenancy that cannot amount to a derogation from grant, because those rights are part of the grant itself. (There may be cases in which a right reserved by a lease is repugnant to the lease; but that is not suggested in this case).

In other words, Mr Sparrow submits that the court will not construe a general provision in a lease, particularly an exception and most of all an exception couched in very general terms such as those in clause 3, so as to take away with the other hand that which has already been granted by the one hand in the dispositive provisions of the lease.

Something that might be reasonable to do in the daytime might be unreasonable if done at night.

He accepts also that the landlords are not restricted merely to setting foot over the boundary. Having entered, they may continue to travel over the farm with or without vehicles. He also accepts that, having entered, the landlord may inspect the farm; and may place things on the ground if that is ancillary to inspection. But, he says, once the humans carrying out the inspection leave the farm they must take everything away with them. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Suppose that for the purposes of inspection a surveyor arrives in a motor vehicle which he parks off-site. He brings with him a surveying instrument, such as a theodolite. As Mr Jourdan accepts, he is permitted to place it on the ground. If by mistake he had left some other instrument in his car, he would surely be entitled to leave the theodolite in place while he went to retrieve that other instrument. Or he may wish to measure distances between points. Let us assume that he does so in an old-fashioned way by means of a measuring tape or measuring rod. He is entitled to place a marker in the ground at one end of what he wishes to measure. If the survey was not complete by the time the surveyor went home in the evening, it would surely be reasonable for him to leave his marker in place so as to avoid having to do the first day’s work all over again. </p>

They do this by serving notice in writing. Section 93 of the Act permits service by leaving the notice at the tenant’s proper address. The giving of such notice is without question a reasonable purpose for entering the farm. It would be a futile right if, having entered the farm with the notice in hand, the landlord then had to leave again, carrying the notice with him. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">I do not, therefore, accept Mr Jourdan’s stark proposition that all that the right of entry permits the landlords to do is to enter, inspect and then leave again; and cannot leave anything on the land even for a short time. In all these cases the question what is permitted is, in my judgment, to be determined by what is reasonable. As Mummery LJ said in <span style="font-style:italic">Risegold</span>, the right of entry must work sensibly; and a literal interpretation does not produce sensible results. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">If the landlord wishes to carry out more intrusive works, such as widespread CCTV or time lapse cameras for ecological or habitat monitoring, the degree of intrusion would have to be balanced against the reasonableness of the purpose. As the judge said, much would depend on the position, nature and effect of the devices. But that is not this case. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">There is one additional point so far as the bat detectors are concerned. If it is the case (as we were told in the landlords’ skeleton argument) that they are strapped to trees, it seems to me that, at least in the case of the land comprised in the 1965 agreement, they are not left on the farm at all. The reason for that is that trees are excepted from the grant as a result of clause 4. The trees have at all times remained the landlords’ property. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">So far as the 1968 agreement is concerned, the relevant purpose for which the landlord is entitled to enter the farm is “for the purpose of inspecting the same”. In <span style="font-style:italic">Possfund</span> the Inner House held that a right to inspect must not cause “any material disturbance” to the tenant or result in “material damage” to the premises. I agree. They also held that a right to inspect would not permit “intrusive investigations lasting several days”. That was, of course, a lease of a petrol filling station; and what might be intrusive in that context might not be intrusive in the case of a 51 acre farm. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">This seems to me, with all respect, to be a dispiriting ground of appeal, although it is one for which permission has been given. If the judge’s observation (and it is no more than that) had an insufficient evidential foundation, it must equally be the case that there was insufficient evidence to enable him to decide that the installation of the bat detectors and the placing of the reference points was prohibited. The consequence will be that the question whether the installation of bat detectors and the placing of surveyors’ marks are permitted by the tenancy agreements will not have been answered. Given the hostility that now exists between these parties, a failure to answer that question is likely to do no more than store up trouble for the future. In giving an answer to that question the judge was trying to be helpful and to avoid further dispute; and must have considered that he had sufficient material on which to base his observations. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The question, then, is whether the judge was entitled to form the view that there was sufficient material upon which he could base his observations. Because of the rather extreme position that both sides took at trial, the nuances of the evidence were not explored as well as they could have been. But there was material before the judge that showed that the bat detectors were a proprietary product called Anabat, and even a cursory search of the internet will find the proprietor’s website with a product description and picture. A judge may take judicial notice of matters which are capable of immediate accurate demonstration by resort to readily accessible sources of indisputable accuracy: <span style="font-style:italic">Scott v The Attorney General</span> [2017] UKPC 15 at [40] – [41]. He also had photographs of the surveyors’ marking pins. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The evidential basis for the judge’s conclusion was undoubtedly slender. But in my judgment it was enough. But even if that is wrong, what we can say is that if the Anabats are as described in the landlords’ skeleton argument, their installation on trees for a few days at a time is within the scope of the right to enter and inspect. </p>
