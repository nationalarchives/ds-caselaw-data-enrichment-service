	    <p style="margin-left:0.99in;margin-right:0.12in;text-indent:0.5in">The issue in this appeal is whether the decision of the prison authorities of 8 September 2017 to refuse to transport the appellant to the hearing of his civil claim in Oxford County Court, but instead facilitate his attendance by video link, was lawful. The appellant is a Category A prisoner who was sentenced in November 2009 to imprisonment for life with a minimum term of 18½ years.  He was convicted with his son of murder, and on two counts of causing grievous bodily harm with intent, all by stabbing.  He has since received a concurrent sentence for assaulting a prisoner at HMP Woodhill. At the time of the challenged decision he was serving his sentence at HMP Whitemoor.  He is now located elsewhere.  William Davis J dismissed the claim for judicial review: [2018] EWHC 2324 (Admin). </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.99in;margin-right:0.12in;text-indent:0.5in">The claim was advanced on two broad grounds, although the second had two distinct components.  First, that the failure to produce Jason Michael for the hearing of his claim in the County Court violated his right to a fair trial guaranteed at common law and by article 6 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms [“ECHR”].  Secondly, (a) that the decision failed to have regard to all the material factors in Mr Michael’s case, and indeed proceeded on a fundamental misunderstanding of central fact, and (b) the decision-maker applied an unlawful presumption (fettering of discretion) against producing a Category A prisoner in a civil court.  Permission to apply for judicial review was granted on those grounds by Morris J.  Shortly before the hearing of the claim for judicial review Mr Michael’s representatives sought to introduce a third ground by amendment, namely that the decision refusing to produce him at court was unlawfully taken by an official in the prison when the governing statute required it to be taken by “the Secretary of State”. In context, that meant an official within the relevant section of the Ministry of Justice. The argument was advanced in reliance upon the decision of the Supreme Court in <span style="font-style:italic">R (Bourgass) v. Secretary of State for Justice </span>[2016] AC 384.  William Davis J refused permission to advance that ground (“the <span style="font-style:italic">Bourgass</span> point”). His refusal to permit the amendment is also the subject of appeal before us. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.99in;margin-right:0.12in">4.<span style="font-family:Arial"> </span>We are satisfied that the decision did not violate Mr Michael’s rights to a fair trial and that the decision maker did not unlawfully fetter her discretion in refusing his request to be produced physically at the hearing of his claim.  Moreover, we consider that the case management decision made by the judge to refuse leave to argue the <span style="font-style:italic">Bourgass </span>point cannot be impugned on appeal. It is clear, however, that the decision was taken on the basis of a fundamental misunderstanding of an important fact, namely that the hearing would take place in a court with a secure dock.  We are unpersuaded that the decision would necessarily have been the same had the decision maker not made an error in assuming that the hearing would be in an ordinary court or the chambers of a judge. On that limited basis we have concluded that the decision is unsustainable and must be quashed.  It will be retaken in the light of up-to-date information, including the location and practical arrangements for any hearing, the risks associated with Mr Michael’s physical presence and the logistics, including cost, of arranging his attendance. </p>

The introduction identifies the primary consideration as whether “it is in the interests of justice that [the prisoner] should attend” but that when the interests of justice test is satisfied “the normal security considerations (e.g. risk to the public) must be taken into account.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.99in;margin-right:0.12in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Michael’s underlying civil claim was brought under the Data Protection Act 1998 against the solicitors who acted for him in his murder trial in 2009.  It was commenced in June 2015 in the County Court Money claims Centre.  He has other litigation in train.  He believes that his former solicitors retain documents from the criminal proceedings which would assist him in making an out-of-time application to the Court of Appeal Criminal Division for leave to appeal against conviction, in particular a statement from his son.  In form, the claim is made pursuant to section 7 of that Act on the basis that the solicitors have failed to comply with his data subject access request.  The solicitors deny having any material to produce.  With justification, the judge described the underlying claim as being “not easy to follow from the pleadings” and the basis of the claim “opaque”.  An application by the solicitors to strike out the claim in December 2016, which Mr Michael attended by video-link, was unsuccessful.  The strike out application was heard at Cambridge County Court.  Mr Michael was disturbed by the conduct of a prison officer supervising the link (he was said to be doodling) and also unhappy that the link was terminated too quickly, depriving him of the opportunity to have out-of-court discussions with the lawyer representing the solicitors.  In consequence, he filed an official complaint with the prison.  He has also later said that the noise outside the video-link room disturbed him.  </p>

An earlier allocation decision of 17 May had provided that the case be listed for hearing at Oxford County Court. The County Court is co-located with the Crown Court.  The expectation was that arrangements could be made for the hearing to take place in a court with a secure dock to facilitate Mr Michael’s physical presence.  The Deputy District Judge recognised that the question of production was for the prison authorities.   Mr Michael received notice of the trial date on 26 May 2017. On 5 June 2017 he applied to the prison authorities to be produced in person at the hearing.   In the absence of a positive response the appellant later made an application to the court for a production order, which was dismissed by Mr Recorder Rowlands on 17 August on the basis that he had no power to make the order.   There was no hearing and, although the application was served on the governor of Whitemoor, no written representations were made by or on behalf of the Ministry of Justice.  </p>

He explains that a Category A prisoner would not ordinarily be escorted outside the prison without the prior authority of the High Security Prisons Group in the Ministry of Justice. Any movement must be in a vehicle with a trained navigator and driver who remain in constant contact with the police.  In addition, three escorting officers are required.  Additional police support may be required both for the journey and at the court. There may be a need to transfer the prisoner to a local prison for a few days before a hearing, but advance warning of a move would not be given for security reasons.  There are regular risk assessments made of courts used for high security prisoners.  Mr Lyddiatt explains that it is extremely rare for Category A prisoners to be produced for civil hearings.  Quite apart from the onerous and expensive logistical burden in executing the production of a Category A prisoner, the planning and risk assessing of such an operation is time-consuming and labour intensive.  </p>

He rejected the core submission that a litigant in person engaging in civil proceedings can only have a fair hearing if he is in the courtroom with all the other parties.

The context of the decision, namely access to justice and the need for fairness in the proceedings, would always have been important considerations which would have given rise to anxious scrutiny.  Moreover, the question whether the impugned decision would result in procedural unfairness (if that was the challenge and having regard to all material factors) would be a matter for the reviewing court: <span style="font-style:italic">Gillies v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions </span>[2006] 1 WLR 981 per Lord Hope at [6]. “Its function is not merely to review the reasonableness of the decision-maker's judgment of what fairness required”: per Lord Reed in <span style="font-style:italic">R (Osborn) v Parole Board </span>[2014] AC 1115 at [65]. The power (like its predecessor discussed in the <span style="font-style:italic">Wynne </span>case) contemplates a two-stage decision making process.  First, do the interests of justice call for the physical presence of the prisoner at the court for the hearing in question?  Secondly, if the answer to that question is yes, production might yet be refused taking account of other factors such as risk and expense.  The nature of the decision making remains the same, but as we foreshadowed in paragraph 6 above, any decision made pursuant to paragraph 3(1) of schedule 1 to the 1997 Act must respect the article 6 rights of the prisoner concerned. In this regard, we see no difference between the protection provided by the common law and by the ECHR. </p>

The claimants argued that they should be present to given evidence and present when the defendant’s witnesses gave evidence.  They accepted that attendance by video-link was adequate for the balance of the trial, including when their witnesses gave evidence. The defendant wished all those in custody, including the claimants, to attend by video-link at all times. The judge concluded that “fairness does require that the Claimants give evidence in person and that they be present in court when the Defendant’s witnesses are giving evidence”.   He did not express the same view about the claimants’ witnesses. He accepted in principle that the consequence of producing the claimants would be that the Royal Courts of Justice would not be suitable as a venue.

It referred to both <span style="font-style:italic">Kabwe and Chungwu </span>and also to <span style="font-style:italic">Marcello Violla</span>. The case concerned civil proceedings brought against the state by a prisoner convicted of multiple murders.  He alleged medical negligence in treating him.  He was not produced for the hearings of his claim, which was dismissed in his absence after argument from the State. He complained that the civil proceedings had been unfair and that he had been given no opportunity to be present at the hearings to advance his case.  He argued that his personal testimony about his medical treatment was necessary especially as his medical file had been lost. Russia contended that his participation through written materials was sufficient to vindicate his article 6 rights and that he could have used a lawyer.

Article 6.1 leaves to the State a free choice of the means to be used in guaranteeing litigants these rights. … For instance, as a way of securing the applicant’s participation in the proceedings, the national authorities could have held a session by way of video link or in the detention facility. …  However, these options were not considered.” </p>

As the judge observed, it is not established by the medical evidence produced in these proceedings, still less on what was known to the decision maker, that he would be better off physically present at the court.  Indeed, the reference to conflict being generated by his difficulties in understanding or appreciating the position of others with whom he interacts at least raises the question whether it would be better for him to be at one remove, even though he believes he would be better off present.  The judge’s assessment of the likely nature of the hearing, namely that it would not involve the credibility of Mr Michael and would centre on the solicitors’ explanation of the documents they held and whether they had been produced, was obviously correct.    When considered in the light of the Strasbourg jurisprudence, it is not possible to sustain a contention that Mr Michael’s participation by video link would violate his article 6 rights or that he would be deprived of a fair hearing if he attended by video-link.  He would be able to participate effectively and present both his evidence and argument.  He could question the witness from his previous solicitors.  In such circumstances the judge, whose function is to ensure a fair trial, would be especially astute to ensure that Mr Michael was not placed at a disadvantage and would be alert to any practical constraints under which he was working.   </p>

It is an interesting and thoughtful piece of work but not one which supports the broad submission that the use of a video link in Mr Michael’s case would result in his civil proceedings being unfair.  The judge had before him a report from Transform Justice, a charity set up in 2012, the <span style="font-style:italic">alter ego</span> of Penelope Gibbs, a former magistrate, entitled “Defendants on video – conveyor belt justice or a revolution in access?”.  In her conclusions she makes the observation that “t<span style="font-size:12.5pt">he unanswerable question is whether virtual justice does make any difference to justice outcomes. Bar the 2010 study on virtual courts we have no research in England and Wales which assesses the impact on court decisions.”  That study was concerned </span>with a pilot that ran from May 2009 for 12 months in two magistrates’ courts in London and North Kent.  Amongst the concerns raised by Ms Gibbs is that the physical separation of a defendant in criminal proceedings from the court may itself result in less favourable outcomes.  That is a subject ripe for further investigation, but the report does not advance Mr Michael’s article 6 case.   </p>

Indeed, it refers to the interests of justice being the primary consideration. In any event, the decision must respect the prisoner’s fair trial rights and in terms states that “if it appears that the prisoner’s case will suffer detriment if they do not attend, this would be a strong case for allowing the production”.  Ms Cox’s decision, flawed though it was for reasons to which we will turn next, did not proceed on the basis that a Category A prisoner could never be physically produced in a civil court. In earlier correspondence it was said that it would be highly unlikely that a Category A prisoner would be produced in a civil trial.  Given the security and logistical difficulties in doing so that is no more than a reflection of the reality, particularly given the availability of video-link participation which in most, if not all, circumstances would enable a self-represented prisoner to take part effectively in a civil trial.        </p>

He is no longer at HMP Whitemoor.  His personal risk profile may, or may not, be the same.  His medical condition may have changed for better or worse. The claim may, or may not, proceed in Oxford. It may or may not be possible for the claim to be heard in a court with a secure dock.  It is clearly in the interests not only of Mr Michael but also of the solicitor defendants in the underlying civil action that it is resolved as soon as possible.  The interests of justice embrace concepts wider simply than whether a fair trial is possible, as PSO 4265 recognises.  In describing a balancing exercise in her decision, Ms Cox recognised that the interests of justice weighed in favour of production to some extent.  We are very far from persuaded that it is inevitable, irrespective of the circumstances as they now are, that a decision maker would be bound to refuse Mr Michael’s request for production.  He should not read into that observation any hint (or otherwise) that his production should be facilitated.  We have concluded that his participation by video link would not infringe his common law or ECHR rights to a fair trial.  However, the Order requires a more subtle approach than simply to ask whether attendance by video link would accord with fair trial rights.    </p>

He took the view that a full analysis of the issue would be assisted by evidence. The respondent had also submitted that the grounds of resistance had not dealt with the point and that input and instructions from the Ministry of Justice and relevant directorate were necessary to deal with a point that might have far-reaching implications.  For these reasons, the judge refused permission to introduce the new ground.  Nevertheless, on the basis of the information that was available, the judge reached the provisional conclusion that <span style="font-style:italic">Bourgass </span>did not assist Mr Michael and that the decision had been taken by someone qualified to do so on behalf of the Secretary of State.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.99in;margin-right:0.12in;text-indent:0.5in">In our view, there are a number of aspects of the argument that need attention in both evidence and argument. Both PSO 4265 and the correspondence state, as regards Category A prisoners, that decisions on production to courts be authorised by the Directorate of High Security Prisons.  It is not clear whether this decision was referred to the Directorate; the evidence is silent on the point.  We heard no argument on whether the Order envisages authorisation only if the governor has concluded (provisionally) that a Category A prisoner should be produced and thus whether refusal is left entirely to the governor.  We also heard no argument, or had evidence, on the question of the extent to which a decision could be taken further down the hierarchy within a prison.  There was no evidence about the relationship generally between the Ministry of Justice and prisons in decision making on production of prisoners, not only Category A but other prisoners too.  Mr Rule’s submission, if correct, would disable the staff in a prison from making decisions about the production to a court of any prisoner, not only those in Category A. </p>

The same rule limits the period of segregation to 72 hours unless authorised by “the Secretary of State”.  Prison Service Order 1700 purported to authorise the Secretary of State’s extension decision to be taken by governors and other senior prison officers in conjunction with others on a panel.  The Supreme Court concluded that the governor, an office holder under the statutory scheme, and the Secretary of State have separate functions under rule 45.  That precluded the governor (a term which itself has more than one meaning) exercising the Secretary of State’s functions pursuant to the <span style="font-style:italic">Carltona </span>principle.   </p>
