While the judge felt bound to dismiss the Claimant’s appeal, she recognised that the case raised issues about: (a) the extent to which an ET should assist a litigant in person in formulating issues; and (b) the circumstances in which an ET can depart from an agreed list of issues when one party is a litigant in person and the list of issues appears to be deficient when compared to the original pleaded case.   </p>

Two other individuals, Mr Smith (the Production Manager) and Simon Hawkes (the Design Engineer), also worked in the office.

Where a litigant in person has decided not to advance a claim, “the ET should be confident that the litigant in person has done so advertently.” The Judge noted that “a person with no legal training might well think that if she wanted to bring an unfair dismissal claim, the last thing that it would be in her interest to concede would be that she had resigned rather than been dismissed”. </p>

The judge was, therefore, entitled to proceed on the basis that the only issue in relation to the claim for unauthorised deduction from wages and breach of contract was whether there was an agreement that the claimant be paid a salary. Having decided that there was such an agreement, she not unnaturally upheld the contract claim as being outstanding on termination. She never dealt with any argument that nothing was outstanding because the company could not afford to pay the claimant's salary and still less with any argument that, even if the company could not afford to pay it, it was necessary to imply a term that, nevertheless, the company was obliged to pay once the employment had come to an end.

It will no doubt be an unusual step to take, but what is “necessary in the interests of justice” in the context of the tribunal’s powers under Rule 29 depends on a number of factors. One is the stage at which amending the list of issues falls to be considered. An amendment before any evidence is called is quite different from a decision on liability or remedy which departs from the list of issues agreed at the start of the hearing. Another factor is whether the list of issues was the product of agreement between legal representatives. A third is whether amending the list of issues would delay or disrupt the hearing because one of the parties is not in a position to deal immediately with a new issue, or the length of the hearing would be expanded beyond the time allotted to it.   </p>

Their function is to hear the case the parties choose to put before them, make findings as to the facts and to decide the case in accordance with the law. The suggestion that, in the present case, the employment judge committed some error of law in failing to engage in the sort of inquiry that Mr Hopkin suggested is, in my judgment, inconsistent with the limits of the role of such judges as explained by this court in <span style="font-style:italic">Mensah v.

Of course an employment judge, like any other judge, must satisfy himself as to the law that he must apply to the instant case; and if he assesses that he has received insufficient help on it from those in front of him, he may well be required to do his own homework.

However, in order to do justice to all parties, it is equally important, where at least one of those parties is unrepresented, to clarify the issues which arise on the pleadings and to seek to confirm whether any and, if so, which claims have been conceded.  </p>
