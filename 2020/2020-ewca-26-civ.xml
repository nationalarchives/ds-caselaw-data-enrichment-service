	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">This appeal against the order of Andrew Hochhauser QC sitting as a Deputy Judge of the Chancery Division raises two separate issues relating to the recovery of legal costs incurred in the course of extensive litigation conducted in London and in several other jurisdictions around the world.  The Appellant, Candey Limited (‘Candey’), is an English registered company based in London. For a number of years Candey acted as the legal representative for a party to that litigation, Peak Hotels &amp; Resorts Ltd (‘Peak’), a company incorporated in the BVI.  Peak is now being wound up in insolvency proceedings brought in the BVI court and the Respondents (‘the Liquidators’) were appointed by that court as the liquidators of Peak on 8 February 2016.  Shortly after they were appointed, the Liquidators replaced Candey with other solicitors. A dispute then arose between the Liquidators and Candey about Candey’s claim to unpaid fees owed to it by Peak.  For the purpose of that dispute, Candey was represented by an English firm of solicitors, Candey LLP.  Following one of many hearings that have taken place to resolve that dispute, the Liquidators were ordered to pay some of Candey’s legal costs. The first issue in this appeal is whether the Liquidators are bound under that costs order to pay a success fee which Candey asserts it is bound to pay its lawyers Candey LLP under a conditional fee agreement (‘CFA’) between Candey and Candey LLP.  For reasons that will become clear, this issue has been called the Exemption Issue because it turns on whether an exemption from the general prohibition on the recovery of a success fee from opposing parties applies to the proceedings between Candey and the Liquidators. The judge decided the Exemption Issue in favour of the Liquidators, holding that the proceedings were not covered by the exemption and so the success fees were not recoverable from the Liquidators as part of Candey’s costs.  Candey appeals against that decision. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The second issue relates to Candey’s claim in the Peak insolvency proceedings to recover the unpaid fees it was owed by Peak for the legal work done.  Candey asserts an equitable lien which it submits the court can and should convert into a charge on Peak’s assets under section 73 of the Solicitors Act 1974 to secure those unpaid fees. This is referred to as the Lien Issue.  On this issue the judge also found in favour of the Liquidators that the lien over Peak’s assets had been waived by Candey and was no longer enforceable.  Candey appeals against this finding.  The judge did not agree with all the arguments that the Liquidators put forward as to why the lien no longer operated in Candey’s favour. There is a Respondents’ Notice from the Liquidators raising again some of the arguments that the judge rejected as alternative reasons for upholding his decision that the lien has been waived.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The factual background to this dispute was set out in the judge’s clear and comprehensive judgment reported at [2019] EWHC 282 (Ch). I need only provide a brief outline here. Peak was incorporated in January 2014 to hold shares in a joint venture vehicle which owned a group of boutique luxury hotels. Relations between the joint venture partners broke down and Peak became embroiled in litigation for which Candey acted as its legal representative between April 2014 until 2 March 2016. There were proceedings in London, Hong Kong, in the BVI and in New York.  One set of proceedings in which Candey acted on Peak’s behalf was the claim brought by Peak in June 2014 in the Chancery Division of the High Court in London. This was referred to by the parties as the ‘London Litigation’. In the course of the London Litigation, Peak paid first $10 million and then £3 million into court to fortify its cross-undertaking in damages when it was granted injunctive relief and to provide security for the defendants’ costs. By August 2015 Peak owed Candey several hundreds of thousands of pounds in unpaid legal fees and could not continue to finance the litigation in which it was involved. Peak and some of its backers negotiated a fixed fee with Candey to cover all the litigation going forward. Those backers included the American company Campion Maverick Inc although it was not involved in negotiating the fixed fee. The negotiations culminated in an agreement between Candey and Peak dated 21 October 2015 (‘the FFA’) under which Candey agreed to continue to act for Peak in various proceedings including the London Litigation.  The FFA provided that Peak would pay: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Pursuant to an obligation in clause 11 of the FFA, a deed of charge and security was executed between Peak and Candey also on 21 October 2015 (‘the Deed of Charge’). By the Deed of Charge Peak purported to create in favour of Candey (i) a fixed charge over its assets and undertakings; (ii) a fixed charge over all damages, costs, monies and other sums or benefits flowing from all the claims it was involved in; and (iii) a floating charge over any further assets which were not capable of being charged by a fixed charge. The Deed of Charge was then registered in the BVI.  The Lien Issue is, in short, whether by entering into this Deed of Charge with Peak, Candey has waived its entitlement to rely on its equitable lien over any fruits of the London Litigation.  </p>

The proof of debt referred to the Deed of Charge as the security for the debt, describing it as creating ‘fixed and floating charges’ over all of Peak’s assets.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">It rapidly became clear that there was going to be a dispute between Candey and the Liquidators over the payment of the sums due under the FFA. The Liquidators took the view that Candey’s charge under the Deed of Charge was only a floating charge rather than a fixed charge. Moreover, they considered that Peak had been unable to pay its debts when it entered into the Deed of Charge so that the floating charge in favour of Candey could only secure the value of services provided by Candey after the creation of the Deed of Charge, in accordance with section 245 of the Insolvency Act 1986 (‘the IA 1986’).   </p>

The order stayed all proceedings against Peak except for the proceedings listed in paragraph 3 of the order. Paragraph 4 of the order provided that the Liquidators have liberty to apply for relief under Article 21 of the Model Law.  On 31 March 2016 Candey concluded a CFA with Candey LLP which is an English law firm regulated by the Solicitors Regulation Authority. It is a separate entity from Candey although it operates from the same offices and appears to have the same fee earners. Under the CFA, Candey was obliged to pay a 100% success fee to Candey LLP in the event that Candey was successful in its dispute with the Liquidators.  Candey gave notice to the Liquidators of the CFA on 9 May 2016. </p>

A consent order was made by Asplin J dated 7 March 2016. The order directed the payment out of the sums that Peak had paid into court, directing that some of it be paid to Peak. The result was that about US$10 million and £1.6 million were paid back to Peak in May 2016. Subsequently, Peak received a further $1.5 million arising from the settlement (referred to as ‘the SCB Monies’ because they were held in an account at Standard Chartered Bank). Those are the monies, referred to as ‘the Settlement Proceeds’ over which Candey now asserts its solicitors’ equitable lien.  </p>

He held that the fixed fee set in the FFA was a fair and reasonable fee for work done by Candey on behalf of Peak and that that sum was payable by the Liquidators to Candey with interest ([2017] EWHC 3388 (Ch)). Following a hearing to determine the costs and other consequential matters relating to the Liquidators’ Application, HHJ Raeside also ordered on 5 December 2017 that the Liquidators pay 80% of Candey’s costs with a payment of £538,780 on account. An appeal by the Liquidators in relation to the value of services issue was heard on 13 December 2018 and judgment was pending at the time of the hearing before Mr Hochhauser QC.  The Liquidators’ appeal was allowed on 8 March 2019 ([2019] EWCA Civ 345) and the valuation of services issue was remitted to the High Court. On 25 March 2019 the Court of Appeal gave consequential directions including that the costs of the first instance hearings, both of the value of services issue and of the other issues in the Liquidators’ Application, were reserved to the trial judge at the conclusion of the remitted hearing.  Judgment on the remitted value of services issue was handed down by HHJ Davis-White QC on 20 December 2019, after the hearing of this appeal ([2019] EWHC 3558 (Ch)). The judgment set a timetable for computing the value of services and for dealing with consequential matters such as costs early in 2020.  The ultimate decision on who will pay the costs of the Liquidators’ Application is therefore still pending at the time of this judgment.  </p>

This means that a court may still order the Liquidators to pay the success fee, as part of any costs they are ordered to pay to Candey in the Liquidators’ Application, if the Liquidators’ Application counts as proceedings in England and Wales brought by a person acting in the capacity of a liquidator of a company which is being wound up in England and Wales under Parts IV or V of the IA 1986.

Mr Lord QC, appearing for Candey, accepts that the Liquidators are not ‘acting as’ English liquidators but that is not, he says, what article 4 requires.  Some meaning must be given to the additional words ‘in the capacity of’ an English liquidator and those words cover not only actual English liquidators but also foreign liquidators who have the capacity to exercise such powers because they are recognised under the CBIR.  Capacity must not be confused with status; although the Liquidators retain the status of foreign representatives under the recognition order they now have the same powers and abilities as an English liquidator and therefore brought the Liquidators’ Application in the capacity of an English liquidator.  </p>

An analysis of the CBIR shows that the recognition order does not have the effect that the foreign representatives are thereafter treated as either acting as or acting in the capacity of an English liquidator.  The CBIR provide that the Model Law has the force of law in Great Britain in the form set out in Schedule 1 to the Regulations. Article 1 of Schedule 1 provides that the Model Law applies where assistance is sought in Great Britain by a foreign representative in connection with the foreign proceeding. A foreign representative is defined in article 2(j) as including a person or body authorised in a foreign proceeding to administer the liquidation of the debtor’s assets or affairs. This can be contrasted with the definition of a ‘British insolvency office holder’ defined as including a person acting as an insolvency practitioner within the meaning of section 388 of the IA 1986, other than an administrative receiver.  </p>

When foreign representatives make such an application, they are exercising the right conferred on them by Article 21(1)(g) of Schedule 1 and not the right conferred on them by section 168 IA 1986. The fact that the Liquidators’ Application referred to section 168 as well as to Article 21 does not affect the legal analysis of the powers that are available to them. Indeed, if the effect of the recognition order was generally to deem a foreign representative to have the same abilities, capacities and powers of a British insolvency practitioner, Article 21 would be redundant because the foreign representative would automatically have the powers that the Schedule expressly confers on him. </p>

The provisions that refer to the recipient of the recognition order still refer to him as the foreign representative. Article 20(5) contemplates that there might be British insolvency proceedings as well as the foreign proceedings. I do not accept that the fact that some of the powers or forms of relief listed as being available to a recognised foreign representative are, on their owns terms, limited to cases where a company is being wound up in England and Wales has the effect for which Mr Lord contends.  The effect of Article 21 is to widen the scope of application of those provisions so that they are no longer applicable only in the circumstances that they themselves specify </p>

	    <p style="margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">but also in circumstances where Article 21 applies.  Further, as Mr Holland QC acting for the Liquidators pointed out, the powers or capabilities of the foreign representative are not in fact precisely the same as those of an English liquidator. For example, the capabilities of a recognised foreign representative are qualified by Article 22 of Schedule 1. This provides that before granting relief the court must be satisfied that the interests of creditors are adequately protected and may require the foreign representative to provide security for the proper performance of his functions as a condition of granting relief. Article 23 also modifies the IA 1986 provisions listed in subparagraph (2) in various ways so that they apply in this context differently from how they apply to an English liquidator.  </p>

If that had been the intention it would have been a simple matter to make that clear.  One can see many difficulties that would need to be addressed if the exception were intended to cover foreign representatives, for example whether a success fee is recoverable if it is payable under a CFA which is governed by the law of the place of the foreign proceedings rather than English law.   </p>

In order to benefit from article 4 of the LASPO Order, a person who is an English liquidator must be bringing the proceedings as part of the performance of those functions and not in some other personal or professional capacity, for example if he sues for his fees.  The judge was right to hold that one does not need to draw a distinction between a person ‘acting as’ an English liquidator and a person acting ‘in the capacity of’ an English liquidator in order to give some meaning to that phrase; in this context the two phrases mean the same thing.   </p>

A company in respect of which a recognition order was made would not qualify as ‘a company which is being wound up in England and Wales’ for the purposes of article 4(e).  There would therefore be a significant disparity between the scope of article 4(e) and the scope of article 4(c)(i).  Similarly, there would be a disparity between the scope of article 4(f) where a company can only benefit from the exception if it has actually entered administration under Part II of the IA 1986.  If Candey’s construction applied to the wording in article 4(d) too, a foreign representative acting ‘in the capacity of’ an administrator of such a company would also fall within the exemption if those foreign administration proceedings were recognised under Schedule 1 to the CBIR even though he was not appointed under Part II.  I can see no rational basis for Parliament to have chosen that as an appropriate way of determining the scope of the exemption. </p>

He might be entitled to bring proceedings here under the EU Regulation 2015/848 on Insolvency and he may be entitled to relief at common law.  Mr Lord accepted that a foreign liquidator would not be acting ‘in the capacity of an English liquidator’ if he brought proceedings using one of those other routes so that the exemption in article 4 would not apply.  He argued, however, that there was a rational basis for making such a distinction.  If a foreign liquidator brings proceedings under one of the other three routes, he does not limit himself to the kinds of relief available to an English liquidator but can, for example, ask the court to grant relief that is available under BVI law.  I see that that may be a distinction between the CBIR route and the other three routes, but I do not see why the kind of relief being sought in the proceedings should make any difference to the ability of the liquidator to recover the success fee.  On the contrary, the availability of the exemption conferred by article 4 under one route but not the others would risk skewing the decision of the foreign liquidator as to which route was otherwise the most appropriate and efficient way to get in the money for the estate.  </p>

The saving in article 4 not only allows the recoverability of the success fee by a successful English liquidator but also empowers the court to order the English liquidator to pay the success fee of the opposing party if the proceedings fall within the provision.  If the Liquidators’ construction is right, a foreign representative is protected from the risk of having to pay the opposing party’s success fee whereas an English liquidator is not.  I accept that the more limited construction urged by the Liquidators does have that consequence.  However, that result does not strike me as being so absurd as to mean that the more limited construction cannot be correct. It is rational for Parliament to have intended to limit the exception to English liquidators bringing proceedings to get in funds to distribute to creditors based in this jurisdiction.  It would be unfair to make the exception one-sided by allowing English liquidators to recover a success fee but not allowing their opponents to do so. I see no justification for extending the exception beyond that.  </p>

The kinds of conduct that can amount to the waiver of a lien include where the parties enter into a new arrangement to provide the creditor with security for the debt already secured by the lien. Waiver can arise by inference if the holder of the lien enters into a new security arrangement with the debtor when the terms of that new arrangement are inconsistent with the terms of the lien he already holds.

This difference ‘arises from the fact that it is the duty of the solicitor to explain to his client the effect of that which the client is about to do.’ (p. 477). Buckley LJ also confirmed that properly read, the judgments of the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Re Taylor</span> did not go so far as to say that the taking of <span style="font-style:italic">any</span> additional security without reservation of the lien would amount to an abandonment of the lien.

Kennedy LJ agreed with the result but applied a broader principle. His inclination was to hold that the fiduciary duty owed by the solicitor to his client meant that whatever the nature of the security, its acquisition in addition to the lien must be an advantage to the solicitor and the taking of something of value from the client.  The solicitor must therefore either by express words or by necessary implication make that intention known to his client by reserving the lien. If the solicitor fails to prove that reservation, he should be treated as having abandoned his lien.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">More recently there have been two judgments in the Chancery Division arising from the same proceedings. In <span style="font-style:italic">Clifford Harris &amp; Co v Solland International Ltd &amp; ors (No 1) </span>[2004] EWHC 2488 (Ch) (‘<span style="font-style:italic">Solland (No 1)</span>’)<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>the solicitors Clifford Harris sought orders under section 73 charging money received under a settlement of proceedings in which they acted for Mr and Mrs Solland. The Sollands’ defence was that they had executed a legal charge over their house in favour of Clifford Harris to secure the present and future costs and disbursements of the litigation.  They submitted that the grant of the legal charge constituted a waiver by Clifford Harris of the right to any lien or charging order and applied to strike out Clifford Harris’s application. At the hearing of the strike out application, David Richards J held that the principle of waiver applied as much to the lien under section 73 as it applied to any possessory lien: para. 15. The key questions were whether the new security was inconsistent with the solicitor’s rights at common law and under section 73, and, because of the fiduciary relationship between them, did the solicitor inform the client that he was reserving those legal rights: ‘If it is inconsistent, it will be taken to waive the solicitor’s other rights, unless he has reserved them’: para 17.  One issue raised was whether the legal charge could be inconsistent with the lien even though it was secured on different property – the Sollands’ home – from the lien which was secured on the settlement recoveries.  David Richards J noted (at para. 29) that there had been no authority cited to him that the taking of a charge on an unrelated asset was inconsistent with the solicitor’s lien and he considered it well arguable that as a matter of principle there was no such inconsistency. He accepted that the authorities did establish that if the new security arrangements confer a right to interest not otherwise payable, that would be inconsistent with the lien.  He held, however, that the contractual position under the legal charge and the original retainer were unclear. The strike out application therefore failed since there was no obvious inconsistency.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">was ‘somewhat more readily to be found in the case of a solicitor’s lien than in the case of other liens’.  This also accorded with principle since it was difficult to see why a solicitor should be taken to have abandoned a lien by taking a security which is in no way inconsistent with it.  He rejected the submission that the parties’ subjective intention was relevant. The judge then held that it was not inconsistent with the lien for the solicitor to take a security by way of charge on separate assets from those protected by the lien. However, in the case before him the legal charge was inconsistent because it provided for the payment of interest whereas the provision purporting to charge interest in the original solicitors’ retainer was unenforceable. The section 73 right had therefore been waived by Clifford Harris taking the legal charge over the Sollands’ home.  He went on, however, to find on the facts that there had been an agreement between the solicitors and the Sollands that the debt would be paid out of the settlement monies and that that was sufficient to create an equitable charge in the solicitors’ favour without the need to rely either on the lien or on the legal charge. </p>

Questions of inconsistency and the reservation of the lien simply do not arise because Candey has put itself in the position of a banker or innkeeper. Such inconsistencies as may exist between the terms of the Deed of Charge and the attributes of the security acquired by the solicitors’ lien are not enough to amount to the kind of clear abandonment of their rights that would be necessary to defeat the lien claimed by a lien holder who is not a solicitor in a fiduciary relationship.   </p>

Mr Lord relied on the decision of this Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Twigg Farnell (a firm) v Wildblood </span>(1998) PMLR 211 (CA). In that case the defendant solicitors acted for the plaintiff until 1991. The solicitor/client relationship ceased in 1991 and there followed contentious litigation about the claim for the unpaid fees by the solicitors. That litigation resulted in a judgment for a debt, namely the unpaid fees, together with an award of interest and costs to the solicitor as the successful party in the litigation. The judgment debt and interest were not paid so the former solicitor applied for a charging order over the former client’s property. The question arose whether that charging order replaced the lien that the former solicitor had for his costs. Mummery LJ referred to <span style="font-style:italic">Re Taylor</span> as explaining the principle underlying the general rule that where the solicitor/client relationship is still existing the court may infer from all the circumstances of the case that the taking of the security by the solicitor who has a lien amounts to an abandonment of his lien.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgment this argument does not provide the knock-out blow for which Candey was hoping. The argument must be rejected because it misunderstands why equity sets a different threshold for solicitors from that set for other lien holders.  Lindley LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Re Taylor </span>referred at p. 597 to the solicitor’s duty to explain to his client ‘the effect of what he is about to do’.  Kay LJ in the same case referred to the duty of the solicitor ‘to represent to his client all the facts of the case in a clear and intelligible manner and to inform him of his rights and liabilities’. I do not see that duty as focused on the terms of the new arrangements for additional security. What needs to be explained in a clear and intelligible manner is the combined effect of the new security and the lien on the prospects of the client recovering anything of value to him personally from success in the litigation in which the solicitor is instructed. The relevance of the solicitor’s fiduciary duty in this circumstance is that the solicitor is seeking to ensure that his unpaid fees and future fees are paid out of the recoveries from the litigation in which he is representing the client. The client should be made aware that even though he is now being asked to grant security over the litigation recoveries on the terms of the new arrangements being negotiated with him, the solicitor will still have a first call on those recoveries.  In most circumstances, as in Peak’s case, the client is facing in effect a choice between either signing a new security agreement with his solicitors or abandoning the litigation.  It is essential that in making that choice he has a complete understanding of what his solicitors’ prior claims to the proceeds of the litigation will be if he continues to fight the case and thereby incur further legal fees. That is what the solicitor is under a duty to explain to him and why it is so important that the client understands that any monies he ultimately recovers are subject not only to the security he is now providing to his solicitors but also to their pre-existing lien which will continue in parallel with the new security arrangements. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Looked at in that light, it is clear that simply arranging for the client to obtain advice from an independent lawyer about the terms of the new security arrangement does not help.  The independent adviser is in no better position than the client to know what the litigation solicitor’s intentions are with respect to the equitable lien and so cannot explain this to the client.  I accept that it might, depending on the circumstances, be sufficient to reserve the lien if the litigation solicitor made it clear to the independent adviser that the lien was to continue in addition to the new arrangement.  But merely interposing an independent adviser to discuss with the client the merits of the new security arrangement does not enable the litigation solicitor to avoid the duty to explain the effect of the new security on his existing lien.  Mr Lord submits that the independent adviser’s task is simple. He should know that the litigation solicitor has a lien and that his own involvement means that any nice questions about inconsistencies between the lien and the proposed new security are irrelevant.  As long as there is no clear abandonment of the lien, he can confidently advise the client that the lien continues to exist.  That, however, would put the client in a false position as regards the litigation solicitor who is continuing to act for him.  He may be unwilling to seek clarification from his litigation solicitor as to who will get what from any settlement that is being discussed or from any final judgment in case he jogs the litigation solicitors’ memory about the lien which he did not in fact have in mind.   </p>

That case before the Court of Appeal of Northern Ireland concerned an action brought by the plaintiff client for the return of title deeds and other documents over which the solicitor claimed a lien for his fees.  The facts are most clearly set out in the judgment of Best LJ. The solicitors’ defence to the action claiming the return of the documents was twofold. First, that the documents were detained by virtue of a solicitor’s lien for costs and monies advanced to the plaintiff some years before. Alternatively, they contended that the documents were held by the solicitor as mortgagee under a mortgage made between the plaintiff’s father George Curry and the solicitor to secure the payment of the solicitors’ fees which he owed them for legal work and for the repayment of some monies loaned to him. The mortgage was subject to interest at 5% per annum. Best LJ identified the relevant question as ‘What became of the lien on the execution of the mortgage?’. He held that it was either waived or abandoned or became merged in the security of the mortgage: </p>

In that case the solicitor Mr Kimber acted for Mr Groom in a claim against Mr Cheesewright for shares in Fifeshire Main Collieries together with monies alleged to be owed to him.  During the course of the action, Mr Groom executed a mortgage for the purpose of securing Mr Kimber’s fees and the debts of his other creditors. The mortgage was entered into between Mr Groom and a Mr Maccall under which Mr Groom assigned to Mr Maccall 100 fully paid up shares in the Fifeshire Main Collieries as well as any cash and shares coming from Mr Cheesewright as a result of the litigation. The assets were assigned to Mr Maccall upon trust to secure the fees of Mr Kimber and then Mr Groom’s other debts.

The important point is that the solicitor is seeking to secure his future fees against the proceeds of the litigation in which he continues to act for the client. The client needs to be aware of the full extent of the solicitors’ interest in those proceeds when it comes to considering any future advice about the prospects of success on the litigation, the wisdom of settling or accepting any payment into court.

The Liquidators put this priority ranking point in two ways.  First, they say that the Deed of Charge expressly makes Candey’s security over the Settlement Proceeds subject to a prior interest of Campion Maverick, the litigation funders. That is clearly inconsistent with the assertion of a lien which would rank in priority to any secured debts.

Mr Lord submitted that these paragraphs were not relevant on the question of inconsistency but constituted at most a modification of the reservation of the lien. That appears to me to be a distinction without a difference; the fact is that the Deed of Charge shows the intention of the parties that Campion Maverick would have first call on any monies recovered from, amongst other proceedings, the London Litigation.  We were shown email exchanges in August 2015 between the parties on this point.  Mr Ashkhan Candey sent Ms Turnbull at Peak a draft of the FFA saying that they would need to get Campion Maverick to enter into a deed of subordination so that the proposed charge in favour of Candey took priority over their earlier charge.  Mr Judge told Ms Turnbull and others that he had no idea whether a deed of subordination from them could be delivered. It is apparent from the terms of the Deed of Charge ultimately agreed that Campion Maverick refused to subordinate their claim to that of Candey.  </p>

Under the standard terms and conditions of the original retainer on which Candey had been retained there was no specified interest rate.

If that was right, then there is no inconsistency between the interest rate protected by the equitable lien – 8 per cent – and the interest rate accruing under the Deed of Charge which must also be 8 per cent since the Deed of Charge is expressly intended to secure all the liabilities owed to Candey under the FFA.  </p>

The correct comparison was with the absence of any interest payable on unpaid fees under Candey’s standard terms and conditions applicable before 21 October 2015 and the interest rate accruing thereafter secured by the Deed of Charge.  It is artificial to treat the FFA and the Deed of Charge as separate transactions when they were intended to comprise a single arrangement providing Candey with new security for its unpaid fees.  That is not how the parties viewed them.  The two documents cross refer to each other and were signed on the same day.  The new arrangement to secure the payment of the fees did therefore provide for the payment of interest, albeit in limited circumstances, when none had been payable under the pre-existing retainer and hence for the purposes of the pre-existing lien.   </p>

Mr Holland submitted that the Deed of Charge, being a floating charge, entitled Candey to appoint a receiver by operation of law whereas the lien conferred no such right.  Mr Lord did not accept that there was any right to appoint a receiver under the floating charge in respect of these assets. He countered that in any event, the court has power pursuant to section 37 of the Senior Courts Act 1981 and CPR Part 69 to appoint a receiver and might do so as part of the relief granted in an application made by a solicitor under section 73.  Mr Holland argued that, even if that were the case, the appointment of the receiver would be by a different jurisdictional route and that, of itself, would be a sufficient inconsistency between the two securities to generate the inference of waiver.  Given that there are several much clearer inconsistencies between the two securities I do not need to decide whether this rather abstruse argument would have entitled the Liquidators to succeed if that had been their best point.   </p>

Mr Holland submits that this does not matter because the breadth of the definition of ‘asset’ under the BVI Insolvency Act is wide enough to include contingent assets and the term ‘security’ expressly includes a lien. He also argues that the restrictive definition put forward by Candey according to which a solicitor does not need to mention the equitable lien when submitting its proof in the liquidation undermines the purpose of section 214. A liquidator will need to decide fairly soon after taking office whether to pursue any litigation in which the insolvent company was engaged. That decision will undoubtedly be informed by an understanding of what claims there will be on any monies recovered from that litigation and who has the foremost entitlement to those monies.  It would create a serious lacuna in the regime if a solicitor could assert the lien once monies were recovered by the liquidator even though he had not relied on it when submitting the claim for unpaid fees. Mr Holland relies on <span style="font-style:italic">Re Safety Explosives Ltd </span>[1904] 1 Ch 226 which concerned solicitors who had failed to mention the lien when proving their debt in the winding up of the company and applied to the court to amend or withdraw their proof so that they could rely on the lien. The assumption underlying the case was, Mr Holland submits, that if the solicitors had a retaining lien they would have to state in their proof that they relied upon it. He also submits that Candey’s argument proves too much. If, as they say, they had no security interest as at 8 February 2016 and so did not have to mention it in the proof for the purposes of section 214, then they are too late to apply to the court to grant them a charge because of the principle that the court will not grant security after the date of liquidation. That proposition was established in <span style="font-style:italic">Roberts Petroleum Ltd v Bernard Kenny Ltd </span>[1983] 2 AC 192 in which the House of Lords held that the court should not make a charging order over the property of a company in liquidation because such an order would be inconsistent with the statutory scheme for distribution.  </p>

Candey’s rights to payment and to security were similarly to be determined exclusively by those terms.  It was a carefully crafted agreement covering the potential recoveries from all the litigation in which Peak was engaged including the London Litigation.  There is nothing in clause 7 to suggest that it is intended to preserve some pre-existing right.  I accept Mr Holland’s submission that the purpose of clause 7 is to reverse the usual right of appropriation that Peak as debtor would have to determine which of the three debts owed under the FFA should be treated as </p>

Instead, Candey was entitled to decide whether any monies received should be treated as paying off the Fixed Fee, the Outstanding Costs or the disbursements due. It has nothing to do with the lien.  I do not see that any of the terms of the Deed of Charge assist Candey either.  On the contrary, by paragraph 4 Peak is required to warrant that it has not created any other security or charge over the monies protected by the Deed, save for the charge in favour of Campion Maverick.  Paragraphs 5 and 6 are dealing with a different point, namely that Peak must do its best to ensure that any monies recovered are paid directly to Candey and not to Peak or a third party.  That does not constitute an acknowledgement of any other security over those monies in addition to the security expressly created by the Deed itself.   </p>

It is commendable to avoid ‘legalese’ when explaining contracts to clients and a lien can be reserved without needing to use the word ‘lien’ or refer to section 73.  I emphasise again the importance for the litigating solicitor to explain in a transparent and straightforward way the totality of its claims to the fruits of the litigation.  Something much clearer is needed than appears here.  I would therefore hold  that there was no reservation of the equitable lien here.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Some of the authorities I have referred to earlier raise the issue of whether a lien which has been waived by the solicitor can revive in certain circumstances.  In <span style="font-style:italic">Curry v Rea </span>the Northern Ireland Court of Appeal considered whether the lien over the property deeds, which they held had been abandoned when the same property was mortgaged, revived when the mortgage became statute-barred. Andrews LJ said at p. 14 that no authority had been cited to show that the lien revived automatically in such circumstances and he was satisfied that no such authority existed. Any such revivor would, he thought, require evidence at least of a clear intimation by the solicitor to his client of his intention to assert the lien.  In the <span style="font-style:italic">Solland </span>cases, there was a concern that the solicitors would fall between two stools in that the Sollands were contending both that the equitable lien had been waived when they granted a legal charge over their home but also that the legal charge should be set aside on the grounds that it was induced by duress or undue influence: see para. 37 of <span style="font-style:italic">Solland (No 1) </span>and para. 28 of <span style="font-style:italic">Solland (No 2)</span>. Having found that Clifford Harris had waived the lien when they took the legal charge, Mr Nugee returned to the question of revivor at paras. 52 of his judgment.  He rightly noted that <span style="font-style:italic">Curry v Rea </span>was not authority for the possibility of a lien reviving.  He thought that as a matter of principle it would not be possible for this to happen by the solicitors’ unilateral act; there would need to be a fresh agreement between the solicitor and client that the equitable rights would be exercisable after all: para. 53. However, he then referred to the unfairness to the solicitor in that case if, in later proceedings, the legal charge over the Sollands’ home was set aside:  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.00in;text-indent:0.00in">“54.  … On the analysis I have adopted, the principle is that a solicitor is effectively presumed to intend to waive his rights whenever he takes a security that is in any way inconsistent with them.  However, since the ground for assuming waiver is the taking of any inconsistent security, I do not see why the solicitor should be presumed to have intended the waiver to continue to have effect if the security he thought he was taking turns out not to have been valid and binding.  In other words if the client is able to, and does, have the security avoided, then the parties are in my judgment entitled to be put back into the same position as that in which they would have been had it never been granted.  In practical terms this means that if Mr and Mrs Solland are able to and do avoid the charge, then I consider that CH’s section 73 rights would in any event revive as if they had never been waived.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Candey argues that a similar situation has arisen here because Candey thought that the FFA and Deed of Charge conferred on them a fixed charge over Peak’s assets that would have given them priority over all other debts except for the debt to Campion Maverick. In the event, the Deed created only a floating charge so that their charge could be of little if any value.  Mr Lord argued that in those circumstances, the lien should revive.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Assuming in Candey’s favour that it is possible by operation of law rather than by express agreement for a lien to ‘revive’ if the inconsistent security taken to replace is set aside, that is not what has happened in this case.  First, it is not right to say that Candey intended to obtain a fixed charge over Peak’s assets.  They intended to obtain the charge that was set out in the Deed of Charge and that is what they did in fact obtain.  The fact that they wrongly thought that this would confer a fixed charge is to my mind irrelevant: see <span style="font-style:italic">Agnew v Commissioners of the Inland Revenue </span>[2001] UKPC 28, [2001] 2 AC 710, at para. 32 <span style="font-style:italic">per </span>Lord Millett. Secondly, in the situation posited in the <span style="font-style:italic">Solland </span>case there is no inconsistency between the new charge and the lien because the new charge does not exist. Here, the floating charge that Candey obtained was just as inconsistent with the continuation of the lien as the fixed charge – it covered the same assets, it ranked below the debt owed to Campion Maverick and it secured an entitlement to interest that did not previously exist.  I agree with the judge (see para. 118 of his judgment) that there is no scope for the application of any principle of revivor in the present case.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.00in">95.<span style="font-family:Arial"> </span>Mr Holland argued that it was an abuse of process for Candey to seek to rely on their equitable lien only after a great deal of time and money had been spent arguing over whether the Deed of Charge created a fixed or floating charge. Although the dispute between the Liquidators and Candey about Peak’s liability under the FFA arose soon after Peak went into liquidation, Candey only asserted their equitable lien by letter dated 29 March 2018, several months after the judgment of HHJ Davis-White QC downgrading the Deed of Charge from a fixed to a floating charge had been handed down and after HHJ Raeside QC had determined the value of services issue.  Even if it was not an abuse of process, he submitted that it was a reason why the court should not exercise its discretion under section 73.  The judge dealt briefly with these points, stating at para. 150 that if he had reached the conclusion that there had been no waiver of the lien he would not have found that there was an abuse of process. He would have exercised his discretion in favour of imposing a charge. I do not have to address these issues since the lien has in my view clearly been waived by Candey.  My inclination, however, would have been the same as that of the judge.  It seems unlikely that if Candey had raised the issue of their lien at an early stage, the Liquidators would simply have accepted that it entitled them to a first call on the fruits of the London Litigation or that the proceedings between the parties over the past years would have been avoided.  As to the exercise of discretion, the cases are clear that if the lien exists, it should be enforced by the court unless there are good reasons why not: see for example <span style="font-style:italic">Fairfold Ltd v Exmouth Docks Co Ltd </span>[1993] Ch 196, <span style="font-style:italic">per</span> Ferris J at p. 204E and <span style="font-style:italic">Solland (No 2)</span> para. 22 and the cases cited there.   </p>

The rights conferred on Candey by those new security arrangements were inconsistent in material respects with the security conferred on them by the lien.  This gave rise to an inference that they intended to waive the lien, in the absence of any reservation by Candey of their pre-existing rights. There was no such reservation of the lien by Candey. The fact that the Deed of Charge created a floating charge and not a fixed charge as Candey may have expected, did not cause the lien to revive.   </p>
