Whereas it is true that Mr Al Ahmed could have filed an appeal in time – there was no mental impediment to him doing so, and there was no logistical impediment because he had access to a computer and the review letter stated very clearly what he had to do – he sought assistance with the preparation of this technical legal document. In my judgment he probably had no idea what it needed to say. Aware of his limitations, he sensibly sought assistance from Crisis. He trusted them to do what was necessary to get his appeal up and running, including filing it in compliance with any time limits. This was a reasonable position for him to take. Crisis took the view, which was also reasonable, that Mr Al Ahmed needed legal representation. The wisdom of that course is borne out by comparing what Mr Al Ahmed wrote in his lengthy emails to the Council with what is set out very succinctly in the grounds of appeal filed, albeit out of time, by his legal representatives. It is, however, unfortunate, that Crisis did not either ensure that the appeal was filed in time or explain to Mr Al Ahmed that, notwithstanding their assistance, that is something which he had to do. </p>

This is a borderline case, but where there is a borderline case in my judgment the court should err in favour of granting permission to appeal out of time and that is what I propose to do. I say err, but I am satisfied that on the particular facts of this case, given the particular capabilities of this appellant and the particular course of conduct he had taken, seeking and relying upon the guidance which he had obtained from Crisis, it was reasonable for him to wait for Crisis to find him a legal representative because without a legal representative this appeal was never going to go anywhere. Whether it goes anywhere now that he has got one remains to be seen and I express no view on that question, but I am going to give permission to appeal out of time.” </p>

In my judgment the starting point for analysing whether or not in this case there was “good reason” for the Respondent’s delay is an understanding of what is required in order for an appeal to be brought before the court. It is common ground between the parties that the requirements of the CPR are that what is required is an Appellant’s Notice, accompanied by the appropriate fee or application for fee remission together with Grounds of Appeal. In my judgment there is force in the submission made by Mr Baumohl that these requirements are not especially sophisticated or taxing. Whilst Mr O’Sullivan is entitled to point out that the jurisdiction is based purely on contentions that there has been an error of law, that is not unusual. For instance, applications for judicial review and other forms of statutory appeal or review proceed upon the same basis. I am unable to accept the contention that it is necessary for a lawyer to be instructed before adequate grounds of appeal, sufficient to bring the appeal before the court, can be drafted. For instance, in the present case the two grounds which are raised by the Respondent are ones which in substance (as opposed to the precise legal detail) [are] obvious sources of complaint, namely the failure to provide him with the “minded” letter and thereby afford him the opportunity to respond to it, and the failure to properly examine and take account of his medical difficulties. The grounds of appeal would have been no less adequate had they been expressed in those simple terms. They have benefited from, but did not require, the added legal sophistication provided by Mr O’Sullivan’s drafting. I have no doubt that an application to strike out grounds drafted by an unrepresented party along these lines would be met with short shrift, since the essence of the errors of law complained of would be capable of being easily identified from the pleading.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.00in;text-indent:0.50in">Seeking to analyse the basis of the Judge’s conclusion that there was “good reason” in the present case it appears that in paragraphs 14 and 15 of his judgment he reached upon the conclusion that it was reasonable for the Respondent to rely upon the guidance he had obtained from Crisis and wait for a legal representative “because without a legal representative this appeal was never going to go anywhere”. This was in the light of the Respondent’s “limitations”, in that what was required was a “technical legal document”, in respect of which “he probably had no idea what it needed to say”. In reaching the conclusion that these matters amounted to a good reason for the appeal being brought out of time in my view the Judge very clearly went wrong and misdirected himself as to what was required in order to bring this appeal. Firstly, as set out above, the fact that the Respondent was unrepresented had little, if any, part to play in providing good reason. In so far, therefore, as the Judge relied upon that position, and suggested that the Respondent “needed legal representation”, his approach was illegitimate. In reality, as set out above, what was required was the issuing of an Appellant’s Notice and then the provision of grounds setting out the basis of the Respondent’s complaint that there was an error of law in his case. There was evidence before the Judge (and in the material before this court) demonstrating that the Respondent not only had access to a computer, but also that he was more than capable of expressing himself in writing and articulating his concerns. In my view there was no basis for the Judge to conclude that the appeal could not be commenced without legal representation, and that in the particular circumstances of this Respondent he was unable to provide a document expressing his complaints in relation to the decision reached in a manner that would enable to court to understand the errors of law which were relied upon. </p>

The Judge suggested that the Respondent “trusted them to do what was necessary to get his appeal up and running, including filing it in compliance with any time limits”. This appears to have led the Judge to the conclusion that in effect the Respondent was relying upon Crisis as his representative in prosecuting the appeal. In truth, however, the role of Crisis was far more limited, and was to try to identify a lawyer to enable the Respondent to bring his appeal. They were not the organisation which was going to &#x2028;draft proceedings and issue them on the Respondent’s behalf.  No doubt they did their best to obtain legal assistance for the Respondent, but the Respondent could not rely upon Crisis to draft and issue the appeal for him. This observation distracted the Judge from the reality of the position, which was that this is the Respondent’s appeal and he must bear some of the responsibility for ensuring that it is brought in time. For the reasons I have already given I am satisfied that it was within the Respondent’s capabilities to do what was necessary to bring the appeal and get it started. As the Judge observed there was no mental or logistical impediment to him filing the appeal in time.”</p>

He said that there was some degree of read across between his observations in respect of litigants who do not have professional representation and the contention that time should be extended and discretions exercised so as to enable them to have legal representation by way of legal aid.  He referred to <span style="font-style:italic">R (Kigen) v Secretary of State for the Home Department </span>[2015] EWCA Civ 1286, [2016] 1 WLR 723 (“<span style="font-style:italic">Kigen</span>”), in which it was held, consistently with the reasoning in <span style="font-style:italic">Hysaj</span>, that the fact that a claimant had applied for legal aid and had been waiting for a decision from the Legal Aid Agency was not a good reason for failure to comply with the time limit in the Upper Tribunal rules for the making of an application for reconsideration of a decision refusing permission to apply for judicial review.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Ms Neate’s witness statement for Shelter is a lengthy document.  It covers the practical difficulties involved in a homeless applicant issuing a notice of appeal in person; the wider difficulties and circumstances that homeless persons often have to contend with; and the difficulties that homeless applicants face in finding solicitors who are able to advise and represent them in homeless appeals, and the lack of capacity in the housing advice sector.  It also sets out the limited results of an exercise under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 seeking to establish the advantages to homeless applicants of being represented when bringing a s.204 appeal, and the impacts on court time and costs.  I stress that this evidence was not before the courts below and that it does not therefore bear directly on Judge Hellman’s decision as to good reason or on Dove J’s criticisms of that decision.  But it has not been challenged and it underpins Shelter’s concerns about aspects of Dove J’s judgment and its effect on future cases.  I therefore think it helpful to provide a somewhat fuller summary of some of the matters covered. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">As to practical difficulties in bringing an appeal, the witness statement points to the limited information provided in review letters regarding the right to bring an appeal and how to go about it; and to Shelter’s experience that review letters are hard for homeless applicants to understand and do not clearly indicate what issues might be open to appeal.  Further, applicants who lack legal advice and are themselves without knowledge or experience of housing law are more likely to focus on the facts of their case rather than the law when faced with a negative decision; and it is very rare to find a homeless applicant who is without legal advice or assistance but is able to focus appropriately on how housing law and public law principles apply to the facts of their case in order properly to assess and formulate a point of law for the purpose of bringing an appeal.  Those who have been placed in temporary accommodation will tend to focus on the imminent loss of that accommodation and the need to undertake a number of stressful and time/resource heavy tasks in a short period of time, rather than on the need to bring an appeal.  It is said that a number of common difficulties or shared characteristics of those experiencing homelessness (poverty, mental ill health, etc.) contribute to delaying or preventing them from being able to cope with life events and to manage their affairs; and that it does not necessarily follow that because someone who is homeless is articulate and can express himself or herself verbally and on paper, he or she therefore has the ability to take and implement a decision to issue a complex court appeal. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Also in relation to the practical difficulties of bringing an appeal, the witness statement refers to the limited information freely available which might assist applicants in working out how to issue an appeal and how to formulate grounds of appeal.  It provides evidence that accessing information on the internet for applicants who are without accommodation or are living in temporary accommodation and with very limited financial resources can be incredibly difficult; and examples are given of the difficulty of identifying any useful material even if an applicant is able to access the internet.  Reference is made to the difficulties in finding a solicitor; to the fact that parts of the notice of appeal, Form N161, are not at all suited to the circumstances of a s.204 appeal, which makes it difficult for homeless applicants to understand and complete the form; and to the need to find access to a computer and printer and to draft, complete, print, photocopy, post (and pay for recorded delivery) or physically take to the local county court a covering letter, the notice of appeal, the grounds of appeal and the fee or fee exemption form (with attached evidence of income), and to provide copies of the documents to the local authority. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">One section of the witness statement deals with the serious diminution in the provision of advice for housing law matters under legal aid contracts as a result of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 (“LASPO”).  Homeless applicants should still qualify for a full legal aid certificate to cover the work necessary for a County Court appeal, provided that they meet the Legal Aid Agency means and merits tests.  But many housing cases were taken out of the scope of legal aid, and the resulting shrinkage in the number of providers means that there are now areas of the country where it is almost impossible to get face to face legal advice in housing law – there are housing advice deserts throughout the country.  Even those who are still entitled to legal aid will often not be able to find someone to provide the service they need.  Those housing advice providers that are still left are facing increased demand and often do not have the capacity to assist everyone who approaches them for help. </p>

He also observed at [24] that “good reason is a phrase in common parlance, which, in my judgment, does not need elaboration”.  That approach was followed by Lewis J in <span style="font-style:italic">Peake v London Borough of Hackney </span>[2013] EWHC 2528 (QB) and by Jay J in <span style="font-style:italic">Poorsalehy v London Borough of Wandsworth </span>[2013] EWHC 3687 (QB).  In the latter case Jay J added at [16] that “good reason is not a matter of law or presumption.  Its existence depends on all the circumstances of the case as known to the court by direct and inferential evidence; and, thereafter, secondary evaluative conclusions derived from that evidence”. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Shelter’s submission, which I accept, is that by his reasoning in relation to unrepresented parties Dove J has departed from the approach in those previous cases and has introduced an unjustified restriction on the circumstances that can be taken into account in deciding whether an applicant has a good reason within s.204(2A).  Reference is made in particular to the passage at [14] of his judgment where Dove J states that “[i]t is clear … that the fact that a party is not professionally represented could play only a very limited, if any, part in the assessment of whether or not there was good reason for a departure from the time limit in bringing the appeal in cases of this sort”.  In the middle of [16] he refers to that proposition as the first of his reasons for finding that Judge Hellman misdirected himself in relying on the view that Mr Al Ahmed needed legal representation.  Thus he treats the point as one of general application which limits what may qualify as a good reason for the purposes of the statutory test.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">First, s.204(2A) lays down a statutory test, “good reason”, the content and effect of which cannot have been changed by the strict approach adopted in recent years by the courts towards failures to comply with the CPR or with the corresponding rules of the Upper Tribunal.  Although appeals under s.204 are brought in accordance with the procedural rules in the CPR, those rules do not define the test of good reason; and neither changes to the rules themselves nor changes in the court’s approach towards failure to comply with them can alter the statutory test.  I have referred above to the consistent approach taken previously by the courts towards that statutory test, to the effect that all the circumstances are to be taken into account without applying any particular presumptions.  That approach should not be qualified by importing the <span style="font-style:italic">Mitchell</span>/<span style="font-style:italic">Denton</span> principles into it.  In <span style="font-style:italic">Short v Birmingham City Council </span>(cited above) at [26], Tugendhat J observed that “on the wording of the 1996 Act s.204(2A) it is not open to a judge to have regard to the criteria set out in CPR 3.9, or any criteria, other than those specified in terms in the section”.  He was referring to an earlier<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>version of CPR 3.9 than that considered in <span style="font-style:italic">Mitchell </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">Denton</span>, but his observation has equal validity in relation to the principles laid down in those cases and applied in analogous contexts under the CPR and the Upper Tribunal rules. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.00in;text-indent:0.00in">“A judge should address an application for relief from sanctions in three stages.  The first stage is to identify and assess the seriousness and significance of the ‘failure to comply with any rule, practice direction or court order’ which engages rule 3.9(1).  If the breach is neither serious nor significant, the court is unlikely to need to spend much time on the second and third stages.  The second stage is to consider why the default occurred.  The third stage is to evaluate ‘all the circumstances of the case, so as to enable [the court] to deal justly with the application …’”.    </p>

A strict approach towards the question of good reason can more readily be justified in a situation where the potential for unjust consequences can be mitigated at the third stage, where the court evaluates all the circumstances.  By contrast, there is no scope for a three-stage analysis under s.204(2A), where consideration of the merits and any other matters can arise only if good reason is established.  To restrict, by reference to the <span style="font-style:italic">Mitchell</span>/<span style="font-style:italic">Denton </span>approach, the circumstances that can be taken into account in the assessment of good reason under s.204(2A) would therefore open the door to unjust outcomes, which Parliament cannot have intended. </p>

As Underhill LJ said at [40], “[h]ow strict an approach should be taken to non-compliance with time limits is not a question to which one answer is necessarily better or worse than another ….  A balance has to be struck between two interests which weigh on opposite sides ….  Different courts or tribunals may legitimately choose to strike the balance differently.”  In this case the point is an even stronger one, in that the test of good reason in s.204(2A) has been laid down by Parliament and it is not open to the courts to strike a different balance by reading limitations into that test. </p>

I have summarised the evidence placed before this court by Shelter.  It presents a bleak picture of the difficulties faced by homelessness applicants in bringing an appeal under s.204 of the 1996 Act without legal advice and representation, and of the difficulties they may face in finding someone to provide those services under legal aid, especially as a result of the post-LASPO shrinkage of the housing advice sector.  Everything will of course depend on the circumstances of the individual case, but it would be both surprising and unfair if difficulties of that kind could not be taken fully into account and given appropriate weight in the assessment of whether there was a good reason for failure to bring an appeal in time and, to the extent that it arises as a separate issue, for delay in applying for permission to bring an appeal out of time.   </p>

The basic rule remains the 21 day time limit, with which Parliament must have intended applicants in general to comply.  Compliance may present little difficulty in practice if an applicant already has a solicitor acting for him in relation to the review (as might have been the position in Mr Al Ahmed’s case had it not been for a breakdown in the relationship between him and his solicitor).  Where an applicant relies on the fact that he was unrepresented and was seeking legal aid as a reason for non-compliance, the circumstances will need to be examined with care, including scrutiny of the diligence with which he acted in seeking legal aid.  And even if the court is satisfied as to good reason, that simply opens up a <span style="font-style:italic">discretion</span> to give permission for an appeal to be brought out of time.

His point, however, was that Mr Al Ahmed “probably had no idea what it needed to say” and reasonably sought assistance from Crisis which took the view, also reasonably, that he needed legal representation.  Judge Hellman clearly did not accept that Mr Al Ahmed was able to identify without legal representation even the substance of the two grounds of appeal that were advanced once he did have legal representation.  He pointed to the contrast between what Mr Al Ahmed wrote in his lengthy emails to the Council (which got nowhere near to identifying the relevant points of law) and what was set out succinctly in the grounds of appeal actually filed.  Thus, the judge was looking, perfectly reasonably, at the practicalities of the matter.  In his view there was no useful purpose in filing a notice of appeal until Mr Al Ahmed had legal representation and knew what, if any, points of law could be advanced: “without a legal representative this appeal was never going to go anywhere”.  There was no error of law in any of this, and it was based on factual findings for which there was an adequate evidential foundation in the material to which the judge referred. </p>
