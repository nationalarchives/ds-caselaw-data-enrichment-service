A person is liable to pay a business rate in relation to an unoccupied hereditament in respect of a chargeable financial year, if the conditions in section 45(1) of the Local Government Finance Act 1988 (the “1988 Act”) are met. These include the condition that in respect of any day in that year, the person is the owner of the whole of the hereditament (section 45(1)(b)). Section 65(1) of the 1988 Act provides that the owner of a hereditament is the person entitled to possession of it. A further condition, contained in section 45(1)(d), is that the hereditament falls within a class prescribed by regulations. Regulation 3 of the Non-Domestic Rating (Unoccupied Property) (England) Regulations 2008 (SI 2008/386) (the “2008 Regulations”) prescribed all non-domestic hereditaments other than those exempted by Regulation 4.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In outline, under both Scheme 2 and Scheme 3, business rates were avoided by the landlord leasing its empty commercial property to a special purpose vehicle company (“SPV”) incorporated or purchased, in the case of Scheme 3, by PAGAPL or MBV. The effect of the grant of a lease (“Scheme Lease”) is that the SPV becomes the owner of the hereditament for the purposes of section 45(1)(b), as a result of section 65 of the 1988 Act, and liable for business rates in relation to it. The SPV is then placed into members’ voluntary liquidation (“MVL”) with the effect that it is relieved of liability to pay business rates as a result of regulation 4(k) of the 2008 Regulations. The MVL continues until the lease expires, by which time, if not before, the landlord may well have been able to find a new commercial tenant. </p>

In my judgment the purpose of liquidation is the collection, realisation (though not invariably) and distribution of assets in satisfaction of the claims of creditors and the entitlements of members. The adjustments made to third party rights (whether they be stays upon enforcement or exemptions from fiscal liabilities otherwise falling upon companies) are made to achieve that purpose. I hold that there is a clear public interest in ensuring that the purpose of liquidations is not subverted, as I consider it is by treating a company in liquidation as a shelter (and seeking to prolong it continuation as such).

Of such schemes I say nothing, save that if the liquidation is not genuinely a collection and distribution of assets then its propriety might need to be reconsidered. For me it is the use of the company in liquidation as an asset shelter and the inherent bias towards prolongation of the liquidation that is subversive of the true purpose and proper functioning of insolvency law.

Under Scheme 3 the liquidator will not know until all of the leases have either been determined or expired the value of the assets which may be realised in terms of payment of any determination premium and, hence, what assets will be available for distribution. It follows that Scheme 3 does not require the artificial prolongation of the MVLs, since it is inherent in its design and effect that in ordinary circumstances each MVL will last until all of the leases held by the SPV have come to an end.”    </p>

In my view what was crucial in that case was that there was no collection, realisation and distribution of assets intended or effected in the voluntary liquidations operated by PAGMS [PAG Management] so that the only purpose of those liquidations was for them to operate as a shelter for assets which were not being collected, realised or distributed.

It seems to me that it is quite clear that Norris J was considering Scheme 2 and the particular aspects of it. He was not making any wider generalisations either about business rate avoidance schemes or in relation to the business model of the PAG companies as a whole. It would have been surprising if he had done so. At [60] of his judgment, Norris J made clear, quite rightly, that it was “not possible to find that NNDR [business rate] avoidance/mitigation schemes are contrary to the public interest (although they may be): nor would it in principle be right for the court in one case to resolve what is essentially a far-reaching economic and political question that is properly the province of Parliament”.  </p>

Furthermore, at [65] he set out PAG Management’s business model by reference to the essential elements of Scheme 2 before holding that there “is a clear public interest in ensuring that the purpose of liquidations is not subverted, as I consider it is by treating a company in liquidation as a shelter (and seeking to prolong its continuation as such)”. It is clear, therefore, that Norris J made those observations solely in the context of and based upon the details of Scheme 2 and had eschewed the promulgation of any wider principle. </p>

They were effectively nominal liquidators who dragged their feet and were eventually removed and not immediately replaced.

The fact that the purpose for which a transaction has been entered into can be characterised as artificial in no way invalidates the transaction, unless, of course, the transaction is actually a sham . . .”  </p>

He requires us to conclude that the determination premium is not genuine in some way or should be ignored because it is a contingent asset in the MVL which enables the MVL to be continued whilst the Scheme Leases are in existence.  </p>

Just as Buckley LJ held in the <span style="font-style:italic">Shell Mex </span>case (quoted by Geoffrey Lane LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Aldrington</span>) one must first determine the status of the transaction or provision in question, in this case, the determination premium, before considering its purpose.  </p>

As he explained, the only purpose of the liquidation in that case was to shelter the leases. That was not the case in Scheme 3. The determination premium is a genuine contingent asset which the liquidators were entitled and obliged to wait to collect in, the liquidation was not artificially prolonged </p>

In this case, however, there is no challenge to the judge’s finding that there was no evidence of harm to the public and in oral submissions before us, Mr Chaisty was unable to identify any class of the public who were or might be harmed. An essential element, therefore, is missing.  </p>

Having evaluated all the evidence and balanced all of the relevant factors, he concluded that even if it there had been a misuse of the insolvency process, it was not sufficient to warrant winding up under section 124A. He was entitled to come to the conclusion he did.</p>
