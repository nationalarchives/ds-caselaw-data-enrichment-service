      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">1.<span style="font-family:Arial"> </span>This is a second appeal following the decision by Master Rowley, Costs Judge, upheld by Jay J (sitting with Master Haworth), to disallow on assessment certain </p>
      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.00in">“additional liabilities”, namely the success fees of solicitors and counsel and the ATE insurance premium. These additional liabilities are claimed at £1,078,972.72 (out of a total bill of £2.4 million odd). The appeal raises issues as to the reasonableness of the appellant’s decision to change funding from legal aid (which would not have given rise to these liabilities) to a CFA (which has done) and, in particular, arguments as to the application of the decision of this court in <span style="font-style:italic">Surrey</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">v Barnet and Chase Farm Hospitals NHS Trust</span> [2018] 1 WLR 5831 (“<span style="font-style:italic">Surrey</span>”).

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">The appellant’s claim involved allegations of clinical negligence resulting from an alleged delay in recognising and treating her tuberculosis meningitis, which it was said caused catastrophic brain injury. She acted through her husband as her litigation friend. Subsequent to the events with which this appeal on costs is primarily concerned, issues of liability were agreed on the basis of a 98%/2% apportionment and quantum was later compromised in a very substantial sum. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">The delay in treatment occurred in May 2001. A first firm of solicitors were instructed by the litigation friend in May 2002 and they acted for almost four years, first on a privately funded basis, and then on a Conditional Fee Agreement (“CFA”). In February 2006 the litigation friend instructed Bolt Burdon Kemp (“BBK”), initially on a privately-paying basis, then on the same CFA basis as the previous firm, but in the expectation that, since BBK had a legal aid franchise, he would apply for legal aid.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">The Legal Services Commission (“LSC”) granted a public funding certificate for investigative work in January 2007. They granted a substantial legal aid certificate on 25 February 2009, by which time breach (but not causation) had been admitted. This was limited to the end of stage two (the exchange of experts’ reports, CPR Part 35 questions and a conference with counsel and experts), in the sum of £55,480. That was the sum which had been sought by BBK. The certificate was predicated on the basis that, as BBK had advised, there would be three liability experts. </p>

LSC’s principal concern was that it could not be readily ascertained from BBK’s systems how many hours had been spent on individual cases and whether the relevant financial limits on the certificates were at risk of being exceeded. A system was put in place that alerted the relevant solicitor once 80% of the budget for any given case had been spent. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">During 2011, and without any reference to the LSC, Ms Trask instructed two further experts, a consultant neurologist (on causation issues) and a medical microbiologist. Their reports were obtained in February and April 2011 respectively, and a conference with counsel and all five experts took place on the 31 October 2011.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">On 13 December 2011 Ms Trask wrote to the LSC belatedly informing them of the reports from the two new experts and seeking an increase in the costs limit of the certificate of £10,000. Master Rowley inferred at [73] of his judgment that the £10,000 was intended to cover the extra work apparently needed for the case to be conducted to the end of stage 2. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">On 17 January 2012, the LSC replied, referring to its recent Clinical Negligence Guidance and saying that, in accordance therewith, funding in a five expert case up to mutual exchange of reports would now be limited to £45,000. They stated that, in consequence, they could not agree to any further funding, but said that a formal request for funding should be made, including a report which fully addressed all of the points relevant to the stage for which funding was sought, accompanied by a particular form, CLSAPP8.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Two points should be noted about this reply. First, contrary to Mr Williams’ oral submissions, I consider that it is wrong to say that the LSC were seeking to impose the new Guidance upon BBK in respect of this case; they were simply using it to demonstrate that, on the face of it, BBK’s informal request for additional funding was too high and could not be accepted. Secondly, it is plain that the LSC were doing no more than rejecting that informal request: hence their invitation to make a proper application in the prescribed form. No such form was ever completed and there was no coherent reason for the omission.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Ms Trask did not reply to the LSC until her letter dated 8 May 2012, some 4 months later. She said that she inferred from their letter of 17 January that an increase beyond £55,490 (the sum in the existing legal aid certificate) would not be approved, recording that BBK’s current costs were £57,000, and that BBK’s costs at the point of issue would be £67,000. She also said that BBK would be unable to progress the case within the current costs limit of £55,490 and that in consequence: </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Master Rowley spelt out a number of inferences to be drawn from these various figures at [74]. He observed that the £67,000 was well short of the total likely amount for the litigation to the end of stage 2 and that the additional £10,000 which BBK had sought in December 2011 would have been insufficient for that purpose. More importantly, as Master Rowley went on to find, Ms Trask was wrong to infer that the LSC would have refused a formal request for an increase; as we have seen, the LSC had invited such a request in the appropriate form, but this had not been provided. The inference which Master Rowley drew from that was that, by 8 May, Ms Trask had </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.00in">already made up her mind to switch from legal aid to a CFA, so the making of the formal request no longer mattered to her. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">That is borne out by the fact that, despite the clear terms of the letter to the LSC, Ms Trask had not (at the time she wrote it) had any communication with the litigation friend about funding. It was only on 8 May (the same day as the letter to the LSC) that she wrote to the litigation friend on this topic for the first time, noting that BBK had reached the current costs limit on the certificate and that the limit was unlikely to be increased at this stage. She said that BBK had informed the LSC of this and recommended that the certificate be discharged so that alternative funding arrangements might be made. She expressly advised the litigation friend that, under a ‘no win no fee’ agreement, the respondent “will be in broadly the same position, in that she will be protected from any deductions to her compensation as she lacks capacity…”. Ms Trask went on to say that if the LSC sent the litigation friend a form in the event that he thought legal aid should continue, he need not complete it. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">I should say here that Mr Williams’ submissions dwelt on the importance of what he called ‘party autonomy’, namely the right of a claimant to choose the funding he or she considered appropriate. It is, however, an important feature of this case that, in reality, the appellant – through her litigation friend – made no choice at all. The decision to switch funding was made by BBK before – or no later than – 8 May 2012. Mr Williams accepted that “no choice was given”. </p>

He said that “there is absolutely nothing before the court to show how this case was ever expected to be brought home for the sum sought from the LSC.” [83].

The references to a "level playing field" in this context cannot be read as factoring in a consideration which could not apply across the board. Lewison LJ's observation, which he was accepting for the sake of argument, that "there was not much to choose between funding by legal aid and funding by CFA", was a general statement which applies to all legal aid cases on the one hand and all CFAs on the other. Lewison LJ was not limiting this statement to CFAs which post-dated 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> April 2013 and therefore attracted the benefit of the uplift.

It is true that at para 71 he is recorded as making a submission that CFA-lites were clearly preferable to legal aid in a quantum only case. However, I think that Mr Williams' submission recorded at para 30 was recognising, as it had to, that the Costs Judges had found in terms that this was more or less a level playing field. These were evaluative assessments which could not readily be shaken on appeal; and at that point Mr Williams was not attempting to do so.

In any case, the real reason for the advice to switch to a CFA, which was given as late as 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2012, was that the legal aid limit had been exceeded. By then there was no prospect of an extension to the certificate; indeed, BBK was effectively asking for the certificate to be discharged. It is not arguable that by this letter the solicitors were simultaneously or alternatively seeking an extension of the certificate in some indeterminate amount on the basis of the information they were putting forward. There was only one operative reason for the change in funding, and it followed in my view that the only real question was whether the solicitors were culpable or otherwise in relation to the state of affairs which had resulted. It is not surprising, in my view, that the argument before the Costs Judge was limited to that issue.  </p>

Aside from the absence of any reference to the points that Mr Williams now seeks to rely on, BBK stated in terms that under a CFA the Claimant "will be broadly in the same position". This was in the context of a case, cf. para 71 of <span style="font-style:italic">Surrey</span>, where causation remained in issue. Apart from the obvious difficulty that at the hearing before Master Rowley the Claimant did not seek to question or undermine that advice, I do not think that it was so plainly wrong that the Court may look behind it. To the extent that Mr Williams relied on paras 49 and 51 of <span style="font-style:italic">Surrey</span>, it seems to me that these do not avail him. In this regard, I would hold that there is a difference in principle between a factor such as the <span style="font-style:italic">Simmons v Castle</span> uplift, which was a certain and indisputable advantage, and the sort of factors prayed in aid by Mr Williams, about which there are differences of opinion.

Where a claimant was faced with a choice between two alternative courses of action which will involve incurring costs, it may well be the case that both courses of action were reasonable, even if one is more costly than the other. So what was required was an objective analysis of the reasonableness of the individual claimant’s decision, on advice, to change the basis of funding, taking all relevant circumstances into account [14]. The court said that it was essential to focus on the litigant’s reasons for making the choice s/ he did, rather than the reason s/ he might have had for that decision [16]-[19]. If the legal advice given in respect of that decision was “not sound” then that could impact on the reasonableness of the client’s choice [23].  </p>

I agree with Mr Hutton QC that a generic high-level assessment of the pros and cons of the two methods of funding does not answer the question whether costs were reasonably incurred in the particular case under consideration. While the judge was, understandably, trying to give general guidance, I do not consider that the question whether a change in funding method was reasonable is a question to be answered at the macro level.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Mr Williams QC argued that since there was nothing much to choose between funding by legal aid and funding by CFA-lite plus ATE insurance, it followed that either choice was a reasonable choice. It therefore followed that the costs incurred in entering into the CFA-lite and the ATE policy were reasonably incurred; and that the costs judges were not entitled, let alone required, to examine the reasons for the switch. I do not agree. The court is required to take into account all the circumstances of the case. That means the particular case under consideration: not some generalised description of similar cases, as <span style="font-style:italic">Solutia</span> makes clear. Moreover, the burden of proof, in the case of an assessment on the standard basis, lies on the receiving party. Accepting for the sake of argument that there is a "level playing field" and that there was not much to choose between funding by legal aid and funding by CFA, the fact is that in each of the three cases the claimant already had chosen legal aid. If there is not much to choose between the two methods of funding, and the claimant decides to switch to a funding method that is far more disadvantageous to a paying party, I consider that the paying party is at least entitled to ask the question: why did you switch? In those circumstances I consider that it is up to the receiving party to justify his choice; and that entails examining the reasons why the choice was made.” </p>

To paraphrase Lewison LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Surrey</span>, the paying party, namely the respondent in this case, is entitled to ask: ‘why did you switch?’ Here the answer to that question is BBK’s unreasonable conduct: without it, the change in funding would never have been made and there would never have been a success fee to argue about.

If a CFA-lite arrangement was so obviously superior to legal aid, and if such an arrangement had been in place at the outset this debate could not have arisen, then one has to ask why a CFA-lite arrangement was not in place from the outset or, even more pertinently, why the appellant changed to legal aid from the original CFA which was in place, only to change back again some years later. I checked Ms Trask’s witness statement before the appeal hearing, but no answer appeared to be provided to that fundamental question. Mr Williams conceded that during argument. I volunteer the obvious reason for that in paragraph 86 below, but it does not assist BBK on this appeal.  </p>

When they sought further funds, they did so in a way that Master Rowley described as “half-hearted”. They decided, without obtaining the instructions of the litigation friend, that they would move to a CFA-lite. Master Rowley found that, in all of this, they had behaved unreasonably.

If BBK had thought that, then they would have said so, because it provided them with an easy way out of the difficulties they had got themselves into over the legal aid budget limit. I do not accept that in some way the alleged superiority of CFA-lite somehow “went without saying” so it did not need to be articulated either to the LSC or to the appellant or her litigation friend. </p>

He is immune to costs risks, whereas his opponent may face a crushing burden of costs. That imbalance puts pressure on a defendant to settle a case early and, moreover, has the consequence that offers of settlement are higher. He referred in this connection to Sir Rupert Jackson's description of such litigants as "super-claimants". There are two problems with this argument. The first is that it formed no part of the decision-making process. In other words this was not one of the reasons for the switch. The second is that this argument was not run before the costs judges and was not the subject of a Respondent's Notice.

That is not entirely accurate. CPR 46.4 provides that there must be an assessment of any costs claimed against a protected party such as the appellant in the present case, and the Practice Direction gives examples of where this will not be necessary, including where the protected party has waived their right to claim further costs other than those recovered between the parties. Furthermore, as I have already said, <span style="font-style:italic">YZ v Gloucestershire</span>, which also involved protected parties, suggests that it is most unlikely in practice that any shortfall would be charged to the client under legal aid.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Secondly, Mr Williams said that by reference to Section 11(1) of the Access to Justice Act 1999, which applied to this case, legal aid only provided limited protection against adverse costs orders. But that is a purely theoretical state of affairs, described by one of the costs judges in <span style="font-style:italic">Surrey</span> as “fanciful or not problematic”. I agree with Mr Hutton that the chances of a costs order being enforced against a severely braindamaged woman with supportive expert evidence is properly regarded as fanciful. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Thirdly, Mr Williams submitted that legal aid provided little protection against the adverse consequences of failing to beat Part 36 offers to settle, because any post-offer costs awarded to a defendant would be deductible from the claimant’s damages. This ended up being Mr Williams’ principal point in support of the obvious superiority of a CFA. But I do not accept his analysis. </p>

The offers were not accepted, and the appellant went on to achieve a better result (98%/2%) than was reflected in those offers. So it is quite impossible to say that, on the facts of this case, a potential liability to costs deductions was of any relevance at all. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">I accept Mr Williams’ general submission that (even though there were no quantum offers here) a claimant in a large clinical negligence case like this has to be very careful of a well-judged Part 36 offer, because of the costs risks if it is not accepted. But a claimant funded through a CFA is, in reality, in much the same position as a claimant funded by legal aid when faced with a well-judged offer: if that claimant is advised to take the offer but refuses to do so, in all probability the funding (however provided) will cease. A legally aided claimant will find the funding withdrawn; a claimant with ATE insurance will have to look at the small print, but may find himself/herself paid out to the limit of the insurance and left to continue themselves, or (as Mr Williams said was more likely) may find that their cover was terminated or withdrawn. The only practical difference that may arise is when the claimant is advised to reject the offer and then fails to beat it at trial: then a legally aided claimant may be at risk of deductions whilst a claimant with a CFA would not be. But for the reasons I have given, this will arise so rarely that it cannot be a general reason to suggest that one system of funding is so obviously superior to the other. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Fourthly, a similar point is made by Mr Williams about the costs of interlocutory disputes. In my view that is an entirely unrealistic factor, given that it was not a reason in the present case put forward for the change of funding and there was no evaluation of how, on the facts of this case, it could have had any relevance, particularly given the size of the claim. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Fifthly, Mr Williams pointed out that a claimant who only makes a partial recovery of costs in their legal aid case will also see substantial deductions from damages because the unrecovered costs will be deducted and repaid to the legal aid agency. Again, I consider that to be theoretical, certainly in the present case, given that this was a multi-million pound claim which was either going to succeed or fail. It was not a case in which a partial costs order was going to be made. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Furthermore, contrary to Mr Williams’ submissions, I consider that there was a positive advantage of legal aid which was particularly apposite in the present case. As Jay J found at [71] of his judgment, there was a measure of budgetary control imposed as a result of the legal aid arrangement which was a benefit to the appellant. BBK had accepted a contract with the LSC and had been provided with a costs budget in the sum which they themselves had requested. If they had wanted more, they could have sought it, in accordance with the LSC rules to which they had agreed. Master Rowley considered that the outcome of the present dispute might have been different if BBK had run the case properly and reasonably in accordance with the LSC’s rules.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">In my view, this was a clear benefit of the legal aid regime. It is ironic that, just as civil legal aid has ceased to be available for much of the work it used to fund, the sort of control of costs that used to be exercised by the LSC has now been introduced in a much wider range of civil cases, through the mechanism of cost-budgeting. These days, the civil courts require all solicitors to keep a tight control on the costs which they are incurring, in part so as to protect their own clients from overspend. It might fairly be said that, when on legal aid, the appellant already had that advantage, without what some see as the additional paraphernalia that goes with costs budgeting. It was an advantage which was dissipated in the present case but that was not the appellant’s fault (the fault lay with BBK). It remained an advantage to her which did not arise out of the CFA- lite arrangements. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Accordingly, I do not accept Mr Williams’ submission that the change in funding was an obvious benefit because, as he put it, “it freed the appellant from the LSC’s financial control.” Control of the costs being incurred was in everyone’s interests, including those of the appellant. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">During the hearing, there was some debate about whether it was appropriate in any comparison exercise to recognise that, at least as a matter of theory, under the CFAlite regime, the appellant was liable to reimburse BBK for the sums (in excess of £1 million) now in issue: that is why they are identified as “additional liabilities”. Mr Hutton said that this was something which should be taken into account when legal aid is compared with CFA-lite because, although he accepted that the sums would never be paid by the appellant, what mattered was whether the costs – including these items of cost - had been reasonably incurred. He acknowledged that there was a conceptual difficulty inherent in the application of the indemnity principle in this sort of situation. Mr Williams said simply that the liability should be ignored because it could never arise.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">In my view, this liability cannot be a deciding or even significant factor in any comparison exercise, because it is not a liability that will fall to be paid in practice. But there is some force in Mr Hutton’s submission that, if the court is considering whether the costs were reasonably incurred, these liabilities should not be left entirely out of account. On that basis, it is therefore a downside of CFA-lite.  At the very least, it is another reason why the comparison exercise should be considered as producing a broadly level playing field, as identified in <span style="font-style:italic">Surrey</span>. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Finally, it seems to me that, in any comparison exercise, what might be said to be the elephant in the room needs to be addressed, namely the reason why the funding in this case took the course that it did, and then changed when it did. In my view, BBK had a very good reason for changing from a CFA to legal aid in 2007. Moving to legal aid, at the outset of a potentially complex case meant that, win or lose, BBK would be paid. That was a beneficial arrangement when a large but potentially difficult clinical negligence case was getting underway. 5 years, an admission of breach and many experts later, it would have become clearer that the claim was more likely to be successful. That may have seemed a good time for BBK to lose the restraints of legal aid and change to an arrangement that gave them a success fee as well. It is not therefore unfair to say that changing to CFA-lite at that point potentially allowed them to have their cake and eat it too.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">For all those reasons, I agree with Mr Hutton that, even taking the points raised by Mr Williams at face value, as far as the appellant herself was concerned, it was far from obvious that CFA-lite was a superior funding system compared to legal aid. On any view, it was not so much better that, contrary to the authorities I have cited, the appellant did not need to explain the reasons for changing funding and to justify that decision as reasonable.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">In one sense, the proof of the pudding is in the eating. BBK advised the appellant at the time that she “will be broadly in the same position” under a CFA as she was under legal aid. I agree with that advice; so she was. A CFA meant that BBK were potentially in a better position, but they did not advise the appellant of that, and it is in any event immaterial for present purposes. For these reasons, I reject the underlying premise of Mr Williams’ submissions, that CFA-lite was, in fact, obviously superior to legal aid. </p>

The second is the unlikelihood of such a situation arising in practice; the more obvious the reason for a change in funding, the more likely it is that such a reason will have occurred to the claimant’s solicitors at the time. If the so-called ‘obvious ‘reason did not occur to them or feature in their advice, that may well be because it was not so obvious, after all. </p>

The decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Surrey</span> appears to have worked well in practice. It stresses that, in general terms, there is little to choose between legal aid funding, on the one hand, and a CFA-lite arrangement on the other. In disputes about the recoverability from the paying party of additional liabilities where the funding has changed from the former to the latter, what matters is the reasonableness of the decision to change funding. That inevitably highlights the actual reasons for the change. On the particular facts of the present case, Master Rowley found that the reasons for the change were unreasonable and disallowed the success fee and the ATE premium. Jay J agreed with that, and so do I. </p>

It was not an evaluation based on the facts of any particular case or, indeed, type of case.
