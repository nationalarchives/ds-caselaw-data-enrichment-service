In the year ended 31 July 2005, it declared a gross profit of £3.3 million; for the 18 months ended 31 January 2007, a gross profit of £4.6 million; and for the subsequent year ended 31 January 2008, a gross profit of £2.3 million.  The managing director and sole shareholder is Mr Aria Taheri, who exercised overall control of the business.  At the material time, the finance director was Mr Frank Harasiwka and the purchasing manager was Mr Eddy McFadden.  The retail side of the business employed some 120 people, but the wholesale side was essentially run by Mr Taheri and Mr McFadden, with some involvement from Mr Harasiwka regarding the finances.  The Appellant’s wholesale deals involved purchasing central processing units (“CPUs”) and flat screen monitors from UK suppliers for resale to customers abroad.  </p>

The Appellant had claimed a repayment of £445,156.98 on the basis that all of its input tax was creditable.  When HMRC decided that £758,770.69 of the Appellant’s input tax was not creditable, the Appellant’s repayment claim was reduced by £758,770.69, so that HMRC was owed £313,613.71.

In its letters of 6 and 7 of October 2008, HMRC did not raise an assessment against the Appellant as the author of the letters, Mr Bailey, admitted in his evidence before the FTT that he had not made an assessment.  All that happened in this case was that HMRC denied input tax and thereby did not accept the VAT return as filed by the Appellant as being correct.

In the first place, Mr Cordara's reliance on Dillon LJ's reference in <span style="font-style:italic">Don Pasquale</span> to the decision to assess as being distinct from the assessment itself is in my judgment misplaced. The distinction between the assessment itself and notification of the assessment to the taxpayer is, of course, clear on the face of s 73. Thus, under s 73(1) the commissioners are empowered to 'assess the amount of VAT due from [the taxpayer] … and notify it to him'; under s 73(6) time runs from the making of the assessment; and under s 73(9) no debt arises until the assessment has been notified. However, the distinction between the decision to assess and the assessment itself is not one which is expressly drawn by s 73; nor, in my judgment, does s 73 require such a distinction to be drawn. At one extreme, a mere decision to assess which is not reflected in action plainly cannot of itself amount to an assessment. An assessment, after all, has to be capable of being notified to the taxpayer, and on notification it creates a debt: hence a <span style="font-style:italic">mere</span> executory decision to assess can have no statutory consequences. At the other extreme, where the steps taken by the commissioners, objectively viewed, constitute the making of an assessment, in my judgment s 73 leaves no room for an issue as to whether the commissioners decided to make – which is another way of saying, intended to make – the assessment which (objectively) they made.  </p>

They are not required by statute or regulation which prescribe no particular formality at all.  All that is required is that the commissioners should make an assessment to the best of their judgment and notify it to the taxpayer.  There is perhaps an understandable tendency to merge the assessment with the notification and to look only or mainly at a single document if it is called notice of assessment.  But there appears to be no reason why notification should not be given by letter, nor any reason why in this case the letter dated 24 May 1990 should not be seen as, or part of, due notification.  That letter states the amount of the assessment and refers to the schedules for the details of the build up of the amount.  I do not see why a notification cannot be contained in more than one document provided that it is clear which document or documents are intended to contain the notification and that that document or those documents contain in unambiguous and reasonably clear terms the substantial minimum requirements to which Mr Cordara has referred.” </p>

The fact that there has been such a decision will usually be implicit in the very fact that an assessment has been made; and the fact that an assessment has been made will be implicit in the notification of it.  Conversely, on facts very different from those of the present appeal, there may be circumstances in which the deliberate decision is made <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> to assess.

At para. 9, Lloyd LJ noted that the right way to proceed would have been to issue a supplementary assessment or an additional assessment.  The crucial point was that, by the time of the hearing before the Tribunal, it was too late to take either of those steps.  Thus, HMRC accepted that the taxpayer’s liability for VAT in respect of the relevant period was defined by the original assessment at £6,971.95.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Firth drew our attention to the power to open an enquiry under section 9A of the Taxes Management Act 1970, as amended, which was considered by this Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Raftopoulou v HMRC</span> [2018] EWCA Civ 818; [2018] STC 988: see in particular paras. 15 and 41-43 in the judgment of David Richards LJ.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Firth also cited the decision of the Supreme Court in <span style="font-style:italic">HMRC v Eclipse Film Partners No 35 LLP</span> [2016] UKSC 24; [2016] STC 1385, in particular at para. 24 in the judgment of Lord Neuberger PSC.  As I understand it, Mr Firth relies on that passage for the proposition that the mere fact that something could, as a matter of law, be done in a different way does not mean that it has been done.   That may well be so as a general proposition but, in my view, it takes matters no further in the present appeal.  The crucial question for this Court to decide is what was the true construction of the two letters of 6 and 7 October 2008.  If, on their true construction, they do record an “assessment” within the meaning of section 73 of the VAT Act, that is the end of the matter. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Finally, Mr Firth sought to rely on two cases concerned with trust powers:  <span style="font-style:italic">Kain v Hutton</span> [2008] NZSC 61; 11 ITELR 130, which was cited by Newey J (as he then was) in <span style="font-style:italic">Briggs v Gleeds</span> [2014] EWHC 1178 (Ch); [2015] Ch 212.  I am doubtful whether reference to cases about trust powers is going to be helpful in the present context, where we are concerned with statutory powers and in particular the powers in the VAT Act but, in any event, I do not consider that those two cases assist the Appellant’s argument in the present case. </p>

As I understood it from the hearing before us, the difficulty has arisen because it was mistakenly thought within HMRC that an assessment could not be issued where a VAT return had not been “processed”.  It should be a simple matter in practice of ensuring that, in circumstances such as these, the fact of assessment is internally recorded within HMRC and a Notice of Assessment is given as well.  If the return can be corrected that would be desirable but the statutory powers in this regard were not dealt with in any detail before us and I say no more about that. </p>
