	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0.00in">The twin purposes of the Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996, as amended by the Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Act 2009 (together referred to as “The Act”) was to improve cash flow in the construction industry, and to streamline its dispute resolution process. The former aim was achieved through mandatory provisions relating to interim payments, payment notices and the like, and the latter through a new, compulsory scheme of construction adjudication. The Act has been, on any view, a considerable success.  </p>

	      </authorialNote> “got at by some big, powerful, important interests in what are called the process industries. They yielded to those pressures and in so doing lost sight of the aim of the Bill.” Whatever the reason for it, many contracts for works which, on any sensible definition, are construction operations, were excluded from the ambit of the Act. To make matters more complicated, the Act recognised that this might create what have subsequently been called hybrid contracts, that is to say contracts providing both for construction operations (which were therefore expressly covered by the Act) and for operations which were expressly said not to be construction operations (and excluded from the Act). In the last 20 years, much too much time and judicial resource has been spent grappling with the problems created by such hybrid contracts, of which this appeal is but one example. But until the Act is amended to do away with these unnecessary distinctions, the courts have to do their best to resolve the resulting, self-inflicted problems. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0.00in">Although this case is, in many ways, a typical example of the genre, it raises a point which has not arisen for decision before. The issue is whether, in the case of a hybrid contract (which therefore provides for the execution of both construction operations within the Act and construction operations outside the Act), a valid payment notice is required to identify <span style="font-style:italic">separately</span> the sum due in respect of construction operations only, along with the basis on which that sum has been calculated. O’Farrell J (“the judge”) answered that question in the negative, but she recognised the wider significance of the points and gave the appellant (“CSL”) permission to appeal against her ruling. </p>

Those payments were in a form typical of the process industry, namely milestone payments. Those payments did not require a detailed valuation mechanism to arrive at the amount due at each milestone: the amount of each such payment was set out in the sub-contract to reflect the completion of a particular stage or element of the works. Until almost the end of the work on site, the parties operated the payment provisions of the sub-contract without any regard to the definition of construction operations in s.105 of the Act, or any perceived need to identify separate sums for construction and non-construction operations. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0.00in">There was a good reason for that. The sub-contract contained a series of detailed provisions relating to payment. They are set out extensively at [24] of the judge’s judgment ([2019] EWHC 2547 (TCC)) and are not repeated here. On their face, those payment provisions reflected the mandatory requirements of the Act. The judge summarised the contractual regime at [25] as follows: </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.55in;margin-right:0.20in;text-indent:0.29in">“25. Thus, the contractual regime for interim payments under the Subcontract is as follows. CSL is entitled to make an application for an interim or instalment payment on a monthly basis upon completion of each milestone. Each application submitted by CSL must set out CSL's assessment of the amount due in respect of completed milestones and any other amounts to which CSL considers itself to be entitled, together with the basis of calculation of the sum claimed and supporting documentation, less sums previously certified. Each instalment payment becomes due sixteen days after the date of CSL's application ("the Payment Due Date"). The contract manager issues a certificate sixteen days after the application, setting out his response to the application, including the basis on which the certified sum has been calculated. MW is obliged to pay the sum due nineteen days after the Payment Due Date ("the Final Date for Payment"). If MW intends to pay less than the sum due, it must issue a pay less notice no later than one day before the Final Date for Payment. Subject to any pay less notice, the sum due is (a) the amount certified for payment in the contract manager's certificate or, in the absence of such certificate, (b) the amount assessed by CSL as due in its application.” I adopt that summary, which was not disputed by either party on appeal. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0.00in">In July 2018, CSL gave notice of their intention to refer to adjudication the dispute that had arisen as to the sum due pursuant to application 31. At that point, MW raised a jurisdictional challenge in respect of the proposed adjudication, pointing out that the adjudicator could only deal with disputes in respect of construction operations and not disputes in respect of non-construction operations. MW said that, in circumstances where the dispute framed by CSL in their adjudication notice failed to distinguish between the two, the adjudicator did not have the necessary jurisdiction to decide the dispute. In the face of that challenge, CSL withdraw its adjudication claim. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0.00in">In my view, MW’s challenge was in accordance with the terms of the sub-contract. Clause 44.1 of the sub-contract, which set out the provisions in respect of adjudication, made plain that either party’s right to refer a dispute to adjudication applied “only to the extent (if any) required by the Act”. In other words, if the dispute was in respect of non-construction operations, the Act did not require a reference to adjudication, so that (absent express consent) any adjudicator appointed to deal with disputes about non-construction operations  would have had no jurisdiction. In addition, the challenge was in accordance with the authorities: MW’s underlying contention that, in the case of a hybrid contract, it was for the claiming party to demonstrate that any reference to adjudication was limited to construction operations, was based foursquare on the judgments of Ramsey J in <span style="font-style:italic">Cleveland Bridge (UK) Limited v Whessoe-Volker Stevin Joint</span> [2010] EWHC 1076 (TCC), [2010] BLR415, and of Stuart-Smith J in the first round of <span style="font-style:italic">Severfield (UK) Ltd v Duro Felguera UK Limited </span>[2015] EWHC 2975 (TCC). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0.00in">On 4 February 2019, CSL issued its application for interim payment 32 in the sum of £3,353,219.22 plus VAT. The covering letter explained that, because MW had drawn the distinction between construction and non-construction operations, CSL were now making that distinction themselves in their own application. Accordingly, the application for payment specified the amount of £2,683,617.09 plus VAT as being the sum allocated by CSL to construction operations. The breakdown that was attached explained how this figure, and the larger figure of £3.3 odd million for the works as a whole, had been calculated.  </p>

It referred to CSL’s application for payment, and then went on to give notice that, on MW’s case, CSL owed MW £6,818,521.70 excluding VAT. The attached spreadsheet set out the basis for that negative valuation. It was principally made up of various claims made by MW against CSL, including significant claims for delay.  </p>

That point was challenged by MW’s solicitors in a letter dated 19 March 2019. Subsequently, CSL commenced Part 8 proceedings seeking payment of the £2,683,617.09 plus VAT, again on the basis that MW’s payment notice 35 was invalid because of the absence of any sum allocated to construction operations only. The Part 8 claim was disputed by MW and resolved by the judge in MW’s favour. I refer to her judgment in more detail in Section 4 below.  </p>

It is clear that the legislation could have dealt with agreements which related both to construction operations and to "other maters" being operations which were not construction operations, in a number of ways. It would have been possible to treat them either as being agreements for construction operations or as not being agreements for construction operations. It would also have been possible for that question to depend on the relative values of the construction operations and of the "other matters". It is clear that Parliament decided that, just because an agreement related, in part, to operations which were not construction operations, this did not prevent the implied terms under section 114(4) of the Act from applying to the construction operations. It follows that a party can refer a dispute arising under the agreement, insofar as it relates to construction operations, to adjudication under a procedure complying with section 108 of the Act. In this case the contract contained no provision for adjudication and it is common ground that any adjudication would have to be carried out in accordance with the Scheme for Construction Contracts. ("the Scheme").” </p>

At one point, it was apparent that Mr Hickey was itching to submit that the provisions in the 1996 Act ought to be incorporated wholesale, even in a hybrid contract, to apply to all the works. But it seems to me that, first, that submission would have run counter to s.104(5), which expressly provides that the provisions in the Act apply "only so far as" they relate to construction operations; and secondly, ignores the fact that the parties have expressly agreed a different payment regime (paragraph 6 above).

Because the notice of December 2014 and the accompanying spreadsheet did not begin to address the complexities of what were and were not construction operations, interim payment claim 15 was for everything. There was therefore no explanation in the payment notice of the calculation of £1.4 million as being the minimum due in respect of construction operations within the 1996 Act. So it was not a payment notice in respect of the claim for £1.4 million for construction operations, because the basis for the calculation of that figure, let alone the figure itself, is nowhere explained or set out in interim payment application 15.  </p>

How could it be, when the claimant was claiming for everything, regardless of whether or not the works were construction operations within the Act? Because this was a hybrid contract, it was imperative that the claimant spell out the fact that, regardless of the position in relation to excluded operations, this was a payment notice (with all that that entailed) in respect of the claim for construction operations.” </p>

In my judgment where, as here, a hybrid contract contains a payment scheme that complies with, or mirrors, the relevant provisions of the Act for both construction and non-construction operations, a payment notice that does not separately state the sums due in respect of the construction operations is capable of constituting a valid notice for the purposes of sections 110A and 111 of the Act for the following reasons.  </p>

Firstly, the express words of sections 111 and 110A do not stipulate separate identification of the sums due in respect of construction operations. Section 111 simply identifies the "notified sum" by reference to a valid payment notice in section 110A. Section 110A(2) contains two requirements for a valid payment notice, namely, the sum considered due at the payment due date and the basis on which that sum is calculated. To comply with section 110A(2), the sum considered due must include, but is not expressly limited to, such sum in respect of construction operations. That may be satisfied by stating the overall sum considered due in response to the relevant application.  </p>

In such circumstances, it is possible for a payment notice to satisfy both the statutory requirements (in respect of construction operations) and the contractual requirements (in respect of non-construction operations). Such a payment notice could be valid under the contract and under the Act.  </p>

I agree with CSL that, where separate payment machinery applied, as in the case of <span style="font-style:italic">Severfield</span>, it would be necessary to distinguish construction operations from non-construction operations in respect of each application notice and payment notice. Otherwise, it would not be possible to identify the notified sum which became payable pursuant to section 111. There might also be cases where one party sought to enforce section 111 in isolation from any contractual entitlement to a payment. In such cases, it would be necessary for the party seeking to rely on section 111 to identify the notified sum to which the section applied so that the default provision in section 111 could be implemented. However, such difficulty would not arise where the same provisions applied to both construction and non-construction operations, whether by way of statutory requirement or contractual obligation. As a matter of principle, validity of the payment notice in respect of both the construction and non-construction operations would be determined against the same parameters. In such cases, it would be possible to identify the sum payable by way of each interim payment, applying section 111 (in respect of the claims for construction operations) together with the provisions replicated in the Subcontract (in respect of the claims for non-construction operations).  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0.00in">Accordingly, the next question is whether the terms of the sub-contract were, in some way, in contravention of the minimum requirements of the Act. If they were, then of course any non-compliant terms will not apply and, by operation of ss.109-111, the Scheme for Construction Contracts will apply instead. What could any potential noncompliance be? In this case, the only possible candidate is whether there is some part of the Act which requires, in a hybrid contract, payment terms which provide for the separate or distinct notification and breakdown of sums due in respect of construction operations only. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0.00in">In my view, there is nothing in the Act which sets out such a requirement. S.104(5) expressly recognises that, because of the distinction that the Act makes between construction and non-construction operations, there will be hybrid contracts. Indeed, as Mr Hargreaves submitted, this part of the Act created such contracts: without its distinction between construction and non-construction operations, there would be no such thing as a hybrid contract at all. But although the Act created such contracts, it does not provide that a hybrid contract must contain a term requiring the separate or distinct notification and breakdown of sums due in respect of construction operations only. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0.00in">If it was important for hybrid contracts to contain terms which provided for the notification and breakdown of sums due in respect of construction operations only, then the Act could easily have said so. For example, it could have provided that “the notified sum” in ss.110 and 110A was a sum in respect of construction operations only and/or must not include any sums in respect of non-construction operations. But the Act does not do that. Nowhere in ss. 110, 110A, 110B or 111 does the Act provide that the expression “the notified sum” should be modified in this way.  </p>

As has been pointed out in numerous authorities, the parties’ critical obligations begin and usually end with the payment of “the notified sum”. If CSL was right then, in every hybrid contract created by s.104(5), “the notified sum” would not be the full sum due to the payee, but just that part which related to construction operations. Alternatively, CSL’s case would lead to there being two different notified sums, one in respect of construction operations, and one in respect of non-construction operations. In my view, such significant qualifications to the parties’ statutory or contractual rights would need to be clearly expressed in the Act. But they are not. </p>

In other words, he said that it was artificial to rely on the fact that these provisions did not include the words on which he now relies, when that omission only occurred in the first place because the payment provisions in the Act presumed that the contracts with which they were concerned were construction contracts only.  </p>

The sections of the Act with which this appeal is concerned relate to construction contracts and (if that is what the parties agree) hybrid contracts too. It is therefore no answer to say that the words now relied on as being ‘read in’ were not expressly stated because the relevant sections of the Act presupposed that the contract in question was a construction contract.

That is the point made by the judge at [58], and already foreshadowed in paragraphs 40 and 51 above. In my view, that approach is not only permissible, it is to be welcomed, for the reasons that I have already given. The fact that the parties have agreed that the same payment provisions as set out in the Act will apply to both construction and non-construction operations does not require the parties to differentiate between different parts of the sub-contract works in the manner suggested by CSL. The terms of the sub-contract evidence their intention to do the opposite and, provided that by so doing they were not in breach of the Act (as I have found) they are entitled to rely on the sub-contract terms which they have agreed. </p>

But that only applies at all if there is a statutory right which is being lost. Here, there is a right/liability under the Act to be paid/to pay the notified sum (singular).

In particular, whether the dispute can be referred to adjudication will depend on whether the dispute relates to construction or non-construction operations, (because - unless it is extended by agreement - the adjudicator only has jurisdiction to deal with the former).

In other words, the adjudication clause recognised that this was a hybrid contract and made plain that the adjudication provisions only related to referrals in respect of construction operations. The same limitation could have been included in the payment provisions of the sub-contract, but was not. That indicates that the parties were content to rely on the payment provisions derived from the Act in respect of both construction and non-construction operations, but that in respect of the dispute resolution mechanism, they were limiting the adjudication provision to disputes in respect of construction operations only.

If they had wanted to challenge payment notice 35 in an adjudication, then CSL could have done so, and left it to MW to take a jurisdiction point, which they might or might not have done and which may or may not have been successful. Or CSL could have waited and then themselves have taken a jurisdiction point if MW had pursued their own claim for £6.5 million in adjudication.

Mr Nissen fairly conceded that, if he was right, it would be a change to the way in which the industry currently deals with hybrid contracts. And, as Mr Hargreaves demonstrated during his submissions, it may well be very difficult, if not impossible, to undertake such an allocation in a contract such as this, where the parties have agreed milestone payments. There is at least a risk that, if CSL were right and an allocation had to be performed, the parties would be obliged to carry out a detailed valuation exercise (to differentiate between construction and nonconstruction operations) in respect of milestone payments which, pursuant to this subcontract, were fixed in a single sum by reference simply to the completion of a particular stage of the work.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="3">

It is therefore unnecessary for this Court to determine them.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0.00in">During the course of his submissions, Mr Nissen relied on observations by Jackson LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">S&amp;T (UK) Limited v Grove Developments Limited </span>[2018] EWCA Civ 2448, in which he suggested at paragraphs 40 - 42, and again at paragraph 99, that s.111 not only overrode any contractual provisions which provided otherwise, but was also the principal source of the obligation to pay the notified sum, even if the contract said the same thing. The former observation was of course entirely conventional; with respect, the latter was not. Although this issue was not fully argued out in this appeal, I have given the matter careful thought, but I have concluded that I do not need to (and should not) address this issue in this judgment. There are a number of reasons for that. </p>

She approached the issues on the conventional basis that, if the payment terms in the contract complied with the Act, they were valid. Likewise, it was not fully argued before us. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0.00in">Secondly, I do not consider that it is necessary to decide whether Jackson LJ’s observation is right or wrong for the purposes of this appeal. The analysis which I have set out above is applicable regardless of whether the right to payment of the notified sum as set out in s.111 is paramount, or whether that right was a creature of a sub-contract which (as I have found) did not contravene the Act. Either way, on Mr Nissen’s case, words have to be read in to achieve the result which he wants and, for the reasons which I have given, I do not accept that such a mechanism is either appropriate or necessary. </p>

The point about s.111 arose in relation to one of six separate reasons why the first instance judge, and the Court of Appeal, decided the case in favour of the employers. His observations appear to go to a secondary issue about the potential clash between the adjudication regime and the prompt payment regime. The result in <span style="font-style:italic">Grove</span> would have been precisely the same if the right which Jackson LJ identified had been expressed as a contractual rather than a statutory right.  </p>

They appear to be suggesting that, at least for the purpose of the obligation to pay the notified sum, the contract is irrelevant, even if that contract meets all the minimum terms required by the Act. That may be right, but it might be thought to be a potentially surprising result. There seems to me to be nothing obvious on the face of s.111 which suggests that it is creating a completely different right to those created by ss.109-110B inclusive. In addition, I am not entirely clear how a provision like s.111, which started life dealing with the need for a construction contract to enshrine a party’s right to withhold payment of the sum due (if that party complied with the specified procedure) should now be read as creating a statutory right to be paid the notified sum regardless of the contract terms.  </p>
