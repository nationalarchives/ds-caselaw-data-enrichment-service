Paragraph 3 of the order contains a final injunction restraining the defendant from publishing or disclosing to any other persons all or any part of the information contained in Confidential Schedule 1 (“CS1”) to the order (“the Information”).  The injunction also prevents the use or disclosure by CCC of any information which is liable to identify the claimants, AAA and BBB, as parties to the proceedings and from making adverse or derogatory comments about them.  Paragraph 3(d) of the order also prevents CCC from seeking to damage the business of the claimants or that of any other business controlled by BBB by the release of the Information or the release of “any matter arising out of engagement with the Claimants”.  I shall return to the full terms of paragraph 3 later in this judgment. </p>

Both parties were business partners as well as directors and equal shareholders in AAA.  A dispute arose between them in part generated by various allegations of sexual harassment that were made against CCC in relation to an employee of AAA.  CCC denied the allegations and has himself complained of sexual assault by the employee in question.  Those allegations are also denied.  But these circumstances contributed to a breakdown in relations between BBB and CCC and the possibility of various claims being made by or against them or against AAA including an unfair prejudice petition under the Companies Act. </p>

The remaining £100,000 was conditional on AAA remaining contracted as at 31 January 2019 to its major client (“X”) at least until 31 January 2020.

In particular, it is alleged that CCC has threatened to make these allegations known to X, which is AAA’s major client, the result of which might well be the loss of that client and therefore considerable financial and reputational damage to AAA. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">There was no real dispute before the judge that CCC had either disclosed or threatened to disclose the alleged misconduct I have referred to.  His position as taken earlier in the proceedings was that the allegations of misconduct were true and that the claim for an injunction was intended to hide allegations of serious conduct, some criminal, by BBB which should not be barred from disclosure.  The injunction was therefore said to amount to an infringement of CCC’s freedom of expression under Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  The claimants’ position was that the allegations were untrue and had been fabricated by CCC in order to damage the value of AAA’s business and, if possible, to extort money from AAA and/or BBB as the price of his silence.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">There also seems to be no real dispute on the defendant’s side about the source of the information.  In his fourth witness statement made on 29 September 2019 (that was his defence to the claim), CCC refers to a number of the disputed allegations in terms which make it clear that these were matters he discovered during the time when he was employed by AAA and had access to the relevant information.  He says that he made inquiries (using his access to the financial records of AAA) into the payments which are said to constitute tax evasion and money laundering and that it was as a result of these inquiries that his relationship with BBB broke down.  The other misconduct alleged against BBB also relates to the period when CCC was still an employee or director of AAA.  </p>

It is important to emphasise that the claim for the injunction was based on the covenants contained in the SAR and the EC.  It was not based on a right to privilege or confidentiality or any other cause of action.   </p>

It was argued that the agreements had been procured by duress or had been repudiated but the judge rejected both those defences as unarguable.  He also rejected CCC’s reliance on Article 10 as a reason for refusing an immediate injunction, although he accepted that provision needed to be made in the order in relation to possible future conduct where the balance might lie differently on the issue of disclosure.  For that reason, he included the express liberty to apply on notice to vary the terms of the order.  Subject to that, however, he gave judgment for the claimants on their application.   </p>

Mr Chaisty says that since BBB was not a party to the EC he had no cause of action against CCC based on clause 10.5 nor any entitlement to an injunction which effectively enforces the provisions of clause 10.5.  Clause 13 of the EC expressly excludes third party rights under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999.  The effect of paragraph 3(c) of the order is therefore to give him the benefit of an order in his favour which he can enforce even though he could not enforce the contract.  In relation to paragraph 3(c), Mr Chaisty also points out that on its face the order gives BBB permanent protection from adverse or derogatory comments even though clause 10.5 of the EC restricts the protection to the directors and employees of AAA.  The period of protection should not extend beyond the time when BBB ceases to be either an employee or a director. </p>

The term “employees” is also very wide.

It was not, I think, contended before the judge that they featured in the negotiations and correspondence referred to in the definition of Confidential Information and it is part of the claimants’ case that it was the making of many of these allegations by CCC between 2017 and 2019 that led to the issue of the claim for injunctive relief. </p>

It is possible to give meaning to them in the context of particular actions and in large part they employ in a non-technical sense everyday language to which the court and the parties can give effect in a particular context.

A further factor is that the Second Claimant robustly denies the allegations. This is not a case where he accepts the allegations are true. It might be, though I doubt it would be, that different considerations would apply if the references were to undisputed facts but here Mr Harper is right to say that there is a real benefit to the Claimants in not having to litigate the question of the truth or otherwise of the allegations and it is legitimate for a party to say, “I don’t accept your allegations but I will agree with you that if you do not disclose them, I will make payment”.   </p>

In my judgement, the disclosure of information which is true can be derogatory, adverse, or harmful and can bring a person into disrepute if the information is not otherwise in the public domain.  It follows that the truth of the allegations would not be a defence to a claim that the Defendant is in breach. The allegations here are clearly derogatory and adverse and such as to bring the Claimants into disrepute. It follows that notwithstanding their truth the making of the allegations would amount to a breach of the contract.” </p>

The claimants were under clause 11.5 of the SAR entitled to require CCC to keep the Information secret and confidential even though the allegations, if true, could amount to unlawful conduct on their part.  As I said earlier in this judgment, it is not part of the defendant’s case that the SAR should be declared unenforceable (with the consequence that he should refund the £800,000 to the claimants) nor is it part of the grounds of appeal that the judge’s assessment in [36] that the information was confidential was wrong.  It follows that there was a breach of clause 11.5 of the SAR to which there is no arguable defence.  I therefore reject Mr Chaisty’s submission that the restriction contained in paragraph 3(a) of the order on the disclosure of the Information contained in CS1 was not within the terms of the SAR. </p>

I think that the judge was right when he said at [47] of his judgment that those words are sufficiently clear in meaning and the judge was, I think, entitled to take into account the fact that CCC agreed to the provisions of clause 10.5 with the benefit of legal advice.  I would therefore reject Mr Chaisty’s attack upon the language of paragraph 3(c). </p>

He should not therefore, it is said, be entitled to the benefit of a permanent injunction to enforce that covenant in his favour.  It seems to me important to distinguish between the grant of the injunction contained in paragraph 3(c) and its enforcement in the event of a subsequent breach.  Although BBB clearly had no right to seek to enforce a contract to which he was not a party, AAA did have that right and could seek by injunctive relief specific performance of CCC’s covenant in its full terms.  That included the restraint on making adverse or derogatory comments about AAA’s directors and employees.  One can think of examples in other contexts of an employer seeking and obtaining injunctive relief for the protection of its employees.  The parties to the proceedings will not necessarily include the employees but there is little doubt that the court has power to grant an injunction for their benefit which the employer can enforce.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Much of Mr Chaisty’s argument on this point rests on an assumption that BBB would himself be able to enforce paragraph 3(c) of the order independently of AAA.  I question whether this is right.  We were referred to the commentary in 3C-17 of the White Book with its reference to what Sir Robert Megarry V-C said in <span style="font-style:italic">Clarke v Chadbourn</span> [1985] 1 WLR 78.  Although BBB was a party to the claim which sought to enforce the provisions of both the SAR and the EC, the Court cannot have granted the injunction contained in paragraph 3(c) on his application for the reasons of lack of privity on which Mr Chaisty relies.  I therefore doubt whether BBB could in his own right seek committal of CCC for a breach of that part of the order.  But ultimately that is a matter to be debated if at all should enforcement become an issue.  It seems to me that it cannot affect AAA’s entitlement to an order which enforces the terms of the contract it has entered into.  </p>

Although I can see that the terms of paragraph 3(c) were drafted with the present very much in mind, the injunction is capable of enduring permanently.  I would therefore amend that part of the order by adding after the reference to the Second Claimant the words “so long as he remains a director or employee of the First Claimant”.  </p>

Clause 11.3 is concerned with preventing damage being caused to AAA, BBB or another of his companies by the release of Confidential Information as defined or the release of this other category of information.  The words “arising out of CCC’s engagement” with AAA is to be contrasted with the definition of Confidential Information which refers to CCC’s period as an employee or director of AAA.  I have to say that it is difficult to see what the disputed words add or mean given the wide definition of Confidential Information and I think that Mr Chaisty is right that their inclusion in the order is likely to create uncertainties in relation to what other information is intended to be covered by these words.  I would therefore delete the final part of paragraph 3(d) after the words “the release of the Information”.  </p>

I am not persuaded that that is a sufficient objection to an order in these terms.
