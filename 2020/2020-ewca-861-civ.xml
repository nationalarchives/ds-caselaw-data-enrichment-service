The site, of about five hectares, lies in the Calderstones/Woolton Green Wedge and an area of Green Space. It was occupied by a city council depot, a miniature railway, stabling for horses ridden by people with disabilities, and a facility for disabled children known as “Calder Kids”.

The city council and Redrow both sought permission to appeal, which the judge granted. On 25 March 2020, Redrow lodged a notice of discontinuance – effectively withdrawing its appeal.

In a respondent’s notice the company raised a third, which concerned the status of the site as part of Calderstones Park, but that was not pursued before us. However, there is now a prior question for us to decide. Given Redrow’s withdrawal, the company says the city council’s appeal is academic and should not be entertained.

At the hearing it gave an undertaking to the court through its leading counsel, Mr Paul Tucker Q.C. – foreshadowed by correspondence between its Principal Solicitor (Regulatory) and the company’s solicitor – “that, in the event of this appeal succeeding so that [the permission for the housing development] is reinstated, it will not commence any development under that permission or permit any other person from so doing [sic] insofar as that lies under its control”. This is intended to give effect to a statement made by the Mayor of Liverpool, Joe Anderson, published in the local press and online on 18 January 2019 and confirmed by him on BBC Radio Merseyside on 19 January 2019, that the housing scheme is “dead”. The undertaking does not satisfy the company, whose solicitor, in a letter to the city council dated 18 May 2020, says that “what is required is an undertaking that regardless of the outcome of the appeal the land is only to be used as it is currently or as a park”.  </p>

But the Policy OE3 issue is of a different kind. It is a question of policy interpretation, not previously considered, not confined to the particular circumstances of this case, but with significance across the city and potential consequences in other areas where similar policies are in place – though the precise form of such policies will differ. Policy OE3 covers large areas of land designated as Green Wedge, and is often applied in development control decisions. Is it as restrictive a policy as national and development plan policies for the Green Belt, or even more so? That is clearly a significant question in the planning of Liverpool. But it is also a point of some general importance, whose determination by this court is likely to be of benefit elsewhere. This is enough to support the conclusion that this appeal is not wholly academic, and, in the public interest, ought to be heard. It follows that the appeal as a whole, including the section 66(1) issue, must be entertained, because to succeed in overturning that part of the judge’s order by which he quashed the planning permission for Redrow’s proposal, the city council has to win on both issues.  </p>

He said that “[for] the reasons given earlier in this report, [he] considers that the scheme is, on balance, acceptable having regard to the wider public/regeneration benefits that it would deliver”, and “… that matters relating to any identified impacts on openness/greenspace, highways, design, ecology, archaeology, trees and the amenity of nearby occupiers are acceptable, having regard to the impact on the wider Green Wedge, and having regard to the particular characteristics of this part of the Green Wedge”. He also said that “impacts on Heritage are considered to be outweighed by the public benefits identified within the report”. Finally, he confirmed that “[on] this basis, he [considered] the proposal accords with [National Planning Policy Framework (“NPPF”)] and the relevant development plan policies …”. He was referring there to the original NPPF, published by the Government in March 2012, which was extant at the time. I shall do the same.     </p>

It also says that “[the] reuse of buildings within the Green Belt will only be permitted where … the proposed use does not have a materially greater impact than the present use on the openness of the Green Belt and the purposes of including land within it …”, and that “[proposals] for the extension of both existing and reused buildings … should not conflict with the openness of the Green Belt and the purposes of including land within it …”. As the supporting text confirms, the policy corresponded to national policy for the Green Belt in Planning Policy Guidance Note 2, current at the time of the adoption of the UDP.

He did not think that “[subparagraph] ii permits planning judgment to allow what is prohibited under [subparagraph] i” (paragraph 103). The “conflict with [Policy] OE3 here had to be openly acknowledged and expressly taken into account”. It was “indisputable and not disputed that these proposals would affect the open character of the [Green Wedge] land within and around the application site, whether or not “open character” here is equated to “openness” in [Green Belt] cases” (paragraph 104). In a case such as this, the local planning authority had to “face up to the conflict” with the development plan, and, “if it decides to proceed, address itself under section 38(6) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 to the incongruity between the development proposal and the development plan” (paragraph 109). The officer’s report was “wrong, without first acknowledging a conflict with [Policy] OE3 i, to concern itself with the planning judgment as to whether the development would “unduly” or “in the main” adversely affect the green wedge space; and was wrong to assess the extent of the adverse effect, the degree to which the open character of the green wedge land was already compromised and the proportion, expressed as a percentage of the whole, of the green space affected” (paragraph 110). </p>

As with other formulations of planning policy, its meaning is to be derived from the words the policy-maker has used, read sensibly in their “proper context”, and not as if they were the provisions of a statute or contract (see the judgment of Lord Reed in <span style="font-style:italic">Tesco Stores Ltd. v Dundee City Council</span> [2012] 2 P. &amp; C.R. 9, at paragraphs 18 and 19). </p>

As was emphasised both by this court in <span style="font-style:italic">Samuel Smith </span>(at paragraphs 33, 38 to 40 and 50), and by the Supreme Court (at paragraphs 22 and 25), it involves the exercise of planning judgment by the decision-maker. When it considers whether the decision-maker has exercised a lawful planning judgment in applying a planning policy, the court will not be taken beyond its limited role in a public law challenge (see the speech of Lord Clyde in <span style="font-style:italic">City of Edinburgh Council v Secretary of State for Scotland</span> [1997] 1 W.L.R. 1447, at p.1458G to p.1459D).

Context governs the policy’s meaning. Thus, for example, the aim of preserving the “openness” of the Green Belt was not limited by the proposition in paragraph 79 of the NPPF that one of the “essential characteristics” of Green Belts is their “openness” – a concept whose meaning, in that context, goes to the mere physical presence, or otherwise, of buildings, regardless of any visual impact they might have (see <span style="font-style:italic">Lee Valley</span>, at paragraph 7; and <span style="font-style:italic">Hook</span>, at paragraph 7(3)). As this court said in <span style="font-style:italic">Lee Valley</span> (at paragraph 7), specifically in the context of paragraph 79, “[the] concept of “openness” here means the state of being free from built development, the absence of buildings – as distinct from the absence of visual impact”. But this does not mean that, in the context of the development control policies in paragraphs 87 to 90, harm to “openness” cannot be caused by forms of development other than buildings – such as those referred to in paragraph 90, which contains a proviso that they “preserve the openness of the Green Belt”; or cannot be caused by a development’s visual impact on “openness”.

And it did so. The judge’s interpretation of Policy OE3 was incorrect. It wrongly elevated “open character” to an absolute concept. Subparagraph i of the policy refers to development affecting the “predominantly open character” of a Green Wedge. This is a qualified concept – and one that does not appear in Green Belt policy. Policy OE3 does not mean that all built development in a Green Wedge must be regarded as causing – in the officer’s words – “unacceptable harm”. Some “harm” by the reduction of unbuiltupon land may be acceptable, and not contrary to Policy OE3, if it does not conflict with the aims and objectives of the policy. An impact less than “unacceptable harm” is not unacceptable. Assessing whether a particular proposal is contrary to the policy will always be a matter of planning judgment for the decision-maker. Here, the city council, in the lawful exercise of its planning judgment, was satisfied that the development would not have an unacceptable impact on<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>the “predominantly open character” of the Green Wedge, and that it complied with Policy OE3 in its totality.

If such development were tolerated, “openness” would be compromised and a precedent set – leading to “the death of a thousand cuts” referred to by Sullivan J. in <span style="font-style:italic">Heath and Hampstead Society</span> (at paragraph 37). The only built development permissible under Policy OE3, Mr Streeten argued, is development not caught by subparagraph i – development that does not affect the “predominantly open character” of the Green Wedges or reduce the physical separation between existing built-up areas. Such development – for example, conversions, extensions, sports and recreation facilities – is not “inappropriate” and is permitted under subparagraph ii, subject to the criteria laid down.  </p>

It does not say that planning permission will be refused for all “new development” in a Green Wedge, or for all new “built development”, or that only development within certain exceptions will be approved, or that development outside those exceptions will only be approved if “very special circumstances” are demonstrated. Had any such prohibition or restriction been intended, this part of the policy would not have been expressed as it is. On a straightforward reading of the words the city council has used as policy-maker, subparagraph i poses two questions for it as decisionmaker: first, whether the development proposed would “affect the predominantly open character” of the Green Wedge in which it would be located; and secondly, whether it would “reduce the physical separation between existing built up areas”. </p>

Implicit in it is a recognition that the Green Wedges, as designated, were by no means free from built development.

Subparagraph i does not rule out any reduction, or net reduction, in unbuilt<span style="font-weight:bold">-</span>upon land within a Green Wedge – a reading of Policy OE3 that would render it even more restrictive than policy for the Green Belt. Under this provision, as Mr Tucker argued, the mere fact of an increase in built development does not mean that the development proposed will necessarily have an unacceptable impact on the “predominantly open character” of the Green Wedge, and so be contrary to the policy. Some physical change of that kind is allowed for – possibly, as here, through the removal of existing development and its replacement with new buildings – so long as the impact on the “predominantly open character” of the Green Wedge is not, in the decision-maker’s planning judgment, unacceptable, having regard to the objectives of the policy.  </p>

What is required is a realistic assessment of the impact that this development, on this site, and in its own surroundings, will have on the “the predominantly open character” of the Green Wedge.

And the reference to the “conversion or extension” of buildings being included is not to limit the scope of potentially acceptable “built development” to such development, but to make clear that this provision relates to all “new built development”, including conversions and extensions to existing buildings. </p>

This is a clear, reasonable and lawful conclusion on the proposal’s compliance with subparagraph i. It embodies a legitimate planning judgment, based on a true understanding of the policy. The officer faced the crucial question: whether the impact the proposed development would have on the “predominantly open character” of the Green Wedge was acceptable. He found it was acceptable, and the proposal compliant with subparagraph i. This conclusion was confirmed when he went on to say that there would be “no significant impact on the character or openness of the wider Green Wedge/Green Space …”, and that he was “satisfied that the proposed development does not constitute a departure from the UDP in relation to saved policies OE3 and OE11, given it is considered that there will only be limited impacts”.

He did not sidestep either provision. He applied both. Having concluded as he did on the proposal’s compliance with subparagraph i, he then considered whether it complied also with the criteria specifically for “built development” in subparagraph ii. He went one by one through those criteria, and the relevant criteria in paragraph 8.25, and found each of them satisfied.

This was consistent with the policy in paragraph 129 of the NPPF referring to the need for authorities to take into account “any necessary expertise”, and with the guidance in the Planning Practice Guidance stressing the value of “expert advice”, and the seeking of “[advice] … from appropriately qualified staff and experienced in-house experts </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.00in">Whether the failure to bring the objection to the attention of the members was simply an oversight or deliberate does not matter. It is the more striking because the officer took care to refer in his report to three other internal consultation responses. And it was, I think, a significant omission (see <span style="font-style:italic">Mansell v Tonbridge and Malling Borough Council</span> [2019] </p>

It was a detailed and carefully considered assessment of the effects the development would have on the listed buildings and their settings. It differed from the assessment presented to the committee by the Interim Head of Planning, and in a significant way. It articulated “strong conservation objections” to the proposed construction of three houses within the setting of Beechley House. That the Interim Head of Planning himself acknowledged there would be some harm to the setting of the listed building does not overcome the omission. The fact remains that the city council’s own conservation officers had expressed a firm objection, which was neither confronted nor even noted in the officer’s report or in debate at the committee meeting.   </p>

Quite apart from the section 66(1) duty, this was a matter to which the city council had to have regard in reaching its decision on the application for planning permission, giving it such weight as it saw fit. It could have made a difference to the outcome. But it was overlooked. That was an error of law.  </p>

(on the application of Loader v Rother District Council</span> [2016] EWCA Civ 795. In that case the proposed development was in the setting of a grade II listed Victorian terrace. The officer’s report had indicated that the Victorian Society, which had objected to a previous application, had made no comments on the new proposal. In fact, they had not been consulted. The appellant argued that the committee might have been left, wrongly, with the impression that the Victorian Society were now satisfied with the revised design. This court accepted that “[in] the context of the duty [in section 66(1)], … in taking this misinformation into account, [the committee] could be said to have proceeded on the basis of an error of fact”, but that “the unlawfulness [was] better described as the taking into account of an immaterial consideration” (paragraph 57). This was enough to justify quashing the planning permission (paragraph 58).   </p>

Its potential effect, however, was no less significant. As in <span style="font-style:italic">Loader</span>, it was liable – seriously, though innocently – to mislead the members when making their decision. It implied the absence of objection from a consultee with specific responsibility for the conservation of heritage assets: in <span style="font-style:italic">Loader</span> a national amenity society; here the city council’s own “experienced in-house experts”. In that case, it was not known what the Victorian Society would have said had they been consulted. They might have said nothing. Here, however, the court knows there was an objection from the city council’s Urban Design and Heritage Conservation team, which was not dealt with by the officer in his advice to the Planning Committee or grappled with by the members. </p>

It was also a significant default in the city council’s performance of its duty under section 66(1). It indicates that despite the reference made in the officer’s report to the statutory duty, the policies in paragraphs 132 and 134 of the NPPF and Policy HD5 of the UDP, the duty to have “special regard” to the desirability of preserving the setting of the listed building was not complied with. Even if one could excuse the other shortcomings to which the judge referred – including the “unweighted formulation of the balancing exercise” in the officer’s assessment – I think this would be a sufficiently powerful “contra-indication” on its own to displace the presumption that the section 66(1) duty was discharged. For this reason, like the judge, I am left in “substantial doubt” that the duty was performed.</p>
