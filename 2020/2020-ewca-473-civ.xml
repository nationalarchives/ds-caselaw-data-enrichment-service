	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0.00in">The issue arises in an action brought by the claimant and respondent, Mexichem UK Limited (“Mexichem”), for revocation of six patents owned by the defendant and appellant, Honeywell International Inc. (“Honeywell”).  All six patents relate to compounds useful in refrigeration systems.  In recent years there has been a focus in research to find refrigerants which are less harmful to the environment than compounds previously used.  A particular focus of the patents is refrigerants for use in mobile air-conditioning systems (“MACs”) for cars, and in particular two refrigerants known as R-1234ze (“ze”) and R-1234yf (“yf”).  These compounds are claimed either alone for use in MACs, or combined with a lubricant, of which there are alternatives, or other refrigerants.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0.00in">Mexichem wishes to be free to market ze and yf in the UK for use in MACs.  In addition to seeking to revoke the six patents in suit, Mexichem is also concerned that Honeywell has at least four other divisional patent applications in the pipeline undergoing examination in the European Patent Office.  In order to protect itself against the possible impact of the grant of patents in the future on those further applications, Mexichem has sought declaratory relief aimed at establishing that the mere idea of using ze or yf in a MAC was obvious at particular dates. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0.00in">All six patents in suit have a priority date of either 25 October 2002 or 29 April 2004.  By 25 October 2002 both ze and yf were known compounds.  By that date a Japanese patent application number H41-10388 (“Inagaki”) had been made available to the public.  Mexichem accordingly sought declarations to the effect that by 25 October 2002 and/or 29 April 2004 it was obvious in the light of the teaching of Inagaki (a) to use ze in the manufacture of a product for use as a refrigerant in a MAC; and/or(b) to use yf in the manufacture of a product for use as a refrigerant in a MAC. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0.00in">Honeywell applied before the judge to strike out the claim for these declarations, or alternatively for summary judgment against Mexichem on this claim, on the grounds that Mexichem had no real prospect of succeeding in obtaining such a declaration at the trial.  Honeywell objects to the declarations on a variety of grounds.  It complains that the declaration is not sought in relation to a specific product or process which Mexichem intends to market in the UK, that it is not sufficiently clear, and that a declaration in these broad general terms lacks any utility.  It contends that this is so clear at this interim stage that the court should not even allow it to go forward to trial. </p>

Since then, the court’s discretionary power to grant <span style="font-style:italic">Arrow</span> declarations in appropriate cases has been reviewed by this court in two cases: <span style="font-style:italic">Fujifilm Kyowa Kirin Biologics Co Ltd v AbbVie Biotechnology Limited and another </span>[2017] EWCA Civ 1; and in <span style="font-style:italic">Glaxo Group Limited v Vectura Limited</span> [2018] EWCA Civ 1496.

The declarations would foreclose any further argument in this jurisdiction on that point, but would go no further… </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Speck developed some of these points at the hearing more fully than others.  One theme of his submissions was that the rationale for the utility of the grant of an <span style="font-style:italic">Arrow</span> declaration was the approach taken to the issues of infringement and validity in the well-known case of <span style="font-style:italic">Gillette Safety Razor Co v Anglo-American Trading Co Ltd</span> (1913) 30 RPC 465.  Instead of analysing the issues of infringement of a patent and its validity as separate issues, Lord Moulton had taken a short cut.  He concluded that, on the facts before him, there was nothing inventive in the defendant’s razor blade.  Having reached that conclusion about a specific product, it could be established that the product could not be covered by the claims of a valid patent.  Either the product must be excluded from the scope of the claims, or alternatively, if within the claims, the patent must be invalid.  It was not difficult to see why an <span style="font-style:italic">Arrow</span> declaration would be of utility in such circumstances, because in any future proceedings the holder of such a declaration could simply establish that it was doing no more than was specified in the declaration, and the subsequent proceedings would be struck out.  Whilst Mr Speck accepted that there were of course limits as to the amount of detail which an applicant for such a declaration must be required to give of a product, to grant declarations of the extreme breadth of those sought by Mexichem lacked that sort of utility.  </p>

To provide such a platform was contrary to the warning, given in cases such as <span style="font-style:italic">Technograph Printed Circuits Limited v Mills &amp; Rockley (Electronics) Ltd</span> [1972] RPC 346, against “step-by-step” arguments of obviousness.  It was wrong in principle to decide at the outset that a particular part of the gap between the prior art and the invention was obvious, and then to use that as a bridgehead for subsequent steps.  The task for the court was to decide whether the invention as a whole involved an inventive step.  That might be so even where each of the steps which the skilled person is required to take, viewed in isolation, might be described as obvious.  To grant a declaration in respect of one step was wrong in principle.  It lacked real utility because a second action would not be struck out.  Moreover, such a declaration positively distorted the exercise which the court was later required to perform.  </p>

That would be a valid point to make after a trial at which validity of these broad claims had been maintained by Honeywell.  It would be wrong, however, to assume that the issues will remain the same at trial as they appear to be now.   Another part of Mexichem’s case, as set out in the Particulars of Claim, asserts that Honeywell has a litigation strategy which seeks to avoid court or tribunal determinations of the validity of its broad concepts.  That would perhaps not matter if it showed comparable reticence when asserting these broad claims against its competitors.  The Particulars of Claim identify a number of occasions where a strategy of abandoning patents or appeals shortly before hearings so as to avoid adverse determinations has been implemented.  It is not necessary to recite all the extensive detail set out in the pleading, because I must assume at this stage that Mexichem will succeed in establishing its allegation.   Most relevantly, however, on 30 October 2019, patent attorneys acting on behalf of Honeywell wrote to the UK Intellectual Property Office (“the IPO”) offering to surrender the UK designation of the 977 patent under section 29 of the Patents Act 1977.  A copy of this surrender offer was sent by Honeywell’s solicitors to Mexichem’s the following day.  On 5 November Mexichem’s solicitors wrote to the IPO seeking a stay of the consideration of the surrender offer until the outcome of the revocation proceedings.  </p>

We were informed that such a stay is in force.  The German designation of 977 was, of course, one of the patents which was used to prevent the offer for sale of yf by SRI in Germany.  There is no corresponding attempt to surrender the 655 patent, with its claim to the use of ze in a MAC.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0.00in">What effect all this will have on the issues at the trial is not easy to predict.  Honeywell, having been obliged to defend 977 against the claim for revocation, may consent to its revocation, or may seek to amend the claims so as to formulate a narrower inventive concept.  The same applies to 655.  If Honeywell submits to revocation, the presence of the declarations may give Mexichem valuable protection.  As Lewison LJ pointed out in the course of argument, the declarations are a means of ensuring that, whatever steps are taken by Honeywell to remove the issues of the inventiveness of the broad inventive concepts from scrutiny and adjudication by the court, Mexichem will remain in procedural control of those issues. It will also mean that Mexichem will obtain protection against further attempts by Honeywell to protect these broad concepts through the cited and other divisional applications which result in granted patents. </p>
