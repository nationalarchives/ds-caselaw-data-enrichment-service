The solicitors are entitled to know specifically which items are challenged and the reasons for the challenge.  Insofar as the claimant states that all entries are disputed, it seems to me that it would be beholden on him to explain why each particular entry is challenged and whether he is asserting that no time should be allowed or reduced time should be allowed or whether the work should have been done by a different grade of fee earner.  But, as pleaded, the points of dispute, it seems to me, do not raise a proper challenge to the documents items and certainly do not raise a challenge which can be properly answered by the defendant without a considerable amount of time being spent in looking at the papers to reply to that challenge and that, it seems to me, is a process, which if it is to be done, should be done in advance of the hearing rather than at the hearing. </p>

Accordingly, directions should have been given for filing further Points of Dispute and the matter should have been adjourned to be dealt with on another occasion, if necessary. Mr Munro accepted, however, that the process was governed by the procedure set out at CPR r46.10 and that the right to an assessment was subject to the consideration of proportionality both in relation to the costs and time of the parties and court time and resources. He submitted, nevertheless, that even if the paying party on a solicitor and own client assessment failed to serve any Points of Dispute they would have a right to be heard.  </p>

Both the right and the obligation must inevitably be subject to the rules and procedures which relate to the exercise of that right which include the rules of the court itself. Had it been intended that the right, and the obligation for that matter, was absolute, it seems to me that section 70 would have been worded very differently. As it stands, in my judgment, the ordinary meaning of section 70 is that the solicitor and own client assessment will be carried out by the court in accordance with the rules by which such matters are governed, including the case management powers of the court.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">That case, to which the pre April 2013 Costs Practice Direction applied, was concerned with two decisions made by a master in the course of a detailed assessment of various bills rendered by solicitors to their client. The former client, having served discursive Points of Dispute, sought to challenge the solicitor’s costs line by line at the hearing and raised matters which went beyond the Points of Dispute. The Master gave directions that the parties meet to narrow the issues and that in the event that it did not prove possible to resolve their differences, Mount Eden (the paying party) should serve a schedule setting out the items that remained in dispute “as briefly as possible.” The schedule which was later provided did not comply with the Master’s order. It relied on two broad headings: “excessive” and “no supporting evidence” and identified the items challenged by reference to the solicitor’s timesheets rather than the breakdown of their bills. At a further hearing, the Master held that neither the Points of Dispute as originally served nor as amended would enable a detailed assessment to be carried out at proportionate cost without loss of fairness to the defendant and that it would not be dealing with the case justly to permit the client a third opportunity to put its case into an intelligible form. Accordingly, he stayed the assessment. Teare J gave permission to appeal but dismissed the appeal.   </p>

General points and matters of principle which require consideration before individual items in the bill or bills are addressed, should be identified, and then specific points should be made “stating concisely the nature and grounds of dispute.” Such an approach is entirely consistent with the recommendations and observations made in the Review of Civil Litigation Costs: Final Report, 2009 to which we were referred.  </p>

This need not be a lengthy process. Having explained the nature and grounds of dispute succinctly, the draftsman should insert the numbers of the items disputed on that ground in the relevant box. The principle is very simple. In order to deal with matters of this kind fairly, justly and proportionately, it is necessary that both the recipient and the court can tell why an item is disputed.

He sought to use the three examples which Stewarts Law had been directed to produce by Longmore LJ and the comments upon them to show that there were matters which the Chief Master had already dealt with under other heads which fed through to the work on documents, and could easily have been dealt with at the hearing.

It seems to me that that decision falls within the wide ambit of the court’s discretion under CPR r3.4(2)(b) and or (c). The Chief Master was entitled to decide that it was not possible to conduct a fair hearing on the basis of Points of Dispute 10 as pleaded, the matter could not be conducted fairly “on the hoof” and was likely to take too long. Despite his very considerable experience in these matters the Chief Master himself noted that having read the papers in the light of the points of dispute as they were pleaded he was unable to identify which particular items were challenged or why and Mr Poole accepted that that was the case.  </p>
