	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">This is an appeal against a decision of the Upper Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) dated 18 July 2019 dismissing the Appellant’s claim for judicial review of a decision of the respondent refusing to grant the appellant leave to remain in the United Kingdom as a Tier 2 (General) Migrant.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">In summary, the appellant came to the United Kingdom with leave to enter as a Tier 4 (General) Student. He made an application seeking to vary his existing leave and be granted leave to remain as a Tier 2 (General) Migrant. That application was refused on 27 September 2018. An administrative review of that decision was concluded on 31 October 2018 and the decision upheld. The appellant submitted that the application was not finally determined until the administrative review was complete. He contended that he was entitled to vary the application at any time until it was finally determined and had done so on 18 October 2018 by making a human rights claim. In those circumstances, he submitted that he continued to have leave to remain by virtue of section 3C of the  Immigration Act 1971 (“the 1971 Act”) until the application (as varied to include the human rights claim) was decided.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Secondly, the appellant submitted that the respondent determined his application in a way that was procedurally unfair. The respondent had sought further information from the sponsor of his Tier 2 application without also notifying the appellant that further information was required and telling him that if it were not provided the application might be refused. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">The respondent submitted first that the application was decided on 27 September 2018 when it was refused. Any variation of that application had to be made before it was decided, i.e. before 27 September 2018. The appellant could not vary that application by making a human rights claim on 18 October 2018. Further, the respondent submits that the human rights claim was not in any event a valid variation as it was not in the prescribed form, no fee was paid and mandatory requirements were not satisfied. Secondly, the respondent submitted that there was no unfairness in the way that she dealt with the application and, in particular, procedural fairness did not require her to notify the appellant that she had made a request to the appellant’s sponsor for further information. </p>

The letter explained that specified information was required before the respondent could proceed further with the applications. The letter then requested the sponsor to provide information about the jobs including full job descriptions listing the duties of the proposed employees and an explanation as to why the sponsor required an accounts manager and a sales manager. The letter also requested other information including the sponsor’s business bank account statements for the last 12 months, a full staff list, the latest company accounts, HMRC reference numbers, a chart of all employees, CVs for the appellant and the other applicant and marketing material and website details.

The letter said that the information covered various areas of the sponsor’s business and as a result more time was needed to prepare them. It said that: </p>

The letter said, amongst other things, that it was a human rights claim within the meaning of section 113 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (“the 2002 Act”) and that there was no requirement to make the claim by way of a fee paid application. It stated that the appellant had established a private life in the United Kingdom and that leave to remain should be granted under Article 8 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”). </p>

Leave to remain would continue in force by virtue of section 3C of the 1971 Act until the application for leave (as varied by the human rights claim) was determined. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">The Upper Tribunal held that the appellant could only apply to vary an application before it had been determined. In the present case, the application had been determined on 27 September 2018. The process of administrative review was not an extension of the decision-making process. It was a review of the decision. Consequently, it was not open to the appellant to seek to vary the application on 18 October 2018 as the application had been determined by that time. Further, the Upper Tribunal did not consider that, on the facts, the letter of 18 October 2018 did amount to an application to vary the earlier application.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">The Upper Tribunal further held that there was no procedural unfairness in the way in which the respondent dealt with the application. The Immigration Rules provided that the respondent may request additional information and evidence from the sponsor and may refuse the application if the information or evidence is not provided. The sponsor was asked to provide information and was given a period of 25 business days to do so (longer than the ten business days referred to in the Immigration Rules). The Upper Tribunal concluded that the primary onus was on the appellant to provide all the necessary information. There was no obligation on the respondent to inform the appellant that information had been sought from the sponsor or to remind the sponsor of what was clearly set out in the letter of 7 August 2018 that the consequence of a failure to provide the information might be the refusal of the application.  </p>

The application is only finally determined when the process of administrative review is completed. A decision refusing the application is an initial, inchoate, or provisional decision and the final determination is only made on the outcome of the administrative review. He submitted that the provisions governing the process of administrative review must necessarily be read as an extension of the process of deciding the application. There would otherwise be no legal basis for a formal system of administrative review leading to a fundamentally different decision from the decision refusing the application. He submitted that that was consistent with the approach of the VicePresident of the Upper Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) refusing permission to apply for judicial review in R (Sukhwinder Singh) v Secretary of State for the Home Department JR/1361/2015. In considering whether the claim was brought out of time, the Vice-President considered that the process of administrative review was different in character from the informal process of reconsideration of decisions previously undertaken. The final decision was the decision reached on the administrative review. </p>

The application was refused on 27 September 2018 but the administrative review was not completed until 31 October 2018. Consequently, the appellant could vary that application at any time before 31 October 2018. The appellant continued to have leave to remain by virtue of section 3C of the 1971 Act until the application, as varied to include the human rights claim, is determined. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">The starting point is the wording of section 3C of the 1971 Act. The section applies if a person has limited leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom and applies for variation of that leave before the leave expires and the leave expires without the application having been decided: see section 3C(1)(a)-(c). In those circumstances the existing leave is extended for the periods permitted by section 3C(2) of the 1971 Act. Thus, where a person such as the appellant has leave to remain as a Tier 4 (General) Student and applies to vary that leave and be granted leave as a Tier 2 (General) Migrant, he continues to have leave to remain in the United Kingdom until the application is determined. Furthermore, the applicant may vary the application by substituting a different basis for seeking to vary the existing leave: see section 3C(5) of the 1971 Act. A variation may only made before the application is determined. Once the application is determined there is nothing to vary. That is recognised by the Court of Appeal in JH (Zimbabwe) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2009] Imm A.R. 3.

		<span style="font-size:11pt">35. The key to the matter is an understanding of how s.3C operates….The section applies, by subs.(1) , where an application for variation of an existing leave is made before that leave expires (and provided that there has been no decision on that application before the leave expires). In that event there is, by subs.(2) , a statutory extension of the original leave until (a) the application is decided or withdrawn, or (b), if the application has been decided and there is a right of appeal against that decision, the time for appealing has expired, or (c), if an appeal has been brought, that appeal is pending: I paraphrase the statutory language, but that seems to me to be the effect of it. During the period of the statutory extension of the original leave, by subs.(4) no further application for variation of that leave can be made. Thus, there can be only one application for variation of the original leave, and there can be only one decision (and, where applicable, one appeal). The possibility of a series of further applications leading to an indefinite extension of the original leave is excluded. However, by subs.(5) it is possible to vary the one permitted application. If it is varied, any decision (and any further appeal) will relate to the application as varied. But once a decision has been made, no variation to the application is possible since there is nothing left to vary.” </span>

Administrative review is defined in AR2.1 as “the review” of an eligible decision (here a decision refusing leave to remain as a Tier 2 (General) Migrant). The purpose is to decide whether “the decision is wrong due to a caseworking error”. It is clear that the process envisages a difference between “the decision” which is the refusal of the  application and the “administrative review” </p>

Section 3C(2)(d) also expressly provides for leave to continue when “an administrative review of the decision on the application” could be sought or is pending.   In other words, the provisions of section 3C themselves draw a distinction between a decision on the application and an administrative review of that decision.  </p>

The decision in Sukhwinder Singh was concerned with identifying when the time limit began to run and to reconcile that with the requirement that alternative remedies should generally be used before resorting to judicial review.  Its reference to the review decision as the final decision is to be understood in that context. The review decision was the final decision for those purposes as “that is the decision from the date of which the passage of time for judicial review is to be measured”.

Mr Biggs submitted that the situation was analogous to that in R (Pathan) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2020] UKSC 41. There, at least four members of the Supreme Court held that procedural fairness required the respondent to notify the applicant of a fact which was fatal to the application and which was known to the respondent but not the applicant. If the appellant had been informed of the request in this case, he might have supplied the relevant information, or taken steps to encourage the sponsor to do so, or taken steps to find other employment or make an application for leave to remain on a different basis. Further, the respondent here was treating the failure by the sponsor to provide information as a basis for inferring that the accounts manager post was not a genuine vacancy. Procedural fairness required that an individual adversely affected by adverse inferences of that nature be given the opportunity to respond before a decision was taken based on those inferences. In that regard, Mr Biggs relied upon In re HK (An Infant)  [1966] 2 Q.B. 617,  Gaima v Secretary of State for the Home Department [1989] Imm A.R. 527 and R v London Borough of Hackney ex p.

In the context of a points based system intended to ensure the efficient processing of a high volume of applications for leave to remain, there was nothing unfair in placing the obligation on an applicant to demonstrate that he or she satisfied the requirements for the grant of leave to remain. In that context, the respondent had requested the sponsor, in accordance with the rules, to provide specific information and said that failure to do so might result in the application being refused. Procedural fairness did not impose any obligation on the respondent to notify the appellant of the request to the sponsor for information. The situation in Pathan was different and involved a specific act by the respondent, the revocation of the sponsor’s sponsorship licence, which meant that the application for leave would inevitably fail. Here the situation involved a failure by a sponsor to provide the information requested and which led to the refusal of the application. </p>

The additional evidence related to the sponsor’s bank accounts, staff list, company accounts, tax details and the like. Those were matters that the sponsor was in a position to provide not the appellant and there was nothing unfair in asking the sponsor to provide the information.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">The appellant suggests that if he had known that a request for information had been made, he could have chased the sponsor to provide the information and evidence. But the system operates on the basis that the applicant will obtain a certificate of sponsorship from a sponsor for a genuine job vacancy and the respondent can request further information from either the applicant for leave or the sponsor to assess that. Procedural fairness in this context does not require the respondent to give the appellant the opportunity to chase the sponsor for information. If the employer intends to employ the appellant, and has provided a certificate of sponsorship, it is incumbent on the employer to provide any additional information sought by the respondent. Furthermore, requiring the respondent to notify the appellant so that the appellant can chase the sponsor would not be consistent with the operation of the points based system in general, or the rules in respect of applications for leave as a Tier 2 (General) Migrant in particular. Procedural fairness does not require the respondent “to have to distort the ordinary operation of the [points based system] to protect an applicant” (adapting the words of Sales L.J. at paragraph 35 of his judgment in EK (Ivor Coasty) against the possibility that a sponsor may not respond to requests for information. Nor is the purpose of a request for information to give the appellant time to find an alternative employer, or a different basis for seeking leave, in the event that the employer cannot, or fails for whatever reason to, provide the information requested. It is to enable the respondent, as paragraph 77J of the Immigration Rules provides, to assess whether the requirements for grant of leave as a Tier 2 (General) Migrant have been satisfied. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">The situation here is different from the situation in Pathan. There the applicant was a person who was already employed by the sponsor and applied to renew his leave to remain on the basis of an apparently valid certificate of sponsorship. The respondent revoked the sponsor’s licence and, as a consequence, the certificate was no longer valid and the application for leave was bound to fail. The applicant knew nothing about the revocation of the sponsor’s licence. Three months passed before a decision was taken to refuse the application for leave. It was in that context that Lord Kerr and Lady Black considered, at paragraph 104 of their judgment, that “the rules of natural justice may require a party to be afforded time to amend his case in a way that cures an otherwise fatal defect of which he had, without fault on his part, previously been unaware”. Lord Kerr and Lady Black considered the various ways in which Mr Pathan could have benefitted if he had been notified of the revocation of his sponsor’s licence as soon as it had occurred.

Rather, as the judgments of the majority of the Supreme Court recognise, the requirements of procedural fairness are flexible and are not set in stone. They are necessarily influenced by the context and the facts. See paragraph 55 of the judgment of Lady Arden and paragraph 104 of the joint judgment of Lord Kerr and Lady Black. Lord Wilson also recognises that the requirements of procedural fairness will vary and the court will imply into a prescribed procedure so much but no more than is required: see paragraph 203 of his judgment. In those circumstances, I do not consider that the majority decision of the Supreme Court requires the imposition of a duty to notify an appellant of a request for additional information and evidence sent to a sponsor of an applicant for leave as a Tier 2 (General) Migrant. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Nor is this a case where the respondent was making adverse findings against an individual and where fairness requires that the individual concerned be told of the possibility of adverse findings and be given the opportunity to respond  to the matters giving rise to the adverse findings. This was a case where the Immigration Rules provided that the information could be required to enable the respondent to assess whether a job vacancy was a genuine vacancy. In the absence of that information, she could not make the assessment and could not be satisfied that the vacancy was a genuine one. The case is unlike In re HK where the immigration officer considered that an immigrant was over 16 years old and so did not qualify for admission to the United Kingdom as the child under 16 of a person ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom. Procedural fairness required the immigration officer to inform the individual of his suspicions and give him an opportunity to address those matters. Similarly, in Gaima, the respondent considered that a claimant for asylum was not credible because of certain things she was alleged to have done. Those matters were never put to the claimant and the Court of Appeal held that procedural fairness did require that matters relied upon as undermining her credibility should be put to her and she should be given the opportunity to comment. In Decordova, a local housing authority was minded to disbelieve a person’s account as to why she did not accept an offer of accommodation, namely that she did not want to live in the area as her stepfather who had abused her lived nearby. Procedural fairness required that where a housing authority was minded to disbelieve the account of an individual on a matter that was critical to the issue of whether she should be offered accommodation in a particular area, they were bound to put that matter to the individual and give her the opportunity to comment.  </p>

The respondent could not therefore be satisfied that the sponsor did require an accounts manager paid £21,000 a year. There was nothing unfair in that process. This was not a case where the respondent was making adverse findings, still less adverse findings on matters within the knowledge of the appellant.  It was for the sponsor to provide the information to enable an assessment of whether the vacancy was genuine. It did not provide the information. In those circumstances, there was no allegation or issue that need in fairness to be put to the appellant for comment before the application for leave was refused. </p>
