That claim was dismissed by Joanna Smith QC, sitting as Deputy Judge of the High Court, in a decision dated 20 May 2019.  She also dismissed a range of other arguments in support of the declaration, based on estoppel, trustee indemnities and claims for knowing receipt; claims for dishonest assistance were abandoned before trial.  There is no appeal from those conclusions.  The only aspect of the decision that is subject to this appeal, for which permission was given by Lewison LJ on 1 July 2019, concerns the construction of Clause 14. </p>

By construing the words of the clause literally and viewing them in isolation from the Constitution and the timeshare structure, the Judge reached a conclusion that means that the Members can choose whether or not to pay any outgoings in respect of the apartments when those outgoings are incurred by BBCB as the apartments’ legal owner.  Meantime, BBCB, as a company without other assets and with no power to trade, has no means of paying.  That produces a commercially absurd outcome that renders the timeshare scheme unworkable. </p>

Clause 14 is not ambiguous (and clauses 7 and 8 show that the drafter knew what an indemnity is).  It is a standard professionally-drafted indemnity clause, providing the Trustee with an indemnity.  It does not extend to liabilities that have not been incurred by the Trustee or grant an indemnity to anyone else.  In the face of such clear and unambiguous language, there is no scope for departing from the words of the clause unless the construction gives rise to commercial absurdity, which is not found here.   </p>

It points out that for most of the lifespan of the Resort, the Members have acted as if they might be responsible for the Spanish Taxes, to the extent that they saved for them and persistently appealed against them.  Meantime, they have paid whatever they have needed to pay by way of utility bills and local rates in order to ensure that their benefits continue uninterrupted.  However, we are not concerned on this appeal with whether the Respondents’ actions might be regarded as opportunistic, but rather with their legal obligations under the agreement setting up the timeshare scheme.  Having considered that question, I am in no doubt that the appeal must be dismissed.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In the first place, one looks at the wording of Clause 14 itself.  It obliges the Founder Member and the Club to provide protection for the Trustee by way of (a) an indemnity against all liabilities resulting from the performance of its duties, and (b) an indemnity against all liabilities incurred in connection with the Trust Property or in any other connection with the office of Trustee.  The Appellants rely upon limb (b).  But in my view, the clause is clear both in its wording and, critically, in its intent.  It is an indemnity given <span style="font-style:italic">to the Trustee</span> in respect of liabilities arising <span style="font-style:italic">in connection with the Trust Property</span> or <span style="font-style:italic">the holding by the Trustee of the office</span>.  It is no more or less than a conventional indemnity clause for the protection of the Trustee.  It has nothing to do with BBCB, or BBCB’s liability for the Spanish Taxes, and it cannot sensibly be construed to extend to them.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The same conclusion is reached by considering the clause in the context of the timeshare documents to which I have referred.  It sits in the middle of a series of provisions concerning the powers and protections of the Trustee.  None of these provisions stretches beyond that.  In my view the other contractual provisions to which we were referred shed no more light on the matter.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Then there is the factual and commercial context.  For the scheme to be a commercial proposition, timeshare purchasers have to know their potential liabilities.  Here, there is no indication that the parties to the Constitution or the Trust Deed intended the Members to be liable by way of an open-ended indemnity for general taxation in unspecified amounts.  Had this been their intention, they would surely have said so; indeed it would have been positively necessary as otherwise the parties would not know (a) how the Members’ liability would be triggered, (b) what exactly the Members would then have to do, and (c) how the Trustee was then to act.  These are matters of importance and the silence about them in documentation that in other respects descends to minute detail is in my view telling.  To take an example, Ms Talbot Rice was forced to submit that as soon as the Members were informed of a demand from the Spanish tax authority, they would immediately be obliged to put the Trustee in funds for the full amount: but that is an onerous obligation and there is nothing that explains how such a mechanism would work in practice.  The conclusion is that the Appellants, who have put their case for a declaration in many different ways without arguing for an implied term or for rectification, are in reality arguing for an entirely new provision providing a free-standing indemnity to the Owning Company.  Their continually shifting position in framing their case is symptomatic of this core conceptual difficulty.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Nor is there any force in the argument that the timeshare structure is unworkable without giving the indemnity provisions an extended meaning.  An arrangement by which the Members can pay what they want when they want by way of taxes and expenses may not be a tidy one, but the Resort has seemingly continued to operate.  The alternative proposed by the Appellants is, as the Judge said, far from obvious.  It deprives the Members of the choice of paying or not paying taxes levied on the Owning Company as they fall due.  Of course, if they decide not to pay taxes, they may have to take any consequences.  But that does not amount to commercial absurdity and there is nothing integral to the scheme as a whole that requires the Trustee to act as an enforcer for taxes levied on a third party that the Members do not wish to pay.  Furthermore, had the Committee considered the arrangements unworkable, it had the power under clause 19 of the Trust Deed to propose modifications.   </p>

Her legal analysis might in some respects have been differently expressed.  The statement, recorded at paragraph 28(5) above, that the court should only depart from plain words where the parties obviously did not mean them, does not fully accord with the approach identified at paragraph 33 above, but does not amount to a material misdirection.  The isolated sentence at paragraph 25(6) (<span style="font-style:italic">“… the timeshare trust structure envisaged that the Club members would, collectively, pay for all outgoings…”</span>) makes most sense when read in context as referring to outgoings other than the Spanish Taxes and as such does not undermine the Judge’s overall reasoning.  Lastly, the passage quoted at paragraph 28(9) (<span style="font-style:italic">“I am not dealing here with two rival, but equally likely, contentions as to the true meaning of the words…”</span>) sets the bar too high, when all that is needed to justify a choice between alternative meanings is that they should be possible meanings, not that they should be equally likely.  But this is a small slip in a long and impressive judgment and it did not lead the Judge into error.  She ultimately, and in my view correctly, placed weight on the words and function of Clause 14, but not before she had also considered the wider context.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In this case, the language of clause 14 itself points quite clearly to an objective meaning which limits the obligation of the Founder Member to indemnify FNTC against all costs, liabilities, expenses, losses and demands which <span style="text-decoration:underline">it</span> incurs.  That is implicit in the use of the terms “indemnify” and “indemnified”.  Further, the fact that the indemnification is expressed to be in respect of costs, liabilities and expenses “which may result from the performance by the Trustee of their duties . . .”  and to be against all losses, claims, demands, expenses and other liabilities “made or incurred in connection with the Trust Property or in any other way in connection with the holding by the Trustee of the office of custodian trustee hereunder” supports this conclusion. </p>

I can see no relevant distinction for this purpose, between the use of the phrase “incurred by the Trustee” in clause 7(c) and “incurred in connection with the Trust Property or in any other way in connection with the holding by the Trustee of the office of custodian trustee . . .” in clause 14.

She says that “kept fully indemnified” in clause 14 should be read as “put in funds”.  It seems to me that that phrase has a completely different meaning from the words used in clause 14 read as a whole and in context, and it is not necessary to adopt it in order to avoid commercial absurdity (to which I shall turn below).  In practical terms, it also fails to meet the situation in relation to the payment of Spanish Taxes levied upon BBCB which Ms Talbot Rice says reveals the absurdity in the first place.  Even if the objective meaning of the language in clause 14 were that FNTC must be “put in funds” in relation to liabilities, the liabilities in question are expressed to be those of FNTC itself.   </p>

Although as Ms Talbot Rice points out, it is possible that commercial absurdity may require the court to depart even from the apparently unambiguous natural meaning of a provision (see <span style="font-style:italic">LB Re Financing No 3 Ltd v Excalibur Funding No 1 Plc </span>at [46] per Briggs J as he then was) this is not such a case<span style="color:#008000">.</span>  There is nothing which has clearly gone wrong with the wording and there is nothing commercially absurd about clause 14 in the context of the structure of the time share scheme as a whole.  </p>
