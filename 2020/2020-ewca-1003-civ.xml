Two of the appeals are brought by the children’s mother and by their maternal grandparents against interim care orders made in respect of the children.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The background can be summarised briefly in these terms. The children’s parents married in 2013 and separated four years later. The mother alleges that during the relationship she was subjected to domestic abuse by the father, who also misused drugs. Initially after the separation, the children remained with the mother but in early 2018 she took them to the father’s home where they lived for until January 2019. The social work statement filed at the start of these proceedings alleges that during the parents’ relationship and in the immediate aftermath, the children endured a very unsettled and at times chaotic lifestyle while in the care of one or both of their parents. It was said that, during that period, they had witnessed parental conflict and physical abuse. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In January 2019, the father took the children to the maternal grandparents’ home and left them there, indicating that he did not wish to resume care in the future. It was at this stage that this local authority first became involved with the family. For the subsequent 18 months, the children have lived with their grandparents and maternal aunt who all occupy the same home. It is accepted that the children have a bond with their grandparents and with their aunt. No criticism is made of the quality of physical care they have received within the maternal extended family. Compared to their previous experiences with their parents, the children seem to have benefited from a much more settled life. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Nevertheless, the local authority remained involved with the family. In April 2019, the children were registered as being in need.  In early 2020, the grandparents expressed some anxiety about the cost of caring for the children. Around the same time, the mother indicated that she wished to resume caring for them. The local authority was concerned about the risks to the children if they were returned to their mother’s care and about the history of difficult and at times abusive relationships within the family. The mother subsequently withdrew her proposal to resume care and, on 6 March 2020, signed a written agreement to the children being accommodated under s.20 of the Children Act 1989. The grandparents also signed the agreement. It was subsequently alleged by the local authority that the grandparents broke the agreement a few days later by allowing the mother to take one of the children to medical appointments. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">As the children were now being “looked after” by the local authority, they underwent medical examinations which, in A’s case, revealed that she was developmentally delayed in communication, language and social skills. No concerns about the boys’ development were identified in the medical examinations, although information from their schools included a suggestion that both boys may be on the autistic spectrum. The local authority was also required to identify a carer for the children and therefore carried out a kinship assessment of the maternal aunt under regulation 24 of the Care Planning, Placement and Case Review (England) Regulations 2010. The report recommended that the children be placed in the aunt’s care. The author of the report noted that the children had built positive relationships with their maternal family since being left in their care fourteen months earlier; that the aunt and grandparents had been active in meeting the children’s basic needs; that the children had experienced what the reporter described as “a settled and predictable environment free from harm”; and that the children recognised their maternal family as their primary caregivers and were able to seek them out when they needed comforting, to be fed or wanted to play. The reporter concluded that it was a positive factor that the children had been able to remain within their birth family where their need for a sense of belonging and identity could be met.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">That assessment reached a positive conclusion, but the aunt then indicated that she was unable to commit to acting as a carer in the long term. The local authority then carried out a regulation 24 assessment of the maternal grandparents. The author of the report described the grandparents as experienced parents who had the best intentions for the three children to thrive. They had every intention of ensuring that their physical and emotional needs were met, although their insight into those needs was said to be limited. But the reporter described them as committed and cooperative. She thought there was no doubt they would be able to take advice and develop greater understanding about the children’s particular needs. The assessment referred to a number of incidents in the family history. In addition to the history of domestic abuse in the children’s parents’ relationship, it was recorded that the grandfather had a conviction for an offence involving serious violence against an adult ten years ago. There was also a reference to a recent report of a domestic abuse incident in the family in April 2020 when the grandfather was alleged to have hit the grandmother with a broom on the foot and threatened the aunt. The reporter observed that the impact on the children of that incident and wider conflict within the family needed to be explored. Despite those matters, the assessment reached a positive conclusion. The reporter had no concerns that the grandparents would prioritise the children’s safety and well-being and protect them from the risk of harm, although they were not always clear on the nature of the risk. The grandparents presented as committed and motivated to care for the children throughout their minority and had indicated that they wish to apply for a special guardianship order. The report recommended that the areas of concern identified in the report should be addressed through a special guardianship assessment. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Meanwhile, the local authority had decided to issue care proceedings. The preliminary social work report, whilst identifying a number of concerns about the current placement, recommended on balance that the children should remain in the grandparents’ care during the proceedings. The report recorded that “the local authority is mindful that [the children] have not experienced other care arrangements away from the biological family, as such it is recognised that being placed in foster care may be a new and challenging experience for them particularly for A who shares a close bond with her maternal grandmother. It would be beneficial for the children’s emotional well-</p>

A number of the allegations made by the father, including particularly the allegation of involvement in terrorism, are denied by the grandparents. On the basis of these allegations, and following further conversations with the grandparents, the local authority carried out a supplemental regulation 24 assessment which concluded that that it was no longer safe for the children to remain in their care.  </p>

The recorder concluded that the court did not have sufficient time to deal with the application for removal at that hearing, which had been listed for only one hour. Furthermore, the grandparents were not at that stage parties to the proceedings. The recorder therefore adjourned the application for removal to a further hearing on 25 June. As the local authority was no longer willing to support the placement of the children with the grandparents under the interim care order, the recorder discharged that order and made an interim child arrangements order for the children to live with the grandparents, coupled with an interim supervision order to continue until the next hearing. The grandparents were joined as parties to the proceedings and appropriate case management directions given. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In the first judgment, the recorder noted that s.13(6) of the Children and Families Act 2014 provides that the court may only give permission for the filing of expert evidence in children proceedings if it is of the opinion that the expert evidence is necessary to assist the court to resolve the proceedings justly, and that s.13(7) sets out the factors to which the court is to have regard when considering such an application. He agreed with a submission made on behalf the mother that the vast majority of the issues identified in the application were “within the purview of social worker statements”. He accepted that cognitive or psychological issues or needs would not be so covered but observed that there was no suggestion of psychological or cognitive assessments being required and concluded that there was no evidential basis for such instruction in this case. The transcript of the hearing shows that counsel for the guardian then pointed out that the boys’ school had suggested that T and J may be on the autistic spectrum, and that the medical examination carried out a few weeks earlier suggested that A may be suffering from developmental delay. She asked for permission to appeal against the decision. At that point, the recorder acknowledged the concerns about the children’s development but noted that there had not been any referral to CAMHS. He suggested that if a “more specific, better targeted” application was filed proposing an “expert with relevant expertise”, the court might be in a better position to determine it. Counsel renewed her application for permission to appeal which the recorder then refused. </p>

He noted a number of concerns about the grandparents and the maternal family generally, referring to the grandfather’s criminal conviction, the local authority’s assertion that he was still minimising that offence and various other incidents from the family history in which there had been conflict between family members, including between grandparents and the maternal aunt, grandparents and the mother, and between the grandparents themselves.

Drawing all of the threads together now, I am of the view that in the care of the grandparents, there is a risk of emotional and/or psychological harm from: the children seeing their grandparents as short-term carers (leading to feelings of instability); the lack of boundaries and inappropriate threatened consequences for misbehaviour adding to this; witnessing a domestic incident between the grandparents and within their household; and witnessing the conflict between the grandparents and other family members – set against a background of serious incidents arising from conflict within the family.

It is a balancing exercise.  With the maternal grandparents, the greater harm seems to arise from incidents involving conflict within the household or within the family.  It has rightly been noted on behalf of the Guardian that public law proceedings are stressful proceedings.  They are proceedings in which allegations are made and have already been made between members of this family.  They are proceedings in which emotions run high.  There is perhaps a greater risk of conflict within the family, as a result, than there was before proceedings started. </p>

The only person to have reported matters to the authorities from within the grandparents’ household is not there now.  When I consider the inevitability of deep, emotional distress and another disruption from uprooting these children again from their primary carer, do I consider that the children’s safety or psychological or emotional welfare demands separation from their grandparents and that such a separation until the final hearing, with the harm it will cause, is a proportionate response to the risks if I leave the children in their grandparents’ care?

Three particular lacunae were identified. First, and most importantly, it was submitted that the assertion made by counsel during the hearing about the aunt’s absence from the home was unsupported by any evidence. It subsequently transpired that the assertion was inaccurate. The appellants submitted that the local authority’s assertion that the aunt was no longer available to act as a protective factor shielding the children from the impact of any family conflict was an important factor in the recorder’s decision. Secondly, it was submitted that there was insufficient evidence of the grandparents’ alleged breaches of the written agreement. It was contended that there was even less justification for this omission since the alleged breaches had occurred as long ago as March. Finally, it was pointed out that no written care plan was put before the recorder. As a result, details of the proposed interim foster placement were not available until a late stage in the hearing. Given that the proposed placement was with a carer from a different cultural background who did not speak the children’s first language, it was submitted that the absence of a care plan was another important material omission. Furthermore, there was no written care plan for contact between the children and the family members following removal. Overall, it was submitted that the omissions in the evidence, and in particular the lack of any evidence to support what turned out to be an inaccurate assertion concerning the maternal aunt, infected the recorder’s analysis and led him to the wrong conclusion. </p>

The appellants accepted that the recorder referred to the positive relationship between the children and the grandparents and acknowledged that severing the bond would result in emotional harm to the children. On behalf of the mother, however, Mr Barnes submitted that the recorder did not analyse the relationships, or the consequences of severing them, in any detail. In the circumstances, he failed to appreciate, or give any or sufficient weight to, the gravity of the emotional harm which the children would undoubtedly suffer were they to be removed. In fact, the recorder took the view that the degree of emotional harm which the children would suffer may be slightly less because they may be anticipating the removal. Mr Barnes submitted that this observation by the recorder was unsupported by any evidence and was a clear indication that he underestimated the degree of emotional harm the children would be likely to suffer. </p>

There was little evidence that the conflict had impinged upon the children’s welfare. There was only one incident – the alleged incident involving a broom in April 2020 - which was said to have occurred in the children’s presence. The circumstances of the incident are disputed and the local authority’s allegations are denied by the grandparents. In any event, as Mr Singh pointed out on behalf the grandparents, the incident was mentioned in the initial regulation 24 assessment of the grandparents and thus was a matter of which the local authority was aware when it invited the court to approve the placement with the grandparents under the initial care order. </p>

The recorder’s decision that the report was not necessary had been based in part on his erroneous belief that there was no evidence that the children had any psychological problems.

On behalf of the mother, Mr Barnes relied on the principle that an appellant seeking to challenge a case management decision faces a high hurdle and that the recorder had been entitled to conclude that there was no necessity for the specific psychological assessment sought in the local authority’s application. Mr Barnes drew attention to the observation of the court following a further exchange with counsel who had pointed out the evidence of psychological problems of the children. The recorder had observed that a more focused application concentrating on those problems might have a better chance of success. Mr Barnes therefore submitted that the recorder was right to base his decision on the specific application placed before him and that in those circumstances the appeal should be dismissed. </p>

At this remote hearing, the recorder was faced with a series of case management decisions and a contested application for an order which, if granted, would have removed three small children from the family for the first time. During the pandemic there has often been no alternative to conducting truly urgent hearings in this way, but the experience of the past four months has demonstrated that particular care must be exercised when making such important decisions under what are inevitably sub-optimal conditions. </p>

I accept Mr Barnes’ submission that the recorder did not give sufficient consideration to the emotional harm the children would unquestionably experience as a result of separation, and did not take into account, or give sufficient weight to, the gravity of that harm. The children have been placed with the grandparents for nearly eighteen months. They are settled there. They have a close relationship with the grandparents. As the recorder acknowledged, for the youngest child A, the grandparents’ home has been her home for over half her life. Plainly she will have no memory of any other home.

There is no suggestion that the children have been exposed to the risk of physical harm directly or indirectly. The evidence that the children had been caught up in the family conflict is, at this stage, slim. The deficiencies in the grandparents’ insight and understanding, cited by the guardian’s counsel as a factor justifying the removal of the children, are manifestly not reasons for moving them at this stage. I am also troubled by the suggestion made on behalf of the local authority that, having been given unsubstantiated information that the aunt had left the home, it was for the grandparents to rebut the consequential concerns, particularly when the information was given for the first time during a remote hearing when interpreters were being used. The removal of young children from their home represents a serious intrusion and interference with family life. The burden of proof remains on the local authority at all times. Those professionals representing the local authority and children are under a duty to ensure that recommendations are soundly based. That responsibility is, if anything, even more acute in the inevitably imperfect circumstances of remote hearings.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I turn finally to the guardian’s appeal against the refusal to authorise instruction of the psychologist. On this issue, the recorder again correctly identified the legal principles to be applied when deciding whether to authorise instruction of experts in family proceedings. The widely-perceived excessive and unnecessary use of experts in such proceedings has led to the requirement of necessity being placed on a statutory footing, and all family judges must comply with this rule. On this occasion, however, it seems to me clear that a psychological assessment is necessary to resolve issues in the proceedings. There is some evidence that each of the children has some sort of psychological problem. Furthermore, the principal issue in the case seems to be the impact of family conflict and dysfunctionality on the children’s welfare. In my judgment, a psychological assessment would plainly assist the court in evaluating this issue. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I am puzzled why the recorder did not initially appreciate that the children’s various psychological problems represented an issue on which psychological assessment would assist. It may be that this point was missed in the course of the remote hearing. It seems clear that the recorder took the view that the specific questions proposed for the expert as set out in the local authority’s application were not relevant to the issues in the case. For that reason, he proposed that, if the guardian persisted in wishing to instruct an expert, she should submit a more focused application. Although that approach may conform strictly with the rules, it runs the risk of causing additional delay. A better course in the quasi-inquisitorial context of care proceedings will often be to discuss the issue with the parties in court, identify the broad parameters of an expert assessment which is necessary to assist the court to resolve the proceedings, and then ask the parties’ representatives to agree the details of the instruction and submit a draft to the court. I recognise, of course, that judges sitting at first instance often do not have the time to engage in such discussions with the parties, particularly in the current circumstances and at remote hearings, and therefore do not have the opportunity for reflection and consideration that this Court usually enjoys. Furthermore, of course, the recorder on this occasion was not only required to make detailed case management directions in these complex proceedings but was also facing a difficult decision on a contested application for an interim care order. </p>
