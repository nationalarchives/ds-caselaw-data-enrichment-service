These applications were supported by witness statements of Mr Grattan and Mr Hussey, the latter running to 42 pages with over 3,000 pages of exhibits. These statements detailed what were described as “serious questions that need to be answered” about the management of the Companies’ investments, the transactions undertaken in 2011 and the conduct of the liquidations.</p>

Notwithstanding the requirement to give notice of the applications to the former liquidators under the <span style="font-style:italic">Practice Note: Claims for an Order Restoring the Name of a Company to the Register (Companies Court</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">Practice Note 1 of 2012)</span> [2012] BCC 880, no notice was given to them. This was deliberate, as counsel appearing for Mr Grattan explained to Fancourt J. The reason given was that the purpose of the restoration and appointment of new liquidators was, in part, to investigate the conduct of the former liquidators. Counsel drew the judge’s attention to the relevant paragraph of the Practice Note. Inadvertently, the judge was wrongly told that the registrar of companies had consented to the absence of notice to the former liquidators. Counsel explained to the judge why, having regard to the matters alleged in the witness statements, the former liquidators were not proposed for appointment as liquidators. Fancourt J made a composite order for the restoration of the Companies to the register and for the appointment of the present liquidators (the restoration order). The order was received by the registrar of companies on 25 July 2018, whereupon the restorations became effective.</p>

The liquidators appointed on that application were invested with the wide powers conferred by the 1986 Act, which they were seeking to use to pursue investigations again without the consent or involvement of the members, who owned the companies and for whose benefit the present liquidators were purporting to act. Moreover, the present liquidators resisted the proposal that the members should decide who the liquidator should be and had rejected the compromise suggestion of meetings of members of the companies. The present liquidators’ approach was summarised by Mr Pagden in a witness statement: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In rejecting the set-aside application in its entirety, the Judge began by considering the approach that the court should take when there is evidence before the court that could justify an investigation of (in this case) the former liquidators’ conduct. Relying on <span style="font-style:italic">Clydesdale Financial Services v Smailes </span>[2009] EWHC 1745 (Ch), (2009) BCC 810, where the court removed administrators without any personal imputation against them personally, in circumstances where they could not be expected to investigate allegations against themselves, he said that the scope of the court’s enquiry must necessarily be limited to deciding whether issues worthy of investigation have been raised. While that approach did not necessarily dictate the outcome of the applications, he said at [78]: “I consider that the approach does shape how I should make my assessment as to (i) whether there is sufficient material to justify the investigations that the liquidators now seek to pursue; and (ii) the whole process which was started when Mr Hussey and Mr Grattan made the application for the restoration of the companies and the appointment of new liquidators”. The right test was whether the material now relied on by the present liquidators raised serious issues to be investigated. The applicants did not seek to argue that the evidence failed to raise issues worthy of investigation. This, as the Judge commented, was a realistic and correct position to adopt, both in light of the state of the evidence and because the application was not a suitable forum for resolving such disputes once there is a credible evidence as to the existence of such issues.</p>

He instanced derivative actions and the statutory power of the court to remove liquidators appointed by the members, on which the wishes of the majority are a factor to which the court will have regard, but which are not determinative. Thus, the Judge held, while the court will respect principles of corporate autonomy in relation to majority decision making, those principles have to accommodate wider concerns such as minority protection or holding a liquidator to account. Those principles did not provide an overarching objection to the procedure adopted in this case, contrary to the submissions of counsel for the applicants.</p>

He also accepted, relying on the decision of this court in <span style="font-style:italic">Welsh Ministers v Price </span>[2017] EWCA Civ 1768, [2018] 1 WLR 738, that applications to restore companies to the register are effectively <span style="font-style:italic">ex parte</span> so that there is a duty of full and frank disclosure on the applicant in respect of all material facts. He considered that there had been no non-disclosure of material facts. Fancourt J had been informed (i) of the requirement under the Practice Note as to service on former liquidators, (ii) that the former liquidators in this case had not been served, and (iii) that the proposed liquidators were different from the former liquidators. The Judge also accepted that the evidence explained, as required by the Practice Note, why different liquidators were being proposed. The misstatement as to the registrar’s consent to non-service on the former liquidators was not material because Fancourt J was made fully aware that they had not been served.

The position was, if anything, stronger in the present case where proceedings are not proposed, but merely under consideration. If the former liquidators had attended, the Judge did not think that Fancourt J would have been persuaded to make any different order, particularly as it was clearly impossible for them to investigate the allegations against themselves.</p>

It was therefore entirely just that they should be restored to the register. I consider that there was no failure of frank and full disclosure upon the making of the applications that were considered by Fancourt J in July of last year; the misstatement as to what had been mentioned to the registrar was immaterial, and Fancourt J himself was clearly satisfied that it would be a satisfactory way forward for the former liquidators to be served with his order within 21 days from the hearing before him. The appointment of new liquidators was inevitable. The former liquidators could not sensibly be reappointed when the pressing task to be undertaken would include investigating their own previous conduct. The investigations needed to be undertaken properly, and by someone whose independence is not in doubt. This was achieved by Fancourt J’s order. No good cause to remove the liquidators has been demonstrated. It would not be appropriate to order a meeting of the companies at this stage. Such meeting would not have the benefit of the proposed investigations, and there is, because of the voting power available to those whose interests are aligned against investigation, a real danger that proper investigation would be defeated.” </p>

They do not, however, become the beneficial owners of the assets vested in the company. In all types of liquidation, the beneficial interest in the assets is suspended and they are held on a statutory trust to be dealt with in accordance with the statutory scheme: see <span style="font-style:italic">Ayerst (Inspector of Taxes) v C&amp;K Construction Ltd </span>[1976] AC 167.

It was said by the applicants that Mr Grattan and Mr Hussey were joined only for the purpose of obtaining costs orders against them. However, the restoration order, which the applicants were seeking to have set aside, was obtained on applications made by Mr Grattan. He, not the present liquidators, was the proper respondent as regards that relief. The same is true of the application for an order for meetings. These were essentially matters between the members of the Companies, although as allegations were made against the former liquidators and as (for reasons which I shall give later) they had standing on the setaside application, they could legitimately address those allegations. </p>

If the application to remove the present liquidators had been made on grounds that reflected on them personally, for example their competence or integrity or that their conduct required investigation, they could be heard in opposition to that relief but that formed no part of the application, which instead was based on the proposition that they should not have been appointed without the support of the members of each Company as a body. </p>

Section 1029(2) sets out eleven categories of person who may apply for a restoration order, including a former member of the company (“former” because the company has been dissolved). In addition, it permits the application to be made by “any other person appearing to the court to have an interest in the matter” (emphasis added). A former member is, by virtue of that status alone, considered to be a person with a sufficient interest in the restoration of the company to be designated as a person who may make the application. If a restoration order is made, it will directly affect all the members. The company of which they were members will be revived and, if they were members at the date of dissolution, their status as such will also be revived. They will become again the owners of an asset, their shares in the company. Although there is no requirement for former members to be given notice of a restoration application, it is frankly impossible to see why members should not have standing to be heard on it. They may indeed have many legitimate reasons to support or to oppose restoration. For the same reasons, it is clear that they are “directly affected” by a restoration order for the purposes of CPR 40.9 and so have standing to apply to the court to vary or set aside a restoration order.</p>

Equally, they also have sufficient interest to oppose an appointment or to set aside an order making an appointment under CPR 40.9.

This pre-supposes, without expressly providing, that the application must be served on the former liquidators.

The judgment of Sir Terence Etherton MR, with which Longmore and Coulson LJJ agreed, is framed exclusively in terms of an application by a third party. As the Master of the Rolls said at [60]: “There may be many third parties who perceive that their interests may be indirectly affected by restoration and who may wish to advance all manner of reasons for seeking to prevent or reverse an order for restoration rather than wait to face and, where appropriate, resist actions of the company against them”. Relying on this court’s decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Stanhope Pension Trust Ltd v Registrar of Companies</span>, he said at [61] that “it is well established that the court will not allow the intervention in proceedings for restoration by a third party who merely wishes to argue that the proceedings which the revived company proposes to bring against the third party have no prospect of success”. </p>

Their submissions could not and did not therefore involve any reliance on a suggestion that there was nothing to investigate. As a member and a former liquidator respectively, they had standing to raise other matters that were relevant to the restoration order.

I would not wish to be taken as agreeing that they had no right to do so. The case made by Mr Grattan was that there were matters worthy of investigation. He had to persuade the court of that, as the Judge acknowledged at [79]. If Mr Fakhry and Mr Fry had been served or given notice of the application, it is not clear to me why they should not have been heard in opposition to that necessary part of Mr Grattan’s case. As a member, Mr Fakhry had a legitimate interest in opposing the restoration of the Companies if the purpose was to pursue investigations into concerns which he could demonstrate, within the confines of this type of application, were groundless. He would clearly be entitled to do so if the concerns did not relate to him, and it is not clear why he should be denied that opportunity where the concerns did relate to him. The position is critically different from <span style="font-style:italic">Welsh Ministers v Price </span>where the objectors were truly third parties, with no connection with the company except that proceedings were being brought against them.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Different considerations apply to Mr Fry as the former liquidator. In the usual course of events, the expectation would be that the former liquidator would be re-appointed on restoration of the company. This is demonstrated by paragraph (6) of the Practice Note which requires evidence to explain the reasons if a different liquidator is proposed. If the application is served on the former liquidator, he or she is entitled to appear on the application and to assist the court with evidence and submissions relevant to the application. In my view, those matters include the reasons put forward for not re-appointing the former liquidator, including whether there are grounds for investigating his or her conduct. This was the view taken, correctly in my judgment, by Norris J in <span style="font-style:italic">Barclays Bank plc v Registrar of Companies </span>[2015] EWHC 2806 (Ch), [2016] BCC 64 at [19] – [20].<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>Although the present type of application is technically not an application to remove the former liquidator, it has that practical effect in a case where the former liquidator is willing to act. If it were an application for removal, the liquidator would be entitled to be heard as to whether there were grounds for an independent investigation (see <span style="font-style:italic">Clydesdale Financial Services Ltd v Smailes </span>on which the Judge relied) and I see no reason why the same should not apply on this type of application. It follows that these are matters that the former liquidator could also raise on an application to set aside or vary the order.  </p>

However, it is important not to overstate it. Three points are relevant in this respect. First, while members may by a simple majority remove a director or, in a members’ voluntary liquidation, the liquidator, there is also vested in the court by section 108 of the Act the power to remove a liquidator, on cause shown, on the application of any person whom the court considers proper, including a member. No similar power exists as regards the removal of directors. Second, the court also enjoys the power to appoint a liquidator under section 108, either to fill a vacancy or in place of a liquidator. Again, no similar power exists as regards the appointment of directors. A liquidator appointed in this way may be removed by the members only through the mechanism set out in section 171(3). Third, the members do not enjoy powers to control the actions of liquidators. While the articles of association usually confer on the directors the power and responsibility to conduct the business of the company as they, in accordance with their duties, see fit, it is open to the members to exert control and instruct the directors in their conduct of the business by special resolution, altering the relevant articles either generally or <span style="font-style:italic">pro tanto</span>. The members enjoy no such powers over the liquidator even in a members’ voluntary liquidation. The most they can do, short of taking steps to remove the liquidator, is to apply to the court for directions under section 112 of the Act. It is then for the court to decide whether any directions be given to the liquidator. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The fact that the members of the Companies had resolved to accept the final accounts of the former liquidators and to give them their release could not of itself preclude the court from exercising its powers under section 1029 of the Companies Act and section 108 of the Act and Mr Crow did not suggest otherwise. As Hoffmann LJ said in <span style="font-style:italic">Stanhope Pension Trust Ltd v Registrar of Companies </span>at p.89E, “the finality of the dissolution is qualified by the express provisions of section 651” [of the Companies Act 1985]. <span style="font-style:italic"> </span>Leaving aside any issues arising from the <span style="font-style:italic">ex parte </span>character of the restoration application as it was made, Mr Crow relied on two factors as demonstrating that the relief should have been denied.

Second, remedies </p>

The reason is that the resolutions were passed without most members having any knowledge of the matters of concern raised by Mr Grattan and Mr Hussey. There was no circular to members, informing them of these matters. Although Mr Grattan and Mr Hussey raised questions at the meetings, very few members were present in person to hear them and most of the votes had already been cast by proxy, as is usually the case with meetings of this sort. Only if there has been informed consent given by the majority of members voting for the resolutions to conclude the liquidations, could it be said that the resolutions should be treated as a bar to, or as strong grounds against, subsequent applications for restoration and the appointment of new liquidators. </p>

Some may be controversial, such as in particular a derivative action sanctioned under section 260 <span style="font-style:italic">et seq </span>of the Companies Act 2006, but there is no doubt that remedies were available. Most obviously, he could have applied to remove the former liquidators under section 108 and appoint other liquidators who could investigate their concerns and bring proceedings, if they considered it appropriate. Of course, on any such application, the onus would have been on him to establish that there was good cause for the removal of the former liquidators. Alternatives existed, although they would be less attractive from a practical standpoint. Misfeasance proceedings could have been brought under section 212 of the Act against Mr Fakhry and others, with the leave of the court under section 212(5). It is uncertain whether such proceedings could be brought against the former liquidators while they remained in office, as section 212(1)(b) refers to “a person who has acted as liquidator…of the company”. In theory, proceedings could have been brought in the names of the Companies, with an indemnity in favour of the liquidators as regards costs, as ordered by Walton J in <span style="font-style:italic">Fargro Ltd v Godfroy </span>[1986] 1 WLR 1134.   </p>

It must also be borne in mind that he and Mr Hussey were retail investors without ready access either to the information known to Mr Fakhry and Mr Fry or to the level of professional resources available to them.  If the evidence showed that Mr Grattan had sat on his hands, with knowledge of the alleged facts and in circumstances where he should have applied to remove the former liquidators or even brought proceedings against the alleged wrongdoers, this would at the very least be a highly relevant factor in the exercise of the court’s discretion to restore the Companies to the register and to appoint the present liquidators.  </p>

His submission was that it had not been shown on the evidence that Mr Grattan and Mr Hussey had discovered any new information. Mr Sutcliffe did not accept this, and he pointed to the detailed evidence given by Mr Hussey in his witness statement in support of the restoration applications and to the large volume of documents exhibited to it. Mr Crow was in difficulty in developing this submission because the appellant had not agreed to any of the relevant evidence being in the appeal bundles and, although the respondents had filed an “unagreed bundle” which included Mr Hussey’s witness statement, we still did not have critical documents, including in particular Mr Hussey’s letter dated 29 July 2016 to the former liquidators. </p>

The reason proffered was that it was intended to investigate the conduct of the former liquidators. That could not be a good reason for not serving them. This was not akin to an application, such as for a freezing order, where notice to a party may well frustrate the application. Fancourt J fell into error in accepting the reason given for non-service on the former liquidators, an error which he might well not have made if he had been correctly informed of the registrar’s position on the need for service on the former liquidators. Service on them would have enabled other material considerations, not raised by Mr Grattan’s legal team, to be put before Fancourt J, by both the former liquidators and by any members such as Mr Fakhry who might then have been alerted to the application. </p>

He also referred to the fact that on an application to <span style="font-style:italic">remove</span> a liquidator under section 108 of the Act, the wishes of the majority of members are a factor to which the court will have regard but which is not determinative. Likewise, a decision by a majority of members which gives rise to a release of a liquidator is not absolute because a misfeasance claim can be made against a former liquidator with the leave of the court under section 212(4). </p>

The issue facing the court was whether these Companies should be revived at all. It was, in my view, this issue on which the members should be consulted, together with whether they wanted liquidators to embark on the proposed investigations. The Judge referred to the investigations which the liquidators wished to undertake, but the crucial issue is not whether they wanted to undertake investigations but whether the members wanted them to do so. It was an error of principle to delay meetings of members until the liquidators had concluded those investigations. I will revert to the other reason given by the Judge, that there was a real risk that the manager’s voting power might be deployed to prevent the investigations. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Nor do I think it would be right to remove the present liquidators. The Companies are currently in existence and they need to have liquidators in office while that remains the case. Given that Mr Fry accepts, for present purposes, that there are matters worthy of investigation as regards the former liquidators’ conduct of the liquidation, it would not be appropriate to appoint him. While it can fairly be said of the present liquidators that they were appointed for the sole purpose of conducting those investigations and were energetic in doing so, the expense of appointing liquidators temporarily to hold the ring is not justified, even assuming there were funds to pay them. For this reason, it is unnecessary to enter into the debate as to the “adverse interest principle” advanced by Mr Sutcliffe, which would deprive Mr Fakhry as a member of standing to apply for the removal of the present liquidators, to which the Judge referred at [61] and [104] – [107]. I only wish to say that I am not persuaded that there is anything as elevated as a “principle” at work here and that I am more inclined to the view of Marcus Smith J in <span style="font-style:italic">Raithata v Arnold Holstein GmbH </span>[2017] EWHC 3069 (Ch) that the existence of matters worthy of investigation as regards the conduct of an applicant seeking the removal of a liquidator is highly material to the application but not determinative in all cases; there might be reasons to remove the liquidators which could not properly be resisted on this ground. </p>

These should be ordinary resolutions decided on a simple majority of votes. Once the meetings have been held, the court would decide whether to confirm or set aside the orders made by Fancourt J. In the absence of exceptional circumstances and subject to the next paragraph, it is to be expected that the court would give effect to the resolutions. </p>

This is the second reason given by the Judge at [111] for not convening meetings. This problem has been considered in the context of derivative actions and resolved by having regard only to the votes of shareholders independent of the proposed defendants: see <span style="font-style:italic">Smith v Croft (No 2) </span>[1988] Ch 114.

First, the present liquidators are relying on resolutions passed during the “previous” liquidation for the remuneration of the former liquidators as authority for their own remuneration. To date some £250,000 plus VAT has been paid to them on this basis. This may be legally permissible, a point on which I express no view, but it underlines the need for the members as a body to resolve what they consider should be the future of the Companies.  </p>

The legal costs are very substantial, principally as a result of these proceedings. This funding is designed to cover the investigation phase, but not the costs of any proceedings that may follow. If no claims are brought, or the claims are unsuccessful, those shareholders will not be repaid. If claims are brought, and are successful, those shareholders “will be returned the monies invested and a return on their investment for putting their money at risk”. No information has been provided as to the size of that return. Full disclosure of the terms of these funding arrangements will need to be made to members, at the latest when notice of the meetings is given to members.
