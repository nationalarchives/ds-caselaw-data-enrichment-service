	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">This case raises important points of law concerning the test to be applied to determine when prices charged by dominant undertakings for goods or services amount to the abuse of a dominant position, as to the nature of the duty upon a competition authority to evaluate evidence adduced by an undertaking in its defence, and as to the powers of judicial bodies called upon to hear appeals from such authorities. The subject matter of the appeals concerns the pricing of pharmaceutical products and affects the sums paid by the public purse for drugs.  But the case is of wider application because the legal issues apply to all goods and services in the economy. I have read the judgment of the Chancellor of the High Court and agree with it.  </p>

The pharmacokinetic characteristics of the drug (i.e. the manner in which it moves through the body from absorption to break-down and excretion) are non-linear and the concentration of the drug in the blood does not respond proportionately to increases or decreases in dosage. It can therefore be difficult to regulate the appropriate dose for a patient. This is a reason for the decline in use of the drug in the UK. Phenytoin sodium is therefore not generally prescribed as a first-line or single treatment for epilepsy. There are nonetheless about 48,000 patients in the UK who are already stabilised on the drug and for whom it is effective.  </p>

In 2009 Pfizer was approached by Tor Generics Ltd which sought to acquire a licence for the exclusive supply of Epanutin in the UK.  It proposed that the drug be genericised to facilitate a price increase. Pfizer did not ultimately pursue the proposal. Instead it approached Flynn in January 2010 to discuss tail end products including Epanutin. In July 2010 Flynn produced a proposal that Flynn should become the holder of the MA for Epanutin and </p>

Authorities find them difficult to bring and are, rightly, wary of casting themselves in the role of price regulators.  Generally, price control is better left to sectoral regulators, where they exist, and operated prospectively; ex post price regulation through the medium of competition law presents many problems. However, the law prohibits unfair pricing in certain circumstances and in such cases there is no reason in principle why competition law cannot be applied, provided this is done on the correct legal basis and the analysis of evidence is sound.   </p>

However, we have found this particular decision to be wrongly based in certain respects.  Whilst we find the CMA was correct that the two companies each held a dominant position, we find the CMA’s conclusions on abuse of dominance were in error.  The CMA did not correctly apply the legal test for finding that prices were unfair; it did not appropriately consider what was the right economic value for the product at issue; and it did not take sufficient account of the situation of other, comparable, products, in particular of the phenytoin sodium tablet.  This means that the CMA’s findings on abuse of dominance in this case cannot be upheld.   </p>

We recognise the difficulties inherent in seeking to formulate a generally applicable framework or test for abuse by unfair pricing, and we are conscious that, as United Brands itself states, there may be other ways than the two-limb test set out in that case for establishing an abuse.  Nonetheless, if an authority chooses to proceed to apply the two-limb test in a structured way, as the CMA has purported to do in this case, a sensible framework would, in our view, and in light of the requirements and factors we have already set out above, be as follows.   </p>

There is also a suggestion in the Judgment that in any case where the authority relies upon one alternative it should <span style="font-style:italic">also</span> use the other alternative as a “<span style="font-style:italic">sanity check</span>” (Judgment paragraphs [294(14)] and [368]), adopting the “<span style="font-style:italic">authoritative</span>” analysis of Advocate General Wahl in <span style="font-style:italic">Latvian Copyright</span>. On my reading of the Judgment I was unclear as to whether the Tribunal was indicating that the authority should therefore <span style="font-style:italic">always</span> use a multi-test, combined, approach or whether that was required <span style="font-style:italic">only</span> when it was raised by a defendant undertaking. For the avoidance of doubt, I address both possibilities. The nub of this Ground flows out of the position that the CMA adopted in the Decision. There the CMA stated that if it establishes enough evidence on cost plus to prove abuse (i.e. under the “<span style="font-style:italic">in itself”</span> alternative in <span style="font-style:italic">United Brands</span> paragraph [252]) then “<span style="font-style:italic">it was not necessary</span>” to address any other sort of evidence (such as under the second alternative, </p>

Put another way the two tests are mutually exclusive in the sense that <span style="text-decoration:underline">if</span> the CMA relies upon one test then it does <span style="text-decoration:underline">not</span> have to address the other.

I disagree. The judgment is certainly inconsistent with the proposition that the Commission <span style="text-decoration:underline">must</span> always analyse more than one appropriate test. But that is not the same as saying that in an appropriate case, the Commission can ignore exculpatory evidence of another type if it is <span style="font-style:italic">prima facie </span>relevant. On the facts of this case the Commission chose to examine comparator data.  The Court held that excessive prices “<span style="font-style:italic">may</span>” be determined by reference to whether the price is “<span style="font-style:italic">unfair in itself</span>” or competing product data, but it was not obliged (“<span style="font-style:italic">must</span>”) to perform a Cost-Plus exercise. The Court did not say that the alternatives were legally mutually exclusive and/or sufficient in their own right.  The ruling is a far cry from saying that <span style="font-style:italic">if</span> the Commission selects one method, but a defendant undertaking serves relevant exculpatory evidence upon some <span style="font-style:italic">other</span> basis then the Commission can avoid fairly evaluating that evidence.

The collecting society was fined by the competition authority for imposing unfair rates.  The society appealed to the Competition Council. There was an appeal to a first instance court and then an appeal to the Supreme Court (Administrative Cases Division) therefrom.  The court referred 7 questions to the Court of Justice (cf judgment paragraph [24]). This was not a case involving a Cost-Plus analysis since in cases involving intangible property, such as copyright, it is recognised that such an analysis might be artificial. The questions referred sought clarification as to how to apply the unfairness test in Article 102 in such circumstances. The questions raised concerned issues such as: the sufficiency for the purpose of Article 102 of an authority conducting a limited exercise comparing national rates with those in neighbouring states; the sufficiency of using the PPP index of gross national product; whether if comparisons must be made they had to be based upon rates for each segment or averages; when differences in rates would be considered appreciable; and, as to the nature of the evidence that was to be expected from a defendant undertaking to prove the fairness of rates alleged to be unfair.

In our view those comparisons, taken together, amply support the Director’s conclusions that Napp’s prices in the community segment were, during the period of the infringement, well above what would have been expected in competitive conditions. Thus we agree with the Director’s finding, at paragraph 211 of the Decision, that it is only in the community segment, where buyers are less price sensitive, and where there is an absence of effective competition, that Napp can sustain a premium of 40 per cent over competitors.  With the exceptions mentioned in paragraph 360 above, Napp’s prices have remained unchanged for 20 years, including nearly 10 years since the expiry of Napp’s formulation patent.  At the same time, Napp has retained a market share of the community segment of some 96 per cent.  Those facts also support the proposition that Napp’s community prices, unlike its hospital prices, have not been subject to competitive pressure, as the Director found in paragraph 213 of the Decision” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Hoskins QC drew our attention to various features of pharmaceutical markets recognised in the literature, to support the submissions of the CMA favouring a wide margin of appreciation for competition authorities and the importance of <span style="font-style:italic">ex post</span> intervention. The OECD Paper explains why such <span style="font-style:italic">ex post</span> intervention is relatively unusual but also how it can be very important in certain types of case.  Medicines are subject to a “<span style="font-style:italic">dense and comprehensive</span>” regulatory framework that recognises the limited ability of competition enforcement agencies to lower prices.  The framework is less comprehensive in relation to off-patent drugs, where inter-brand competition is relied upon to contain prices.  But competition concerns can arise even in the offpatent sector where there can remain an absence of therapeutic and inter-brand competition even upon expiry of patents. This can lead to a “<span style="font-style:italic">lack of price elasticity of demand, particularly as regards ‘essential’ drugs</span>”.  These developments appear, observationally, to have occurred in tandem with the emergence of business strategies that identified market segments where prices could be successfully increased. Companies identify niche essential drugs that are not under patent but whose market is so small that no competitors will enter the market, or where supply is limited for regulatory or contractual reasons.  In its submissions the CMA identified analogous factors specific to the drug in question in these proceedings which it contended made the present case apt for <span style="font-style:italic">ex post</span> intervention.  These included that phenytoin was not in patent. It is an “<span style="font-style:italic">old</span>” product first marketed in 1938 which was used for a declining patient population but where the suppliers benefited from regulatory clinical guidance which substantially precluded switching even between clinically identical, molecular, substitutes.  This served to maintain barriers to switching and inter-brand competition and was an important factor in establishing the dominant positions of Pfizer and Flynn in their respective markets and their power over price.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">These features served to distinguish the present case from other markets where patent expiry removed the principal obstacle to market entry. Where there are no material barriers to entry high prices can act as a magnet to entry which, in due course, drives prices down.  Many markets are thus self-correcting.  In the absence of entry barriers regulatory intervention can risk prolonging a monopoly situation by blocking efficient signals which would otherwise promote market entry.  A belief in market forces “…<span style="font-style:italic">is often bolstered by the (perceived high) likelihood of regulatory failure, a risk which is compounded in the case of price regulation</span>”.  The investigation of <span style="font-style:italic">ex post</span> cases of alleged excessive pricing faces significant difficulties in terms of data availability and analysis, identifying appropriate assessment standards, and of designing and implementing suitable remedies: “<span style="font-style:italic">This has led some to consider that the identification of excessive prices is a ‘daunting, if not, impossible task’… The issues are still more extreme when trying to set clear rules that allow for ex ante compliance with excessive pricing rules. The key problem here is that it is not clear what the appropriate benchmark should be</span>.”. In written submissions the CMA argued that the economic difficulties in applying competition law to excessive pricing must not be allowed to render “<span style="font-style:italic">…the law a dead letter</span>”.  It was the task of the competition authority to exercise its judgment as to when <span style="font-style:italic">ex post</span> intervention was apt, and courts should avoid articulating rules which made this inherently difficult task unworkable or excessively difficult.  </p>

In some cases, a comparison between production costs and prices is used but price/cost analysis is not feasible in all cases due to lack of data or because the disputed price relates to an intangible good such as an IP right.  Other methods are also used such as benchmarking “<span style="font-style:italic">of some sort</span>”. Price-based benchmarks are used by comparing the investigated price with prices charged by the dominant firm in different markets or over time or by comparing the prices charged by the dominant firm and those charged by other firms, either in the same market or in other markets. Another benchmark focuses upon the profitability of the dominant firm by comparing such profits either with a normal competitive profit or the profits of other firms. Other methods are also identified. The guiding factor in each case is the availability and suitability of the evidence and data. Competition authorities often adopt a pick and mix or combinatorial approach to the evidence to be relied upon. There are no fixed rules, assumptions or presumptions.

The CMA cited the dichotomy drawn in Article 101 TEU between “<span style="font-style:italic">object</span>” and “<span style="font-style:italic">effect</span>” in relation to the prohibition of restrictive agreements.  It was argued by analogy that the Treaty itself recognised the economic logic of a strict demarcation between object and effect and this was analogous to the equally strict distinction drawn by the Court in paragraph [252] between an “<span style="font-style:italic">in itself</span>” and a “<span style="font-style:italic">competing products</span>” fairness test. I disagree and the economic literature provides no support for this narrow argument: </p>

It is predicated upon the economically sound premise that prevention is better than cure.  The distinction drawn in paragraph [252] of <span style="font-style:italic">United Brands</span> is not however premised upon any equivalent economic justification for <span style="font-style:italic">ex ante</span> intervention but, on the contrary, identifies two possible ways of considering <span style="font-style:italic">ex post</span> intervention.  </p>

There the Commission advanced an argument very similar to the object/effect point now run by the CMA namely that if a practice was capable of harming competition (but had not yet done so) that was sufficient to establish abuse.  The Court disagreed: if a defendant undertaking adduces evidence which shows that even if there is capability nonetheless there is no effect then it was not open to the Commission to stand on capacity and ignore effect.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">I finally address the argument that any test other than that advanced by the CMA and the Commission would leave the law as unworkable.  Insofar as the concerns of the CMA and Commission rest upon their interpretation of the Judgment as <span style="text-decoration:underline">compelling</span> a combinatorial approach the statement of relevant principles set out in this judgment (and the consistent position set out in the judgment of the Chancellor) should address that concern.  The OECD Paper is generally sanguine about fears of over-complexity: <span style="font-style:italic">“… even if it were true that the assessment of excessive pricing can be challenging, it would be wrong to overstate the difficulties of pursuing such an assessment. While it can be hard to set out simple guidance that draws a clear line between excessive and lawful pricing, there may nevertheless be cases where pricing is so extreme that it becomes relatively easy to demonstrate that it is excessive by reference to a variety of different measures. Acknowledging the difficulties in identifying a single standard which is able to determine whether prices are excessive in all situations, many competition authorities have instead applied several methodologies in parallel in order to minimise the possibility of erroneous intervention</span>”.  Very much the same argument was advanced by the Commission in <span style="font-style:italic">Intel </span>before the General Court in relation to the AEC defence advanced by Intel (see paragraphs [87] – [89] above). As is clear from the Commission decision in that case the AEC analysis was hugely complex and detailed, yet this was irrelevant to the judgment of the Court which held that since an AEC test was in principle relevant then it was the <span style="text-decoration:underline">duty</span> of the Commission (and the court on appeal) fairly to evaluate it.  </p>

The Tribunal described the nature of the investigation that the CMA must conduct into competing evidence adduced by an undertaking using different language.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">“<span style="font-style:italic">investigation</span>” and the inference that it has to be full to be “<span style="font-style:italic">proper</span>” have raised fears in the minds of the CMA and the Commission that the Judgment imposes upon competition authorities generally an overly burdensome duty and strips from them the ability to perform a reasonable and proportionate, more finely-tuned, evaluation of the evidence consistent with the existence of a margin of manoeuvre or discretion. In particular the CMA is concerned in this case that to follow the Judgment it would have to conduct an exhaustive analysis of <span style="text-decoration:underline">all</span> the comparators advanced by the companies or engage in a full-blown Cost-Plus analysis of third parties (even if in its view these steps were unnecessary). To overcome these concerns the CMA argues generally that (i) a competition authority has no <span style="text-decoration:underline">duty</span> to conduct a “<span style="font-style:italic">full</span>” investigation or inquiry of a defendant’s evidence; and (ii) in any event, there is a distinction to be drawn between a duty to “<span style="font-style:italic">consider</span>” and a duty to “<span style="font-style:italic">investigate</span>” and the extent of its duty lies with the former and not the latter.  I was not entirely certain from the CMA’s arguments where it drew the line between a duty to “<span style="font-style:italic">consider</span>” and a duty to “<span style="font-style:italic">investigate</span>”. The distinction appears to be between a passive assessment of the evidence before it (a consideration), and the proactive seeking out of evidence from third parties (an investigation).   </p>

By the very nature of the legal test for abuse a competition authority has a margin of manoeuvre or discretion as to the method(s) it uses and the evidence it relies upon.  How it goes about evaluating the evidence will be fact and context specific and will take into account the evidence adduced by a defendant undertaking.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">At base the CMA has a duty to conduct a fair evaluation of all the evidence before it.  What this means in a given case is impossible to say in advance and will depend upon the facts of the case.  A degree of proactivity might be needed, in some cases, but not in others. For instance, at both the UK and EU level the CMA and Commission have the statutory power to seek information from third parties by the use of statutory demands for information, if they consider this necessary to establish an infringement, and such powers are routinely considered and used even in investigations which might be described as relatively light touch (and certainly not “<span style="font-style:italic">full”</span>).  What this ultimately boils down to is the existence of a margin of manoeuvre or discretion that the authority has in relation to the evaluation of evidence before it. The law does not predetermine in advance how intensive any particular evaluation by the authority will be.  The notion of a duty to evaluate evidence fairly encapsulates the contextual nature of the duty.  If the CMA fails in this duty the Tribunal exists to remedy any such failing.  In short there is a duty of fair evaluation upon the CMA in relation to the evidence before it.  But it has a discretion as to how it performs that duty which includes as to the depth and intensity of the inquiry and there is no general duty to perform a “<span style="font-style:italic">full</span>” investigation in all cases. In coming to this conclusion I am not precluding the possibility that in a specific case the Tribunal might, having found an error in the analysis and findings of the CMA, remit the matter with a very specific direction in the judgment (under paragraph 3 of Schedule 8 CA 1998) as to the steps that must be taken during a fresh evaluation to correct the error. But the present case is not such a case; the remittal was in general terms.  To the extent that there is an issue on the facts of this case about the scope of the remittal, this is dealt with under the fifth (Flynn) Ground of Appeal (paragraphs [174] – [182] below). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">I turn now to a different point.  The CMA expressed the concern that if the duty imposed upon it was to investigate “<span style="font-style:italic">fully</span>”, that undertakings could “<span style="font-style:italic">game the system</span>” and adopt a strategic approach to proceedings designed to heighten the burden on the authority and thereby deter enforcement.  I do not consider that the law permits this to occur. Case law makes clear that the extent of the duty on an authority to evaluate evidence adduced by an undertaking (taking account of its due margin) is affected by the quality of that evidence. There is an important evidential burden upon an undertaking being investigated. Case law exemplifies this. In <span style="font-style:italic">United Brands</span> the Court condemned the Commission for failing to investigate evidence on costs and profits adduced by the undertaking even though it criticised that evidence as in some respects “<span style="font-style:italic">unreliable</span>”. This was because, limitations apart, the evidence refuted key elements of the Commission’s analysis and cost data was readily available in the form of a recent UNCTAD report. The undertaking had met <span style="text-decoration:underline">its</span> evidential burden and the burden of fair evaluation lay upon to the Commission. But the evidential burden can be quite exacting. A different result arose in <span style="font-style:italic">Athens Airport</span> (ibid) where the Court found that the complainant had not adduced evidence of sufficient quality to shift the burden back to the Commission (see paragraphs [74] – [75] above) and it therefore had no obligation to proceed to evaluate the category of evidence that the complainant wished the Commission to assess.   In Case T-216/13 <span style="font-style:italic">Telefonica v Commission</span> (28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2016) the General Court explained that where the Commission had demonstrated the existence of an infringement it was not enough for a defendant undertaking simply to raise the “…<span style="font-style:italic">possibility that a circumstance arose which might affect the probative value</span>” of the Commission evidence - speculation will not do.  It “…<span style="font-style:italic">was not capable of affecting the probative value”</span> of the Commission evidence.  In Case C-105/04P <span style="font-style:italic">NFVV v Commission</span> in her Opinion of 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2005 Advocate General Kokott, in the context of a discussion about the relative burdens of the Commission and investigated undertakings, observed that where the Commission has drawn a conclusion based upon “…<span style="font-style:italic">objectively verifiable evidence from stated sources</span>…” then such findings could not be undermined simply by the undertaking “<span style="font-style:italic">unsubstantiatedly disputing them</span>” (ibid page I-8748 paragraph [74]) - assertion will not do. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">I deal finally with one argument raised by the CMA which if correct could have wide ramifications. Mr Hoskins QC sought to argue, as a matter of principle, that the CMA was justified in not conducting a full investigation of a defendant undertaking’s evidence by virtue of the fact that the Tribunal had a <span style="text-decoration:underline">merits</span> jurisdiction and could, if needs be, correct failings on the part of the CMA.  This meant that there was always a safeguard against poor administrative decision making: no harm would come of it.  I disagree.  I can see no basis upon which the fuller, merits, jurisdiction, of the Tribunal governs or affects the scope of the duty of the competition authority at first instance. As Ms Bacon QC for Flynn pointed out by reference to case law of the Court of Justice and other considerations there were many reasons why competition authorities must conduct a sufficient, self-contained, evaluation: (i) the jurisdiction of competition authorities is treated as quasi-criminal because it can lead to the imposition of potentially vast fines and no undertaking should be subjected to a criminal penalty without have been subjected to a fully adequate evaluation of the evidence; (ii) case law establishes that the burden of proof remains on the competition authority to prove its case with evidence that is “<span style="font-style:italic">objective, appropriate and verifiable</span>” (e.g. <span style="font-style:italic">Latvian Copyright</span> paragraph [41]) and the presumption of innocence lies with the investigated undertaking throughout; (iii) competition authorities are subject to duties of good administration which do not contemplate that sub-optimal evaluations are acceptable merely because there is an appeal route which might cure that failing (see e.g. Case C-272/09P <span style="font-style:italic">KME Germany v Commission</span> (8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2011) at paragraphs [107] and [108] - the duty of good administration means that the </p>

To the extent therefore that the Tribunal compelled the use of a particular test then in my view it has misconstrued the case law.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">First, as to the expression “<span style="font-style:italic">hypothetical</span>” nothing suggests that in every case there is a need for the creation of a hypothetical benchmark, in the sense of an artificial construct.  Indeed, the thrust of the OECD Paper and the literature it cites suggests that the counterfactuals of greatest practical value are often those drawn from real life, as opposed to some hypothetical model. The case law supports this conclusion. I note that in some cases the Commission does use hypothetical modelling (part of the AEC test used in the <span style="font-style:italic">Intel</span> case was based upon just such hypothetical modelling) but the point is that it is not a <span style="font-style:italic">necessary</span> part of the analysis. Any suggestion by the Advocate General in <span style="font-style:italic">Latvian Copyright</span> that the use of hypothetical price benchmarking was mandatory is not a proposition that was endorsed by the Court which, as already observed, emphasised the flexibility of the margin of manoeuvre of competition authorities.  </p>

I also agree with the submissions of Ms Bacon QC for Flynn (who ultimately did not support the reasoning of the Tribunal, <span style="font-style:italic">if</span> the Judgment was to be construed as requiring a hypothetical benchmark price in every case) that in both the law and in economics all that is required is that there be “<span style="font-style:italic">a</span>” benchmark or standard against which to measure excess or fairness.  The need for <span style="font-style:italic">a</span> comparator is economically logical since the concepts of fairness, excessiveness and reasonableness are all relative concepts.  They must be compared with their counterfactual e.g. unfairness, normality or unreasonableness.  But case law and literature make clear that there are numerous counterfactuals which might be used, and importantly this <span style="text-decoration:underline">includes</span> the costs of the dominant undertaking as well as benchmarks set by reference to ROS or ROCE or some other similar measure. As was pointed out in argument the overarching description of an abuse in <span style="font-style:italic">United Brands</span> at paragraph [249] is by reference to a comparison with “<span style="font-style:italic">trading benefits</span>” realised in conditions of normal and sufficiently effective (i.e. workable) competition.

It argues, in essence, that it conducted a detailed (and sufficient) analysis of the evidence, that the Tribunal was unable to find serious fault with the preponderant part of it, and that the only flaw identified by the Tribunal was one of degree – namely that the CMA should have carried out a more intense evaluation of the comparables evidence adduced by the defendant undertakings.

Pfizer’s average selling price (“<span style="font-style:italic">ASP</span>”) exceeded Cost Plus by an average excess of 443% across all capsule strengths (the excesses ranged between 29% and 705%), accruing approximately £53.9m excess profit. The ASP of Flynn exceeded Cost-Plus by an average of 41% (the range was between 31% and 133%) though these percentages understate the extent of the actual excess, because Flynn paid high supply prices to Pfizer thereby artificially inflating its costs. In absolute terms, Flynn earned £29.8m in excess profit which was more than half the £53.9m excess earned by Pfizer, despite Flynn’s limited activities and risks (as noted in the Judgment, paragraph [346]). The differential between the prices charged pre-September 2012 and those charged by each of Pfizer and Flynn post September 2012, which did not reflect any material change in costs, risk or innovation were “<span style="font-style:italic">dramatic</span>”.

If the Tribunal considers that the findings of the CMA are reasonable it might be difficult to say that any findings that it arrives at which differ from those of the CMA are material. The Tribunal in the present case indicated as much at various points in the Judgment.  This point was also made by the Tribunal in <span style="font-style:italic">Albion Water</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">v Water Services Regulation Authority</span> [2008] CAT 31 at paragraph [72].

Phenytoin sodium may be dispensed in either capsule or tablet form. Pfizer manufactures capsules and rivals, including Teva, produce tablet versions for the UK market. During the administrative procedure before the CMA Pfizer adduced evidence on the relationship between phenytoin sodium capsules and tablets (Judgment paragraphs [209] – [213] and [374] – [393]). The capsules and tablets are clinically identical.  They are sold in the UK to the same ultimate customer, the NHS, who paid a price for the tablet <span style="text-decoration:underline">double</span> that charged by Pfizer for its capsules.  It was not in dispute that Pfizer benchmarked its capsule prices against the tablet price. During the administrative procedure Pfizer encouraged the CMA to evaluate the tablet as a comparator as relevant to the economic value of phenytoin sodium. The CMA decided that in law it could ignore the tablet as a comparator and only considered the tablet for sake of “<span style="font-style:italic">completeness</span>”<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:18.5pt"> </span>(Decision paragraph [5.478]).  For this reason, the nub of the CMA’s submissions to the Tribunal focused upon why it excluded tablets, rather than upon the intrinsic merits or demerits of the comparators.  The CMA adduced no evidence concerning any comparators, or possible comparator products. The expert medical evidence of Professor Walker for Pfizer stood unchallenged.

However, that process would also be highly germane to seeking to establish the benchmark price in conditions of sufficient competition, as well as being informative on the question of unfairness.

Nevertheless, in this case, the CMA should, in our view, have done a sufficient investigation into the competitive conditions surrounding the most obvious comparator product properly to inform its decision on Pfizer-Flynn Capsules.  It is not an answer to state there was no obligation to conduct a full investigation.  That is so in relation to the CMA's discretion in relation to the price of tablets; but it is not right in terms of obtaining sufficient evidence properly to apply Article 102 to the price of Pfizer-Flynn Capsules.

There was enough material to make it pause to consider, at the very least, whether there was a prima facie case of fairness under Alternative 2.  We accept that there is an element of circularity in this.  The authority must investigate possible comparator candidates to see if they are likely to be meaningful on objective, verifiable and appropriate criteria. On the other hand, the authority has a margin of discretion as to the possible comparators that it needs to examine.  How is it to know whether the comparators are likely to be meaningful unless it examines them?

But this cannot serve as an adequate definition in an abuse case since otherwise true value would be defined as anything that an exploitative and abusive dominant undertaking could get away with. It would equate proper value with an unfair price.  This is a well-known conundrum in international competition law.  The same point was made by the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Attheraces</span> (ibid) at paragraph [205].

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The Tribunal then addressed an argument raised by the CMA about dependency.  The basic idea is that because patients are unable to switch away from the Pfizer drug, because of clinical guidance (see paragraph [21] above), they (or the state as the payer) are bound to pay whatever price is demanded. The simple fact that patients value the drug highly and must remain wedded to it is not therefore to be treated as a discrete patient benefit; it is a feature of the regulatory regime surrounding the drug, but not the drug itself.  The CMA relied upon the Opinion of Advocate General Jacobs in <span style="font-style:italic">Tournier</span> (ibid).  That Opinion arose in the context of requests for preliminary rulings in a series of cases concerning the conduct of the French copyright management society SACEM towards discothèque owners in relation to charges for music in France.  The Court was requested to consider whether the royalty rates charged were discriminatory and excessive, particularly by reference to the royalties charged in other EU Member States. The Advocate General considered the relevance of the importance of music to French discothèques, i.e. the benefit to users.  He said (ibid paragraph [65]) that the idea that those who need music more should pay more was “<span style="font-style:italic">superficially attractive</span>” but the “<span style="font-style:italic">usefulness of such criterion breaks down</span>” when users were “<span style="font-style:italic">completely dependent</span>” on the supply of the music in question and there was no other possible source of supply.

I agree that demand side factors may be capable of generating economic value but on a fair reading of the Judgment the Tribunal was not saying that the CMA failed to address its mind to the issue and for that reason ignored economic value. It was saying that having addressed itself to the issue (as part of Cost-Plus) it had failed adequately to take account of evidence that there might be “<span style="font-style:italic">some</span>” (albeit unspecified) value to be attributed to patient benefit, and that the reasons given by the CMA for rejecting patient benefit as relevant (namely dependency) was itself an issue of fact and degree (and not principle) and did not mean that the CMA could ignore relevant evidence. The Tribunal articulated the issue in the following manner: “<span style="font-style:italic">The question is whether the CMA was correct, on the facts of this case, to exclude from its calculation of Pfizer’s and Flynn’s economic value all factors other than those that formed part of the Cost-Plus calculation</span>” (Judgment paragraph 411).

In this connection the CMA pointed out that the sheer scale of the prices charged by Pfizer and Flynn over Cost-Plus (i.e. above a 6% ROS) meant that any errors or omissions made by it were innately unlikely to exert any effect upon the ultimate conclusion, of breach.  For instance even if the CMA should have used a higher figure for ROS than 6% (because as the Tribunal found the PPRS might not be the ideal benchmark for ROS) the fact that at times the percentage actually being applied by the undertakings was so vastly in excess of ROS (see the table at paragraphs [38] above) meant that even if the CMA’s calculation of ROS was out by a factor of (say) 100% or 200% that would have made no real difference to the end conclusion. The CMA says that neither Pfizer nor Flynn set out to attribute precise quantitative monetary values to their arguments about patient benefit. Even if the CMA should have attributed “<span style="font-style:italic">some</span>” quantitative value to patient benefit (as part of the assessment of economic value) the likelihood of that altering the conclusion based upon Cost-Plus was remote.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">There is a brief analysis in the Judgment of materiality. In an ideal world it might have been fuller. The nub of the reasoning was that: the undertakings had raised a series of challenges to the methodology adopted by the CMA; the Tribunal identified a series of individual errors in that methodology; the Tribunal itself was not in a position to conduct a review of these matters; they went to relevant parts of the test for abuse; they could individually and/or cumulatively be material but the Tribunal was not in a position to form any conclusions about this. The CMA does not however argue that read fairly the Judgment discloses that the Tribunal ignored materiality <span style="font-style:italic">altogether</span> or applied illogical or irrational reasoning or that the reasoning was so lacking in detail as to amount to an error of law. Nor does it argue that the undertakings themselves failed altogether to adduce evidence on materiality as part of their evidential burden and that in such circumstances the Tribunal should have found that the errors were immaterial. There are no grounds of appeal which raise such matters.

The Tribunal held that it was not part of the “<span style="font-style:italic">in itself</span>” test but was part of “<span style="font-style:italic">a more general assessment</span>” (Judgment paragraphs [427] and [443(6)]). I agree with the parties on this.  It is evident from the judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">United Brands</span> that the reference to “<span style="font-style:italic">economic value</span>” is as part of the overall descriptor of the abuse; it is not the test.  The test should therefore, when properly applied, be capable of evaluating economic value.  So, for instance, as the CMA argues, when evaluating patient benefit it would be possible to measure its economic value in the Plus element of Cost-Plus, or even in the fairness element. Equally, if there is evidence of the prices being charged in relevant, comparator, markets which were effectively competitive then those prices could be capable of acting as proxy evidence of the economic value of patient benefit. </p>

If it is properly factored into “Plus” or “fairness” or into some other part of the test, or is reflected in other evidence which can stand as a proxy for economic value, then there is no incremental obligation to take it into account <span style="text-decoration:underline">again</span>, as a discrete advantage or justification for a high price. In paragraph [421] the Tribunal states that the analysis of economic value conducted at other stages of the test are “<span style="font-style:italic">broadly similar</span>” but that there is a “<span style="font-style:italic">different perspective</span>”. With respect I do not follow this. The analysis of the Tribunal, for instance as articulated in paragraph [443(6)] of the Judgment (set out at paragraph [40] above), suggests that it is a requirement <span style="font-style:italic">discrete</span> from other components of the test to be applied only after all those components have been worked through. But if this were so it would (wrongly) risk <span style="font-style:italic">compelling</span> a competition authority to double count economic value.  In short, economic value needs to be factored in and fairly evaluated, <span style="font-style:italic">somewhere,</span> but it is properly a matter which falls to the judgment of the competition authority as to where in the analysis this occurs.   </p>

On the various suggested combinations of other companies put forward by Flynn, whether or not their activities included manufacture, or their portfolios included or they were subject to a sufficient degree of competition, it is not apparent from the Decision (paras 5.164 and 5.193-4) that the CMA examined these fully and may have been too ready to dismiss them entirely (i.e. in a binary fashion) because of other factors such as Flynn’s low level of risk and high supply price. Nevertheless, with the exception of the tablets issue discussed below and subject to our findings on the CMA’s overall approach, we do not find that any of the comparators suggested to us, in themselves, presented such a clear evidential picture (given the difficulties, on the material before us, of understanding how relevant any given comparator was) that they undermined the conclusions reached by the CMA in deciding on a reasonable rate of return.

Indeed this was, in effect, the stance also adopted by Mr Brealey QC, for Pfizer, who described the outcome of the appeal to the Tribunal as a “<span style="font-style:italic">classic merits based appeal</span>” where the Tribunal found that the CMA had not properly considered various matters and remitted the issues in their entirety to be further considered as the CMA “<span style="font-style:italic">saw fit”</span>. </p>

There is no consideration of these matters in the Judgment.  This buttresses my construction of the Judgment as not fettering the discretion of the CMA or the parties as to the evidence that they may adduce or consider upon the remittal.

He submitted on the excessive limb (and generally), that there was no legal obligation on a claimant (whether a competition authority or a private complainant) to identify a checklist of each prima facie available and informative benchmark, methodology, or factor, and then to address each one.  Instead, the relevant legal question was whether the methodologies and the evidence that a claimant had chosen to rely upon meet the standard of proof.  A defendant is, of course, legally permitted to put forward evidence to the CMA and the CAT to seek to undermine the claimant’s case.

If an undertaking submits to the CMA a comparator that is <span style="font-style:italic">prima facie</span> “suitable and available” (see AG Wahl at [43]), in the sense that it is <span style="font-style:italic">prima facie</span> meaningful, then the authority should look at it under the principle of good administration and having regard to all relevant considerations.

The standard was whether <span style="font-style:italic">prima facie</span> the comparator provided or might provide some evidence, even if it is not conclusive evidence, of price or profitability under conditions of normal and sufficiently effective competition.

It would be undesirable to establish an approach or a methodology that is so complex and time-consuming that the CMA has neither the time nor the resources to deal with cases of alleged unfair pricing.  </p>

It is, however, unfortunate that it used a variety of terminologies to describe the problems that it identified in the CMA’s decision.

The CMA submitted that it was for it to choose which methodology to use.  The undertakings could then seek to demonstrate the inappropriateness of that methodology, but there was no requirement to seek to identify any particular benchmark, let alone a benchmark price.  Flynn submitted that it was necessary to identify one or more appropriate benchmarks as the CAT had said.  Ms Bacon nonetheless accepted that, in any particular case, the CMA that could properly fix upon a single methodology to identify the appropriate counterfactual with which the actual prices could be compared.  </p>

It is not, however, right to suggest that the only possible comparison is between “benchmark prices” in such a competitive situation and the undertaking’s actual prices.  Indeed, <span style="font-style:italic">United Brands</span> explained at [250] that in that case charging a price which was excessive would be an abuse if it had “no reasonable relation to the economic value of the product supplied”. At [251], the CJEU expressly acknowledged that the comparison could be between the selling price and the “cost of production, which would disclose the amount of the profit margin”.  Finally, in this connection, at [252], the first question to be determined is “whether the difference between the costs actually incurred and the price actually charged is excessive”. </p>

In some cases, that simply cannot be done, and in others, it may provide an inappropriate counterfactual.  But, where it can be done, there is no reason, based on the applicable authorities, why the authority should not use that methodology to ascertain an appropriate counterfactual for the excessive limb of the analysis.

That is so whether or not the CMA chooses to proceed eventually under the “unfair in itself” alternative of the unfairness test.  Even in that situation, the fact that comparators are expressly mentioned under the second alternative does not absolve the CMA from giving whatever proper attention is required to comparators raised by the undertakings.  In these circumstances, I am in substantive agreement with Green LJ’s conclusions on this point.

In <span style="font-style:italic">Albion Water II</span> [2008] CAT 31, the CAT said at [72] that it would “whilst still carrying out an assessment of the merits of the case, give due weight to a finding which is arrived at by an appropriate and reliable methodology, even if a dissatisfied party could suggest other ways of approaching the issue which would also have been reasonable and which might have resulted in a resolution more favourable to its case”. </p>

It may reject comparators so advanced, but should give reasons for doing so.  In my judgment, however, the obligation that the CAT imposed on the CMA at [379] and [391] was not correct in law.  The CMA does not have any duty actively to investigate in every case, in the sense of obtaining evidence about, any comparators put forward by the undertakings.  It may do so, of course.  It may even be desirable for it to do so (or even necessary in some cases), but it has a considerable margin of manoeuvre and it may decide how it wishes to deal with the comparators put forward by an undertaking.  If it rejects the comparators wrongly or without giving appropriate reasons, its infringement decision will be more vulnerable, if and when the matter comes before the CAT on appeal. </p>

As I have said, it may well be prudent for the CMA to make its own investigations, but it is not under a legal duty to do so.  If the CMA wrongly ignores evidence of comparators, and those comparators turn out to be relevant or important, their analysis will fail at the CAT.  In my judgment, the suggestion of an obligation in every case to conduct any investigation is not warranted in law. </p>

At [391], the CAT again said that the CMA should have done a sufficient investigation into the competitive conditions surrounding tablets, and at [392] that tablets as a meaningful comparator should not have been wholly rejected on the grounds relied on by the CMA.  There was, the CAT thought, enough material to make the CMA pause to consider whether there was a <span style="font-style:italic">prima facie</span> case of fairness and that the CMA should have investigated possible comparator candidates to see if they were likely to be meaningful on objective, verifiable and appropriate criteria, even bearing in mind its margin of discretion as to the possible comparators that needed to be examined. </p>

It is true that the CAT, at times, used the language of “investigation” to describe what it thought the CMA should have done, and also true that I would hold it was wrong to hold that an investigation had to be undertaken in every case.  But that does not, in my view, affect the CAT’s substantive factual findings as to the CMA’s treatment of comparators.  The CAT held that its treatment was inadequate for a series of factual reasons which have not and could not be challenged.  In those circumstances, I take the view that the issue of the comparators raised by the undertakings must be reconsidered by the CMA.  Mr Hoskins accepted, as I have said, that if that was our decision, the CMA would need to look afresh at the issue of comparators generally and would wish to do so.  I agree that it would be artificial for the CMA to reconsider comparators (in relation to each limb of the test) without a free hand to look, as Mr Hoskins put it, at each of the “elements of the basket”.  He accepted, and again I agree, that the CMA ought to consider all the factors put forward by the undertakings when the case goes back to it “with an open mind, carefully and impartially”.  </p>
