	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">This case involves a clash between rival users of the trade mark BENTLEY. The Claimants (“Bentley Clothing”), which are companies owned by Robert Lees and his sons Christopher and Richard, are the owner and exclusive licensee of three trade marks consisting of or comprising the word BENTLEY registered in respect of clothing and headgear (“the Trade Marks”), the earliest of which was registered in 1982. Bentley Clothing are the successors to a line of predecessor businesses, the first of which was founded by a Gerald Bentley in 1962. The Defendant (“Bentley Motors”) is the well-known car manufacturer. It is the successor to a predecessor company which was founded by Walter Owen Bentley in 1919. It is common ground that Bentley Motors and its predecessor have since 1919 made extensive use of the trade mark BENTLEY in relation to motor cars, and as a result that trade mark has a substantial reputation. Bentley Motors has sold clothing under signs consisting of or comprising the word BENTLEY since about 1987. This has given rise to a number of disputes between the parties in various fora. In these proceedings Bentley Clothing contend that Bentley Motors has infringed the Trade Marks by selling clothing and headgear under the sign or signs shown below since November 2011 (six years before the date on which the claim form was issued).  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It is important to note before proceeding further that one of the main defences to infringement advanced by Bentley Motors before the judge was a defence of honest concurrent use. The judge rejected that defence for the reasons given in his judgment at [85]-[160]. Bentley Motors was refused permission to appeal against that conclusion both by the judge and by Floyd LJ.

In the alternative, Bentley Clothing contends that Bentley Motors hase infringed all of the Trade Marks pursuant to Article 5(1)(b). It is common ground that the applicability of Article 5(1)(a) depends on the threshold question of whether Bentley Motors has used two distinct signs, namely (i) the B-in-wings device and (ii) the word BENTLEY (as Bentley Clothing contend), or one sign consisting of the combination of the B-in-wings device and the word BENTLEY (as Bentley Motors contends). If the use was of two distinct signs, Bentley Motors has used a sign identical to the relevant Trade Marks in relation to goods identical to those for which they are registered. If the use was of one sign, however, Bentley Motors has used a sign similar to the Trade Marks and the infringement claim falls to be considered under Article 5(1)(b). The difference is that Article 5(1)(b) requires Bentley Clothing to establish a likelihood of confusion, whereas Article 5(1)(a) does not. </p>

Counsel for Bentley Clothing pointed out that the list of issues included the issues of whether the Combination Mark was identical to any of the Trade Marks and whether Bentley Motors had a defence of honest concurrent use, but did not include condition (vi) as such or any other issue referable to condition (vi). Counsel for Bentley Motors pointed out that the list of issues included a statement that it was “not intended to take the place of the statements of case herein” and that the list of issues did not include the Schedule 3 paragraph 4 defence (which was introduced by an amendment to the Defence for which Chief Master Marsh gave permission by the same order).

There is no dispute that this finding was equally applicable during the relevant period. It is not the same, however, as a finding that the B-in-wings device was exclusively associated with goods of Bentley Motors when used in relation to clothing, still less is it a finding that the sign BENTLEY when used in combination with the B-in-wings device in relation to clothing was exclusively associated by consumers with goods of Bentley Motors.

None of those goods were identical to “articles of knitted clothing, shirts and waistcoats”, and thus use of the word BENTLEY in relation to those goods did not infringe under the 1938 Act. The judge held, for the reasons given in his judgment at [72]-[84], that Bentley Motors also had a defence to the claims for infringement of the Series Mark and the Word Mark under Schedule 3 paragraph 4, but this defence was limited to use of the sign on “promotional literature” (not on the goods themselves or on swing tags or the like attached to the goods) advertising “jackets, silk ties, caps and scarves”. </p>

Under current European laws, patents last 20 years, registered designs up to 25 years, a copyright can easily last over 100 years and a trade mark may remain registered indefinitely. The law cannot remain static for such long periods, however. Changes in technology, business models and social attitudes, among other things, mean that intellectual property legislation must be periodically revised if it is to remain fit for purpose. Although the speed with which legislatures react to the need for change varies greatly, most countries do introduce new or amended laws from time to time. In addition, the desire for increased harmonisation, both internationally and regionally, is another factor which leads to legislative change. What happens when new legislation comes into force? If the legislation is creating an entirely new right, then it is possible for the legislature to start with a clean sheet. More usually, however, there will be existing rights to which the legislation may apply. In these circumstances the legislature is faced with a series of choices. Should the new legislation only apply fully prospectively, that is to say, to rights which come into existence after the legislation comes into force? Or partially prospectively, that is to say, both to existing rights and to new rights, but in the case of existing rights only in respect of future acts of infringement? Or retrospectively </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In devising appropriate transitional provisions, a fundamental guiding principle that has often been applied by the UK Parliament is that of continuity of the law. The concept of continuity of the law is not easy to define with precision, but in broad terms it refers to the idea that the law should continue to apply in as seamless a manner as possible after a change in the law. A simple example is where legal proceedings are extant, but have not yet been determined, as at the date when the law changes. The principle of continuity of the law means that such proceedings should not fall into some legal abyss, but should continue in being. As this example shows, however, the principle of continuity of the law can be given effect to in more than one way. The first way, and the way that is generally accepted as representing continuity of the law in the truest sense in this context, is for the old law to continue to apply to the subject-matter of the existing proceedings even if it has otherwise been repealed or replaced. A second way is for the new law to apply to the subject-matter of the existing proceedings. A third way is for the old law to apply to some aspects (e.g. damages for past infringements) and the new law to others (e.g. the availability of an injunction to restrain future infringements). As this example shows, there is a need for policy choices to be made as to when the new law applies.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Another fundamental guiding principle that has often been applied by the UK Parliament in making such policy choices is that of legitimate expectations. The legislature recognises that both right owners and users of intellectual property rights have legitimate expectations about the way in which changes to the law affecting their rights should be implemented. These expectations often revolve around the question of retrospectivity. Right owners expect that they will not be deprived of existing rights, while users expect that existing non-infringing uses will not be turned into infringements. Such expectations are not necessarily all-or-nothing ones, however. Thus right owners may be prepared to accept limitations on existing rights, at least in the future, particularly if such limitations are imposed, say, as part of the price for an extension of the term of their rights. Similarly, users may be prepared to accept certain activities being turned into infringements if they are given time to sell off existing stocks and to transfer their businesses to new areas of activity.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The question of legitimate expectations is, of course, tied up with that of fundamental rights.

If, on the other hand, a new law extends the scope and/or duration of an intellectual property right, then there can be no question of any complaint by right owners under Article 1 of the First Protocol; but other parties affected by the change may argue that it amounts to an interference with another fundamental right, such as freedom of expression (protected by Article 10 ECHR and Article 11 of the Charter) or the freedom to conduct a business (protected by Article 16 of the Charter). It is not necessary to explore this aspect of the matter further, however, since neither side advanced any argument based on fundamental rights.   </p>

He held that Bentley Motors could continue to use the sign in relation to “jackets, silk ties, caps and scarves” generally, and not merely the specific kinds of jackets, silk ties, caps and scarves which Bentley Motors sold prior to 31 October 1994. (It is not clear why the judge only held that “silk ties” were permitted, and not “ties”, but there is no ground of appeal attacking that aspect of his decision.) As I have said, Bentley Clothing do not challenge this. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Bentley Motors contends that the judge ought to have assessed the goods at a higher level of generality. In its grounds of appeal and Re-Amended Defence Bentley Motors contends that it was and is entitled to continue to use the sign in relation to “all the clothing types complained of (save for knitted clothing, shirts and waistcoats)”. (Curiously, it does not claim any entitlement to continue to use the sign in relation to headgear.) The obvious problem with this formulation is that it is result-oriented. Why should Bentley Motors be entitled to continue to use the sign in relation to a particular kind of clothing just because, many years later, its use of the sign in relation to that kind of clothing has been held to be an infringement subject to the defence under Schedule 3 paragraph 4? </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Leaving aside the way in which the category of goods is formulated, the substance of the argument advanced by Bentley Motors in its skeleton argument and orally is that, given that Bentley Motors had sold “clothing of various kinds as merchandise of its car marque” prior to 31 October 1994, it should be entitled to continue to sell “clothing that serves the same purpose” after that date. It was accepted that this would not entitle Bentley Motors to step “wholly outside the types of goods which it has previously sold” e.g. by selling underwear. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I do not accept this argument, for three reasons. First, I am unable to see why Schedule 3 paragraph 4 should entitle Bentley Motors to sell any clothing that serves the same purpose. Counsel for Bentley Motors submitted that Bentley Motors had a legitimate expectation of being able to sell any clothing that served the same purpose, but I do not accept that. That would give Bentley Motors carte blanche to change the clothing it sold according to changes in business models. Merchandising in 2020 is a somewhat different activity to merchandising in 1994. Moreover, as counsel for Bentley Clothing submitted, this would defeat the legitimate expectations of the trade mark proprietor whose rights have been enlarged. Secondly, this test seems to me to be unacceptably vague and uncertain. Would it, for example, permit Bentley Motors to sell an overcoat or a pair of trousers or a pair of skiing gloves under the sign? What about children’s clothing? Thirdly, as counsel for Bentley Clothing pointed out, it is difficult to reconcile with Bentley Motors’ acceptance that it cannot use the sign in relation to knitted clothing, shirts and waistcoats. For example, T-shirts were in 1994 and remain a common form of merchandise.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">During the course of oral argument counsel for Bentley Clothing suggested that the judge’s approach amounted to treating the appropriate level of granularity as that found in the Alphabetical List of Goods and Services which forms part of the Nice Classification. Since this suggestion had not been raised in advance of the hearing, the parties did not come to court equipped properly to argue it. Thus the Court was not even referred to the relevant provisions of the Nice Agreement or to the relevant entries in the Alphabetical List. In any event, this suggestion also seems to me to be fraught with difficulty. The Nice Classification changes periodically, so which version(s) would be determinative of the scope of the exception? Moreover, the level of granularity of the Alphabetical List is essentially a matter of happenstance, depending as it does in large part on history and the decisions of successive Committees of Experts appointed under the Nice Agreement to revise the Classification. Most fundamentally, why should the question depend on classification at all, given that classification is essentially, if not exclusively, an administrative tool? In any event, no attempt was made by either counsel to relate the goods in issue in this case to the relevant entries in whichever version of the Alphabetical List was contended to be relevant. </p>

Again, counsel for Bentley Motors argued that Bentley Motors had a legitimate expectation of being able to use the sign in any way which amounted to use in relation to the relevant goods. I do not accept this. Prior to 31 October 1994 Bentley Motors had sold articles of clothing and headgear none of which had the sign BENTLEY affixed to them. Why, when the law was changed to give Bentley Clothing broader rights in respect of the Lozenge Mark, should Bentley Motors have had a legitimate expectation of being able to sell articles of clothing and headgear with the sign affixed to them, including e.g. jackets and caps emblazoned with the sign, for the first time? </p>

Certainly it was not an issue which was specifically raised by Bentley Motors in its grounds of appeal or skeleton argument. Even if it is an issue, it is not central to the dispute, which is primarily concerned with use affixed to the goods and on swing tags and the like. I therefore prefer to say no more about it.   </p>
