The appeal was heard on 23 April 2020.  On the previous day the same constitution heard the first such appeal: <span style="font-style:italic">Re A (Children)(Remote Hearing: Care and Placement Orders) </span>[2020] EWCA Civ 583.  In that judgment we summarised current guidance and set out a number of cardinal points and relevant factors with a view to assisting courts to make appropriate decisions in this changing landscape.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">At the end of the hearing of this appeal, we informed the parties that the appeal would be allowed and that an interim care order made at a telephone hearing in the family court on 3 April would be set aside.  The appeal concerned a 9-year-old boy, Sam (not his real name).  As a result of the order he had been removed from the care of his grandmother and placed in foster care.  The order should not have been made and Sam has now returned home.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In the present abnormal circumstances, the fundamental principles of substantive law and procedural fairness are unchanged.  Alongside other courts and tribunals, the Family Court continues to discharge its duties, particularly in urgent child protection cases.  The effective use of communication technology is indispensable to this ability to continue to deliver justice.  A remote hearing, where it is appropriate, can replicate some but not all of the characteristics of a fully attended hearing.  Provided good practice is followed, it will be a fair hearing, but we must be alert to ensure that the dynamics and demands of the remote process do not impinge upon the fundamental principles.  In particular, experience shows that remote hearings place additional, and in some cases, considerable burdens on the participants.  The court must therefore seek to ensure that it does not become overloaded and must make a hard-headed distinction between those decisions that must be prioritised and those that must unfortunately wait until proper time is available.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In our judgement, the events in the present case illustrate why this approach is necessary.  The problems here arose because the local authority changed its care plan in the middle of a remote hearing and because an application that was not urgent was treated as if it was.  We will briefly summarise the background, and then describe the course of the proceedings in more detail.   </p>

Their mother is a drug user with a criminal record and their father, who died in 2019, was also a prolific drug user.  When they were young, the local authority took care proceedings and in July 2013, their maternal grandmother, who is now aged 65, became their special guardian.  The children were then aged 5 and 2, and she had been their primary carer for a long time, indeed for all of Sam’s life.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">It has not been plain sailing since then.  The local authority has continued to be involved and has provided a range of support to the family.  There have nonetheless been concerns about the stability of the placement, the grandmother’s ability to cope, interventions by the children’s mother, and the actions of a maternal aunt and uncle.</p>

He is also a drug user and has on a number of occasions behaved in a highly inappropriate way towards the children.  Allegations have from time to time been made by Samantha of physical abuse by the uncle and the aunt.  The grandmother did not support these allegations.  In September 2019, the children were placed on child protection plans, particularly because of the risk posed by the uncle to their physical and emotional wellbeing.  The grandmother continued to work with the local authority, including successfully attending a course on attachment in January/February 2020.  In February, she reported that Samantha’s behaviour was deteriorating and that she was struggling to manage it.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Up to this point, the picture is one of a family under some strain, with Samantha’s situation causing more concern than Sam’s.  Although there had been allegations of physical abuse, the local authority’s main concern was for the children’s emotional well-being.     </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The catalyst for the proceedings was an incident on 20 March, when police were called to the home, where Samantha was outside, screaming.  She said that she had been hit by her aunt; the grandmother and aunt denied it and described Samantha’s behaviour as having been particularly challenging since the family had been in confinement.  Samantha was taken into police protection and placed in foster care.  Sam was not directly involved in the incident and he remained with his grandmother.  On 23 March, she signed a section 20 agreement for Samantha.  However, on 27 March, she told social services that she would like Samantha back at some stage.  On Wednesday 1 April, she said she wanted her to return by Friday 3 April. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The local authority at that point did not consider that Samantha should return home, nor that Sam should leave.  On 2 April, it acted decisively by issuing proceedings for an interim care order in Samantha’s case and an interim supervision order in Sam’s.  Its application drew attention to the grandmother’s request for Samantha’s return the following day and asked for a hearing within 24 hours.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Accompanying the application was a substantial amount of documentation arising from the local authority’s knowledge of the family down the years, including a fully pleaded interim threshold document, a comprehensive chronology (16 pages) and a thorough template statement from the children’s social worker (34 pages).  Of note, this described a close relationship between the children and their grandmother, with plenty of mutual love and affection being shown.  Given the local authority’s position, the removal of Sam from home did not even feature in the social work analysis as a realistic option, let alone a preferred one.  The case for an interim supervision order was put in this way:</p>

That is critical in a case of genuine urgency, but it does place considerable pressure on the parties.  None of the normal preproceedings stages, whereby a family has access to legal advice, can happen.  No evidence in response can realistically be filed.  Here, as we shall show, the request for an urgent hearing, designed to meet the situation that had then arisen regarding Samantha, came to have unexpected consequences for Sam.   </p>

Sixthly, subsection (8) makes it absolutely clear that a parent with parental responsibility may remove the child from accommodation provided or arranged by a local authority at any time. There is no need to give notice, in writing or otherwise. The only caveat, as Munby J said in R (G) v Nottingham City Council (para 22 above), is the right of anyone to take necessary steps to protect a person, including a child, from being physically harmed by another: for example, if a parent turned up drunk demanding to drive the child home. In such circumstances the people caring for the child would have the power (under section 3(5) of the 1989 Act) to do what is reasonable in all the circumstances for the purpose of safeguarding or promoting the child’s welfare (see para 18 above).  </p>

These can, of course, only be obtained if there is reasonable cause to believe that the child will otherwise suffer significant harm.” </p>

By the time the Recorder started to hear his first case, he had already been working for at least three hours.  The hearings took place by telephone, as was then the practice in that court, with the Recorder at his home address and the other participants at various locations elsewhere.  He was able to contact a member of the court staff by phone or text to coordinate the start and finish of hearings.  The first case was heard between 10.21 and 11.43.  During the course of the morning the Recorder received a continuous stream of bundles, documents and position statements in the other two cases.  These included the Guardian’s position statement in the present case at 11.01.  The significance of that document was that it led to a change in the local authority’s care plan in respect of Sam, which it announced to the other parties at around 11.30.   </p>

Most concerningly, the children seem to be blamed when their behaviours are likely to be expression of the experiences they had, and/or additional needs that their care giver/s should be attuned to identify and respond to; [Samantha] being compared to her mother in derogatory manner and [Sam] being called names are particularly emotionally abusive behaviours in the context of the children’s own experiences.  </p>

It appears as if the maternal uncle continues to be a frequent visitor to the family home and is reported to have been involved with the police 3 times this year in relation to drug offences [C25].

It is not clear how his safety will be monitored as there are very little, if any, direct social work visits being undertaken at present; the presenting concerns cannot be effectively monitored via virtual visits. Schools often provide an oversight into a child’s wellbeing - however the schools are now closed and it is not known when they will re-open; they also often provide an outlet for both children and carers; being constantly at home can greatly escalate the current risks for [Sam], and limits his ability to reach out to professionals or safe adults outside the house for help. The Guardian is concerned that given these exceptional times it will be very difficult to monitor [Sam]’s safety.  </p>

[Sam] has already stated that his family matters are confidential and it is therefore not clear whether he will actually disclose any concerns should they arise at the home; [Sam] may also internalise that violence is acceptable and risk perpetrating violence himself, or take matters in his own hands to protect himself or others, such as, for example, his grandmother if she is also subject to abuse from the uncle.

If the Court agrees that an interim care order is appropriate for both children, the Guardian would strongly prefer for both children to be placed in the same foster placement, if possible. A together and apart assessment to look at the sibling relationship and potential split arrangements for them in the longer term needs to be considered. There are also indication of severely distressed behaviours from the children, emotional regulation and ongoing attachment difficulties, which may require psychological assessment to ensure that the parenting they need to meet their individual needs is fully considered in care planning.” </p>

The court relies on Guardians to be independent in promoting and protecting the interests of the children in the litigation, and they may take, and not infrequently do take, a different position to that of the local authority.  We acknowledge that, as commonly happens when an interim application is made at the outset of proceedings, this Guardian was having to absorb a mass of information at very short notice.  She had no time to make inquiries, beyond reading the papers and having one conversation with the social worker at about 9 am.  In cases of real urgency that may be unavoidable, but in this case it is, to put it at its lowest, surprising that she and the children’s solicitor felt it appropriate to make such a bold recommendation from such a low knowledge base.  Neither of them had met or spoken to Sam or to his grandmother or his grandmother’s solicitor, nor did they have any information at all coming from that quarter.  We also note that the Guardian was not available for the hearing in the afternoon.  Her solicitor was said to be fully instructed, but the Guardian’s absence left her unaware of such arguments as Mr Lue was able to put to the court in response to her recommendation and deprived her of the opportunity to reflect.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">We are also troubled by the lack of any balanced analysis in the case for removal that was put by the Guardian, and also by the local authority.  There is no reference to the emotional detriment to Sam in being removed from his only parental figure without notice or preparation.  There was no reference to Sam’s wishes and feelings about immediate removal, nor any reminder to the court that these were not known.  There was no credible explanation for why there had to be an emergency decision.  Mr Squire fairly accepted at no less than three points in his appeal skeleton argument that the outcome was “harsh”, though he defended it as not being unfair or unjust.  When we asked him about the above matters he described them as a consequence of this being “an emergency application” in which child protection imperatives had to prevail.  We reject that argument.  The pressured way in which the proceedings developed may have felt like an emergency to the professionals, but it was not an emergency for Sam.  We also firmly dismiss the proposition that the current ‘lockdown’ provides a reason for the removal of a child where none would otherwise exist.  It is possible to envisage a case at the margins where face-to-face supervision is so important that a child would not be safe without it, but this case and most others like it fall nowhere near that category.  Our overall <span style="font-weight:bold">observation</span> in this respect is that unfortunately Sam’s voice was not heard at a critical moment in the proceedings and his interests were not protected by his Guardian, whose recommendation set in train the sequence of events that followed. </p>

The only basis for the volte-face was the intervention of the Guardian.  We asked Mr Melsa, for the local authority, about the process leading to the changed decision, which came to him in an email instruction when he was in the middle of an advocates’ meeting.  We learned that the decision was undocumented and the change of plan unreasoned.  There was no evidence about it and no care plan to underpin it.  Not surprisingly that led to confusion.  At 12.48 the other parties were informed that removal would not take place until Monday 6 April because Sam had a cough that might be virus-related.  The social workers then tried to investigate testing, but were unsuccessful.  Despite that, at 13.43 the local authority announced that its plan was again one for immediate removal.   </p>

A local authority must always be responsive to the stance of a Children’s Guardian, but there was no good reason for the plan to have been changed in this case.  The consequence was to wrong-foot the grandmother, with whom it was going to share parental responsibility for Samantha, at least in the short term, without any discussion with her.  Mr Lue was, as he put it, unable to understand the decisionmaking process and was having to take instructions by telephone on a constantly moving picture.  He gave us examples of matters concerning Sam in the social work statement and the Guardian’s position statement that he has since the hearing been able to establish that the grandmother simply did not accept (for example concerning the arrival of the uncle on 20 March).  We were entirely convinced by his account of feeling, in his words, hopelessly unable to represent his client in the way he would normally be able to do.  It says a lot that throughout the whole process not one page emanating from the grandmother could be placed before the court.  She had no opportunity to file evidence in relation to this serious matter, nor was Mr Lue in a position to marshal a position statement.  In cases of exceptional urgency that may be unavoidable, but here it was unfair. </p>

The hearing began promisingly, with the Recorder pressing Mr Melsa to point to evidence justifying Sam’s immediate removal.  Mr Lue then made submissions referring to his application for an adjournment, to the shifting sands of the local authority’s case and to the inadequacy of the evidence as a justification for immediate removal.  He was asked by the Recorder whether the grandmother would be prepared to remove the aunt from the home, to which the reply was that this could and should be investigated, but that he had not been asked and had no instructions.  Mr Lue argued that Sam was in no danger.  The grandmother had been his primary carer for his whole life and removal would have a serious impact on him.  His position was distinct from Samantha’s.  The Guardian’s emphasis on the health crisis was misconceived.  We consider those submissions to have been well-made. </p>

She expressed concern that the grandmother has not been open and honest.  The Guardian believed that both the children needed to be in a place of safety while assessments were ongoing.

Obviously, as a matter of professional courtesy, I am responsive to that because justice features very largely in these cases brought on at short notice where only one side has had the chance to submit evidence.  But the law is the law and the law requires judges make decisions about whether the threshold is established on an interim basis on the basis of reasonable grounds for believing.

But the reality of the situation is that there is an overwhelming body of information available to me in the local authority’s evidence (which I have not been able to spend several days reading).  When I put that against what have been the contested issues in the debate in the past, it leads me to the conclusion that as of the time this application was mounted there were very substantial grounds for believing that these children and each of them would be at risk of significant harm if they were to remain in the care of the maternal grandmother.” </p>

It may be that the consequences are more serious for one child than another but all I am required to do is to consider whether there are reasonable grounds for believing that the section 31 grounds would be established.”  </p>

I am afraid in the evidence that has been put before me, (and I am making allowance for what Mr Lue was able to suggest to me would be contradicted or challenged), there is an overwhelming case for concluding there are reasonable grounds for believing that her parenting and her protective role in relation to these children has been deficient on multiple occasions. </p>

She is obviously a different personality to  [Sam].  There are a number of things though about the overall conduct of the grandmother and those of her children who have been at home to make me believe that the grandmother on the face of what I have seen so far has lacked and lacks a certain amount of grip in supervising young children of this age and, in the circumstances as they have built up over time, I am satisfied that there are more than reasonable grounds for believing that the section 38 test is satisfied.” </p>

I have to proceed on the basis that delay in resolving the need for protection by virtue of an order or a decision one way or another would be likely to prejudice the children’s welfare.  I have to apply the individual welfare factors of the welfare checklist and I have to make sure I do not make any order unless satisfied it is better to do so than to make no order.  The key question for me, whichever of the many dozens of cases that have outlined the test on interim care orders, is whether the children’s individual welfare, (and I do not deal with them as a package deal), demands that they be held back from or removed from the grandmother’s care? Does each of their welfare individually demand that that decision is made straight away to protect them?   </p>

I have paid very careful attention to the position statements that have been put in front of me.  I found the children’s guardian’s analysis of this to be particularly helpful.  She is not part of the team on the local authority’s side.  She has looked at it independently.  I am not bound to accept her analysis and I think there are certain respects in which I would have expressed myself slightly differently. She says at para.25 she is very concerned with respect to the safety of both children given their cumulative experiences and the lack of emotional stability they seem to have experienced under a special guardianship order. If I had not seen that phrase in a position statement I might very well have been using those words myself.  I think the concerns as she puts them are well phrased… So that will help anyone who is wondering about this afterwards to understand what the level of my concern is. </p>

I repeat what I said earlier on.  I do not consider them as a package unit.  The fact that the need for an ICO was proved in relation to one child does not mean that it is proved in relation to the other child.  I have borne in mind the differences between some of what has happened to [Samantha]  and what has happened about [Sam].  But I have to bear in mind that what has happened in relation to both [Sam] and his sister, [Samantha], is relevant to the type of parental operative or the type of parental figure that the grandmother is.  It cannot be expected that, in making a decision about individual children, a judge would ignore how that person behaves in relation to two children who are only separated in age by about two years.  Her lack of sufficient parenting, if I can put it neutrally, in relation to [Samantha] is relevant to [Sam] and vice versa.   </p>

The law, accurately cited in the Guardian’s position statement for the hearing itself, emphasises that removal of a child from a parent at an interim stage of proceedings is a particularly sharp interference with their right to respect for family life, and that a plan for immediate separation is therefore only to be sanctioned by the court where the child's physical safety or psychological or emotional welfare makes it necessary and where the length and likely consequences of the separation are a proportionate response to the risks that would arise if it did not occur: see e.g. <span style="font-style:italic">C (A Child) (Interim Separation)</span> [2019] EWCA Civ 1998.   </p>

Our <span style="font-weight:bold">observation</span> is that this was a case where the central concern related to emotional harm stretching back for years.  On the information then before the court it could not in our view be plausibly argued that something had now happened to make Sam's removal that evening necessary.  The circumstances in which Samantha had been taken into foster care showed the need for Sam's situation to be carefully assessed. The evidence did not remotely justify his peremptory removal and there is nothing in the judgment that is capable of persuading us that it did.  Our further <span style="font-weight:bold">observation </span>is that, no doubt partly because of the exigencies of the remote process, there was a loss of perspective in relation to the need for an immediate decision about Sam.  This was a classic case for an adjournment so that a considered decision could be taken about removal, if indeed that option was going to be pursued after reflection.  An adjournment would have enabled the parties and the court to have all the necessary information.   As it was, crucial information was lacking and its absence was overlooked by the court. </p>

If the application for an interim care order for Sam had been adjourned, it may well have been possible for the adjourned hearing to have been conducted over a video link and that single factor might, of itself, have justified an adjournment in a case which, in our view, plainly was not so urgent that it needed to be determined on 3 April.  Whilst it may have been the case that the provision of video facilities was limited at the particular court at the time of the hearing, it is now the case that the option of using a video link is much more widely available.  Where that is the case, a video link is likely at this time to be the default option in urgent cases.  </p>
