Schedule 5, para. 1, contains an express time limit of 20 working days from the legal completion of the sale of the 300<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> Unit.  This time limit has been specified so that the sales revenue may be calculated with certainty.  It is one fixed point in time.  Therefore, it only takes place at the time of the disposal of the legal interest, which would be a disposition of a freehold interest or a leasehold interest of more than seven years (as per section 27(2)(b) of the Land Registration Act 2002).  </p>

He points out that the planning permission granted in 2008 included permission for the development of flats.  As it would have been unlikely that the flats would have been disposed of by “flying freeholds”, it should have been clear that they would have been disposed of by long leasehold.

That clause states that “any dispute or difference between the parties shall be submitted for the determination of an expert”.  The appellants submit that they were bound to submit all disputes for the determination of an expert.

Mr Wright submits that the appellants entered into the expert determination process by choice, as the planning obligation did not require them to submit a matter of law to the expert for determination.  The entering into of the determination and the communication between the appellants and the expert created a common assumption that the determination of the expert would be final and binding upon the parties.  Estoppel by convention therefore prevents the appellants from now treating the determination of the expert as merely advisory. </p>

In particular, the natural meaning of para. 2 of Schedule 5 is, in my view, that that is the provision which imposes an obligation on how much is to be payable by way of the Affordable Housing Contribution etc. following completion of each development phase.  That paragraph uses the phrase “the total amount payable (if any)” of those contributions.  It also sets out a mathematical formula.  True it is, as Mr Horne reminded us at the hearing, that there is a cap imposed but that does not detract from the fact that there is to be an equal share in principle (subject to that cap) of the profits which the developer makes from disposal of the units in each phase above a fixed baseline.   </p>

As I have said, the exact baseline figure does not matter.  What does matter is that the parties agreed that there should be a baseline figure and that, above that figure, the profits should be shared between them, subject to a cap. </p>

That information has to be provided within 20 working days of the legal completion of the sale of the 300<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th </span>unit, the 600<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> unit etc.  That term is not a contradiction of, nor is it inconsistent with, para. 2.

It is not to be read simply by reference to a layperson’s understanding of the English language.  It is to be read by reference to fundamental legal concepts, in particular concepts of the law of property.  As lawyers know, but lay people may not necessarily know, legal completion and sales of property are not actually of physical bricks and mortar.  What is sold and conveyed is a legal interest in property.  There can be different types of legal interest, for example a freehold or a leasehold.  If only the leasehold is disposed of, the freehold reversionary interest will remain in another person.  It is also well-known that there can be a market in the sale of freehold reversionary interests and in ground rents.   </p>

Equally, the parties would have been aware that some of the properties to be sold were going to be houses and not flats.  It would be very common for the disposal of a house to be way of a sale of the freehold interest, so the parties can reasonably be taken to have had that in contemplation as well.  If in the event some or all of the houses were sold by way of leasehold the parties can reasonably be taken to have contemplated the possible sale in the future of the freehold reversionary interests. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Finally, sight must not be lost of the underlying purpose of Schedule 5.  Although it is convenient to use the phrase “commercial common sense”, that is because most of the authorities on this subject have concerned commercial transactions.  It is important to note in the present context that this was not a commercial transaction in the traditional sense.  This was a planning obligation pursuant to the statutory functions of a local planning authority.  A local authority has obligations not only to its council taxpayers generally but to members of the public who may be affected by proposed developments.  Schedule 5 was expressly designed to achieve certain contributions towards affordable housing, education etc. in the local community.  If the appellants’ interpretation were correct, it seems to me that full effect would not be given to that underlying purpose of Schedule 5.  This is because members of the public would not in fact receive a 50% share of their entitlement to the profits concerned.   </p>

The effect of an estoppel by convention is to preclude a party from denying the assumed facts or law if it would be unjust to allow him to go back on the assumption …” </p>

This is because the point was inherently a point of law.   </p>

That made it clear, at para. 14, that the matter was being referred to the expert pursuant to clause 10 of the April 2013 agreement.   As Mr Horne submitted before us, there can be no room for an estoppel by convention to arise in this case outside the agreement, for the simple reason that the parties were not acting outside the agreement at all but were acting pursuant to that agreement. </p>

I do not accept that interpretation of clause 10.  In my view, it plainly has the effect that all disputes must be referred to an expert but that the ensuing determination is not necessarily conclusive and binding.  It will be so except where there is a manifest error or there is an error of law.  It was common ground between the parties before us that the phrase “on a matter of law” must mean in this context where there has been an error of law by the expert.   </p>

There can be many reasons why parties may agree that they will be under an obligation to refer a dispute to an expert rather than going immediately to court.  They may consider that it would be in their interests for reasons of cost, timing or convenience.  They may also agree that, ultimately, if it is necessary to do so, they should be able to refer a question of law to the ordinary courts for authoritative resolution.  There is nothing inconsistent between those two positions being taken by the parties.  If that is what they have agreed, the court’s duty is to give effect to their agreement, not to rewrite it. </p>
