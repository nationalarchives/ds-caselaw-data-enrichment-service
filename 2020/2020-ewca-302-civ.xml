	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">This appeal concerns a development site on the outskirts of Hemsworth, near Pontefract in West Yorkshire (“Site A”). On 16 December 2016, the first respondent directed that the proposed development of Site A was not EIA development within the meaning of regulation 2 of the Town and Country Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2011 (“the 2011 Regulations”) such that an environmental statement to assess the environmental effects of the development was not required. The appellant’s application for judicial review of that screening direction was refused by Mrs Justice Lang DBE (“the judge”) on 18 December 2018 ([2018] EWHC 3485 (Admin)). The appellant appeals against that decision with leave of Lindblom LJ. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The arguments on appeal ranged far and wide and included, somewhat surprisingly, a close review of the evidence before the first respondent and, subsequently, the judge. It was difficult to discern any substantial points of principle from any of this: speaking for myself, I wondered if the most important point to arise from the appeal hearing was the need to ensure that appeals in cases of this kind do not become another weary trot around a well-worn course.  </p>

Having set out the issues raised by the appellant in Section 6, I then go on to deal with each Ground of Appeal in Sections 7 - 11. There is a short summary of my conclusions at Section 12. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">At the relevant time, the 2011 Regulations prescribed the procedures to be followed when planning permission was sought for what might be “EIA Development”. That is defined in Regulation 2(1) as being either “Schedule 1 development” or “Schedule 2 development likely to have significant effects on the environment by virtue of factors such as its nature, size or location”. It is common ground that this was not Schedule 1 development. It is also common ground that this was Schedule 2 development because, although it was for 150 dwellings (and Schedule 2 only applies to developments in excess of that number), Site A was greater than 5 hectares. Despite the fact that the part of Site A which was being developed was less than 5 hectares (because of the retention of a belt of trees to the south), Schedule 2 still applied. These factors (namely the fact that the number of dwellings was just below the applicable minimum and the size of Site A was only just above the applicable minimum because of the land that was not being developed) explain the repeated references in the screening opinion and screening direction under review to the comparatively small scale of this proposed residential development compared to those which more usually arise under Schedule 2. In that regard, I also note that Schedule 2 is primarily concerned with the extraction, energy and chemical industries, and infrastructure projects such as shopping centres and car parks. </p>

That is clear from European and national authority, including the Commission Guidance at B3.4.1. The criteria to be applied are set out in the Regulations and judgment is to be exercised by planning authorities focusing on the circumstances of the particular case. The Commission Guidance recognises the value of national guidance and planning authorities have a degree of freedom in appraising whether or not a particular project must be made subject to an assessment. Only if there is a manifest error of assessment will the ECJ intervene (<span style="font-style:italic">Commission v UK</span>). The decision maker must have regard to the precautionary principle and to the degree of uncertainty, as to environmental impact, at the date of the decision. Depending on the information available, the decision maker may or may not be able to make a judgment as to the likelihood of significant effects on the environment. There may be cases where the uncertainties are such that a negative decision cannot be taken.

It is also very similar to the submission made unsuccessfully in <span style="font-style:italic">Loader</span>’s case that a full EIA process is required in all cases where the effect would influence the development consent decision.

Having dealt with those points I can return to the substance of the argument, which is that the planning officer failed to demonstrate that she had considered the likely effect of the development in relation to traffic movements, the landscape and noise or, if she had, to explain why an EIA was not required in this case. When considering a submission of this kind I think it important to bear in mind the nature of what is involved in giving a screening opinion. It is not intended to involve a detailed assessment of factors relevant to the grant of planning permission; that comes later and will ordinarily include an assessment of environmental factors, among others. Nor does it involve a full assessment of any identifiable environmental effects. It involves only a decision, almost inevitably on the basis of less than complete information, whether an EIA needs to be undertaken at all. I think it important, therefore, that the court should not impose too high a burden on planning authorities in relation to what is no more than a procedure intended to identify the relatively small number of cases in which the development is likely to have significant effects on the environment, hence the term "screening opinion".”  In the same case, Mummery LJ said: </p>

This view is supported in the cases to which I have referred, notably, for example, in <span style="font-style:italic">Bateman</span> (see paragraph 24 above). Conjecture about future development on other sites that might or might not act with the development in question to produce indirect, secondary or cumulative effects is not in the screening decision-maker's remit. I do not think the precautionary approach extends to that. And when it is suggested in a claim for judicial review that a screening decision was deficient because some potential cumulative effect was left out, it is not enough for a claimant simply to point to other developments in the locality that have been or might be approved, and to leave it to the court to work out whether any aggregate effects were unlikely to be significant. Unless it is obvious that relevant and potentially significant effects on the environment have been overlooked, the court will need some objective evidence to show this was so. It will need to be satisfied that the authority responsible for the screening decision was aware, or ought to have been, of the potential cumulative effects; that the screening opinion could not reasonably have been negative if those potential effects had been considered; and that this was, or should have been, apparent to the authority at the time.” </p>

The proposed residential development of the site will result in additional traffic and there will be an impact in respect of traffic generation, access, servicing, parking and highway safety issues associated with the development (in both its construction phase and once completed). It is noted that, should the proposal for residential development not come forward, bringing the site back into use as a sports facility would have an impact in terms of additional traffic associated with the use of the site. It is considered, given the scale of development proposed, that the impacts from the complete development would not be likely to have significant effects on the environment. The construction phase will result in additional traffic from construction workers and particularly from large construction vehicles associated with deliveries and removal of any wastes and/or contaminated materials from the site. Although the current proposal would result in additional traffic movements and other associate impacts, it is considered, given the limited site area and scale of development, that the traffic and other associated issues will not be likely to have a significant impact on the environment. </p>

More specifically in relation to land contamination resulting from past land use, the Council is of the view that issues can be controlled through condition. The Council has also considered cumulative impact, and is of the view that given the nature of the proposal i.e. residential dwellings in the wider environmental context of an urban area, the application is not likely to result in significant effects. The Secretary of State notes the Council's recent screening opinion for the proposed development, and for the information supplied with the application, and has had due regard to Planning Practice Guidance on assessing environmental impacts. Whilst there are land contamination issues on the application site, this has been investigated and measures/mitigations are within supporting information to the proposal, and the Council has referred to conditions should the proposal receive permission. In view of this, the Secretary of State considers this issue does not result in significant effect, over and above that which is normally present at an existing developed site. </p>

Taken at its highest, such an approach undermines the entire process of judicial review. It runs the risk that the court will be asked to conduct a kind of rolling review, in which nothing is ever finalised or settled, and it does not matter what information was available at the time the decision was taken. This serves only to encourage the all-too-prevalent attitude that, in judicial review applications, it is always possible to ‘have another go’. The parties’ references to the Reports noted in the preceding paragraph were designed to do exactly that, with each side seeking to rely on particular paragraphs in support of their submissions about the rationality (or otherwise) of a decision made without sight of any of them. </p>

This most often occurs when a respondent argues that, even if there was a technicality which rendered the original decision unlawful, it should not be quashed or set aside because subsequent events have shown it to be the right decision on the merits. It was on that basis, for example, that the first respondent originally sought to rely on the REC report. In my view, this process needs to be tightly controlled; otherwise the sort of risks identified in the previous paragraph will eventuate (because the parties so often try and rely on such material for any purpose, even if strictly the evidence goes to a fall-back argument only).

The reason for discounting it is because there was no reference to this Report (whether express or implied) in either the second respondent’s screening opinion, or the first respondent’s subsequent screening decision. Whilst Ms Patry may be right to say that the second respondent could be assumed to be aware of the contents of this Report, there was no evidence that it played any part in the particular decision-making process under review.

Obviously, a screening opinion or direction can only be based upon the information known to the assessor at the relevant time, and that may be incomplete. In this case, the Defendant received a substantial amount of information from Dr Stookes of Richard Buxton in September 2016, and from the Council, whose screening opinion was dated 21 November 2016. Unsurprisingly, the application for planning permission for a nursing home about 500 metres from the Site (referred to as Site G) was not included, since the application was made as late as 18 November 2016. Planning permission was granted on 18 April 2017, which post-dated the Council's screening opinion and the Defendant's screening direction. I do not consider that the Defendant can be fairly criticised for not referring to it, and absent any unlawfulness, the screening direction must stand. Generally, in cases where an unforeseen subsequent development proposal may alter the assessment of cumulative environmental effects, the solution is for there to be a further screening and/or for the cumulative environmental effects to be considered in the course of the application for planning permission for the subsequent development proposal…  </p>

The Defendant's written statement summarised the Defendant's assessment and conclusions, expressly referring to air quality, traffic, and cumulative impact. He concluded, in the final paragraph, that there would be an impact from an increase in traffic in the locality. He took into account, as he was entitled to do, that the Site was not in a designated area nor was it an AQMA. He concluded that the impact from the increase in traffic would not have significant environmental effects. In reaching that key conclusion, which the Claimant overlooked, he took into account that this was an urban development proposal on an existing developed site, which he was entitled to do. In my view, any such assessment can properly have regard to both the location of the site and the existing development on site (if any), when considering the environmental impact of a new development. For example, the outcome of the assessment could be affected if the proposal was for development on a previously undeveloped site situated in open countryside. It follows that I disagree with the Claimant's submission that the Defendant concluded that assessment was not required because the increase was not significant for an urban area. That is a misreading of the decision, in my view.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">As a starting point, I note that in her judgment at [34], the judge described the appellant’s approach on Ground 1 as “unduly forensic and nit-picking”. Despite the habitual skill and charm of Mr Willers’ advocacy, I consider that the same description could be applied to his submissions on appeal. He spent a good deal of time identifying particular paragraphs in particular documents and seeking to point out the potential gaps and omissions within them. Some of this came down to an alleged failure to cross-reference properly. In my judgment, that is not a proper approach to a judicial review application of this sort, let alone an appeal. Furthermore, I consider that the sections of the relevant documents which I have set out in paragraphs 20 – 23 above make plain that, contrary to the appellant’s submissions, there was an evidential basis for concluding that there was no likely significant effect on the environment. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Willers’ principal submission on Ground 1 came to this. Site A was close to the AQMA. It was inevitable that, if Site A was developed, there would be more traffic entering the AQMA. In those circumstances, the proximity to the AQMA was a particular characteristic of Site A which made it irrational to conclude that the development was not likely to have a significant effect on the environment, without at least obtaining further information. As he put it at one stage of his oral submissions, “it is all about the AQMA”. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The first point to note is that this was, on any view, a routine development of residential houses. There was nothing unusual about the proposed development. Indeed, as I have said, the starting point must be that, because this was not a development for more than 150 dwellings, and the actual amount of land being developed was 4.6 hectares, the proposed development of Site A was only just big enough to be within Schedule 2 in any event. I consider that this was an important element of the screening direction, which was repeatedly encapsulated by both the first and second respondents in the shorthand phrase “the limited site area and scale of development”. </p>

The first respondent explained, step by step, how he had reached his conclusion.    </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Fourthly, the first and second respondents were also aware that the increased traffic from the completed development of Site A would have an effect on the AQMA. This can be seen in a number of places, but perhaps most obviously in paragraph 3.23 of the screening opinion, and the consideration of Question 8 in the screening analysis, where there are express references to the development leading to an increase in traffic at the junction of Cross Hill in the centre of Hemsworth, where the AQMA was located. But there is no evidence that this increased traffic would be likely to have a significant effect on the environment: on the contrary, paragraph 3.20 of the screening opinion states that it would not. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Given all of those factors, it is idle to suggest that in some way the first and second respondents, as experienced and knowledgeable planning officials, were not well aware of the likely impact of the traffic from Site A (following its development) on the AQMA. In the exercise of their planning judgment, they concluded that notwithstanding this information, this was not likely to have a significant effect on the environment. In my view, that was a matter for their planning judgment and therefore a matter for them. Contrary to Mr Willers’ submission, this was not a case that was remotely close to the extreme facts in <span style="font-style:italic">Bateman: </span>see paragraph 14 above.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Willers’ related submission was to ask rhetorically: if the first respondent had decided that there would be a likely effect, but that it was not significant, where was the evidence on which he relied in arriving at that conclusion? This shaded into a suggestion that the reasons for the screening direction were inadequate, because in explaining why any effect was not likely to be significant, the direction (as he put it) “does not go far enough.”   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I disagree. The authorities to which I have referred make clear that the first and second respondents were not required to set out in detail all the information and statistics, of which they would have been well aware, and which might be relevant to the question of air pollution. I am thinking in particular of the published data as to trip frequency, standard emissions and exceedances, and the like. The first and second respondents must be taken to be familiar with all such information. Armed with that knowledge, they concluded that, in this case, the increase in traffic was not likely to have a significant effect on the environment. This was because of the comparatively modest scale of the development. That was a matter for them, and not something that had to be justified by reference to lengthy written reasons in respect of concepts, formulae and other matters which were very familiar to them.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Having regard to Mr Willers’ rhetorical question, it is not unreasonable to turn it back on the appellant and ask what the evidence was that might suggest that this comparatively modest residential development was likely to have a significant effect on the environment. Mr Willers appeared to accept that there was no such evidence, but suggested that there did not need to be any. He submitted that there was an automatic assumption to that effect, given the proximity of Site A to the AQMA. Indeed, he went so far as to say that, in respect of any development of over 5 hectares close to an AQMA, it was irrational to conclude that it was not likely to have a significant effect.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In my view, that simply does not follow. The effect on the environment, and whether it is likely to be significant or not, must depend on the facts of each case, and in particular the nature, scale and size of the development, its proximity to the AQMA and the like. It is a sliding scale, or spectrum. It cannot be right that, as a matter of principle, every development close to an AQMA should automatically be regarded as likely to have a significant effect on the environment, without any specific evidence to point to that conclusion. In my judgment, proximity to an AQMA is not some sort of trump card which will always give rise to the need for an EIA. </p>

But that would just bring the debate back to the lawfulness or otherwise of the underlying decision and, for the reasons I have given, I do not doubt the lawfulness of the screening decision in this case.  </p>

It was formerly a brickworks quarry which was subsequently used for landfill with no restoration procedures. At one point the recreation ground had a small athletics track and associated buildings on it. Site A therefore fell within the NPPF 2012 definition of previously developed land (“PDL”) and, since none of the exclusions from the definition of PDL could apply to Site A, it was rightly considered to be an existing developed site. </p>

As noted in paragraph 24 above, the challenge originally raised questions about the contaminated nature of the land. That arose directly out of the landfilling operations and the previous use(s) of Site A. To suggest that Site A is somehow both contaminated and a greenfield site is a logical impossibility.  </p>

The screening direction would have been the same, whether Site A was so designated or not. Site A was still the same distance away from the AQMA. It was still not in the open countryside away from all forms of traffic. Accordingly, its designation was irrelevant to the screening direction of 16 December 2016, an argument from which Mr Willers did not demur. I would therefore reject Ground 5.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I respectfully agree with that conclusion. Nowhere in the screening direction, or in the other documents which I have set out above, is there any sustainable suggestion that, in some way, the potential air pollution from the completed development of Site A was treated in a different way because it would occur in an urban environment, as opposed to a rural location. What the screening direction was doing was making plain that the pre-existing urban environment was part of the context in which the development was going to take place, and was therefore a relevant factor to be taken into account when considering whether the effect was likely to be significant or not. That was self-evidently the right approach. To put the point another way: Site A would not be generating traffic for the first time, and there were existing and future urban developments around it which also continued to generate traffic. It was in that context that the likelihood of significant environmental effects was considered and rejected. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In the context of Ground 5, I had wondered whether there was a slightly different point available to the appellant, to the effect that, because of the reference to the likelihood of effects “above that which any urban development proposal on an existing development site would normally present,” the first respondent was applying the wrong test; that he was suggesting that the applicable test was whether the likely effect of the development would be <span style="font-style:italic">more</span> significant than that which would normally be expected of an urban development on an existing development site. But Mr Willers did not whole-heartedly embrace that argument, and I have concluded that there is nothing in the point. It is not a fair reading of the screening decision and the other documentation, when taken as a whole. The reference to “over and above that which any urban development on an existing development site would normally present” was a matter of background/context. It was not seeking to change the test or to apply a test to an urban area that would not be applicable to a proposed development in a nonurban area or of an existing undeveloped site.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Finally, in relation to both the potential arguments about these two sentences raised under Ground 5 and discussed above, I am mindful of the clear guidance given to judges considering judicial review cases against over-analysing decisions and applying too strict an interpretation to individual words and phrases, and the need to approach the decision as a whole: see for example Lord Bingham in <span style="font-style:italic">Clarke Holmes v Secretary of State for the Environment </span>[1993] 66 P &amp; CR 263 at 271 and Hoffmann LJ<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>in <span style="font-style:italic">South Somerset District Council v Secretary of State for the Environment </span>[1993] 66 P &amp; CR 83 at 84.
