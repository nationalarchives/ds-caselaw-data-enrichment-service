Planning permission was applied for on 19 December 1966 by Mr John Madin and was granted by Merioneth County Council, which was at that time the local planning authority, on 10 January 1967 (“the 1967 permission”).  The relevant application, which incorporated a plan referred to as the “Master Plan”, was for the development of 401 dwellings.  The proposed siting for each of the dwellings was shown on the plan along with a proposed internal road network.  The Master Plan detailed five key types of dwelling: Type A (3-bedroom semi or terrace); Type B (2bedroom bungalow); Type C (2-bedroom flat); Type D (3-bedroom and study bedroom); and Type E (2-bedroom and study bedroom).  The 1967 permission was granted subject to one condition, that water supply be agreed before work commenced.  That condition does not give rise to any issue in the present appeal.  </p>

Nevertheless, what is submitted on behalf of the Appellant is that, as a matter of substance, the judgment of Drake J (and indeed the understanding of the local planning authority at the time) was that the subsequent permissions which were granted were in effect variations of the 1967 permission rather than additional permissions.  Certainly this is consistent with the conclusion reached by Drake J at page 20C of his judgment:  </p>

Thirdly, “the development permitted by the January 1967 Permission has begun; and that it may lawfully be completed at any time in the future”.  The fourth declaration concerned the satisfaction of the condition attached to the 1967 permission.  It is the third declaration that is of particular relevance to the present proceedings. </p>

Complaint is made that there is no reasoning given in the judgment to show that the Additional Permissions granted after 1987 should be considered differently from the ones before 1987.  If all the Additional Permissions were considered in this way, then the remainder of the Master Plan with the specific modifications which were granted could still be developed. </p>

In particular, at para. 17, Lord Sumption said that the phrase <span style="font-style:italic">res judicata</span> is “a portmanteau term which is used to describe a number of different legal principles with different juridical origins.”  The three particular principles which, it is common ground, potentially arise in the present case are the fourth, fifth and sixth as outlined by Lord Sumption.  The fourth was the doctrine of “issue estoppel”, that is where some issue which is necessarily common to both disputes has been decided on an earlier occasion and is binding on the parties.  The fifth principle was that based on <span style="font-style:italic">Henderson</span>, which precludes a party from raising in subsequent proceedings matters which were not, but could and should have been, raised in the earlier case.  Sixthly, Lord Sumption said, there is the more general procedural rule against abusive proceedings, which may be regarded as the policy underlying all of the above principles.   </p>

The main opinion was given by Lord Bridge of Harwich: see in particular page 289.  He concluded that in principle that doctrine does apply to adjudications in the field of public law.  This is subject to the important public law requirement that a statutory body cannot fetter its own freedom to perform its statutory duties or exercise its statutory powers.  As Lord Bridge explained, it is for this reason that there can be no such fetter which arises from an estoppel by representation.  I would add, in the light of more recent developments in public law, that there could not be any such fetter arising from the doctrine of legitimate expectation. </p>

At the time of the hearing before Drake J, only a few houses in the extreme south of the Site had been built, all of them pursuant to Additional Permissions. The evidence shows that the positions of some of those houses conflicts not only with their positions as shown on the Master Plan but also to some extent with the positions of estate roads and a footpath as shown on the Master Plan. More important, perhaps, is what has happened since 1987. This later development is all in the north-west part of the Site and, again, has all been carried out pursuant to Additional Permissions. The easternmost row of terraced houses in this later development has been built across the positions shown on the Master Plan for two distinct rows of houses and an access cul-de-sac between them. To the northwest of these houses, an estate road has been constructed along the line of part of a row of terraced houses shown on the Master Plan; the estate road also runs through the positions of another house and garden shown on the Master Plan. Other examples could be given here and are given in the first statement of Mr Jonathan Cawley (the Authority’s director of Planning and Land Management) of the knock-on effect of what has already been done on the ability to develop the rest of the Site in accordance with the January 1967 Permission. The result is that, although there are large parts of the development shown on the Master Plan that could be carried out in accordance with the Master Plan, there are other parts, particularly in the northwest of the Site, where further development will necessarily involve departure from what is shown on the Master Plan.” </p>

It was in that context, submits Mr Green, that the House of Lords held that a planning permission must be implemented “fully” and that a “holistic approach” must be taken.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">At the hearing before us there was an interesting debate about a point which ultimately this Court does not need to resolve on this appeal.  That issue is whether, in the circumstances envisaged by Hickinbottom J, all the development which has already taken place, apparently in accordance with the first grant of permission, is rendered unlawful simply by virtue of the fact that subsequent operations take place pursuant to another permission which is inconsistent with the first.  The phrase used by Hickinbottom J (“subsequent development”) might suggest that it is only the later development which would fall to be regarded as unlawful.  Mr Lewis contended that as a matter of principle it must be the whole of the development, including any development that has already taken place.  That would have the consequence that there could be enforcement action, and potentially criminal liability, in relation to the development that has already taken place, even though it was at the time apparently in accordance with a valid planning permission.  Mr Lewis submitted that in such circumstances it would be unlikely that enforcement action would be taken in practice.  Even if that is right, that would mean that whether or not enforcement action is taken would be a matter of discretion rather than law.  These are potentially important questions on which we did not receive full argument because they do not need to be decided on this appeal.  I would therefore prefer to express no view on them. </p>

Nevertheless, what is clear to us is that the development which has taken place consists not only of a different type of housing, with different alignment, but has included the construction of roads on the estate which would be clearly incompatible with the road layout as depicted on the Master Plan.  This does not necessarily mean that the Appellant is wrong to say that some at least of the individual units shown in the original Master Plan could still be erected on those parts of the Site which are not affected by the actual development which has taken place.  What it does tend to show, in my view, is that the Judge was entitled, having all the evidence before him, to reach the conclusion that events since 1987 have made it impossible now for the original planning permission of 1967 to be implemented. </p>

In that case, in 1952, planning permission was granted to develop a plot of land by the erection of 28 houses in a cul-de-sac layout.  Later the plaintiffs applied for permission to develop the same plot by building six detached houses, each on a plot fronting the main road.  Permission for this later development was granted in 1957 and two houses were built in accordance with it.  Later, however, the plaintiffs proposed to proceed in reliance on the earlier permission from 1952 by building the cul-de-sac and the 14 houses on the southern side of it.  That land was still undeveloped at that time.  The plaintiffs sought a declaration that the earlier permission was still effective and entitled them to carry out the proposed development on that part of the site where it could still take place.  Winn J concluded that the 1952 permission was not to be regarded in law as a permission to develop the plot as a whole but as a permission for any of the development comprised within it.   </p>

He said that Winn J had in that case construed the first planning permission as authorising the carrying out of a number of independent acts of development, and taking that view it naturally followed that the implementation of the second permission did not prevent the owner of the rest of the land from carrying out the independent acts of development authorised on such part of the site as remained under his control. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">This issue does squarely raise a potential question of issue estoppel.  This is because Mr Green submits that it was implicitly decided by Drake J in 1987 that the present case did indeed fall within the <span style="font-style:italic">Lucas</span> exception to the general requirement that a development must be carried out fully in accordance with the permission granted for it.  There are two difficulties with that submission.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">First, it is difficult to see how Drake J can be said to have decided this issue at all.  <span style="font-style:italic">Lucas</span> was certainly not mentioned in his judgment and it does not appear to have been raised before him.  It did not feature in the pleaded case between the parties before him nor, so far as one can now tell, in the way in which the case was argued before him at a six day trial. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly, <span style="font-style:italic">Lucas</span> was a highly exceptional case.  It has never been approved by an appellate court.  It has never been followed or applied, so far as counsel have been able to show us, by any court since.  Furthermore, it was described as being an exceptional case by Lord Widgery CJ (a judge with immense experience in the field of planning law) in <span style="font-style:italic">Pilkington</span>.  Both this Court and the House of Lords have had the opportunity in the many decades since <span style="font-style:italic">Lucas </span>to consider whether it should be regarded as setting out a general principle or not.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In my view, it would not be appropriate for this Court now to overrule <span style="font-style:italic">Lucas</span>.  In order to do so we would have to be satisfied that it was wrongly decided on its particular facts.  It is not possible to be satisfied of that, not least because we do not have the advantage of seeing the precise terms of the planning permission which was granted in that case.  It suffices to say that the case should be regarded as having been decided on its own facts.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">As Hickinbottom J observed in the case of <span style="font-style:italic">Singh</span>, at para. 25, it is conceivable that, on its proper construction, a particular planning permission does indeed grant permission for the development to take place in a series of independent acts, each of which is separately permitted by it.  I would merely add that, in my respectful view, that is unlikely to be the correct construction of a typical modern planning permission for the development of a large estate such as a housing estate.  Typically there would be not only many different residential units to be constructed in accordance with that scheme, there may well be other requirements concerning highways, landscaping, possibly even employment or educational uses, which are all stipulated as being an integral part of the overall scheme which is being permitted.  I doubt very much in those circumstances whether a developer could lawfully “pick and choose” different parts of the development to be implemented. </p>
