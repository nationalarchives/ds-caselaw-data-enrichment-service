The central allegation was of a deliberate conspiracy between Dunbar and APAM to cause the Administrators inadvertently to breach their duties to the company so as to harm the company and Ms Davey as its shareholder. Among the matters alleged were the production of documents designed to give a false impression of APAM’s incentives in the ultimate sale process, and the deliberate rigging of that sale process so as to result in a sale of Angel House to what was described as the ‘Preferred Bidder’ of Dunbar at an undervalue, so as to leave Ms Davey exposed to Dunbar on her personal Guarantee. </p>

The Court of Appeal, the judge said in paragraph 82, “should not be taken to have been intending to prescribe a rule to be followed in every subsequent case involving commercial funders” but was “simply setting out an approach that it envisaged might commend itself to other judges exercising their discretion in similar cases in the future”. </p>

A number of the decided cases have sought to catalogue the main principles governing the proper exercise of this discretion and their Lordships, rather than undertake an exhaustive further survey of the many relevant cases, would seek to summarise the position as follows. (1) Although costs orders against non-parties are to be regarded as ‘exceptional’, exceptional in this context means no more than outside the ordinary run of cases where parties pursue or defend claims for their own benefit and at their own expense. The ultimate question in any such ‘exceptional’ case is whether in all the circumstances it is just to make the order. It must be recognised that this is inevitably to some extent a fact-specific jurisdiction and that there will often be a number of different considerations in play, some militating in favour of an order, some against. (2) Generally speaking the discretion will not be exercised against ‘pure funders’, described in para 40 of <span style="font-style:italic">Hamilton v Al Fayed (No 2) </span>[2003] QB 1175, 1194 as ‘those with no personal interest in the litigation, who do not stand to benefit from it, are not funding it as a matter of business, and in no way seek to control its course’. In their case the court’s usual approach is to give priority to the public interest in the funded party getting access to justice over that of the successful unfunded party recovering his costs and so not having to bear the expense of vindicating his rights. (3) Where, however, the non-party not merely funds the proceedings but substantially also controls or at any rate is to benefit from them, justice will ordinarily require that, if the proceedings fail, he will pay the successful party’s costs. The non-party in these cases is not so much facilitating access to justice by the party funded as himself gaining access to justice for his own purposes. He himself is ‘the real party’ to the litigation, a concept repeatedly invoked throughout the jurisprudence …. (4) Perhaps the most difficult cases are those in which non-parties fund receivers or liquidators (or, indeed, financially insecure companies generally) in litigation designed to advance the funder’s own financial interests. Since this particular difficulty may be thought to lie at the heart of the present case, it would be helpful to examine it in the light of a number of statements taken from the authorities …. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.01in">29.  In the light of these authorities their Lordships would hold that, generally speaking, where a non-party promotes and funds proceedings by an insolvent company solely or substantially for his own financial benefit, he should be liable for the costs if his claim or defence or appeal fails. As explained in the cases, however, that is not to say that orders will invariably be made in such cases, particularly, say, where the non-party is himself a director or liquidator who can realistically be regarded as acting rather in the interests of the company (and more especially its shareholders and creditors) than in his own interests.” </p>

In the immediately preceding years, there had been major changes to the law and practice relating to the funding of litigation. In particular, the Access to Justice Act 1999 had substantially limited the availability of legal aid, but, on the other hand, extended the scope of conditional fee agreements and made it possible for a winning party to recover both success fees and ATE premiums under a costs order. These changes led to “a cultural shift in the role of CFAs as a core method of funding” and ATE insurance, which had been developed during the 1990s, becoming widespread (see Sir Rupert Jackson’s “Review of Civil Litigation Costs: Preliminary Report”, at paragraphs 1.1 and 1.2 of chapter 14 and paragraph 4.3 of chapter 16). There was also a “sea change in the approach of the courts” to commercial funding of litigation as it was “recognised that many claimants cannot afford to pursue valid claims without third party funding” (“Review of Civil Litigation Costs: Preliminary Report”, at paragraph 1.1 of chapter 15). Third party funding was, however, “still nascent” at the date of Sir Rupert Jackson’s 2009 “Review of Civil Litigation Costs: Final Report” (see paragraph 2.4 of chapter 11). </p>

The claim having failed, and nothing having been paid in respect of costs by the claimant, the defendants sought orders for costs against MPC pursuant to section 51 of the Senior Courts Act 1981.

While this is unfortunate, it seems to us that it is a cost that the impecunious claimant can reasonably be expected to bear.

Mr Marven also drew attention to the fact that in paragraph 43 of its judgment the Court of Appeal could “see no reason in principle” why its “solution” should not be applicable where the funder has contributed the greater part, or all, of the expenses of the litigation. That passage, Mr Marven argued, showed that, as regards a case in which a funder has contributed only part of the costs, the Court was intending to expound something definitive and also suggested that the Court’s approach should be applied more generally, in situations where funders have financed litigation either largely or entirely. </p>

The various factors which the judge mentioned did not provide a sufficient basis for departing from the approach which the Court of Appeal took in <span style="font-style:italic">Arkin</span>. On top of that, the judge failed to take into account the respondents’ failure to apply for security for costs, something which, Mr Marven suggested, pointed strongly against imposing unlimited liability on ChapelGate. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in">(i) that a commercial funder’s motivation will always be commercial and so the fact that that was the case with ChapelGate could not be a reason not to follow <span style="font-style:italic">Arkin</span>. With regard to factor (ii), Mr Marven pointed out that ChapelGate became liable for indemnity costs only on a derivative basis and that the judge made no finding that it had itself either departed from the norm or failed to carry out due diligence. In fact, Mr Marven observed, ChapelGate had the benefit of very strong advice from leading counsel. Coming on to factor (iii), Mr Marven submitted that it would typically be the case where there was a question as to whether to apply the <span style="font-style:italic">Arkin </span>cap that it had been apparent that the funded party might not be able to meet a costs award and that the opponent’s costs might be in excess of the funder’s funding. Such matters could not, accordingly, warrant departure from the <span style="font-style:italic">Arkin </span>approach. Further, to proceed on the basis that a funder should ensure that, through ATE insurance or otherwise, money would be available fully to discharge any adverse costs order would inhibit access to justice for those most in need of help. With regard to factor (iv), Mr Marven argued that the judge was wrong to say that the A&amp;W Agreement meant that ChapelGate “effectively halved its commitment to the funding of the litigation”. From ChapelGate’s point of view, its intended exposure remained £2.5 million because, absent the ATE cover which it had originally been anticipated that Ms Davey would obtain with money from ChapelGate, it was vulnerable to an order requiring it to pay costs up to the limit of the <span style="font-style:italic">Arkin </span>cap. ChapelGate’s total exposure and potential rewards were thus unchanged. So far as the factor (v) is concerned, Mr Marven said that, had Ms Davey’s claims proved to be worth as much as had been hoped, she would have retained the majority of the recoveries from the respondents. The Funder’s Profit Share under the Funding Agreement as amended by the A&amp;W Agreement was to be the greater of five times the Commitment Amount or 25% of Net Winnings. If, therefore, Ms Davey had been awarded, say, the £49 million which had been said to have been lost as a result of the Administrators’ failure to proceed with a funded rescue, ChapelGate would have been entitled to some £12.25 million, but Ms Davey would have kept upwards of £36 million. Ms Davey remained, moreover, in control of the litigation. As for factor (vi), Mr Marven argued that the judge ought to have recognised that disapplying the <span style="font-style:italic">Arkin </span>cap would have the effect of deterring funding. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">For their part, Mr Fenwick and Mr Bacon each submitted that the significance of factor (i) was simply that ChapelGate was a commercial funder rather than a “pure” one and so within Lord Brown’s third category in <span style="font-style:italic">Dymocks </span>(a non-party who “not merely funds the proceedings but substantially also controls or at any rate is to benefit from them”) and hence a person whom justice would “ordinarily require” to pay the successful party’s costs (see paragraph 22 above). As for factor (ii), Mr Fenwick and Mr Bacon argued that the misconduct of the litigation that had given rise to the order for indemnity costs was relevant, particularly in the light of Snowden J’s observation that ChapelGate had had “every opportunity to investigate and form a view” on the allegations of serious misconduct which Ms Davey was making. With regard to factor (iii), it was pointed out that, given the nature of the claims being advanced by Ms Davey, the Administrators and Dunbar were bound to be separately represented and to incur very large costs with the result that limiting ChapelGate’s liability to the amount of its own funding would have unusually severe consequences for the winning parties. Moving on to factor (iv), it was said that ChapelGate had indeed halved its commitment to £1.25 million, albeit that a further £1.25 million had been held as a provision, while the respondents had lost the benefit of ATE cover. As Mr Fenwick put the contention, “ChapelGate had managed to divide its investment by half, and maintain the same potential profit, while depriving the Respondents of ATE protection”. In relation to factor (v), the Waterfall meant that Ms Davey could not possibly benefit from any award of less than £6.25 million, that she would have kept £3.75 million or less of the £10 million assumed in Mr Davies’ opinion (see paragraph 7 above) while ChapelGate would have been entitled to £6.25 million, and that recoveries would have had to exceed £25 million for ChapelGate’s share to fall below 25%. Snowden J was thus right to see ChapelGate as “the party with the primary (i.e. first) interest in the Claim” and to consider that Ms Davey’s access to justice “came a clear second to ChapelGate receiving a significant return on its commercial investment”. Turning finally to factor (vi), the judge’s approach to the “policy argument” put forward by ChapelGate was justified in the light of such matters as Sir Rupert Jackson’s “Review of Civil Litigation Costs: Final Report” and developments in relation to ATE insurance, commercial funding and costs control. </p>

Further, ChapelGate stood to receive in return a profit amounting to a multiple of what it had spent. In fact, Ms Davey had to recover from the respondents more than five times ChapelGate’s expenditure to have any prospect of keeping anything for herself. ChapelGate would, moreover, have derived far more than she would from an award of the £10 million projected in Mr Davies’ opinion. In the circumstances, this was a case in which it was legitimate for a judge to attach importance to the funder’s prospective gains as well as to its outlay. The judge was entitled, too, to have regard to the extent to which the <span style="font-style:italic">Arkin </span>cap would leave the respondents out of pocket. The litigation which ChapelGate chose to facilitate involved very serious allegations against more than one party and, beyond that, parties who could not be expected to share legal representation. As a result, it was inevitable that the respondents would incur costs greatly in excess of the funding which ChapelGate provided to Ms Davey, yet the respondents were not to have the protection of any ATE cover. ChapelGate may not have seen the A&amp;W Agreement as reducing its own exposure, but, with its waiver of the requirement for ATE insurance, it very much increased that of the respondents. This was also, as it seems to me, something which the judge could properly take into account. </p>

The Administrators’ solicitors returned to the subject in a letter to Ms Davey’s solicitors of 11 May 2015 in which they referred to the fact that Ms Davey’s solicitors had “suggested that any award of Security for Costs would be limited to the additional costs of enforcing a costs order in another jurisdiction, over and above the costs which would be incurred in this jurisdiction”, a point as to which it was said that the Administrators made “no concessions” but which would not be disputed for the purposes of the letter. Ms Davey’s solicitors replied on 28 May 2015 that Ms Davey had “once more become resident in England” and so none of the conditions in CPR 25.13 was satisfied. At trial, however, it appears to have emerged that Ms Davey had always been resident in Israel, and Mr Marven argued that that would in all probability have emerged in 2015 had the Administrators pressed the point then. In that event, Mr Marven said, Ms Davey’s claims would have been at an end. </p>

I do not see that the respondents can be criticised for failing to challenge what they had been told by the solicitors acting for the party whom ChapelGate later chose to fund. In any case, the authorities indicate that, even if they had been able to establish that Ms Davey was resident in Israel, security for costs would have been available only in respect of any additional costs of enforcing a judgment there, on which there is no evidence. It is by no means apparent that an award of security for costs on that basis would have prevented Ms Davey from pursuing the proceedings. </p>
