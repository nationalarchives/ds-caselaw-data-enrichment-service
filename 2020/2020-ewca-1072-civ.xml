On 18 June 2017, I refused permission to appeal.  The Applicant now seeks permission to reopen the appeal under CPR rule 52.30.   </p>

It is an exceptional jurisdiction, to be exercised rarely.  It will not be exercised simply because an earlier determination was (let alone, may have been) wrong, but only where there is a “powerful probability” that the decision in question would have been different if the integrity of the earlier proceedings has not been critically undermined.  The injustice that would be perpetrated if the appeal is not reopened must be so grave as to overbear the pressing claim of finality in litigation.  </p>

Those earnings were supported by bank statements, accounts and an accountants’ letter.  For that aggregate level of earnings, he was awarded 20 points, sufficient for the purposes of obtaining his further leave to remain.  However, in his tax return for the year 2010-11, he declared only £734 earnings from self-employment, a matter to which I shall return. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">However, as to the first, although this requirement was subsequently emphasised in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Balajigari</span>, it was an original ground of appeal that the Secretary of State did not give the Applicant a proper opportunity to respond to the alleged dishonesty before a conclusion of dishonesty was reached.  I dealt with that ground in my refusal of permission: the Applicant in fact had had every opportunity to indicate that he had underdeclared his income and why.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The Applicant’s evidence in rebuttal of the suggestion that the discrepancy in declared income was anything less than honest was submitted with the 2017 application for leave: none has been submitted subsequently, and Mr Gajjar confirmed that there is no more evidence on which the Applicant would wish to rely.  In terms of an explanation, as I have described, in the questionnaire that accompanied the application, he said that the under-declaration to HMRC was the result of a simple “typing” error on his part and was for one tax year only.  He had submitted documentary support for that submission, e.g. in the form of his further declaration of income for the year 2010-11 which had been acknowledged by HMRC a week before the application for leave.  However, importantly, as I have described, in his application for an administrative review of the 2016 refusal, the Applicant relied on the fact that he had made full declarations of income to HMRC in all other relevant years and had duly paid the tax on that income; and, in all the circumstances, submitting that the only proper inference that could be drawn is that the 2010-11 under-declaration was an honest error.  Again, Mr Gajjar did not suggest that there were any other submissions that could have been made.  As I have indicated, although he was not bound to take into account any material subsequent to the original application, the decision-maker on the administrative review expressly said that he had taken into account the submissions made in the application for the review; and it is clear from his correction of the declared self-employed income for 2010-11 (from nil to £734), which was an issue raised in those submissions, that he did so.  It was not incumbent upon the Secretary of State to interview the Applicant, so long as she gave him a proper opportunity to explain the discrepancy in declared income.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Therefore, in this case, the Applicant not only had an opportunity to put forward his case on dishonesty prior to the administrative review decision, he availed himself of that opportunity; and the decision-maker duly took into account all of the material submitted.  It is clear that the Applicant has suffered no possible injustice by virtue of the fact that the Secretary of state did not adopt a “minded to refuse” procedure before making the initial decision of 28 April 2016. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">As to the second way in which it is contended the Secretary of State erred – having found the Applicant dishonest, she failed to go on to consider whether his presence in the UK was undesirable and whether he should in any event be granted leave – this was not put forward by the Applicant as either a ground of challenge in the judicial review or a ground of appeal.  But, in any event, the decision-maker in both the 28 April and 31 May 2020 refusals expressly found that the Applicant’s dishonest conduct “makes it undesirable to allow [him] to remain in the United Kingdom”; and he (the decision-maker) acknowledged that “a refusal under paragraph 322(5) would not be mandatory”, only to find that, given the clear benefit of the dishonesty to the Applicant, “refusal [of leave] under paragraph 322(5)… is justified”.  Those are clear conclusions. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">However, Mr Gajjar submits that there are three factors of arguable relevance to the exercise of discretion which the decision-maker did not expressly take into account in drawing such conclusions.  Two factors are linked, namely that the under-declaration was confined to a single tax year and the Applicant had positively engaged that HMRC in other tax years.  However, as I have indicated, the original application included confirmation from HMRC that tax had been received on all income in all other years; and, importantly, the application for administrative review expressly pressed these matters, which the decision-maker on that review clearly took into account.  He expressly took into account the Applicant’s otherwise good character, of which this effectively was a part.  In my view, there is no force in the contention that the administrative review decision-maker did not take this into account when considering undesirability and general discretion.  In concluding that the discretion should not be exercised in the Applicant’s favour, it is inconceivable that the decisionmaker did not have this in mind.    </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Similarly, with the third factor, namely the Applicant’s length of residence in the UK, i.e. since January 2009.  The decision letter refers to further leave to remain being granted to the Applicant in 2011, indicating that he had earlier leave to remain; and, again, it is inconceivable that the decision maker did not have that length of time resident in the UK in mind when considering undesirability and exercising the discretion inherent in paragraph 322(5). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">For those reasons, in relation to the two proposed grounds of appeal which the Applicant now wishes to pursue in relation to the 2016 refusal, I do not see how <span style="text-decoration:underline">Balajigari</span> assists him; nor do I consider that either is arguable.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">It does not assist the Applicant’s challenge to the 2016 refusal of indefinite leave to remain that decision that the Secretary of State has accepted that the 2017 decision to refuse was unlawful; because that letter was in very different terms, in which, amongst other things, the decision-maker then does not appear to have separately considered undesirability.  Nor are we aware of the full circumstances behind the agreement of the Secretary of State (who did not accept any specific defect in her decision-making) to reconsider the 2017 application.  </p>

Therefore, the conditions set out in CPR rule 52.30(1)(a) and (b) are not satisfied, and this application must be refused.  Indeed, in my view, this case falls considerably short of the high hurdle inherent in CPR rule 52.30 of a truly exceptional case where the principle of finality of litigation must be displaced.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Two final points.  First, despite the fact that during its pendency the Applicant has been and is still subject to the hostile environment provisions, and has had to pay the court fees for two separate legal challenges, Mr Malik’s submission that there is an alternative remedy in the form of the further application for indefinite leave to remain made in 2017 which is currently being (re-)considered by the Secretary of State seems to me to have some force – and, even if (as Mr Gajjar submits) it is not an effective alternative remedy for the purposes of CPR rule 52.30(1)(c), then, even if the other matters to which I have referred were not fatal to the application, that would in any event be a factor to be taken into account against the Applicant in assessing whether the criteria in (a) and/or (b) are met and in the exercise of discretion.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Second, the Applicant has on any view been guilty of some delay in making this application to reopen.  Judgment in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Balajigari</span> was handed down on 16 April 2019; the application to reopen was not made until six months later, on 23 October 2019.  Mr Gajjar submitted that that delay is reasonably explicable because the Secretary of State applied to the Supreme Court for permission to appeal in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Balajigari</span>, and that court did not formally accept the withdrawal of the appeal until July or perhaps even August 2019.  However, as Mr Malik submitted, the time frame has to be considered against the backdrop of CPR rule 52.9, which requires an appeal against a decision by the Upper Tribunal to refuse permission to bring judicial review proceedings, as in this case, to be made within seven days.  In my view, the delay which has occurred, whilst of course not in itself being determinative, would also have militated against  conclusion in favour of the Applicant in respect of the criteria set out in CPR rule 52.30(1)(a) and (b) and in the exercise of any discretion to reopen the appeal in this case. </p>
