A appealed successfully to the First-tier Tribunal (“the FTT”) against that decision.  On a further appeal by the Secretary of State, however, the Upper Tribunal (“the UT”) set aside the FTT’s decision and subsequently re-made it, deciding on this occasion in favour of the Secretary of State and dismissing A’s original appeal against the decision to deport him.  A now appeals to this court against the UT’s decision on the re-making of the FTT decision.  The setting aside of the FTT’s decision itself is not challenged. </p>

Since the grounds of appeal to this court relate both to the Main Decision and to the Confidential Decision, it was necessary for the hearing of the appeal before us to be in private.  This open judgment deals with the issues raised in the appeal so far as that can be done without harm to the public interest in the protection of confidentiality.  The remaining matters are the subject of a separate closed judgment.  An anonymity order also applies to the proceedings. </p>

This was a classic exercise in the evaluation of circumstantial evidence, in which the UT examined the various strands of evidence, assessed whether and to what extent each strand was supportive of or consistent with the proposition that A was the head of the OCG, and found that in the aggregate they warranted the conclusion that A was indeed, on the balance of probabilities, the head of the OCG.  The UT did not engage in impermissible speculation or make adverse findings when on the balance of probabilities an alternative explanation was possible.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">It is plain that the UT’s approach to the issue of present threat was conditioned by the concession.  It explains why the UT found it unnecessary to make a clear finding one way or the other as to whether the OCG still existed, and why it considered it sufficient to find that the OCG existed in the past and that A had the ability to revive it.  In any event, in the light of the concession, those findings were dispositive of the issue of present threat.  The UT cannot be said to have erred in law by proceeding on that basis.  Accordingly, there is in my view no substance to ground 3 of the appeal. </p>
