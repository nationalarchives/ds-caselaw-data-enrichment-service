	      <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0.05in">This appeal raises issues about the proper interpretation and effect of section 9 of the Defamation Act 2013.  Section 9(2) provides that “A court does not have jurisdiction to hear and determine an action to which this section applies unless the court is satisfied that, of all the places in which the statement complained of has been published, England and Wales is clearly the most appropriate place in which to bring an action in respect of the statement”.  By a judgment dated 31 July 2019 Mr Justice Nicklin (“the judge”) found that England and Wales was not clearly the most appropriate place in which to bring the libel claim in this action and made a declaration that the Court had no jurisdiction to hear the claim. </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0.05in">The claimant appeals on the grounds that the judge took the wrong approach to section 9 so that he did not make relevant findings about the appropriate place to bring the libel claim, and that if he had done so England and Wales would be shown to be clearly the most appropriate place to bring the claim.  The defendant resists the appeal saying that the judge properly applied section 9 in the circumstances of this case.  The defendant also filed a respondent’s notice saying that if the judge did take a wrong approach, the decision should be upheld because on an analysis of the relevant evidence, England and Wales was not clearly the most appropriate place in which to bring the libel claim. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0.05in">By the conclusion of the written and oral submissions it became apparent that the issues on this appeal are whether: (1) the judge took a proper approach to section 9 in this case; and (2) whether England and Wales was clearly the most appropriate jurisdiction to bring the claim. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0.05in">The background to the claim arises in relation to a controversy about who was the developer of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency.  “Satoshi Nakamoto” is the pseudonym used by the person, or persons, who developed Bitcoin.  On 31 October 2008 an academic paper was published under the name of Satoshi Nakamoto titled “Bitcoin: A peer to peer electronic cash system”.  The academic paper described the manner in which the electronic cash system operated.    </p>

Mr Ver was born in California, in the United States and raised in Silicon Valley.  He moved to Japan, which he described in evidence as the global centre for cryptocurrencies, in 2005.  In 2014 he renounced his US citizenship and became a citizen of St Kitts &amp; Nevis, although he continues to live in Japan.  Mr Ver does not accept that Dr Wright is Satoshi Nakamoto.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0.05in">The evidence before the judge showed that Dr Wright and Mr Ver had had good relations in the past, and that Dr Wright described Mr Ver as a “trusted colleague”.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0.05in;text-indent:0.00in">Mr Ver favoured a version known as Bitcoin ABC.  The “ABC” stands for “Adjustable Blocksize Cap”.  Dr Wright favoured Bitcoin SV.  The “SV” stands for “Satoshi Vision”.  Dr Wright considered that Bitcoin ABC was not Bitcoin because it did not work within existing legal frameworks.  When it became clear that Mr Ver was not supporting Bitcoin SV there was a falling out which appears to have been in November 2018.  The extent of the breakdown in relations appears from the fact that Dr Wright sent Mr Ver an email in which he declared that Mr Ver was his “enemy”.   </p>

The defamatory meaning of these publications is said to be that Dr Wright “had fraudulently claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto, that is to say the person, or one of the group of people who developed Bitcoin”.  </p>

On 2 May 2019 Mr Ver was visiting London.  A claim form on behalf of Dr Wright complaining of the publication in the YouTube video was issued, and it was served personally on Mr Ver, pursuant to the provisions of CPR Part 6.5(2).  Personal service on overseas defendants while temporarily present in this jurisdiction is an established part of the common law, although it has sometimes been considered in other jurisdictions to be an exorbitant exercise of jurisdiction and is excluded as a basis for establishing jurisdiction under certain conventions, see article 3 of the Lugano Convention (Convention on Jurisdiction and the Enforcement of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters) scheduled to the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1991. </p>

In addition to being Bitcoin’s creator, Wright is currently Chief Scientist of nChain, the global leader in advisory, research and development blockchain technologies, which focuses on massive adoption of Bitcoin in the form of Bitcoin SV”.  In his statement Dr Wright said “there were questions in the wider Bitcoin community about the authorship of the White paper and these questions were hindering my efforts to build a global business (both blockchain and coin) based on Bitcoin SV”.  There were some reports exhibited to Mr Double’s statement showing that Bitcoin SV, which the evidence shows Dr Wright is associated with, had benefitted from the publication of reports about the registration of Dr Wright as author of the academic paper. </p>

The judge then set out the position at common law in paragraphs 19 to 21 before turning back to section 9 in paragraphs 22 to 32 of the judgment.

The judge noted that there was “no evidence of any actual reputational harm that the claimant has suffered as a result of any of the defendant’s publications”. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0.05in">The judge then turned to harm to reputation in paragraph 51 noting that the claimant’s evidence was weak, lacked detail and was at a level of generality which was almost speculative, finding that “there is no objective evidence of any harm to reputation”.  The judge stated that “the claimant has failed completely to address whether and to what extent the publications complained of have harmed his reputation in other jurisdictions”.  The judge found that the claimant enjoyed a global reputation, the vast majority of which was generated before he moved to the UK.  The judge said that the whole issue of damage to reputation beyond England and Wales was left completely unaddressed in Dr Wright’s evidence.  The judge accepted that the evidence showed that Dr Wright was putting down roots in the UK and that would increase the reputational interests that Dr Wright had in this jurisdiction but that could not displace the global reputation that he enjoyed.  The judge held that Dr Wright’s reputation in England and Wales was an inseparable segment of his reputation  worldwide, mirroring the words in Lord Hoffmann’s judgment in Berezovsky v Forbes Inc [2000] 1 WLR 1004 at 1023A.  The publications in the UK served “only to demonstrate that the claimant has a notoriety or profile that means he is of interest to readers of  UK publication” which was consistent with his global reputation but did not demonstrate a reputation limited to England and Wales. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0.05in">Finally the judge turned to the US and said “some time – and quite some evidence, including expert legal evidence on whether a US Court would accept jurisdiction over the claim – has been devoted to the question of whether the US is in fact the most appropriate jurisdiction.  I do not need to decide this issue (see [24] above)”.  This was a reference back to the judge’s statement that “it is no longer sufficient to demonstrate that England and Wales is an appropriate jurisdiction.  A claimant could fail to surmount the evidential hurdle in s.9(2) even if the court is unable to identify, from the other candidate jurisdictions, an alternative that is the most appropriate.”  The judge found “as the claimant has declined to provide evidence of his global reputation and the harm that has been occasioned by the publication complained of, for example, in the US, I lack a basis on which to make any assessment, I only have half of the picture; ie the extent of publication in the US”.  The judge noted the evidence showing Mr Ver’s consent that the claim be brought in the US and the evidence showing that there were US Courts that would accept jurisdiction where the parties have consented.  The judge concluded that Dr Wright had not satisfied him that England and Wales was clearly the most appropriate place to bring his action. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0.05in">In addition to these points, at the start of his submissions Mr Wolanski also raised issues about what he said was a shifting burden of proof under section 9.  He submitted that the burden was on the claimant when applying to get permission to serve out, and the burden then shifted to the defendant on the application to set aside service, and that there was an overlap of the burden of proof with the “good arguable case” test set out in forum non conveniens cases, see Canada Trust v Stolzenburg [1998] 1 WLR 547 and Goldman Sachs International v Novo Banco SA [2018] 1 WLR 3863 at paragraph 9.  These submissions were notable by their absence from the proceedings at first instance before the judge, and, as Mr Tomlinson fairly pointed out, these arguments were not raised in any grounds of appeal.  At the commencement of the hearing Flaux LJ asked Mr Wolanski whether he wanted to amend his grounds of appeal to raise these matters.

A claim for libel was, under the common law, actionable per se, so that harm was presumed.  This meant that both claimants domiciled in this jurisdiction as well as foreign claimants could sue foreign defendants for publications of newspapers in an overseas jurisdiction, where there had, in addition to the foreign publications, been some minimal publication in this jurisdiction, see Shevill v Presse Alliance (No 2) [1996] AC 959.

It was necessary to show that “a real and substantial tort” had been committed in this jurisdiction and that “the game was worth the candle”, see Jameel at paragraph 69.  In addition it was held that the common law required a substantial threshold of seriousness to be surmounted before a statement could be regarded as defamatory, as appeared from Thornton v Telegraph Media Group [2010] EWHC 1414 (QB); [2011] 1 WLR 1983.

In paragraphs 31 and 32 of Ahuja Sir Michael Tugendhat had set out extracts from the explanatory notes of the Act and referred to commentaries in various textbooks.  It is apparent that although the explanatory notes state that the section was aimed to address the issue of “libel tourism” (which was said to be a term used to apply where cases with a tenuous link to England and Wales are brought in this jurisdiction), the effect of section 9 is of a wider effect because it is dependent only on the domicile of the defendant, and not the claimant.  It is plain that a person domiciled in England and Wales may find it easier to show that the jurisdiction of England and Wales is clearly the most appropriate jurisdiction to bring the claim, but the position may not be so straightforward with persons who have moved to this jurisdiction or who have a global reputation. </p>

It was apparent at the conclusion of the oral submissions on this appeal that neither party was contending for a different approach from that taken in Ahuja.  This is not surprising because the formulation in Ahuja is a statement of the statutory provision, which uses ordinary language, to describe the Court’s task when deciding an issue under section 9.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0.05in">The number of times on which the statement has been published in each jurisdiction will be a relevant factor.  For example if the hard copy circulation of a newspaper is 90,000 in Portugal and 136 in England and Wales, that is likely to be a very material factor in the assessment of the most appropriate place to bring the action, compare Sobrinho v Impresa Publishing SA [2016] EWHC 66 (QB); [2016] EMLR 12.  This reflects the suggestion made in paragraph 66 of the Explanatory Notes to the Defamation Act 2013. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0.05in">Another relevant factor for the Court to consider will be damage to reputation.  As the tort of libel is critically concerned with damage to reputation and, since the Defamation Act 2013 “serious harm” to reputation, the Court “would wish to take into account such matters as the amount of damage to the claimant’s reputation in England and Wales compared with elsewhere”, see Ahuja at paragraph 32.  It is well known that it can be difficult to establish harm to reputation.  This is because of the obvious difficulties of getting witnesses to say that they read the words and thought badly of the claimant, if only because claimants will have an understandable desire not to spread the contents of the article complained of by asking persons if they have read it and what they think of the claimant, and because persons who think badly of the claimant are not likely to co-operate in providing evidence.  However it is not impossible to obtain such evidence, see Lachaux v Independent Print, and Courts are able, as in all cases, to draw inferences based on the admitted evidence.    </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0.05in">However there are other relevant factors for a Court to consider when making a decision under section 9.  These factors are likely to include the availability of fair judicial processes in the other jurisdictions in which publication occurred.  The available remedies from the Courts of the other jurisdictions may be relevant, as may be the costs of pursuing proceedings in each possible jurisdiction.  Other factors that might impact on access to justice, for example language barriers, can be relevant.  The location of likely witnesses is another feature that may be relevant.  This list of factors is not exhaustive because the relevant multifactorial question to be answered by the Court is whether it can be shown that England and Wales is clearly the most appropriate jurisdiction in which to bring the action.  This will be fact specific but it is likely to require the Court to make the best assessment that it can on the evidence whether any competing jurisdiction is an appropriate place to bring this claim. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0.05in">As appears from paragraphs 61 to 63 above I agree with the judge that both the nature and extent of publication, and damage to reputation are important relevant factors to consider, and in many cases these may be the decisive factors.  However setting out a two stage test is unlikely to assist in many cases.  This is because it is an intermediate step to be performed by the Court, and adds a gloss to the statutory question.  It is therefore likely to add to the complexity of the Court’s task.  Further it is not clear how the first two stages set out by the judge relate to other relevant factors.  The statutory question remains only whether it can be shown that England and Wales is clearly the most appropriate jurisdiction in which to bring this action. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0.05in">As appears from paragraphs 64 to 65 above other factors in addition to the two stages identified by the judge may be relevant.  It is right to note that the judge did consider under his heading “other factors” the convenience of hearing the action in England and Wales.  However when the judge turned to consider whether the US was the most appropriate jurisdiction he said in terms “I do not need to resolve this issue”, and referred back to paragraph 24 of his judgment where he noted that a claimant might fail to surmount the evidential hurdle in section 9 even if the Court is unable to identify, from other candidate jurisdictions, an alternative that is the most appropriate.  The judge then highlighted the fact that Dr Wright had failed to provide evidence of the extent of his global reputation and the harm caused to it in the US.  The judge concluded that Dr Wright had not satisfied him that England and Wales was clearly the most appropriate jurisdiction to bring the claim.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0.05in">I agree that in some cases a judge may be unable to say which is the most appropriate jurisdiction in which to bring a claim.  It is also clear that the decisive issue is whether England and Wales is “clearly the most appropriate” jurisdiction in which to bring the claim.  However I agree with Mr Wolanski that the judge had to confront Dr Wright’s evidence that he had only visited the US for two and a half days in the last four years, and his evidence that the vast majority of his business peers were in the UK.  I also accept Mr Wolanski’s submission that it was possible to make an assessment of whether the US was the most appropriate jurisdiction in which to bring this claim when considering the relevant factors.  It is therefore necessary for this court to consider for itself whether England and Wales is clearly the most appropriate jurisdiction in which to bring this claim, and I therefore turn to the second issue on appeal. </p>

This showed that Dr Wright spoke at international conferences on cryptocurrencies from Asia to South and North America.  He described himself as “an Australian/Antiguan computer scientist, businessman and inventor who challenges the world with visionary ideas”.  Dr  Wright’s evidence showed that he made submissions to regulators interested in cryptocurrencies in the US, Australia, UK, China, Singapore and Uzbekistan.  Bitcoin is a global cryptocurrency.  The existence of a global reputation shows that Dr Wright’s reputation is just as likely to be affected in other jurisdictions where publication took place, as it is in England and Wales. </p>

Dr Wright had issued a press release about this stating that the registration by the US Copyright Office recognised Dr Wright as the author of the 2008 paper and code.  Dr Wright said that the speculation about the 2008 academic paper was hindering his efforts to build a global business based on Bitcoin SV.  All of this relates to a global reputation, part relying on a specific action taken in the US, rather than any specific reputation in England and Wales.  The registration by Dr Wright in the US with the relevant press release about the registration supports the proposition that a state in the US is an appropriate jurisdiction in which this claim can be brought. </p>

On the other hand the evidence showed that Dr Wright’s former business associate David Kleiman had lived in Florida, US, and that the estate of David Kleiman and Dr Wright were in a substantial dispute in the courts of Florida about the entitlement to Bitcoins.  The evidence also showed that Dr Wright spoke at international conferences with Jimmy Nguyen who now lives in Seattle, Washington State, US and who had practised as a patents attorney for 17 years in California, US.  This evidence about Dr Wright’s business relationships, which is the most that is available on the evidence before the Court, strongly suggests that Dr Wright’s most important relationships were and are in the US.   </p>

Further the evidence showed that there was a nChain group of companies of which Mr Nguyen, who lives in the US, had been the CEO until recently.  Mr Nguyen was still the chair of the Strategic Advisory Board.  The limited evidence about nChain from Mr Nguyen suggested that nChain was a group of companies based in more than one jurisdiction.  Dr Wright specifically referred to his concerns that the relevant publications might undermine his efforts to recruit those who had obtained doctorates in mathematics, but there was no evidence showing that the concern was justified.  Further Mr Wolanski had confirmed to the judge in the hearing below that nChain’s efforts to recruit staff was not limited to the UK.   </p>

Although the evidence did not address the specifics of remedies available to Dr Wright in each respective state in the US beyond the statement that New York was a Court of “general jurisdiction”, there was nothing in the evidence to suggest that Dr Wright would not be able to obtain damages to vindicate his reputation in any state for all the relevant publications in the US.  Although Mr Wolanski attempted to sub-divide the publications in the US according to each individual state it was not apparent that this point had been taken before the judge, but more importantly there was no evidence suggesting that any state in the US which would accept jurisdiction would not be able to provide Dr Wright with an adequate remedy for the totality of the publications in the US.  There was no evidence showing that Dr Wright would have difficulties in obtaining access to justice in any state in the US beyond his unexplained hearsay assertion that he had been told that it would be difficult. </p>
