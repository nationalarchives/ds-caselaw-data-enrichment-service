	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">This appeal, brought with permission granted by Males LJ, is against an order whereby Robin Knowles J found that the appellant, Rakesh Malhotra, was in contempt of court. The contempt comprised a breach of an order made by Popplewell J on 27 March 2018 (the Order), which prohibited Mr Malhotra from communicating with any Trade Contact (as defined in the Order) “in terms that are disparaging of any of the Relevant Management” (as so defined). He was found to have breached the Order by a letter dated 29 June 2018 to the Assistant General Manager of Punjab National Bank in Mumbai (the Bank). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Robin Knowles J imposed, as the penalty for the contempt, an order that Mr Malhotra pay the Claimant’s costs of the application on an indemnity basis, summarily assessed at £250,000. Males LJ refused permission to appeal separately against this penalty. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The Order was made following judgment given by Popplewell J on 13 December 2017 ([2017] EWHC 3246 (Comm)) in an action brought by the Claimant against Mr Malhotra. As Popplewell J recorded in his judgment, the action arose out of a fall-out from a shareholder dispute and the central dispute was whether Mr Malhotra’s service contract as executive chairman of the Claimant and its subsidiaries had been validly terminated.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The Claimant is the holding company of the Super-Max group of companies, whose business is principally based in India and the Middle East. The business was founded by members of Mr Malhotra’s family and it remained wholly owned by the family until 2011 when Actis LLP, a private equity investment business, invested US$225 million through a special purpose vehicle, Actis Consumer Grooming Products Limited (ACGPL) which became the holder of just over 40 per cent of the equity capital of the Claimant. Under the terms of a shareholder agreement, Mr Malhotra became the executive chairman. A group chief executive officer was appointed, who could not be removed without the consent of ACGPL. Other senior officers were appointed. In 2016, Mr Malhotra purported to suspend the chief executive officer and to remove or suspend other senior officers. Actis and ACGPL obtained interim injunctions to restrain these actions and terminated Mr Malhotra’s service contract as executive chairman. Mr Malhotra remained a director. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Popplewell J held that Mr Malhotra’s service contract had been lawfully terminated and granted consequential injunctive relief, including the relevant injunction on this appeal in paragraph 9 of the Order. The evidence before Popplewell J established a pattern of disparaging communications from Mr Malhotra to those dealing with the group and a substantial threat that such communications would continue in breach of his duties as a director, unless restrained by injunction.  </p>

If paragraphs 2 and 3 are read together, as they must be and as any recipient of the Letter would do, I regard it as inescapable that the references to “inept management” and “erratic inept management” in paragraph 3 at least include those officers.

Accordingly, the investment agreement which primarily came to be recorded in a document dated 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2010 termed a "subscription and shareholders deed (SSD) provided for not only the representation of ACGPL in all Group companies and in the Advisory Board of the Group but also provided for the appointment of the Group CEO and Group CFO, amongst other, by ACGPL. This is by reason of the fact that Actis LLP agreed to bring along with its investment in the group a gold standard management which would ensure significant growth of the group and its companies, significant increase in generation of revenue and consequently significantly larger profits. It was accordingly the express term of the agreement that Actis LLP through ACGPL, through the management put in place by it would ensure sufficient returns which would enable recovery of its investment and of a return on the same. </p>

In this context it may be relevant to note that at the time of enjoying with Actis LLP the value of the Supermax group was in the region of USD 700 million. In course of time through erratic inept management, Actis LLP succeeded in reducing the value of the group to around USD 10 million. In the circumstances, we were forced to file a proceeding in the Cayman Island against Actis LLP and ACGPL seeking damages from them for having destroyed the value of the company. </p>

As it significantly affected the functioning of the company and amounted to oppression of SMM and Malhotra parties under the SSD, [Mr Malhotra] was compelled to file a proceeding before the NCLT, Mumbai seeking reliefs against such acts of oppression and mismanagement including with regard to the holding of Board and general meetings of SPCPL. This was, however, strenuously opposed by Actis LLP and/or ACGPL. In the course of the said proceeding before the NCLT, Mumbai, Actis LLP further contended that it had acquired 80% of the voting rights of the holding companies of SPCPL through invocation of a pledge of shares. In the circumstances, [Mr Malhotra] and the other petitioners before the NCLT sought an amendment of the petition to bring a challenge to the wrongful acts of Actis LLP and/or ACGPL through the purported invocation of pledge and the purported reconstitution of the Board of SPCPL, amongst others, through such device. Such challenge before the NCLT is also present pending. </p>

Actis LLP and/or ACGPL have through SPCPL succeeded in sealing the bulk of TMPL' s machinery which has caused and is continuing to cause its significant loss and damage. Actis LLP and/or ACGPL have thereby acted against the interest of the group and are continuing to do so. In an effort to recommence full scale production with the use of the sealed machinery, TMPL has since applied for unsealing of the same, which application now stands transferred by an order of the Mumbai High Court to the arbitration of Mr Justice Waziftar (Retired). </p>
