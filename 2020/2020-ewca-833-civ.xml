The tenant is the same for each, but the landlords are different.

The court emphasised that what was important was how the proceedings were initiated. According to the report of [HHJ Davis-White’s decision in this case] the claim was brought by Part 7 claim: not under Part 55. If, as is suggested the possession claim was made by way of counterclaim, that would not have required separate initiation under Part 55. </p>

If the court accepted that submission, Ms Joanne Wicks QC, leading counsel for the tenant (leading Mr Mark Galtrey), contended that the court should not lift the stay so as to enable the substantive appeals to proceed.

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.00in;text-indent:0.00in">“In our view PD 51Z cannot be read as formally excluding the operation of CPR [Part] 3.1.  As a matter of strict jurisdiction, therefore, a judge retains the power to lift the stay which it imposes.  But the proper exercise of that power is informed by the nature of the stay and the purposes for which it was evidently imposed.  PD 51Z imposes a general stay on proceedings of the kind to which it applies, initially subject to no qualification at all, and subsequently qualified only in the limited and specific respects provided for in paragraph 2A.  The purpose was that during the 90-day period the burden on judges and staff in the County Court of having to deal with possession proceedings, which are an immense part of its workload, would be lifted, and also that the risk to public health of proceeding with evictions would be avoided.  That purpose is of its nature blanket in character and does not allow for distinctions between cases where the stay may operate more or less harshly on (typically) the claimant.  It would be fatally undermined if parties affected by the stay were entitled to rely on their particular circumstances – however special they might be said to be – as the basis on which the stay should be lifted in their particular case.  Thus, while we would not go so far as to say that there could be no circumstances in which it would be proper for a judge to order that the stay imposed by PD 51Z should be lifted in a particular case, we have great difficulty in envisaging such a case.  The only possible such case canvassed before us was where the stay would operate in such a way as to defeat the purposes of PD 51Z and endanger public health”.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.00in;text-indent:0.00in">“In our judgment, however, the words of paragraph 2 of PD 51Z are broader than Mr Paget submitted.  They stay “all proceedings for possession <span style="font-weight:bold">brought</span> under CPR Part 55”. We have emphasised the word “brought”, because it focuses on how the proceedings were initiated. As a matter of ordinary language, we think that proceedings brought under CPR Part 55 are still “brought under CPR Part 55”, even when they are under appeal. It is true that the procedure governing the appeal is contained in CPR Part 52, but the proceedings remain proceedings brought under CPR Part 55”.</p>

	    <p style="margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">His point was that neither action was “brought” under CPR Part 55. The first action was an action by the tenants for a declaration as to the application of the 1954 Act, with a free-standing counterclaim for possession. CPR Part 20.3(1) provided that “[a]n additional claim shall be treated as if it were a claim for the purposes of these Rules …”. The second action was a claim by the landlord for declarations only. The proceedings were never amended to claim possession, even if the parties agreed that such an order should be made to give effect to the judgment. Delay would prejudice the landlords. The enforcement of any possession order would obviously await the end of the stay in any event. If a stay were in place in one case and not the other, the landlords accepted that it was preferable to stay both so that they were determined together. In the course of argument, Arnold LJ suggested that, on any basis, the tenant’s claim in the first action was not stayed, so that could proceed alone to determine the substantive issue on whether the leases were protected by the 1954 Act without lifting the stay on any claim for possession at all. The landlords adopted that approach. </p>

Most importantly for our purposes, paragraph 13 deals with “regulating small business” making clear that “[t]he legislation applies to activities that may be undertaken by small businesses as landlords or tenants”, and that “[t]he policy intention is to extend the stay on possession proceedings and the Ministry acknowledges that this may act to the detriment of some small businesses and to the advantage of others”. Paragraph 7.1 points to concern that the expiry of the original stay “may lead to an increase in possession cases which could result in increased homelessness at a time of continuing lockdown and public health risk”. It explains that “[u]rgent collaborative work is being undertaken to agree arrangements to manage carefully the eventual resumption of possession cases in the courts and the resulting potential for eviction”. Paragraph 12.3 makes clear that it was understood that “[t]he extended stay on possession proceedings will have an impact on landlords who are unable to pursue proceedings for eviction”. It says that: “given the wider circumstances of the public health implications of Covid-19 and the need to prevent homelessness, and the arrangements that have been put in place to support the rented sector, the government believes that an extension is a necessary and proportionate response”.  </p>

This indicates that the entire first action must have become “proceedings for possession brought under CPR Part 55” when the counterclaim was initiated. CPR Part 20 does not seem to me to cut across this conclusion. All CPR Part 20.3(1) provides is that a counterclaim is to be treated as it were a claim for the purposes of the CPR. Here, the counterclaim for possession attracts all the rigours of CPR Part 55 and PD55A to the first action. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">This analysis also fits with the reality of the situation more generally. The tenant started the first action to resolve the legal issue that underlay the question of whether or not it was entitled to remain in possession of the two properties. It was inevitable that the landlords would counterclaim for possession, which was itself the inevitable consequence of their position. This is the case in many types of landlord and tenant dispute. Underlying legal issues need to be resolved, but their determination leads to the conclusion that the landlord either will or will not be entitled to recover possession from the tenant. That is why it would, in my view, be so inappropriate to salami slice the first action in order to allow the appeal against the tenant’s claim to go ahead, whilst acknowledging that the counterclaim for possession and the appeal from it is stayed. If we did that here, it would reduce the efficacy of the blanket stay that the Master of the Rolls and now the legislature has imposed.  </p>

I do not see how one can have an order for possession, without there having first been proceedings for possession. As I have already pointed out, CPR Part 55 is mandatorily applicable to possession claims brought by landlords. Accordingly, even though the consensual approach encouraged by the judge employed a short cut that abrogated the need for a formal amendment of the landlords’ claim in the second action, the proceedings on which the judge made his Order must properly be regarded as “proceedings for possession brought under CPR Part 55”. The judge could not otherwise properly have made the Order. In addition, the position was confirmed when the tenant appealed against those possession orders. As <span style="font-style:italic">Okoro </span>makes clear, an appeal from a possession order is still to be regarded as “proceedings for possession brought under CPR Part 55”. </p>

As Ms Wicks correctly emphasised and, as we said in <span style="font-style:italic">Arkin</span> at [42], the purpose of the stay “is of its nature blanket in character and does not allow for distinctions between cases where the stay may operate more or less harshly on (typically) the claimant”. At [44], we said that “[t]he blanket stay has been imposed to protect public health and the administration of justice generally” and  “[t]he approach of a blanket stay reflects the balance struck …, and makes clear that possession claims are not to be dealt with on a normal case by case basis during the stay”. </p>

It would send entirely the wrong message if we were to continue to hear an appeal in what must properly be regarded as possession proceedings on the technical ground that a part of the claim is for a declaration as to the law underlying that claim for possession. </p>

I do not agree that that was the appropriate course. A stay means what it says. If the proceedings are stayed, nothing can happen in court at all (see <span style="font-style:italic">Arkin</span> at [51]). The exceptions to the stay are spelt out in paragraph 2A of PD 51Z, and none of them applies to the delivery of a reserved judgment.

The claim form was issued by the tenant in the High Court, Business and Property Courts, Property Trusts and Probate List, seeking a declaration that its tenancies of retail premises in Bridgend and Mansfield had not been excluded from Part II of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954 and an injunction restraining the landlords from attempting to gain possession of the premises otherwise than in accordance with 1954 Act. In its Particulars of Claim, the tenant contended, in short, that the landlords had not properly complied with the </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">As counsel for the landlords pointed out, Part 55 is a separate code which uniquely regulates all stages of a claim issued under it. The claimant may make the claim at any County Court hearing centre, but may start the claim in the High Court if it files a certificate verified by a statement of truth justifying that course in accordance with Practice Direction 55A (r. 55.3(1)-(3)). The claim form and the form of defence sent with it must be in the forms set out in PD 55A (r. 55.3(5)). The particulars of claim must be filed and served with the claim form (r. 55.4). PD 55A sets out certain requirements for the particulars of claim, depending on the type of claim (paras 2.12.7). A first return date is immediately set upon issue of the claim which will be not less than 28 days nor later than eight weeks from the date of issue (r. 55.5(1),(3)). There are specific requirements as to service of claims on trespassers and others (rr. 55.5(2) and 55.6). The defendant is not required to file an acknowledgement of service, a failure to file a defence does not preclude the defendant taking part at any hearing and default judgment is not available (r. 55.7). The court has the power to determine the claim summarily at the first hearing (r. 55.8). </p>

Quite simply, Part 55 does not envisage possession claims being brought by counterclaim to a Part 7 claim. (Perhaps it should do; but that is a matter for the Civil Procedure Rules Committee on another day.) In any event, no attempt was made by the landlords to bring the counterclaim within Part 55 at the time. To take a simple illustration, the landlords did not file a certificate justifying bringing the counterclaim in the High Court, for the obvious reason that the action was already in the High Court. The counterclaim was simply brought under Part 20 in the ordinary way. Accordingly, the counterclaim was not “brought under Part 55”. </p>

An additional claim is to be treated as if it were a claim for the purposes of the CPR, except as provided by Part 20: r. 20(3)(1). Additional claims, including counterclaims, are distinct to claims. Thus a claim will continue if the counterclaim is discontinued, and vice-versa; and a claim may be struck out or summary judgment granted without that necessarily affecting the counterclaim, and vice-versa. When the glossary to the CPR (which is only a “guide to the meaning of certain legal expressions”: r. 2.2(1)) refers to a counterclaim being “included in the same proceedings as the … claim”, it simply means that the claim and counterclaim form parts of the same action. Accordingly, in my opinion, the bringing of the landlord’s counterclaim did not convert the tenant’s claim into possession proceedings, still less possession proceedings brought under Part 55. </p>

Although there was no application by the landlords to amend their Particulars of Claim, it is plain that the parties agreed that the need for such an application would be waived. It follows that, as a matter of substance and reality, there was a claim by the landlords for possession in respect of the Ashford, Cheshire Oaks and York premises (but not the Swindon premises). To that extent, therefore, the proceedings became possession proceedings at that point. But were they “brought under Part 55”?

In both actions, the tenant relied upon technical legal arguments concerning the requirements imposed by the 2003 Order, which is no doubt why both actions were issued in the High Court. The actions were heard at a trial lasting four days at which the parties were represented by two counsel on each side instructed by well-known firms of solicitors. (Although the trial took place well before the Covid19 lockdown, I see no reason to think that it could not have proceeded during that period, when as I understand it the Business and Property Courts managed to deal with 85% of their normal caseload; still less that it could not proceed under the current circumstances.) The judge delivered a reserved judgment running to 162 paragraphs dealing with a number of issues. I granted permission to appeal to this Court on one of those issues. On the appeal, the parties were again represented by four counsel instructed by solicitors. Counsel, solicitors and clients were all able to participate in the remote hearing. As I see it, this is not the sort of case which the stay of proceedings, as opposed to the stay of enforcement, imposed by r. 55.29 is intended to cater for. That being so, the courts should continue to administer justice. </p>

If, therefore, both actions are fully caught by the stay, then I agree that the case management considerations relied upon by the landlords were not enough to justify lifting it. If it were the case, however, that the tenant’s claim in the first action was not subject to the stay, but the landlords’ counterclaim in the first action and the landlords’ possession claim in the second action were subject to the stay, then that would seem to me to represent exceptional circumstances justifying this Court in lifting the stay, having regard to (i) the fact the tenant’s claim would enable the legal questions arising on the appeal to be decided, (ii) the fact that the landlords’ possession claim in the second action did not include the Swindon premises, (iii) the case management considerations listed by Lewison LJ and (iv) the additional factors mentioned below. </p>

The tenant’s application for reconsideration was not made until sometime during the evening of 16 June 2020. By that time, the case had been allocated to this constitution, which was starting its preparation for the hearing. Although the landlords submitted their written response expeditiously on 18 June 2020, it was almost inevitable by that time that the Court would do what it did, which was to list the reconsideration application for oral hearing immediately prior to the substantive appeal, on the footing that the Court would proceed to hear the substantive appeal if the application was unsuccessful. Thus the parties had to prepare for the substantive appeal anyway. Justice delayed is justice denied, but delay is worse if it involves additional expense, as it will do in this case. </p>
