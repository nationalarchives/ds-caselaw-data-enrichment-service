	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The Appellant, Ping Europe Ltd (‘Ping’), makes and distributes top of the range golf clubs and other golfing equipment and clothing. Ping is the sole licensee of the Ping brand in the UK, Europe, the Middle East and South Africa.  It had a turnover of £52.7 million in the financial year ended 31 December 2016. It operates a selective distribution network of 1,200 authorised dealers throughout the United Kingdom some with premises located on golf courses and some on the high street.  Since the foundation of the Ping brand by the American engineer Karsten Solheim in 1959, Ping has pioneered the importance of what is called “custom fitting”. When customers are custom fitted for a golf club, they are carefully assessed so that the golf clubs they buy are of a specification suited to their particular measurements, golf swing and other attributes. Ping believes that the practice of steering potential customers firmly towards a custom fitting before they buy ensures that the customer acquires the most suitable club to enhance their game. The authorised dealers admitted to Ping’s network, referred to in the proceedings as Account Holders, must meet certain qualitative criteria. These require them, amongst other things, to invest in the equipment and expertise needed to provide the custom fitting service to their customers.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In 2006 Ping considered how to respond to the growing popularity of sales of all kinds of consumer goods over the internet. Ping regarded online sales as anathema to its focus on custom fitting. It therefore introduced an internet sales policy (‘the ISP’) which prohibited its UK authorised dealers from offering Ping products for sale on the dealers’ website.  In 2012 this policy was modified to allow online sales of Ping products other than golf clubs but was maintained and strictly enforced for the sale of Ping golf clubs.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">On 24 August 2017 the Respondent, the Competition and Markets Authority (‘the CMA’), adopted a decision called “Online Sales Ban in the Golf Equipment Sector” (‘the Decision’). The CMA found that Ping’s ISP as incorporated into its contractual agreements with its authorised dealers amounted to a restriction of competition “by object” contrary to both Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (‘Article 101’) and the prohibition in section 2(1) Competition Act 1998.  Having found that the ISP was an object restriction, the CMA did not consider the effects of the policy on the relevant market which it defined as the market for the sale of golf clubs in the United Kingdom. The CMA found further that the policy did not satisfy the criteria for exemption under Article 101(3). The CMA directed that Ping revise its policy to allow authorised dealers to sell Ping golf clubs on their websites. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Ping appealed against the Decision to the Competition Appeal Tribunal (‘the CAT’). In a judgment dated 7 September 2018 [2018] CAT 13 (Andrew Lenon QC, Prof John Beath OBE and Eamonn Doran), the CAT upheld the finding that the ISP amounted to a restriction of competition by object. The CAT reduced the penalty imposed by £200,000.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Ping now appeals to this court against the CAT’s judgment. The principal ground of appeal is that the CAT erred in finding that Ping’s ISP was a restriction of competition by object. Its secondary ground of appeal is that if the infringement decision is upheld, the penalty imposed should be significantly reduced. </p>

It cited a 2015 survey which found that 3.3 million adults played on a full length golf course in 2015 including 1.5 million golfers who play at least 12 times a year. The total value of UK consumer expenditure on golf equipment and clothing was £340 million in 2014 and the value of retail sales of golf clubs alone in 2015 was between £150 – 160 million. Between 60 to 70 per cent of UK golfers had bought golf equipment in the previous 12 months. The average expenditure by UK golfers on clubs in 2015 was £203 on drivers, £153 on fairway woods, £439 on a set of irons, £126 on hybrids and £101 on wedges.   </p>

Market share data derived from different industry sources was set out in the Decision in tables at paras. 3.12 and 3.13, each table listing about 7 or 8 manufacturers including Ping. According to those data, in 2015 Ping was the leading manufacturer of some kinds of clubs and had a significant market presence in relation to other kinds.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Golf clubs must conform to the specifications set out by the Royal &amp; Ancient which decides whether a design of club is contrary to the rules of the game.  The leading manufacturers across all main categories of clubs supply custom fit clubs, allowing a golfer to specify variables including shaft type, shaft length, clubface lie angle, grip type and grip thickness based on the golfer’s personal measurements and other requirements. According to Ping, those competitors introduced their own custom fitting service in response to Ping’s success and to customer demand. The custom fitting of a customer in the retail premises takes about 30 – 90 minutes. The same service is carried out in the shop regardless of the brand being fitted; a consumer may try several brands of golf club to work out which one suits them best. The service generally involves the following steps: </p>

This includes the allocation of space for a driving range with a substantial proportion of Account Holders having a dedicated fitting studio. The majority of Account Holders who responded to Ping’s survey have invested in a launch monitor which costs between £5,000 for a basic model to £17,500 for a more sophisticated model. Ping also invests in this process by providing fitting clubs to Account Holders supplied solely for the purpose of the custom fitting process. Ping also organises a fitting education programme for the employees of Account Holders and fitting demonstration days at its own fitting centre at Gainsborough.   </p>

There are high levels of satisfaction recorded by those who have a custom fitting.  About 30 to 40% of Ping’s Account Holders provide the custom fitting service free of charge. Some of those who do charge a fee then deduct the fee from the cost of any purchase made. The fee is modest compared to the cost of the clubs.  </p>

There are some clubs which are supplied to retailers in standard fits to ensure that the brand achieves appropriate visibility in the retail stores. Then the appropriate club will be supplied to the customer after the dynamic custom fitting has taken place, if it has the right measurements for that golfer.  The price of the club for the customer is the same whether he buys one which the shop happens to have in stock or one that has been custom made. Each Ping club bears a serial number allowing Ping to replicate the club.  </p>

However, the CJEU has established that some vertical restrictions such as retail price maintenance and bans on exports between Member States will in almost all circumstances amount to restrictions of competition by object.  By contrast, some restrictions on the ability of a retailer to sell the goods supplied by the manufacturer may enable the manufacturer to compete better with manufacturers of competing goods (inter-brand competition) even though they limit the ability of the retailers to compete in their sales of the same manufacturer’s goods (intra-brand competition).  That is the case with selective distribution agreements, such as the one operated by Ping, where the manufacturer limits supplies to dealers which meet certain qualitative criteria. In Case 26/76 <span style="font-style:italic">Metro v Commission (No 1) </span>[1977] ECR 1875, EU:C:1977:167, the CJEU considered the legality of a policy adopted by a manufacturer of electrical products to exclude a ‘cash and carry’ outlet from its dealer network.  The CJEU held that where a selective distribution network is appropriate because of the nature of the goods, then even though restricting sales to certain outlets might reduce price competition to some extent, it was justified because it enhances competition by other means. The kinds of goods which have been held to justify the operation of a selective distribution network include luxury goods where the dealers admitted to the network have to have premises which maintain “an aura of luxury” and high tech products where the dealers may be required to have trained staff and offer adequate servicing arrangements before they are allowed to stock the goods: see paras. 7.098 – 7.100, Bellamy &amp; Child<span style="font-style:italic"> European Union Law of Competition </span>8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> ed (2018).  </p>

It must then be examined individually to determine whether it has the object or effect of restricting competition and if so whether it can benefit individually from the application of Article 101(3).  The CJEU has stated that there are no agreements which are incapable of exemption under Article 101(3) – in theory agreements containing hardcore restrictions or object restrictions can satisfy the four criteria in Article 101(3): see Case T-17/93 <span style="font-style:italic">Matra Hachette v Commission </span>[1994] ECR II-595, EU:T:1994:89, para. 85.

It was established to achieve the interoperability of systems for payment and money withdrawal so that holders of cards issued by any of the banks could withdraw money at any ATM installed in a retail premises by any member. The problem perceived by the members of the Group was that it was much easier for banks to issue cards to their account holders than it was for them to persuade retailers to install an ATM. The Group therefore wanted to encourage its members to acquire traders for the system as well as simply issuing cards. The element of the rules that came under particular scrutiny was a device known as ‘MERFA’ which, the Group said, aimed to encourage members who had a poor ratio of card issuing to trade acquisition to expand their acquiring activities by making them pay a levy to those other members of the group whose ratio of trader acquiring to card issuing was the other way round. The levy paid was then distributed to those members with a higher ratio of acquisition business. </p>

He described the advantages for a competition authority of being able to condemn restrictions by prohibiting “conduct which is generally considered, on the basis of economic analysis, to have harmful effects on competition”: para. 29. Such an approach also provides predictability and therefore legal certainty for businesses as well as having a deterrent effect and so helping to prevent anti-competitive conduct. It furthers procedural economy because it enables the competition authority to establish the anticompetitive impact of the conduct without conducting the often complex and timeconsuming examination of the potential or actual effects on the market concerned. However, he said, “such advantages materialise only if recourse to the concept of restriction by object is clearly defined, failing which this could encompass conduct whose harmful effects on competition are not clearly established.”: para. 36. </p>

The use of a website may have effects that extend beyond the distributor's own territory and customer group; however, such effects result from the technology allowing easy access from everywhere.

He approved the statement in paragraph 54 of the Vertical Guidelines that a supplier may require quality standards for the use of the internet to resell its goods, just as a supplier may require quality standards for a shop or for selling by catalogue or by advertising and promotion in general.  The Advocate General went on to consider whether, if he was wrong and the restriction did fall within Article 101(1), was it a restriction by object?

This was, the CMA found, by its very nature liable to restrict competition between Account Holders through an important sales channel both within the UK and across the EU more generally.

The CMA said that four questions were relevant to the proportionality of the ban: (i) does the ISP pursue a legitimate aim; (ii) is it suitable or appropriate to pursue that aim; (iii) is it necessary to pursue that aim or are there less restrictive and realistic alternatives; and (iv) is the burden imposed by the ISP disproportionate to the benefits secured.

However, the ISP had only a limited effect in increasing the proportion of customers having a face to face custom fitting and even if the percentage was higher, this was not necessarily the result of the ISP: paras. 4.106 and 4.113.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">As regards the last point, the CMA suggested various other less restrictive ways that could be used such as requiring the Account Holder to promote custom fitting on its online sales channel by displaying a clear notice on its website saying that custom fitting is preferable. The CMA also indicated that it would be permissible for Ping to require Account Holders to have an appropriate website with drop-down boxes enabling the customer to choose a certain range of relevant Ping custom fit options. This could form part of the quality standard to be met before the Account Holder was permitted to sell over the internet. It would then be for Account Holders to decide whether this was an investment they wanted to make. Other suggestions made in the Decision were that Account Holders could be required to offer a ‘live chat’ facility on their site and to ask customers to tick a box to confirm that they understand the benefits of custom fitting.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">These were measures, the CMA found, by which Ping could both ensure that the customer got the best possible fit and that they did not blame the Ping brand if the clubs did not improve their game as much as they had hoped. The CMA concluded the additional conditions that Ping could lawfully impose on Account Holders were “technically feasible, commercially viable and appropriate to promote Custom Fitting”. These conditions would also, clearly be less restrictive of competition than the outright prohibition currently in place.   </p>

It held that the assessment of whether the ISP satisfies the <span style="font-style:italic">Metro</span> criteria “is a binary assessment and not a balancing exercise”. The tribunal is not weighing up the likely pro-and anti-competitive effects of the restriction but considering whether a restriction is strictly necessary for non-price competition to exist. If it is not strictly necessary then the clause may nevertheless benefit from individual exemption. The CAT stated at para 96 that the assessment of whether a restriction satisfies the <span style="font-style:italic">Metro</span> criteria is conceptually distinct from that of whether the restriction is capable of being redeemed under Article 101(3). The proper place to weigh up the pros and cons of a measure is in the framework of Article 101(3).  </p>

The CAT examined in this context whether there were other measures which Ping could have adopted which were less restrictive of competition than the ISP and which would equally promote Ping’s objective of maximising custom fitting sales. The CAT concluded that the alternative measures which the CMA proposed would have been adequate and would not unacceptably compromise Ping’s objective of promoting custom fitting. </p>

The CAT held that those issues were not relevant to the object/effect stage of analysis but relevant only to the prior stage of considering whether the <span style="font-style:italic">Metro </span>criteria were met or to the later stage of exemption under Article 101(3).

The law on ‘object’ is set out authoritatively by the Court of Justice in <span style="font-style:italic">Cartes Bancaires</span> which makes no reference to proportionality. We should emphasise that we do not see any contradiction between <span style="font-style:italic">Pierre Fabre</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Cartes Bancaires</span>. In particular, we do not consider that it was the intention of the Court of Justice in <span style="font-style:italic">Pierre Fabre</span> to devise a special form of ‘by object’ assessment which incorporates proportionality considerations specifically for internet sales bans. On the contrary, it can be seen that the Court of Justice conducted a standard (albeit brief) assessment of the nature of the restriction in its relevant context at paras 35-38 of the judgment. The Court of Justice then went on to consider the separate question of ‘objective justification’ in paras 39-44 and concluded that the internet sales ban was unlikely to be proportionate. The reference to “objective justification” at para 47 of the <span style="font-style:italic">Pierre Fabre</span> decision is, in our view, best understood as a reference back to the <span style="font-style:italic">Metro</span> criteria, compliance with which would take the internet sales ban outside the prohibition in Article 101(1). </p>

At some point in the Decision the CMA had to deal with two important questions on which Ping’s defence was founded: whether it was true that the ISP increased the proportion of sales made by Ping after a custom fitting as compared with other manufacturers who do not restrict online sales and whether Ping was right to say that the ISP was important to protect its brand image from damage arising from golfers avoiding a custom fitting and then complaining to their fellow golfers about their Ping clubs. The CAT, having rejected the CMA’s approach, dealt with those questions as being relevant to the issue of whether the ISP satisfied the <span style="font-style:italic">Metro </span>criteria, even though it was not part of Ping’s case before the CAT that the policy did meet those criteria. It then cross-referred to that material in a short discussion of Article 101(3).  </p>

As it is, that section came after the discussion of the legal and economic context of the agreement but before the section setting out the CMA’s conclusions on the application of Article 101(1). I do not, however, share the CAT’s confidence that the CMA was wrong to address these issues under the umbrella of applying Article 101(1). There is no doubt that the key paragraph in <span style="font-style:italic">Pierre Fabre</span>, para 47, says that an online sales ban will be a restriction by object if it is apparent that the clause is not objectively justified.  I agree with the CAT that the CJEU was not setting some new test for establishing object restrictions in the context of internet sales bans.  It may be, as the CAT concluded, that that was a reference only to the <span style="font-style:italic">Metro </span>criteria. However, Advocate General Mazák in <span style="font-style:italic">Pierre Fabre </span>certainly dealt with the topic of “objective justification” under the general heading of “Anticompetitive object” in the course of considering the anticompetitive object of the ban. He stated at para. 38 of that Opinion that the threat of counterfeiting and the risk of free-riding were valid concerns in that regard, though in fact they were unfounded in relation to Pierre Fabre’s products.  Although the CJEU did not refer to proportionality in <span style="font-style:italic">Cartes Bancaires </span>it does appear at para. 75 of that judgment to have regarded the fact that combatting free riding was a legitimate objective as relevant to the question whether the MERFA was a restriction by object. Advocate General Wahl in <span style="font-style:italic">Cartes Bancaires </span>said only that a legitimate objective pursued by the restriction “is not directly relevant in determining the existence of a restriction of competition by object” and that the General Court had not been ‘wholly mistaken’ in concluding that it could be taken into account under Article 101(3) rather than Article 101(1): paras. 122-123. </p>

Although Advocate General Wahl in <span style="font-style:italic">Cartes Bancaires </span>stressed the importance of maintaining the distinction and gave some examples of factors which count as ‘economic context’, he acknowledged the undoubted truth that the CJEU’s jurisprudence has not yet settled a clear dividing line between the three different stages set out at para 94 of the Judgment and indicated what factors are relevant at which stage.

That shows that the CMA was not challenging the fact that the nature of Ping’s golf clubs meant that Ping was entitled to restrict admission to its network to retailers prepared to make the investment in and commitment to dynamic custom fitting. It shows further that, following Advocate General Wahl’s Opinion in <span style="font-style:italic">Coty</span>, the CMA recognised that Ping was entitled to restrict internet sales to the transactional websites of those Account Holders and to require them to promote custom fitting on their websites. The CAT did not take a different view.

I agree with the analysis of the CMA at para. 4.54 of the Decision and of the CAT at paras. 147 and 148 of the Judgment. The restriction is twofold. If Account Holders can sell online, then the market in which they compete against each other for sales of Ping clubs is expanded to cover any customer in the United Kingdom or beyond and is no longer limited to those who happen to be in the locality of their shop. The ISP stops this and limits the ability of retailers within the network to sell to customers who are outside the geographic range of their premises. Secondly, and as a result of the limitation on the ability of a retailer to compete for sales to customers beyond their geographic range, there is a diminution in price competition. The customer is unable to buy from the cheapest authorised dealer but is limited to the prices charged by those dealers whose shops he can visit.  Authorised dealers do not have to worry about lower prices being charged by dealers elsewhere in the country or in the rest of the EU because the customer cannot readily buy clubs from those dealers.  </p>

The Court held that insofar as the ban prohibited the sale of nonprescription medicines over the internet it was not justified. The CJEU rejected arguments based on the need for adequate advice and information to be provided to the customer, suggesting other ways by which that service could be provided online.

The Court had no difficulty in holding that the prohibition deprived traders from other Member States “of a particularly effective means of selling those products” and significantly impeded access of those traders to the market of the Member State concerned: para. 54. In arguments similar to those advanced by Ping in this case, the Hungarian government maintained that it was necessary to require customers to take delivery of contact lenses in specialist shops because they must have access to an optician who can carry out the necessary physical examinations, undertake checks and give those customers instructions on the wearing of the lenses. The Court, however, noted that the legislation in question did not require that an optician must make every supply of lenses dependent on a precautionary examination or on medical advice. The examination and the advice were optional and it was the responsibility of each contact lens customer to make use of them. The Court suggested other ways that the customer could be advised as part of the process of online selling such as by means of interactive features on the website concerned - the website could be set up so that the customer had to use the interactive feature before purchasing the lenses.  </p>

They refer to the evidence that customers are not able to assess their own requirements in the way that a trained fitter can and that a properly fitted club can enhance the performance of both amateur and professional golfers.

The data showed that the rate of Ping clubs sold following a custom fit was “somewhat higher” than the aggregated rates for other brands but the differential was a modest one and the evidence did not rule out that some rivals might in fact achieve higher rates than Ping.  The CAT also agreed with the CMA that the evidence did not establish the extent to which the difference between Ping’s rates and those of its competitors was attributable to the ISP.

If the restriction is partly anticompetitive (in this case to stop internet sales) but partly pro-competitive (in this case to improve the quality of the product by promoting dynamic custom fitting) that is sufficient to take the restriction out of the “object box”. The competition authority must then carry out an effects analysis to see whether the overall positive effect on quality outweighs the negative effects on price and availability. He argued that there is no balancing of pro-and anti-competitive elements at the object/effect stage. Rather the identification of credible, pro-competitive effects is enough to establish that the restriction is not a restriction by object.  In Ping’s case, he argued, it was accepted that the ISP enhanced competition based on quality. Once those high-level uncontested considerations were included in the object consideration, it was impossible to conclude that the restriction properly belonged in the object restriction box.  </p>

This means that agreements that have both procompetitive and anticompetitive effects are caught by the prohibition of Article 101(1) TFEU only where the latter prevail. For example, a reduction of price competition may be acceptable when it is a means to increase competition in relation to factors other than price. More generally, agreements that, despite being restrictive of the parties’ freedom of action, pursue the objective of, for example, opening up a market or creating a new one, or allowing new competitors to access a market, may be procompetitive. It equally follows from settled case-law that, under certain conditions, restrictions which are directly related and necessary to the implementation of a main operation, which is in itself not anticompetitive, do not constitute restrictions of competition within the meaning of Article 101(1) TFEU.  </p>

There are a number of answers to this point. The obvious one is that the figures reflect the current position on a market where the ISP has prohibited online sales of Ping clubs for many years. There is no doubt that some authorised dealers of Ping clubs want to sell the clubs from their internet websites. The CMA’s investigation was triggered by a complaint from such a dealer. In addition to that complainant, two other authorised dealers appeared as witnesses before the CAT on behalf of the CMA.  Those members of the network must have invested in installing in their premises the equipment and the professional personnel to offer dynamic custom fitting to customers as required by Ping before they can become Account Holders. They must realise that there is a risk that if online sales are permitted, a customer who comes into their shop and takes advantage of their investment and expertise might leave the shop without making a purchase and instead buy a set of clubs from a different authorised retailer who is offering them for sale more cheaply online. Yet those retailers considered that the best interests of their business lay in being able to sell Ping clubs online.  The second answer is that Ping has never put forward a defence based on lack of appreciable effect on trade, relying on the well-established case law under Article 101(1).  Its substantial market share would clearly make any such argument unsustainable.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgment there is no basis for any such criticism.  The fact of Ping’s selective distribution network and the legitimacy of that network given the nature of Ping clubs underlies the CAT’s reasoning at every stage. The CAT was fully aware of the fact that a certain degree of intra-brand restriction is inherent in a selective distribution network as recognised by the CJEU in <span style="font-style:italic">Metro </span>and by the Commission in Regulation 330/2010 and the Vertical Guidelines. The Judgment does not condemn the ISP simply on the basis of the restriction of intra-brand competition that is inherent in the operation of a legitimate selective distribution network. On the contrary, the CAT at para. 139 referred expressly to the effect of the ISP on intra-brand competition and noted further at para. 141 that the policy went further than the prohibition in <span style="font-style:italic">Coty</span>. The problem with the ISP is that price competition is prevented not merely as between authorised dealers and dealers outside the network but as among authorised dealers themselves, including among authorised dealers in different Member States.  Consumers can properly be prevented from buying from the sports goods equivalent of the ‘cash and carry’ outlet in <span style="font-style:italic">Metro </span>because such an outlet can legitimately be excluded from the network.  That is why any restrictions on the ability of authorised dealers to sell to each other and to end-users whether by active or passive sales are considered so detrimental to competition.  The CAT addressed the correct issue which was whether the ISP went beyond what was generally regarded as a necessary and legitimate diminution of intra-brand competition to restrict competition in a way which experience and economics have established reveals in itself a sufficient degree of harm to merit being regarded as an object infringement. They concluded that it did and I see no basis for challenging that conclusion.  </p>

They believe that they know best how to market their own product and that the ISP promotes dynamic custom fitting for the benefit of their customers – according to Ping’s managing director it is “part of Ping’s DNA”.  The CJEU’s case law has always acknowledged the advantages of selective distribution networks for luxury or highly technical goods. In that way, competition law allows the manufacturer to control the way its products are presented to the consumer in order to maximise their sales in competition with other manufacturers’ competing products.  Advocate General Wahl in <span style="font-style:italic">Coty</span> described how a supplier with a selective distribution network will recognise that the stricter the selection criteria it imposes, the greater the risk of loss of market and of customers.  In the absence of market power the supplier will in principle, he said, “self-regulate its conduct in a way that conforms to the competition rules”: para.44.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">For this reason EU competition rules have respected to some extent a manufacturer’s choices as to how best to promote its product: but only to some extent. The CJEU has never been content to rely only on the kind of ‘self-regulation’ to which Advocate General Wahl referred to ensure that competition is not restricted.  As Ms Demetriou reminded us, the application of Article 101(1) to restrictions on intra-brand competition was considered by the Court at a very early stage, in the seminal case of Case C-56/64 <span style="font-style:italic">Consten and Grundig </span>EU:C:1966:41.  That judgment established that the Court does not regard inter-brand competition as sufficient to bring about the optimal use of resources. The competition rules do not rely on suppliers ‘selfregulating’  by leaving them free to set the terms on which undertakings further down the distribution chain market their goods to the ultimate consumer. The retailer also has a commercial interest and expertise in marketing the goods successfully. Since <span style="font-style:italic">Consten and Grundig</span>, the dividing line between what it is legitimate for the manufacturer to decide and what must be left to the choice of the retailer has been carefully drawn. The detailed provisions of Regulation 330/2010 and the Vertical Guidelines show the drawing of boundaries between active and passive sales in exclusive distribution networks, between resale price maintenance and recommended or maximum pricing, and now between outright bans on internet sales and restrictions which replicate more precisely the boundaries already established for permissible restrictions imposed on authorised dealers’ bricks and mortar shops.  The argument underlying Ping’s case – that it should be allowed to decide for itself how best dealers should market its goods in competition with other manufacturers – is not an argument that has found favour in EU competition cases and it cannot succeed here.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">It may turn out that sales of Ping clubs over the internet will remain a minority of Ping’s overall sales for the foreseeable future. There is nothing in the Decision or in the judgments of the CAT or of this court which prevents Ping from continuing to insist that its Account Holders invest in custom fitting apparatus and do their best to persuade golf club consumers of the benefits of dynamic custom fitting. As the CMA made clear in its Decision, this policy can be reflected in requirements that Ping is entitled to impose on its Account Holders as regards their website design.  No doubt Ping’s authorised retailers are highly skilled at closing the transaction with a customer who has a dynamic custom fitting.  No individual dealer is obliged to offer Ping clubs for sale on its website if it does not want to, once it is made clear to him that he is free to do so. The possibility of such an outcome does not, in my view, prevent the ISP being a restriction by object.  If, after the ISP is adapted to comply with the CAT’s judgment and this court’s judgment, dynamic custom fitting in the future remains an important channel through which Ping clubs are sold, that will be the result of the market determining by the operation of ordinary competitive forces that dealers and consumers have chosen that sales route. It will not be the result of a policy imposed by Ping.  </p>

Para. 38 of <span style="font-style:italic">Allianz Hungária </span>is simply confirming the point that where a restriction is a restriction by object there is no need to consider the effects of the agreement in order to establish the infringement.  At para. 48 of <span style="font-style:italic">Allianz Hungária </span>the CJEU was envisaging one of a number of scenarios that might emerge from the subsequent investigation by the domestic court.  The Court was not laying down a requirement that a restriction is only an infringement by object if it will lead to the elimination or serious weakening of competition on the relevant market.  None of the cases in which object restrictions have been found to exist refer to the need to establish a substantial weakening or elimination of competition. To set the threshold for object restrictions so high, even if only for vertical agreements, would be inconsistent with the application of Article 101(1) which does not depend on market power of the undertakings concerned. I note that the CJEU concluded by confirming that it must be ‘apparent’ that the restrictions are by their very nature injurious to competition.  </p>

If the CAT had applied a test along the lines that the ISP would be an object restriction if there was a non-fanciful possibility of the policy causing a sufficient degree of harm, then that would be an error of law.  However, I do not accept that that is the test that the CAT in fact applied.  The CAT correctly recorded at para. 143 that the conclusion of the CMA was that the ISP “revealed” a sufficient degree of harm, not just that a sufficient degree of harm was a likely or non-fanciful consequence. The relevant question which the CAT said it needed to address was the correct question namely: does the agreement reveal a sufficient degree of harm to be considered a restriction by object: see para. 94(2).  The degree of likelihood of harm was not identified by the CAT as one of the issues in the appeal: para. 124.  There is a discussion of the burden of proof and the presumption of innocence at para. 108 but no discussion of the standard of proof to indicate that the CAT was applying some test other than that set down in the CJEU case law it cites. On the contrary, the key paras. 147 and 148 setting out the CAT’s conclusions describe the potential impact of the ISP as real and material and as significantly restricting access to Ping’s goods.  I am satisfied that these show that the CAT applied the correct test and that there was no error of law in the CAT’s approach to the standard of proof.  </p>

There is no basis for interfering with the CAT’s decision on this point.  The fact that the CMA’s approach to the infringement in the Statement of Objections differed from that taken in the Decision does not, in my view, indicate that Ping could not have foreseen the outcome of the investigation.

The General Court noted that the infringement found by the Commission dated back to a period before the Commission had itself defined its views on the application of the rules to maritime transport.  The Commission had by its conduct led the applicants to believe that their agreement was not unlawful: see paras. 483 and 485. That is not the position here.  In COMP/38.096 <span style="font-style:italic">Clearstream (clearing and settlement) </span>(decn of 2 June 2004) the Commission said that there was no EU decisional practice or case law relating to the complex area of clearing and settlement services so that the decision was the first time the issue of market definition had been considered. That was why it decided not to impose a fine despite finding that Clearstream’s tariff amounted to an abuse of its dominant position: para. (344).  Again, as I have described, this case is not the first time that internet sales prohibitions in selective distribution networks have been considered by a competition authority. Finally, Ping rely on IV/31.906 <span style="font-style:italic">Italian flat glass </span>(decn 7 December 1988) where the Commission did not impose a fine for the abuse of the collective dominant position. However, the Commission did impose substantial fines for the same conduct when characterised as a breach of Article 101.

We have also considered whether the CMA effectively ‘remedied’ this error in step 4 of its calculation by substantially reducing the fine amount produced by the first three steps of the calculation. In our view, however, the fine imposed is slightly too high and a further small reduction is therefore appropriate. Rather than mechanistically applying a 10% reduction to the fine we will take a view in the round. On consideration, we consider that a fair and proportionate fine, taking into account that it was not an ‘aggravated’ infringement, should be £1.25 million. This equates to a fine of </p>

In my judgment, however, the CAT was entitled to take a view of the fine “in the round” as it did in para. 254.  Although it did not expressly refer back to its finding that the infringement had been negligent rather than intentional, that is no basis for saying that its overall decision on the appropriate level of the fine was flawed. </p>

As Ping’s ISP states, it believes that it is fundamental to the process of selling its clubs that the consumer is “custom-fitted to ensure they receive clubs that are custom-built to their own specifications”.  It does not, however, follow in my view that that desirable objective requires the imposition of a complete ban on internet sales.  Some customers may, for example, already know their personal specifications after a recent dynamic custom fitting and wish to buy a second or third set of clubs online.  Others may wish to buy a set of Ping clubs as a gift for someone whose essential data are known.  There are many ways in which Ping’s objective can be substantially fulfilled without imposing a blanket ban on internet sales. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Moreover, I do not think that the growing popularity of the internet as a sales medium can be minimised.  It may be that, when the CMA reached its decision, relatively few customers actually bought their golf clubs online.  But the speed of the internet is increasing and we are living in an age of technological innovation.  It would, I think, be inappropriate in this context for us to accept that the ISP did not reveal a sufficient degree of harm to competition to be considered a restriction of competition by object within the meaning of Article 101(1).  Applying paragraph 47 of the CJEU’s decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Pierre Fabre</span>, Article 101(1) must, in my view, be interpreted as meaning that, in the context of this selective distribution system, a contractual clause requiring sales of golf clubs after a dynamic custom fitting effectively in physical premises, and banning any type of internet sales of such clubs, amounts to a restriction by object.  I reach that conclusion having paid full regard to the content and objective of the ISP and the legal and economic context in which it is set.  Put simply, having regard to all </p>
