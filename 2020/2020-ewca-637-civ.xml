	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">This appeal concerns the scope and effect of the “one voice” principle which is that where Her Majesty’s Government has recognised the existence of a foreign state, or a person or body as the government of a foreign state, the English Court is bound to treat the state as a sovereign state, and the government as the government of a sovereign state, in its determination of disputes before it.  The Court does so because in this country the recognition of foreign states and governments is constitutionally part of the function of Her Majesty’s Government as the executive branch of the state, and the Crown must speak with one voice in its executive and judicial functions in this aspect of international relations.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The principle falls to be applied in this case to the government of Libya following the fall in 2011 of the regime of Muammar al-Qadhafi, commonly referred to as Colonel Gaddafi.  As is well known, there followed a period of political turmoil and fighting which to some extent continues to this day.  The relevant parts of the history can be summarised briefly.  After the revolution  a National Transitional Council (“NTC”) was formed to govern Libya and was for a while recognised internationally as the Libyan government, including by Her Majesty’s Government (“HMG”) on 27 July 2011.  On 3 August 2011 the NTC made a Constitutional Declaration.  In July 2012 elections were held for members of a new General National Congress (“GNC”), which at its first sitting in August 2012 dissolved the NTC.  In June 2014 elections were held for a new parliament, the House of Representatives (“HoR”). However due to continuing conflicts between different factions, two rival governments emerged: a GNC mandated government based in Tripoli in the West of Libya, sometimes referred to as the Tripoli government,  and an “interim” government backed by the HoR based in Tobruk in the East, sometimes referred to as the Tobruk government.  In September 2014 the United Nations Support Mission in Libya, which had been established by the United Nations Security Council (“UNSC”) in 2011, sought to procure a negotiated settlement between the various factions in what became known as the “Libyan Political Dialogue”.  This was widely supported by the international community, including by HMG, and culminated in the signing by its participants on 17 December 2015 of the Libyan Political Agreement (“LPA”). </p>

The HoR was to be the legislative authority; and there was to be a third consultative body, the State Council.  The LPA was intended to amend the Constitutional Declaration and replace it where inconsistent.   Article 1(4) of the LPA provided that the GNA was to have a term of one year from a vote of confidence by the HoR.  On 25 January 2016, the HoR voted in favour of the LPA, although it reserved its position on one article which is not here relevant.  The HoR has never, however, passed a vote of confidence in the GNA as contemplated by Article 1(4).   </p>

He was joined to the proceedings in the court below so that he should be bound by the result.  A few weeks ago, an application was made on his behalf by Farrer &amp; Co that  he be joined to these appeals.  The other parties consented to such joinder, or did not oppose it, and we made an order accordingly.  It was made clear that he did not intend to take an active part in the appeals and that his role at the hearing would be limited to that of a watching brief.  On the eve of the hearing of the appeal, Farrer and Co wrote to the Court asking that the joinder be set aside on the basis that the solicitors had misunderstood the scope of their instructions and that they had not had authority from Dr Derregia to seek his joinder despite deposing to the contrary in the witness statement in support of the application; and stating that he would not therefore be represented at the hearing.  The letter concluded “I am instructed that, notwithstanding that this would mean Dr Derregia would cease to be a party to the appeals he accepts that he is bound by the outcome of them.”   The other parties to the appeal were neutral on the application to set aside joinder, save that Mr Pymont QC for Dr Mahmoud emphasised that the important thing was that he should be bound by the result.  For my part I would not accede to the application.  His joinder was sought and made specifically for the purposes of his being bound by the outcome, which is obviously desirable and was why he was joined to the proceedings below, without objection, after the judgments under appeal.  One is entitled to entertain a degree of scepticism about his motives for seeking to replace his joinder, whose only purpose was to ensure he was bound rather than to participate, with a statement from his solicitor as to his instructions that he will treat himself as bound, especially in circumstances in which the solicitor has previously apparently misunderstood the scope of his instructions.  The desirability of his being bound by the outcome of the appeals is best achieved by his remaining joined.   </p>

One proceeded to a trial in the Chancery Division before Rose J (as she was then) in which the LIA's claims failed.  The other proceeded to the eve of a trial in the Commercial Court before Teare J, when it was settled on terms which involved the LIA recovering something close to US$1 billion.   The rival claims to chairmanship of the LIA threatened to derail the LIA's ability to pursue the litigation by reason of the uncertainty as to who was capable of taking responsibility for the litigation on the LIA’s behalf and giving instructions in its name.  The solution adopted was the making of receivership orders over particular assets, essentially in the form of causes of action which could then be pursued by the appointed receivers on behalf of, and for the benefit of, the LIA. The first such order in point of time was made on 9 July 2015 by Flaux J (as he was then), appointing the Third Respondents, partners of BDO Stoy Hayward, as the Receivers and Managers. There have been subsequent applications and orders extending and defining the scope and conduct of the receivership.  The receivership remains in place pending resolution of the chairmanship claims.  The Receivers and Managers are parties to the current appeals but have taken a neutral stance both on appeal and below.

Mr Bouhadi claimed to derive his title from the HoR affiliated government in Tobruk, and Mr Breish, as identified above, from the GNC.

Dr Hussein additionally advanced the argument outlined at paragraph 16.7.1 of his Addendum to Position Statement that Libyan Law and the LPA required the HoR’s approval of the Board of Trustees or its consultation in the appointment process (this being a separate argument from that based on the HoR being part of the executive government, which was advanced as the consultation/approval issue raised at paragraph 16.6).

As Mance J observed in <span style="font-style:italic">Kuwait Airways Co v Iraqi Airways Co </span>[1999] 1 LRC 223 at p. 267, in a particular case HMG must remain free to take and to inform the court of a more categorical attitude regarding recognition or nonrecognition of a foreign government.  It does not follow from the general policy that there will be reluctance to do so in some individual cases.  The given rationale for reluctance would not arise in a case in which HMG would not be concerned if such recognition were treated as approval of the new regime.  It is clear from the evidence of the public support for Prime Minister al-Sarraj’s GNA by HMG and the UN, some </p>

Moreover the reluctance implicit in the general policy might give way where it is desirable to make a statement of recognition of the de facto status of a government for some particular objective.   That also applies in the current context where the statements have been made in order to assist in resolving the deadlock in the LIA’s ability to exercise effective control as Libya’s sovereign wealth fund for the benefit of all the Libyan people, an objective which HMG and the UN have repeatedly endorsed in public statements, some of which I refer to below.  Moreover it is not uncommon for the FCO to refer expressly to the 1980 policy in qualifying what is said in a statement, as it did for example in its statement in <span style="font-style:italic">Gur v Trust Bank</span>.  The absence of such qualification in this case is a further indication that the 1980 policy is not a significant consideration. </p>

There was some debate in the course of argument as to what was meant by “legitimate”.  Ms Fatima QC argued that it did not mean lawful under local constitutional law, and that if it did, it went beyond the scope of the prerogative function of the executive which the one voice principle would oblige the courts to follow.  I am inclined to accept that argument.  However the concept of legitimacy used in this context seems to me to convey at least recognition of de facto status as a government.  Mr Sprange QC argued that “support” did not necessarily connote recognition; it was consistent with support of a process of progress towards government which had not yet occurred.  However this is not an interpretation which can fairly be put upon it in the light of the other language used and the public statements and conduct of HMG more generally. </p>

I am quite satisfied that no unfairness has resulted from the course taken in this case.  The first FCO letter recorded that the FCO would normally set out its views in answer to a request from the court or a request from all parties, but was doing so on this occasion in response to one party’s request on the basis that the information set out was already a matter of public record.  The evidence in the case shows that to be fully justified.  The letters followed a request to the Court from Flaux J in relation to the initial rival claims to chairmanship of the LIA, and the FCO knew that the letters were intended to be produced to the Court for the purposes of the current dispute.  As such one would expect them to contain the carefully considered views of HMG for use in a public forum and possible widespread dissemination, and their language confirms this impression.   In fairness to Mr Sprange, this point was pressed only faintly.  What I have said is also an answer to his reliance on passages in the notes of the meetings which preceded the letters.  The passages relied on do not in fact advance Dr Hussein’s case, but even if they did, I would be loath to accord them any significance when they were merely part of a general discussion to explore what the FCO might say which was then superseded by a carefully worded communication of the FCO’s position.  </p>

Mr Sprange submitted that references to the LPA mean that HMG must also recognise the legislative authority of the HoR under the LPA.  Whether or not that is so, however, is of no relevance to the current dispute which concerns acts of the GNA which fall within the natural sphere of executive authority, and which are moreover treated as such by the LPA itself: Article 1(2) assigns to the GNA “the tasks of executive authority” and Article 9(1) provides that the Council of Ministers will ensure normal functioning of public state institutions and structures, which clearly encompasses the LIA.  A valiant argument by Ms Fatima that the GNA exercised some legislative functions, based on some Libyan law evidence before the Judge at the recent trial that GNA resolutions were one of a series of sources of law, is nothing to the point.  What has been recognised is the GNA as a government in its proper sphere of executive authority, and such sphere encompasses the acts in issue in this case, namely the appointment of a Board of Trustees to oversee the management of one of the key state institutions which manages state assets.     </p>

Such challenges may take as their starting point that the government is the government of the state.  From that starting point, they proceed by arguing that an act of the government is unlawful or ineffective under local law. That is so of the arguments which the appellants have not been precluded from advancing in this case in their challenge to the validity of Resolution 12 and/or Resolution 1 under Libyan law, and which were considered by the Judge in his 2020 Judgment, such as abuse of power.  However where the alleged unlawfulness does not take as its starting point that the government is the government, it inevitably conflicts with the recognition given to the government by HMG and engages the one voice principle.  The latter is the position in relation to the two particular challenges which are the subject matter of the appeal. The vote of confidence issue involves asserting that the GNA is not and never has been the executive authority of the government of Libya because its term could not start without a vote of confidence.  That is stated in terms at paragraph (4) of the particulars under paragraph 12.5 of Mr Breish’s amended Position Statement. The additional consultation/approval issue raised by Dr Hussein involves asserting that the GNA is not the sole effective executive authority of the government but that it shares executive power with the HoR.  Both are inconsistent with, and irreconcilable with, the recognition afforded by HMG in this case.  Were the Court to allow a challenge on this basis it would be speaking with a second voice because an essential element of its reasoning would be to deny the effect of HMG’s recognition of GNA as the sole executive authority. </p>

The bank in that case sought an injunction to restrain the two defendant employees from continuing to claim control of the London branch and authority to act on its behalf in London, following the determination of their authority by a new board of directors in Spain appointed in substitution for the existing board by order of 5 January 1937 by the Basque State, an autonomous state constituted within the Spanish State in 1936.  The main issue was whether the decrees of the Basque Government were as a matter of Spanish law valid to constitute the new board of directors as the legal executive organ of the bank.  Lewis J held that they were not as a result of certain provisions in the Spanish Constitution.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The outcome of the appeal turned on entirely different issues because events had moved on in two respects.  First, General Franco’s Nationalist forces had occupied Bilbao on 19 June 1937 and the rest of the Basque region in August 1937.  The British Government recognised the Nationalist Government as exercising de facto control in the region at and from that time, whilst also recognising the Republican Government of Spain as having de jure sovereignty over the region.  Secondly, the Republican Government sought to protect the banks in that region by decreeing on 22 August 1937 that the seat of the banks, including the Banco di Bilbao, should have their registered offices and domicile transferred to Valencia or Barcelona; and, critically, by a further presidential decree of 30 September 1937 the substance of which was to validate retrospectively the decrees of the Basque autonomous Government which Lewis J had found to be defective under Spanish law.  In this court there was no attempt to impugn Lewis J’s reasoning in relation to the provisions of the Spanish Constitution which had invalidated the Basque Government decree of 1936; instead reliance was placed on the retrospective validation by the Republican Government. The issue of whether the London employees were answerable to the new board of directors therefore now depended upon the English Court according validity to the 30 September 1937 decree of the Republican Government retrospectively validating the 1936 decree, but made at a time when HMG recognised the Nationalist Government as the de facto government of the Basque region including Bilbao, where the bank’s domicile was at the time.  That was the critical issue because the question as to what body of directors had the legal right to represent the bank was governed by the law from time to time prevailing at the place it was set up, ie Bilbao.   </p>

Ms Fatima made clear that Mr Breish does not contend that there is any government in Libya other than the GNA.  Mr Sprange associated himself with this contention, although I confess that I do not understand how on the facts of this case Dr Hussein can claim valid appointment as Chairman of the LIA without asserting that the HoR affiliated government in Tobruk which appointed the Board of Trustees by whom he was appointed was the government instead of the GNA.

However on the facts of this case it is a distinction without a difference.  The two specific challenges to the relevant acts of the GNA, the vote of confidence challenge and the consultation/approval challenge, are necessarily challenges to its existence because they proceed from the premise that the GNA is not and has never been the sole executive government of Libya.  If the court were to entertain and accept the argument, it would set the HMG recognition of the GNA as the sole executive government at nought, because it would involve saying that the government so recognised cannot validly do anything, or cannot validly do so without consultation with the HoR or its approval.  The arguments which the one voice principle precludes in this case are in substance a challenge to the existence of a recognised foreign government, not merely to its acts.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The suggested qualification to the concession that the English Court cannot consider the question of constitutional lawfulness, namely that that is so only “for the purposes of refusing to recognise the foreign government”, is not only contrary to the statements in the authorities to which I have referred that it cannot do so “for any purpose” and that the binding effect of the FCO statement is “without any qualification”.  It is also incoherent.  Unlike HMG, the Court does not recognise (or refuse to recognise) foreign governments as an exercise in itself, but considers the question of the status of such governments, in cases where the issue arises, because it is asked to decide the private rights and obligations of the parties before it; and the Court accepts the sovereign status of a state or government (or refuses to do so), whenever the status of sovereignty so accepted (or refused) has consequences for the private rights of the parties.  It is misleading to talk of the Court itself as according or refusing “recognition” or having that purpose.  What it is doing is making a determination of the sovereign status of the foreign government as part of its reasoning in the case, whether with or without the assistance of recognition by HMG.  Where there is recognition (or non-recognition) by HMG it settles the question of the sovereign status for the purpose of the task on which the Court is engaged, which is to apply that status to the working out of the rights of the parties.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Ms Fatima argued that the challenges did not involve saying that the GNA could not take any steps which would be recognised as lawful.  She relied on the Advisory Opinion of the International Court of Justice in <span style="font-style:italic">Legal Consequences for States of the Continued Presence of South Africa</span> in Namibia (South West Africa) ICJ Reports 1971 paragraph 125, to the effect that even where there is no recognised government, some acts of those exercising authority may be accorded validity where they are acts necessary for the well-being of the inhabitants such as registration of births, marriages and deaths.  Mr Sprange made a similar submission by reference to the decision of Roberts J in  <span style="font-style:italic">MM v NA (Declaration of Marital Status: Unrecognised State)</span> [2020] EWHC 93 Fam at [66].  This is a theme reflected in obiter statements by Lord Wilberforce in <span style="font-style:italic">Carl Zeiss</span> at p. 954; by Lord Denning MR in <span style="font-style:italic">Hesperides Hotels Ltd v Aegean Turkish Holidays Ltd </span>[1978] QB 205 at 217-218; and by Sir John Donaldson in <span style="font-style:italic">Gur</span> at p. 622.  These are to the effect that where there is no recognised government of a state, so that official acts of governance are normally treated as a nullity, it may nevertheless be necessary exceptionally to accord recognition to the validity of some private rights under its laws or acts of everyday occurrence, or perfunctory administrative acts, so as to avoid an unfortunate lacuna in relation to essential aspects of daily life.  As Sir John Donaldson put it “it is one thing to treat a state or government as being ‘without the law’ but quite another to treat the inhabitants of its territory as “outlaws” who cannot effectively marry, beget legitimate children, purchase goods on credit or undertake countless day-to-day activities having legal consequences.”  However this concept has no relevance to the present case.  Unlike the present case it addresses a situation where there is no recognised government.  Moreover it applies to routine administrative acts quite unlike the central government function exercised by the GNA in passing Resolution 12 which is at issue in this case.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">It was also suggested by both Ms Fatima and Mr Sprange that the Judge’s conclusion confused or conflated the one voice principle with other doctrines, in particular with those of foreign act of state, of non-justiciability, and of public international law immunities.  Mr Sprange went so far as to submit that the Judge’s interpretation of the scope of the one voice principle subsumed other doctrines of non-justiciability or act of state which were carefully delimited by the Supreme Court in<span style="font-style:italic"> Belhaj v Straw</span> [2017] AC 964.  I detect no such confusion, conflation or subsumption.   There are separate and distinct steps in the inquiry in cases in which the doctrines arise.  The first is whether the Court is bound to treat a body as a sovereign government; the second, if it arises, asks whether, in the light of the answer to the first question, issues dependent upon the acts of such a government are justiciable.  The other international law doctrines referred to are relevant to this second stage.  This distinction was clear in <span style="font-style:italic">Luther v Sagor</span> where both doctrines were applied: the one voice principle was applied to determine that the acts of the Soviet Government were acts of a sovereign government because it was recognised as such by HMG; and then there was applied one aspect of the foreign act of state doctrine, namely that the courts will not question the validity of the act of a foreign sovereign government in relation to title to property within its territory (Lord Neuberger’s second rule in <span style="font-style:italic">Belhaj v Straw</span> [2017] AC 964 at paragraph [122], [127]).  The two separate steps are apparent from the judgment of Warrington LJ at p 548.  Lord Neuberger recognised in paragraph [132] of <span style="font-style:italic">Belhaj </span>that the one voice principle was a “rather a different point” from the scope of the foreign act of state doctrine there under consideration.  However none of that is of any relevance to the issue under appeal, which does not engage any of the other international law doctrines referred to.  It seemed to be being suggested that it was the exclusive role of those other international law doctrines, such as foreign act of state, principles of nonjusticiability and pubic international law immunities, to regulate <span style="font-style:italic">all legal consequences </span>of recognition.  That is plainly not so, as the <span style="font-style:italic">Bank of Ethiopia</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Banco de Bilbao</span> cases demonstrate.  In those cases the one voice principle was determinative of the legal consequences because it identified the appropriate government from whom the relevant law to be applied flowed.  In truth none of these other aspects of international law referred to by the Appellants have any bearing on the issue under appeal.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Sprange also invited us to embark upon a comparative law analysis of how other states approach these issues.  This is an area in which I would be cautious about attributing weight to the practices of other countries because the one voice principle depends upon the constitutional settlement in this country of the respective roles of the executive and the judiciary. But however that may be, none of the cases from other jurisdictions to which we were referred is analogous, and I have not found in them any statement of principle or settled practice which illuminates the issue before this court or casts any doubt on the analysis set out above.  </p>
