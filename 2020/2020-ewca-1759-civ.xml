It concluded, and we agree, that the best approach to the interpretation of bilingual legislation, where different language texts bear different meanings, and where it is not possible to reach an interpretation consistent with the literal meaning of both language versions, is to discern the legislative intention by reference to the purposes or objects of the legislation as they appear from the texts, rather than by searching for a shared meaning.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="1">

	      </authorialNote> The court should, we think, apply normal principles of statutory interpretation to its analysis of the meaning of both texts equally. There should be no special rule about the admissibility of pre-legislative material and legislative history, but the court should always be astute to the possibility that such materials may favour one language version. </p>

Where legislation is enacted in two languages of equal standing, and the parties submit that there is, or may be, a conflict, difference or distinction between the two language versions, detailed analysis of each version may be necessary. Where it is not suggested that the different language versions differ in meaning, the court can be sure that either version reflects the intention of the legislature. Counsel for the Welsh Language Commissioner accepted that this was the position. The approach is also consistent with the principle of ensuring equal standing for both languages, and accords with the position adopted by the Law Commission.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="2">

In this case, however, we did not feel we were handicapped in deciding the question of construction that arose. The court was able to engage in oral debate with counsel about the proper meaning of the Welsh text. The questions of interpretation of the Welsh text of section 50 that arose were accessible to non-Welsh speakers, as the judge’s judgment at first instance amply demonstrated. We agree that the use of expert evidence or translations of the Welsh language is inadequate. The court must engage with the Welsh text and Welsh rules of syntax. But we believe, as this judgment will demonstrate, that we have been able to do so fully and competently in this case.  </p>

But there will also be many cases where it is not imperative. There will be a spectrum from the simple construction of one word or a short sub-section or phrase on the one hand, to the need to delve into an entire Welsh language statutory regime on the other hand. This case is at one end of that spectrum and we have felt confident that the comprehensive submissions we received as to the proper construction of the Welsh text have enabled us to apply the rules we have set out, and reach an appropriate conclusion, according equal status to both texts as the legislation requires. </p>

They submitted that, properly interpreted, a proposal fell within section 50(2)(a) where the school provided education suitable to sixth formers only. It did not include proposals for schools which provided sixth form education alongside other secondary education for those aged 16 and below. To interpret section 50(2)(a) in that way would render the inclusion of the word “only” in the English text and the phrase “yn unig” in the Welsh text redundant. Mr Milford submitted that that was consistent with the White Paper which preceded the legislation, and the Explanatory Memorandum which accompanied it, both of which are permissible aids in the interpretation of legislation enacted by the Senedd. </p>

Mr Williams accepted that, strictly, the final clause before “yn unig” was “sydd personau dros oedran ysgol gorfodol” and qualified those persons, in English, above compulsory school age. He submitted that the phrase read more naturally as part of the clause beginning “sy’n addas”. Further, when the legislative drafters intended to make it clear that a provision applied to a school which provided sixth form education only and no other, it said so in clear terms as was the case, for example, in section 71. </p>

Otherwise the phrase “yn unig” and the word “only” would be redundant. That reflected the context and structure of the legislation as a whole. Further, the Welsh Ministers had an interest in sixth form education as they have a duty to secure the provision of proper facilities for the education of and training of persons aged 16 to 19 (see section 31 of the Learning and Skills Act 2000).

It is clear from the structure and words of section 50 that it is defining the circumstances when a proposal requires the approval of the Welsh Ministers. Approval is required “if” the proposals fall within one of the two situations in section 50(1)(a) or (b), that is they affect sixth form education or the proposals were made by someone other than a local authority and the authority objects. Section 50(2) then defines when a proposal affects sixth form education. A proposal will do so “if” it falls within (a) or (b). The use of the word “if” is conditional: where the proposal falls within section 50(2)(a) or (b), it is a proposal affecting sixth form education. Put differently, the section identifies the two sets of proposals which require approval. It is not intended to be an illustrative list of proposals which fall within section 50. Further, the construction favoured by the judge is not consistent with the overall purpose of the statutory provisions. The legislative changes were intended to reduce the number of proposals referred to the Welsh Ministers for approval. A construction which regarded the proposals listed in section 50(2) as non-exhaustive, or illustrative, would create uncertainty as to whether a proposal did, or might, affect sixth form education and would be likely to lead to a greater number of proposals being referred. That would run counter to the aim of reducing the number of proposals referred.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">On ground 2, we think that the essential question is what the Senedd intended in enacting section 50(2)(a) of the 2013 Act/Deddf. The issue is whether the Senedd intended proposals for schools solely providing sixth form education to be referred to the Welsh Ministers for approval or whether, as the judge found, proposals to close a school that provided sixth form education should be referred for approval whether or not the school also provided education to other age groups. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">First, as a matter of the language of the section, the intention was, in our view, to require that proposals to close schools providing solely sixth form education be referred for approval. The inclusion of the word “only” and the phrase “yn unig” must have been intended by the Senedd to have some meaning. The only sensible meaning that those words can have is that proposals for establishing or closing schools providing a particular type of education – and only that education – should be referred for approval. Section 50(2)(a), read as a whole, describes or qualifies the types of schools where proposals for closure must be referred. These are “proposals to discontinue or establish a school” or “yn gynigion i sefydlu neu derfynu ysgol”. The words that follow “school” and “ysgol” are intended, progressively, to describe or narrow the types of school to which the subsection applies. Put simply, they describe what the school must be doing and for whom. In English, the schools must be “providing education” and that education must be “suitable only” to meet the requirements of “persons above compulsory school age”. In Welsh, “yr ysgol” must be one which “darparu addysg”, the type of “addysg” is that “addas at angehnion” of a particular group of persons namely those “dros oedran ysgol gorfodol yn unig”. In each case, the clause is seeking to define what types of school fall within section 50(2)(a), namely those providing sixth from education only. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">On the interpretation accepted by the judge, as Mr Williams accepted, the subsection would have the same meaning whether or not the word “only” or the phrase “yn unig” were included. The subsection would apply to a school providing sixth form education (whether or not it also provided education for other age groups). That result could be achieved by providing that the school is “providing education suitable to the requirements of persons above compulsory school age” (with “only” omitted) or the “ysgol sy’n darparu addysg sy’n addas at anghenion personau dros oedran ysgol gorfodol” (with “yn unig” omitted). We do not consider that the Senedd would have included words which had no purpose and conveyed no meaning. Nor do we consider that questions of syntax compel the conclusion that the legislature included words that had no meaning. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Secondly, that conclusion is reinforced by the following considerations. The provisions of this Part of the 2013 Act/Deddf read as a whole make it clear that the interest of the Welsh Ministers lies with the establishment and closure of sixth form schools, not schools which provide sixth form education as one component of the provision of education to a wider age range. Section 71 provides that the Welsh Ministers may make proposals to establish or discontinue a school providing secondary education to sixth formers (and makes that clear by the use of the words “and no other”). The same is true of the Welsh language text. The language is clear in section 71 – it has to be education suitable “for sixth formers” and “no other”; in Welsh “disgyblion chweched dosbarth (ac nid unrhyw addysg uwchradd arall)”. But the section serves to emphasise that the interest of the Welsh Ministers is in sixth form education only. That is reflected in section 50(2) which is similarly concerned “only” or “yn unig” with the provision of education for those above compulsory school age. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Thirdly, that interpretation is consistent with the White Paper which preceded the legislation, and the Explanatory Memorandum which accompanied the Bill/Bil which became the 2013 Act/Deddf. We considered the Welsh and English versions of the White Paper, even though it was not suggested that there was any material difference between them. The White Paper provides that as responsibility for school places rests with local education authorities, rather than the Welsh Government, decisions should in the vast majority of cases be made at local level. It sets out a series of additional concerns such as the delays in approval or the fact that an objection by a single objector triggered a referral. It stated that the intention was: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The natural reading of that passage is that the Welsh Ministers will be concerned with proposals that affect sixth forms only.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The description of the changes as affecting the vast majority of objections indicate that it is unlikely that the changes were not intended to affect schools which provided education for sixth formers and other age groups. We were told that, as at 2020, there were 182 secondary schools of which 126 had sixth forms, and 23 middle schools, 12 of which had sixth forms. If proposals for schools with sixth forms were to be referred to the Welsh Ministers, it is unlikely that the vast majority of proposals for secondary schools would be determined by local education authorities rather than the Welsh Ministers. We accept, however, that the position might be different if primary schools were included in the figures. The use, in paragraph 3.57, of the words “only” and “solely with the removal or establishment of sixth form provision” are also important. That usage is consistent with changes being intended to require the referral of proposals for the establishment or closure solely of sixth form schools. For completeness, we do not accept Mr Williams’s submission that the pre-legislative material shows that the only, or principal, object underlying the legislation was to address the situation where a referral of a proposal to the Welsh Ministers could be triggered by a single objector. That was one of the concerns but only one of the concerns. </p>

A proposal for the establishment or closure of a school falls within that subjection, and requires the approval of the Welsh Ministers, if the school only provides education for those above compulsory school age. Proposals to establish or close a school which provides education for those above, and those below, compulsory school age, do not fall within section 50(2)(a) and do not need to be approved by the Welsh Ministers. Proposals 2 and 3 in this case, affecting Pontypridd High School and Hawthorn High School, did not provide education for sixth formers only and did not have to be referred to the Welsh Ministers. The appeal will, therefore, be allowed on grounds 1 and 2 so far as proposals 2 and 3 are concerned. </p>

That could deter parents from choosing that school for their children and opting instead for a closer, English medium, school. Those children would be less likely to move to a Welsh medium secondary school. Further, there may be difficulties in attending pre-school and after-school activities which might act as a further deterrence to choosing to attend the proposed new Welsh medium school. In addition, the Welsh Language Commissioner had found that the consultation documents prepared  by Rhondda Cynon Taf did not comply with relevant Welsh language standards and that was evidence of a failure to have regard to the impact of the proposal on the Welsh language. </p>

In that regard, the critical factual issue was whether Rhondda Cynon Taf had taken account of the impact of the proposal for the closure of Point Sion Norton, and the opening of a new Welsh medium primary school 2 miles away. That, in essence, required consideration of three matters: the effect on existing pupils, the availability of places to meet demand for Welsh medium primary education and the likelihood of parents in future opting for a closer English medium primary schools for their children rather than sending them to the proposed new Welsh medium school. It is accepted that if the proposal results in fewer pupils attending a Welsh medium primary school, that is likely to have an effect on Welsh medium secondary school, because children are less likely to attend such schools if their primary education was delivered through the medium of English. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">After careful consideration of the evidence, we have concluded that the judge was wrong to find that Rhondda Cynon Taf had failed to take into account relevant factors when deciding to implement proposal 4. First, the judge was heavily influenced by the fact that he considered Rhondda Cynon Taf had failed to comply with paragraph 1.9 of the Code. He equated failure to consider the matters specifically referred to in that paragraph with a failure to consider Welsh medium education more generally. By way of example, he analysed the documentation by reference to the matters referred to in paragraph 1.9  and how the proposal would affect the sustainability or enhancement of Welsh medium provision in the local 14-19 network and promote access to Welsh medium courses in post-16 education. He appears to have been influenced by the fact that paragraph 1.9 was not taken into account and the matters specifically referred to in that paragraph were not addressed (see paragraphs 117 and 118 of the judgment). Paragraph 1.9 of the Code does not, however, apply as we have said. It is not correct, therefore, to draw any inference from the absence of any reference to the matters referred to in the text of that paragraph in deciding whether Rhondda Cynon Taf had </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.00in">failed to comply with the applicable paragraph (1.4). That error alone would mean that the judge’s finding would need to be set aside and we would need to consider afresh whether there had been a breach of paragraph 1.4 or a failure to consider more generally the impact of proposal 4 on Welsh medium education.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Furthermore, however, the judge considered that Rhondda Cynon Taf relied upon the fact that it had decided not to reorganise Welsh medium secondary education as the justification for considering that proposals did not affect Welsh medium secondary education. He considered that that approach would not address the question of the potential impact of proposal 4 on the take up of Welsh medium primary education which, in turn, could have an effect on those proceeding to Welsh medium secondary education. We accept Mr Milford’s submission that confusion has emerged as Rhondda Cynon Taf thought it was addressing the question of paragraph 1.9 and why the proposals about English medium secondary education did not affect Welsh medium secondary education. It was not seeking to address the separate question of the effect of proposal 4 on the take up of Welsh medium places and the consequential effect on the number of pupils proceeding to Welsh medium secondary education. As a result, and whatever the cause of the confusion, the judge has not properly considered or assessed the relevant issues. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">For those reasons, we consider afresh the underlying documentation. It is helpful to bear in mind that paragraph 1.4 of the Code specifically deals with the need for places and the impact on accessibility of schools. Where a school closure is proposed, the alternative school provision should be sufficient to meet existing and projected demand for the same language category. That is explained further. The proposals should ensure that the school places available reflect the balance of demand and that school provision should remain “available and accessible to pupils in the local area” and “existing pupils must” be able to continue receiving education through the same language medium. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">In the present case, the documentation makes it clear that the proposed new Welsh medium primary school would have an increased number of places. There would be 93 more Welsh medium primary education places as compared with the current provision at Pont Sion Norton and the Welsh medium pupils at Heol y Celyn. Further, the provision would provide sufficient places for anticipated demand over the coming years. Secondly, the proposed catchment area for the new primary school would include the catchment area of the existing Pont Sion Norton (and would be built on the site of the current Heol y Celyn school). All existing pupils at Pont Sion Norton (and Welsh medium pupils at Heol y Celyn) would be able to attend the proposed new school. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Next, the documentation does consider the question of whether the proposed new school would be accessible, or whether issues, in particular distances and the need for transport, would present barriers to pupils attending the proposed new school. In that regard, these issues were addressed in the Welsh language assessment and the community impact assessment which were annexed to the report to the Cabinet which took the decision to implement the proposals. The Welsh language assessment noted that 70% of pupils currently attending Pont Sion Norton had access to free school transport and the location of the new school would enable 100% of those pupils currently within the catchment area of Pont Sion Norton to qualify for free school transport. The community impact assessment explained that the proposed new school </p>

It said that it “is not considered that distance to school will be a barrier to any child who wishes to participate in the pre and after school provision”. We accept that the analysis of the issues is relatively limited. But the question is whether Rhondda Cynon Taf considered and took into account the relevant factors. If so, its decision on those factors are matters for Rhondda Cynon Taf not the court. The Senedd has entrusted the decision on those matters to the elected local authority. The role of the court is to ensure that the local authority has followed the correct legal process and taken the relevant factors into account. It is not for the court to assess those factors and decide whether or not to implement the proposals. We are satisfied that the matters referred to in paragraph 1.4, and in particular the ability to meet demand for places for Welsh medium primary education, the ability of existing pupils to continue their education through the medium of Welsh, and whether the proposed new school would be sufficiently accessible and would not place a barrier to the take up of Welsh medium primary education, were considered by Rhondda Cynon Taf.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Finally, we consider the fact that the Welsh Language Commissioner has found that the consultation documents prepared by Rhondda Cynon Taf failed to meet relevant Welsh language standards. As Mr James accepts, the question of whether particular documents meet Welsh language standards is a different one from the one that this court has to consider, namely whether Rhondda Cynon Taf acted unlawfully. Further, the Welsh Language Commissioner was, it seems, dealing with the adequacy of the consultation documents prepared before publication of the proposals. No challenge has been made to the lawfulness of the consultation exercise. This case concerns a different question, namely whether the decision on 18 July 2019 to implement three of the proposals is unlawful. The findings of the Welsh Language Commissioner do not assist in considering that issue.  </p>
