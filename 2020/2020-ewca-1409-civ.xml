At that hearing, Mr Sooben applied without notice for an adjournment of the application. The grounds for the application, as explained orally by counsel for Mr Sooben, were that Mr Sooben wished to obtain a witness statement from Mr Badal. Mr Sooben alleged that Mr Badal had informed Mr Sooben’s solicitors that the litigation had been controlled by Mr Deepchand; but that, the day before the hearing, Mr Badal had telephoned them to say that he had been intimidated by Mr Deepchand and doubted that he would attend the hearing. In the event, however, Mr Badal was present in court at the hearing. </p>

Nicklin J declined to read the letter unless it was copied to the other parties. A copy of the letter was sent to Lambeth Solicitors on about 21 April 2018, but not to Mr Sooben’s solicitors.

His reasons for reaching that conclusion were, in summary, that it was inevitable that at least two people, and more likely four, would have to give oral evidence and be cross-examined, which was not a summary procedure, but a trial; and that the costs of that exercise would be disproportionate to the sum which was in dispute. Furthermore, there was a real risk that the issues in the case would broaden to encompass the question of whether Mr Deepchand’s allegations against Mr Sooben were untrue, when Mr Sooben had “surrendered his opportunity to have these issues determined” in the libel claim (i.e. by failing to join Mr Deepchand as a defendant in time), which was “not an appropriate use” of the jurisdiction.   </p>

The general rule, if the court decides to make an order about costs, is that the unsuccessful party will be ordered to pay the costs of the successful party – CPR 44.3(2)(a). But the court may make a different order – CPR 44.3(2)(b). Unless the court is satisfied that it has a proper basis of agreed or determined facts upon which to decide whether the case is one in which it should give effect to ‘the general rule’ - or should make ‘a different order’ (and, if so, what order) – it must accept that it is not in a position to make an order about costs at all.

The grounds relied upon against Mr Deepchand amounted in effect to a collateral attack on Master McCloud’s decision not to permit the joinder of Mr Deepchand as a defendant. As the judge said, that was not a proper use of the nonparty costs jurisdiction. As for the grounds relied upon against Lambeth Solicitors, advancing defences of no merit on behalf of their client would not justify a non-party costs order. Even if it is true that Lambeth Solicitors extended credit to Mr Badal (which they dispute), extending credit to a client is not a ground for a non-party costs order against a solicitor: <span style="font-style:italic">Floods of Queensferry Ltd v Shand Construction Ltd</span> [2002] EWCA Civ 918, [2003] Lloyds’ Rep IR 181 at [81] (Hale LJ).

It did not bear on the question of who was successful on the application or on the costs incurred by the Appellants in defending the application.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It only remains for me to deal with the Appellants’ conduct in not sending a copy of Mr Badal’s letter dated 12 April 2018 to Mr Sooben’s solicitors. The judge only relied upon this as a secondary factor supporting his decision. In my view it cannot justify depriving the Appellants of their costs of the application standing on its own, since even without receipt of a copy of the letter Mr Sooben knew, or should have known, that (i) he would be in difficulties without supporting evidence from Mr Badal and (ii) he had not obtained such evidence. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I would therefore allow this appeal and order Mr Sooben to pay the Appellants’ costs of the application. In the circumstances it would seem appropriate for this Court summarily to assess those costs, and I would invite written submissions from the parties as to the sums claimed. </p>
