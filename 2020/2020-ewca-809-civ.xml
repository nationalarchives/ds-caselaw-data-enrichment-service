He had lived and worked in the United Kingdom, making national insurance contributions sufficient to entitle him in due course to an old-age pension.  He moved to Cyprus in December 2014, to act as Ms Ozturk’s carer.  Some months later, in April 2015, he applied to the respondent </p>

Its central provisions “constitute a complete and uniform system of conflict rules which are intended not only to prevent the simultaneous application of a number of national legislative systems and the complication which might ensue, but also to ensure that the persons covered by that regulation are not left without social security cover because there is no legislation which is applicable to them” (<span style="font-style:italic">Pensionsversicherungsanstalt v.

This is “the principle of single applicable legislation”, described in recital 18a to the Regulation as being one of great importance.   </p>

Mrs Tolley lived and worked in the United Kingdom for many years, making national insurance contributions that entitled her to an old-age pension. From 1993 she was awarded the care component of disability living allowance (“DLA”), a noncontributory benefit.  In 2002 she moved to Spain to live there permanently. Under the UK national legislation, which provided that a person was not entitled to the care component of DLA unless he or she satisfied conditions as to residence and presence in Great Britain, she lost her entitlement to the benefit upon her move to Spain.  The question was whether she was covered by Regulation 1408/71 and, if so, whether it entitled her in effect to “export” her award of the benefit to Spain.  The matter came before the CJEU on a reference by the UK Supreme Court. </p>

This result is said to reflect the language of the key provisions and to be supported by purposive considerations. In particular, “competent institution” is defined in Article 1(q)(i) as the institution with which the “person concerned” is insured at the time of the application for benefit; and in a case such as this the “person concerned” should be read as referring to the severely disabled person for whom the care is provided, rather than to the formal claimant for the care allowance.

Article 21 applies to an insured person and to members of his or her family residing or staying in a Member State other than the competent Member State: it spells out when something should happen and goes no further than that.  The legislature was well aware of the related nature of the benefits (see <span style="font-style:italic">Commission v Parliament and Council</span>, cited above) but has not included provision that the competent Member State for one benefit must be the same as for the other benefit.  Regulation 883/2004 is a conflict of laws regulation and it cannot be right that, as the appellant contends, the question of competence for a particular benefit is determined by the relationship between it and another benefit in domestic law.  It is submitted that the cases relied on by the appellant do not advance the appellant’s case. </p>

Since the definition of “insured person” in Article 1(c) relates in terms to the use of that expression in Chapters 1 and 3 of Title III, and Article 21 is part of Chapter 1 of Title III,  I think it inescapable that the first question to be asked under Article 21 is whether, in respect of his claim to UK benefit, the appellant falls within that definition.  To fall within it, he would have to meet the requisite conditions for benefit “under the legislation of the Member State competent under Title II”.  The “Member State competent under Title II” must mean the Member State to the legislation of which he is subject by virtue of the rules under Title II, i.e. the state of applicable legislation under Title II.  That state is Cyprus, not the United Kingdom.  It follows that the appellant does not get off the ground in his attempt to bring his claim to UK benefit within Article 21. </p>

This emerges clearly from the Opinion of the Advocate General in support of the same conclusion, when he states that under Article 1(o)(i) in conjunction with Article 1(q) of the Regulation “the ‘competent State’ means … the Member State in which the institution with which the worker is insured ‘at the time of the application for benefit’ is situated” and that in accordance with that definition “the ‘competent State’ to which Article 22(1)(b) of that Regulation refers means … <span style="font-style:italic">the Member State</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">which was competent on the basis of the provisions of Title II</span>, at the time of acquisition of entitlement to the benefits whose export is requested” (Opinion §§101-102, quoted at §25 above, but with original emphasis removed and replaced by my emphasis).  That also fits with the earlier passage in his Opinion in which he stated that “[t]he designation, as applicable legislation, of the legislation of a Member State (known as the competent state or the state of insurance) means that the social security scheme of that Member State will apply to the worker concerned” (Opinion §65, quoted at §21 above). </p>

Although that provision does not expressly mention the case of a worker who is not employed when he seeks sickness benefit, it is appropriate to interpret it as meaning that, where necessary, it refers to the legislation of the State in whose territory the work was last employed. </p>

The claimant had worked for a short time in the United Kingdom before moving to Ireland where she had never been in employment.  Following her move she applied for a UK sickness benefit.  The court held that Article 19 of Regulation 1408/71 applied to her.  It is evident, however, from the judgment, in particular at §§9-10, that the reason why the United Kingdom was considered to be the competent state for the purposes of Article 19 was that the claimant fell within Article 13(2)(a) (as interpreted at the time) as someone who had worked there and had not taken up employment after her move to another Member State.  It follows that the United Kingdom was the state of applicable legislation under Title II and that the approach of the court again supports my view about Article 21 of Regulation 883/2004.  </p>

The claimant had lived and worked in Austria before moving to Germany.  She was said to be no longer insured under the Austrian social security system since moving to Germany.  Her application for an Austrian sickness benefit was refused.  The relevant question for the court was whether the Regulation precluded such a refusal.  The court referred to the principle of single applicable legislation, determined in accordance with Title II.  It held that the claimant fell within Article 11(3)(e) and that the national legislation applicable was therefore that of the Member State of residence, namely Germany.  The reasoning of the court is consistent with my analysis under Article 21 but does not provide any real assistance since Article 21 was not addressed and it cannot be inferred that it was considered and dismissed by the court. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">As to the alternative argument in ground 2, there is certainly a close relationship between carer’s allowance and attendance allowance but they remain separate benefits with different conditions of entitlement and have to be claimed by, and are payable to, different people.  It is artificial to contend that in the case of a claim for carer’s allowance the “competent Member State” under Article 21 is the state that is competent in relation to the attendance allowance payable to the severely disabled person for whom the care is provided, rather than the state that is otherwise competent in relation to claims by the insured person.  There is nothing in the language of Article 21 or the related definitions to support such an interpretation of the article.  I do not accept that in this one situation the “person concerned” in the definition of “competent institution” (Article 1(o)(i)) is to be read as referring not to the person claiming the benefit but to the person for whom the care is provided.  The natural meaning and effect of an EU instrument such as Regulation 883/2004 are not to be distorted by reference to a particular feature of national law.  If the exceptional result for which the appellant contends had been intended by the EU legislature, it would have been the subject of express provision.    </p>

The court in <span style="font-style:italic">Commission v Parliament and Council </span>described carer’s allowance as “complementary” to DLA and attendance allowance, and as constituting a “supplementary benefit” for the claimant in receipt of DLA or attendance allowance, but did so only as reasons for holding that carer’s allowance was a “sickness benefit” falling within Article 4(1)(a) of Regulation 1408/71.  <span style="font-style:italic">Slanina </span>related to a very different situation concerning entitlement to family benefits under Article 73 when a divorced woman and her child moved to a different Member State from that in which her ex-husband lived.  <span style="font-style:italic">Drake </span>did concern invalidity benefit paid to the carer of a disabled person, but it did so in the very different context of Council Directive 79/7/EEC on equal treatment in matters of social security; and although the court took into account in that context the “clear economic link between the benefit and the disabled person, since the disabled person derives an advantage from the fact that an allowance is paid to the person caring for him” (§24), such reasoning cannot produce the result for which Mr Buley contends under Article 21 of Regulation 883/2004.  I would add that although <span style="font-style:italic">Drake </span>is referred to in <span style="font-style:italic">Kavanagh v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions </span>[2019] EWCA Civ 272, [2019] 1 WLR 3655, §§82-84, cited to us by Ms Smyth, I do not think that <span style="font-style:italic">Kavanagh </span>takes matters any further. </p>
