The trigger for these decisions was that the Appellants were considered by the Respondent to have undergone a change of circumstances altering their benefit entitlements.  Following the Respondent’s decisions, the Appellants applied for UC.  </p>

In the relevant terminology, they had “migrated” and there could be “no turning back”.  At one time the phrase used was “the lobster pot” principle, a phrase that was used before the Judge and by her in her judgment, but I will use the currently preferred phrase “no turning back”. </p>

The Appellants therefore received no transitional protection against the drop in income.  There is still no legislation in place that would provide transitional protection to people in the Appellants’ situation, although there is now such legislation for certain other groups. </p>

She used to work as a laboratory research chemist until she gave up work in 2015 to look after her daughter, AD.  AD has sickle cell anaemia and epilepsy. She requires monthly blood transfusions and needs to attend other regular medical appointments.  At the beginning of 2017, TD was entitled to income support, carer's allowance and child tax credit, with a disability element.  Her total entitlement (excluding housing benefit) was £1005.45 per month.  She also received disability living allowance, on behalf of AD, of £333.23 per month.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.00in;text-indent:0.50in">From 25 March 2017 the SSWP stopped TD's award of income support.  Her Job Centre advised her that she should claim UC, which was awarded to her from 27 April 2017.  TD later successfully challenged the decision to stop her income support but the application of Regulations 8 and 13 described above, precluded her from receiving or claiming any legacy benefit after 27 April 2017.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.00in;text-indent:0.50in">TD was awarded UC of £872.90 per month, which was £136.99 per month less than the amount to which she had been entitled under the legacy system.  The loss of entitlement on transfer to UC was because of the less generous treatment of some children with disabilities under UC compared with legacy benefits.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.00in;text-indent:0.50in">Subsequently, on 18 August 2018 the SSWP revised the level of AD's disability living allowance (DLA) upwards.  This revision had consequences for TD's UC entitlement, entitling her to the highest rate of the disabled child element of child tax credit up to 27 April 2017 and thereafter at the highest rate of the disabled child element of UC.  The effect of this has been that the household's combined entitlement is now at the same level under UC as it would have been had TD continued to receive her legacy benefits.  Notwithstanding this increase in her UC payments, TD contends that her claim is not academic as she and AD continue to seek a declaration and damages for the distress caused to them resulting from the drop in income at the time of transfer; the declaration sought would also benefit others in the same position as TD/AD but who remain on a lower entitlement under UC.” </p>

The criticisms advanced under Ground 3 logically arise prior to the criticisms of justification. Nevertheless, the Respondent responds to the criticism in the way advanced on appeal.  It is argued that comparison between natural migrants and managed migrants is misconceived, as there is no principle that all managed migrants will receive transitional protection: the whole point of the pilot scheme is to review the position before legislative choices are made.  In addition, it is submitted that an assertion of discrimination between disabled people and non-disabled people is incorrect.  Under the UC reforms, two-thirds of claimants in receipt of disability benefits will receive the same or greater entitlement (even leaving aside the transitional protection paid to severely disabled claimants).  Accordingly, a disabled person who migrates to UC is more likely to be in a more advantageous financial position following migration than a non-disabled person. </p>

First, the decision by Parliament to create a new scheme under the umbrella term “Universal Credit”.  Secondly, the decision made by the Secretary of State in regulations that there should be “no turning back” once a person has moved onto UC.  Thirdly, the fact that benefits under the UC scheme may be lower than what a person would have received by way of “legacy benefits”.  It is important to appreciate that the introduction of UC was not intended to be a cost-saving measure.  Rather it was introduced so as to redistribute finite resources and to create a more simplified scheme.  Fourthly, the decision to introduce UC in phases rather than in one go.  Nevertheless, that all said and as is common ground, the way in which the UC scheme is implemented must comply with the Convention rights, in particular for present purposes Article 14. </p>

It is true that those people are not what the Respondent describes as “natural migrants”.  However, they were on legacy benefits and, having moved onto UC, they do receive transitional protection.

The “cons” set out in bullet points included the need for operational systems to identify the relevant people and to make appropriate calculations.  It was said that these would have to be manual, at least initially, and not done by automation.  The calculations would have to be done every month and would be costly and staff-intensive.  It was also noted that a precedent might be set which could have an impact on future policy developments.  On the other side of the balance the “pros” included that this would be in line with the Ministerial decision made in April 2012 and that it would protect the financial position of claimants who might otherwise be worse off because of a departmental decision which was subsequently overturned. </p>

Therefore Transitional Protection will end altogether if a claimant’s circumstances change significantly.”  Examples of a significant change of circumstances were then given and included where one or both members of the household stop work or a partner leaves or joins the household.  The reference to a significant change in circumstances is there clearly a reference to a change in the underlying circumstances of a claimant, not simply the fact of making an application for UC.

However, it seems to me that this is why it is so important not to lose sight of the point made by Lord Bingham in <span style="font-style:italic">A v Secretary of State for the Home Department</span>, at para. 68, that, in a discrimination case, what must be justified is the difference in treatment and not merely the underlying policy.  The other factors to which Mr Brown draws attention may help to justify the underlying policy (moving from legacy benefits to UC) but do not justify the difference of treatment which is in issue.  This is because, but for the acknowledged errors made by the state itself in relation to these Appellants, they would have remained on legacy benefits.  It is the difference in the way that they were treated as compared with others who did remain on legacy benefits (because no error was made in their cases) that needs to be justified. </p>
