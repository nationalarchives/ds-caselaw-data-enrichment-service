	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">This is an appeal against a judgment of Whipple J, handed down on 21 September 2018, dismissing an application for judicial review brought by the two Appellant pharmaceutical companies.  The Appellants’ challenge was to a policy (“the Policy”) adopted by the Respondent Clinical Commissioning Groups (“CCGs”) that the NHS Trusts from which they commission services should use a drug called Avastin as the preferred treatment option for an eye disease generally referred to as wet age-related macular degeneration (“WAMD”).  I will start by setting out a bare outline of the facts which give rise to the claim.  In doing so I will refer to aspects of the EU drug licensing regime, and some other factual matters, that I will need to explain more fully at a later stage; but more detail generally can be found in Whipple J’s comprehensive judgment. </p>

The relevant constitutional arrangements within the NHS are clearly set out by Whipple J at paras. 37-47 of her judgment.  For present purposes I need only note the following.  CCGs are statutory corporations established under Chapter A2 of Part 2 of the National Health Services Act 2006. They have a statutory responsibility to commission medical and healthcare services: see section 3 (1).  Typically they do so from NHS Trusts, which are separate legal entities.  The relationship between CCGs and NHS Trusts in commissioning services is contractual.  There are standard conditions of service governing such contracts.  One (service condition 4) requires the parties to co-operate with one another to facilitate the delivery of services.  It is common ground that as a result of that duty NHS Trusts from whom the Respondents commission treatment of patients with WAMD will have to take the Policy into account in making their decisions about which drug to use.  The Policy is thus not as such binding on the Trusts, but the CCGs’ intention and no doubt expectation is that it will be followed.   </p>

There were, however, regulatory and other concerns, some of which we will have to consider in this appeal, about promoting the use of Avastin in circumstances where its marketing authorisation did not cover its intra-ocular use.  The question was addressed in an editorial in the <span style="font-style:italic">British Medical Journal</span> in November 2014 urging the government “to remove the hurdles” to the use of Avastin for the treatment of WAMD.

Its recommendation 22 was that “no clinically significant differences in effectiveness and safety between the different anti-VEGF treatments have been seen in the trials considered by the guideline committee” and included a footnote pointing out that, that being so, “comparable regimens will be more cost effective if the agent has lower net acquisition, administration and monitoring costs”.  That is somewhat coyly expressed (for reasons explained in the introduction to chapter 10 – see para. 33 of the judgment of Whipple J), but it makes it clear that there were no safety or effectiveness grounds for not preferring Avastin if it was indeed cheaper in real terms. </p>

At the time of the hearing before Whipple J its position was that, whereas Avastin was licensed, CB should be regarded as a distinct and unlicensed product.  Whipple J was prepared to proceed on that basis but she noted some inconsistencies in how the MHRA had expressed itself on other occasions, and she was not convinced that its stance before her was correct and that the use of CB to treat WAMD should not be treated as off-label use of Avastin; she accordingly encouraged the MHRA to review its position.  It has since done so.  The review, published in July 2019, gives a full and careful account of the background, including a review of the literature about the safety of CB and an explanation of the compounding process: I shall have to return to some aspects of that later.

Furthermore, it is apparent from the order for reference, and in particular from the wording of the question raised, first, that the Landgericht Hamburg proceeds on the basis that the composition of the medicinal product is not modified.

In that case there were separate marketing authorisations for Insuman, an insulin product, depending on the pack size: one covered a pack containing ten “cartridges”, while the other covered a pack of five.  Aventis marketed Insuman in France in packs of five.  Parallel importers bought such packs in France and bundled them into a single shrinkwrapped package, with an overall sticker, for marketing in Germany.

In particular, the drawing off of liquid medicinal products from the original vials, and the transfer into ready-to-use syringes of the portions so drawn off, without any modification of those products, is in reality analogous to actions which, in the absence of Apozyt’s activities, could otherwise be, or have been, carried out, under their responsibility, by doctors prescribing the treatment or by pharmacies themselves in their dispensaries, or else in hospitals.” </p>

Thus any subsequent transfer of the product so prescribed is not part of that process; and that is so even where, as on the facts of <span style="font-style:italic">Apozyt</span>, it involves a supply from an outside provider rather than simply between health professionals (e.g. from hospital pharmacy to clinician).  The basis on which the Court distinguishes <span style="font-style:italic">Aventis</span> in para. 43 is consistent with that analysis.  The statement that the compounding process occurs “after the medicinal products … have been placed on the market” is potentially confusing, because it might suggest that what matters is the <span style="font-style:italic">initial</span> placing on the market; but I think it is clear that what the Court meant was, in effect, “after the medicinal products have ceased to be on the market”.  That is apparent not only from the reasoning of the prior paragraphs but from the second half of para. 43 itself: the point there made that Apozyt’s activities are “analogous” with what could have been done by a doctor or hospital pharmacy shows that the Court was treating the compounding process as part of what is done with the product by (or at the instance of) the end-user, namely the prescribing doctor.  This, therefore, is the basis for the “individual prescription” requirement confirmed in the <span style="font-style:italic">dispositif</span>. </p>

It was not submitted that article 3 had any application, no doubt because Apozyt was not a pharmacy.  But the German Government submitted that Apozyt’s activities fell within the terms of article 5 – that is, that it could be regarded as producing “specials”.  The Court considered that submission at paras. 4550.  It held that article 5 could not apply to the preparation of compounded Lucentis, since it was in substance the same product as that covered by the marketing authorisation: “the injection volumes used are no different from those provided for in the marketing authorisation and nor is the product used for a therapeutic indication not covered by the marketing authorisation” (para. 47).  That was not true of Avastin, and the Court acknowledged that there might be circumstances where a doctor took the view that treatment with CB was preferable for a particular patient, in which case its preparation for that purpose would fall within article 5 (para. 48).  I need not, however, consider this reasoning further, since no reliance is placed on article 5 in the present appeal.  </p>

It pointed out that that could not have been what the CJEU meant by “modification”.  It had of course been well aware that compounding necessarily involved a departure from the terms of the marketing authorisation in many respects; if that in itself constituted modification there would have been no need for any further enquiry.   Rather, what it must have intended was that the product should have undergone “a modification in its composition due to the decanting process into prefilled syringes”.  As to that, it was clear that Apozyt did not “take anything from, or add anything to, the substance of the decanted product” (para. 212).  However, the Oberlandesgericht appears to have accepted that a modification, in the CJEU’s sense, would also occur if there were (para. 213) </p>

It was accordingly a serious competitive threat to Lucentis.  The Italian competition authority (“AGCM”) found that Roche and Novartis had entered into an agreement to seek to promote (unjustified) public concern about the safety of Avastin used intravitreally and that as a result its use had declined steeply, with a corresponding increase in the use of Lucentis at huge cost to the public purse; and that this constituted a breach of article 101 of the TFEU.

But in his oral submissions in connection with the Appellants’ ground 3 (and in particular “issue 3A”) Mr de la Mare submitted that that was not the whole question.  It was necessary also to consider what he described as “quality” – that is, unintended “modification” arising from failures in the compounding process.  By reference in particular to the account of the compounding process given in the MHRA review, he identified various ways in which such modification might occur.  There might, for example, be an unanticipated reaction between the Avastin and the materials used in the body of the syringe, or the substance used to lubricate the piston.  It might also occur by the Avastin being contaminated in the course of the transfer process: the obvious example would be microbial contamination, but Mr de la Mare referred us to a passage in the MHRA review which mentions the risk, if a proper filter needle were not used, of contamination of the transferred Avastin by “particulates” (e.g. particles created by the puncture of the stopper of the vial with the needle).<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="20">
		<p class="footnotedescription" style="margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:-0.49in"> I should say, to avoid misunderstanding, that the MHRA mentions these risks, and the precautions to be taken against them (such as the use of a filter needle), as part of a general assessment of “quality considerations”.  It is not part of its purpose to assess the extent of any risk of failures in quality control, though it does in fact observe that the low level of reported serious adverse reactions is “reassuring on the safety of intravitreal [CB]”.<span style="font-size:10pt">    </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr de la Mare contended that the test of modification had to be “geared towards” or “focused on” these risks, because if they eventuated the quality, efficacy or safety of the CB would be liable to be impaired.  I understood his submission to be that the compounding process must be treated as modifying the substance of the Avastin unless it was demonstrable that “appropriate quality standards” (a phrase to which he drew our attention in the MHRA review) were adopted – which, to anticipate, he said that the evidence before the Judge did not establish, and as to which she had in any event made no findings.     </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I do not accept those submissions.  It is essential to remember that the context for the no modification requirement is the issue of whether the supply of compounded Avastin (or indeed Lucentis) involved a “placing on the market” within the meaning of article 6.  As discussed at paras. 60-63 above, the rationale for the <span style="font-style:italic">Apozyt</span> exemption is that the Court regarded what it described as “re-packaging” as part of the use of an existing product by the end-user – that is, by the prescribing doctor or a pharmacy (or other authorised person).  I do not see how, logically, that analysis could be affected by whether failures of quality control have led to the product being contaminated (or to a real risk of contamination): questions of that kind can have nothing to do with the point at which the product ceases to be “placed on the market”.  In my view it is clear that what the Court meant by “modification” was a change in the substance of the Avastin (more technically, in its physical, chemical or biological properties) which is necessarily inherent in the fact of compounding rather than the risk of contamination or other changes as a result of failures of quality control. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">That does not mean that the Court would not expect that the compounding process would be subject to proper quality control: of course it would.  But that does not need to be achieved through the mechanism of the Directive or built in to the definition of article 6.  There would be nothing surprising about the Court proceeding on the basis that pharmacies (or other persons with a special authorisation to perform compounding, such as Apozyt) would be subject to professional and regulatory standards that gave proper protection against any risks in the compounding process; indeed in <span style="font-style:italic">AIFA</span> there were clear findings that the reimbursement authorisations incorporated a system designed to ensure quality control (see para. 77 above).  After all, other operations performed in pharmacies are explicitly excluded from the scope of the Directive by articles 3 and 5.  It is also important to bear in mind that, as Mr Lock reminded us, the EU has no legislative competence as regards matters of medical treatment.  It would be consistent with the logic of the <span style="font-style:italic">Apozyt</span> exemption to treat the safety of the compounding process as an aspect of clinical procedures which are under the control of doctors and/or pharmacists.  </p>

Such an outcome would, in the Secretary of State’s submission, be inconsistent with the provisions of the Directive that require that new or varied marketing authorisations be applied for and granted before medicines can be placed on the market for different routes of administration or therapeutic indications than those set out in the original marketing authorisation: see Article 6(1).

In any one week, therefore, there would be prescriptions covering a sufficient number of syringes for them to be prepared in batches on a bulk basis, without the need for precise matching.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="23">

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I do not believe that in those submissions Mr Lock correctly characterises the purpose of the individual prescriptions requirement.  It has nothing to do with seeing that the patient gets the right drug: that is, as he himself says, a matter outside the competence of the EU.  Rather, it is about drawing the distinction between matters of treatment which occur “downstream” of supply to the end-user (here, the treating hospital) and the “upstream” activities of manufacture and supply which the Directive seeks to regulate.  It is, as Mr de la Mare put it, “a proxy for controlled retail supply”.   </p>

At para. 42 of its Judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Apozyt</span> it expresses the requirement as being that the relevant “processes” should be “carried out” on the basis of individual prescriptions.  That must refer to the compounding process (not least because in the same sentence it requires that they should not result in a modification of the product).  On a natural reading, that means that not only the supply but the compounding itself should not be carried out unless and until a prescription is in existence.  No doubt this particular issue was not live before the Court, but there is a conceptual logic in the way it expressed itself, and I am not persuaded that we should disregard its language only because a substantially similar result could be achieved by limiting the requirement to the point of supply.

Its effect is essentially to extend that exclusion beyond the case covered by article 3 – i.e. where the pharmacist makes changes to the substance of the product, so as to create a new product – to the case where the changes are not to the “substance” but to other features (packaging, mode of delivery etc) which would otherwise be the subject of regulation.  It does so on the basis that the compounding of Avastin under the control of a treating doctor in an individual case occurs “downstream” of the point at which the Directive’s control of marketing and manufacture ceases: it is to be treated essentially as part of the clinical process.  That may be – Mr de la Mare would say that it was – a creative exercise of construction; but the Court’s thinking is understandable and it must be respected. </p>

NICE is the public body with responsibility under the statute for giving advice and guidance and making recommendations about NHS services (Reg 5 of the 2013 Regulations, see above).

Covington made formal Freedom of Information Act requests to each Trust asking whether they “possess facilities that produce, or are capable of producing, CB in-house at the scale necessary to implement the Policy for the Trust’s patients” and, if so, giving particulars of those facilities.  Three answered that they did possess such facilities, although one of those said that it did not intend to make use of them but would purchase CB “externally”.  Two said that they did not.  Mr Lock did not challenge that part of the evidence, and I would admit it as far as it goes.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="24">

Regulation 46 (1) makes it unlawful to “sell or supply” a medicinal product without a marketing authorisation, and regulation 17 (1) makes it unlawful to “manufacture [or] assemble” such a product: see para. 43 above.  A hospital pharmacy which prepared CB would be “assembling” a medicinal product – see the definition quoted at para. 44 above.  And its supply to a different Trust would plainly be a “supply” (whether or not it were also a sale). </p>

He referred us to a passage in the witness statement of Novartis’ “Business Head – Ophthalmology”, Mr James Porter, which quotes from the response given by the MHRA following consultation on the draft of the HMR (for which the MHRA had responsibility as an agency of the Department).  We were not shown the draft itself, but Mr Porter says that it had been “intended to replace the term ‘prepare’ with ‘manufacture’”.  In its response the MHRA explained that following responses from consultees it had decided to retain the language of “prepare”.  It said, as quoted by Mr Porter: </p>

As a matter of ordinary language, the word “prepare” is perfectly apt to the compounding process.  The provision contains no express limitation by reference to volume, and it would be hard to imply one: how would the borderline between “small-scale” and “large-scale” be identified?  I see no ambiguity of the kind that might make it legitimate to have regard to the MHRA’s consultation response.  But even if that were legitimate, the response is not particularly helpful.  It appears to reflect an understanding that it is appropriate for “high-volume” production to be carried out under a “specials’ licence” (see n. 24) whereas “low-volume” production need not be.  But there is no reason to suppose that the consultees had in mind the particular case of compounding, i.e. simply aliquoting the contents of a larger vial between a number of syringes; and it is not clear whether its concerns about “volume” would apply to such a case.  And even if there were room for doubt on the point, it is in my view right to prefer a construction which produces a result that conforms with the Directive as construed by the CJEU. </p>

Again, if there were room for doubt, we should adopt a construction which produces a result that conforms with the Directive as construed by the CJEU.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Lock’s answer to that case started with the position in EU law.  He submitted that it is clear that the supply of CB in mode 3 would not require an authorisation under article 77.1 of the Directive, which regulation 18 is intended to implement.  What the relevant parts of articles 76 and 77 are concerned with is “wholesale distribution”: the definition of that phrase expressly excludes “supplying medicinal products to the public”.  The effect of the <span style="font-style:italic">Apozyt</span> exemption is that the supply of CB by a compounder to the treating hospital is not a “placing on the market” (within the meaning of article 6) and is a retail supply (within the meaning of article 40.2 <span style="font-style:italic">bis</span>).  The reasoning underlying those conclusions necessarily means also that it is not a “supply to the public”.  Mr Lock referred us to para. 82 of the Opinion of the Advocate General in <span style="font-style:italic">AIFA</span> (see para. 89 above), which says in terms that the Italian system there in question does not involve wholesale supply.  It is not clear whether hospitals supplying services under the Italian national health system each have separate legal personality but it would be extraordinary if the availability of the Apozyt exemption depended on the accident of how a particular member state organised its health service in that respect<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="25">

But he said in his oral submissions that his instructions were that the Trusts could and would put such a system in place if the Court held that it was a necessary condition for the use of CB.  That statement in itself cannot be decisive (not least because he was instructed by the CCGs rather than the Trusts), but the burden must be on the Appellants to establish that it would be impracticable to implement an individual prior prescriptions system, and there was no evidence before the Judge (or before us) that that was the case.  In any event, that seems inherently unlikely.  No doubt a system requiring pre-preparation individual prescriptions would be administratively more complex than one under which hospital pharmacies simply prepared stocks of CB which could then be drawn down as required, and thus also more expensive; but that would appear to be, as Mr Lock said, a price worth paying in view of the savings to be made.   </p>

As Ms Stratford put it in her oral submissions, it would “take what is supposed to be an exception, the small-scale supply of unlicensed products, and turn it into the rule”.  The unlawfulness of such conduct was characterised in the Appellants’ skeleton argument in one or more of three ways – (a) that it must be taken to be implicitly prohibited by the Directive because it would thwart its fundamental aims; (b) that it would constitute an “unlawful circumvention” of the Directive analogous to the kind which the General Court had held to be unlawful in <span style="font-style:italic">CTRS</span>; or (c) that it would be a breach of the duty of sincere co-operation in article 4.3 of the TFEU.  </p>

She reminded us of recitals (35) and (40) (see para. 22 above) and emphasised the importance from the point of view of safety of control being maintained over the entire chain of distribution.  The principal points which she made in that regard are essentially the same as those relied on by Mr de la Mare in connection with the modification issue: see para. 96 above.  She referred in particular to the account given of the compounding process in the MHRA review, which notes the risk of contamination and other quality control failures and refers to some specific episodes where such risks eventuated.  She also referred to the limited shelf-life of CB, the absence of an SMPC and the fact that the use of an unlicensed product would not fall within the pharmacovigilance obligations imposed by Title IX. </p>

Following the judgment Covington on behalf of the Appellants sought to investigate this question further, and the relevant correspondence was exhibited to the witness statement of Mr Kelly (see para. 145 above).  That appeared to confirm that the CQC had no such role; but a letter from NHS Improvement said that “where operating under Section 10 of the Medicines Act 1968 NHS England through the NHS Specialist Pharmacy Service [“the SPS”] audits aseptic services in line with EL (97) (52)<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="28">

Mr Lock, who pointed out that he did not represent the NHS, was not able to enlighten us further about the role of the SPS; but on the last day of the hearing Mr Peretz was able to give us a little more detail on instructions from the Secretary of State.  He told us that the SPS reviews “quality matters, including the preparation activities that we are concerned with here”.  He said that it had no formal statutory powers, though he observed that that might be thought unnecessary since the entities which it was supervising were themselves within the NHS.  If it identifies quality failings the SPS reports to the relevant NHS Trust, which has its own governance structures; he pointed out that the chief pharmacist at the Trust will be accountable not only to the Trust itself but to the General Pharmaceutical Council.  As to the quality control regimes operated by commercial compounders, there was no evidence before us at all; that is unsurprising, since, as already noted, neither the Judge nor we had any information about such compounders or the basis on which they operate.   </p>

It has never been part of the Appellants’ pleaded case that the use of CB was unsafe, whether for that or any other reason: the issue has only been raised in the context of the original ground 2 (now “issue 3D”) and, in this Court, in connection with the “modification” issue discussed above.  As we have seen, the Judge did in fact make an explicit finding, based on the NICE Guideline, that such use was safe, and that finding was not challenged in the grounds of appeal.  Even if I were inclined to express any view on the points made about inadequate regulation (and about whether that qualified the NICE guideline), we are not in a position to do so.  We simply do not have the evidence on which to reach any view about the adequacy of the SPS regime or the EL (97) (52) standards.  I would only say that any NHS hospital pharmacy which decides to undertake the preparation of CB, particularly on a large scale, will need to give careful thought to how to ensure that its processes are safe and accord with any professional or other domestic regulatory rules that apply, bearing in mind among other things the contents of the MHRA review.  There is no reason to doubt that they will do so or that the CB produced by them will be of proper quality. </p>

As already noted, the Appellants accept that “mode 1” would not directly contravene the provisions of the Medicines Directive (or the EMA Regulation) or the domestic implementing legislation.  Their case that it is unlawful is only that it would undermine the EU legislative scheme, i.e. “issue 3D”.  I have already rejected that case as regards grounds 2 and 3.  It is even harder to see how it could be advanced in relation to mode 1.  Such use would of course be “off-label”, but that does not make it unlawful. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The most obvious reason why this issue assumed the importance that it did both before the Judge and in the Appellants’ submissions to us was that one of the bases on which the Respondents sought to defend the lawfulness of the Policy was that it could be implemented by mode 1 – and indeed the Judge accepted that submission.  Since it was clear that mode 1 was not originally intended as a means of implementing the Policy, and only became part of the Respondents’ case in the course of the proceedings, it is not surprising that the Appellants criticise the Judge for adopting a “hypothetical” approach and insist on the importance of testing the lawfulness of the Policy on the basis of what was actually and realistically intended.  In the context of my conclusions to date, which treat mode 1 simply as an irrelevance, the issue does not arise in such a stark way.  I agree that the lawfulness of the Policy should be based on a realistic (and indeed purposive and objective) construction, but modes 2-4 are far less obviously susceptible to the criticism that they are “hypothetical” or “divorced from reality”. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Nevertheless, I do not think that ground 1 can be treated as having disappeared.  The result of my conclusions to date is that the Respondents are promoting a course of action – that is, the use of CB by the Trusts – which it would be realistically possible to implement by, broadly, two alternative routes.  The <span style="text-decoration:underline">first</span> is to obtain CB from an NHS hospital pharmacy (i.e. modes 2 or 3).  I believe that to be lawful, provided that an individual prescription policy is adopted.  The <span style="text-decoration:underline">second</span> is to obtain it from a commercial compounder (i.e. mode 4).  It is impossible to say whether mode 4 is lawful (see paras. 166-168 above), but I am content to assume for present purposes that it is not.  As I understand it, the Appellants would contend that on that basis the Policy is still unlawful because it leaves open the possibility of Trusts seeking to implement it by the (assumedly) unlawful mode 4 rather than the (as I would hold) lawful modes 2 or 3. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I do not believe that it would be right to hold the Policy to be unlawful on this basis.  This is not a case where a policy (or guidance or other such document) itself promotes a course which the Court holds to be unlawful.  On the contrary, the Policy is entirely silent about how the Trusts should obtain CB.   The Trusts are independent entities, with access to their own legal advice, and capable of making their own decision about that question.  I can see no principled basis on which the Policy should be treated as unlawful simply because it does not itself prescribe the lawful alternative and proscribe the unlawful.  It neither “leads to” nor “encourages” the choice of the unlawful route.  I can see that it might be said, in one sense of the word, to “permit” it inasmuch as it does not forbid it; but, as Floyd LJ observed in the course of argument, “permit” must in this context mean something like “sanction”, i.e. positively approve.  It would of </p>

She took us to documentary evidence that showed that the CCGs liaised extensively with representatives of the Trusts in developing the Policy and indeed sought to persuade them, in the light of some expressions of unease, that it should be pursued.  This was not, she submitted, in truth an arm’s length relationship in which the Trusts were expected to make their own choices; and the Policy should be construed as positively permitting, albeit as one alternative, the use of mode 4.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">As to that, I am willing to accept that there was indeed a high degree of liaison between the CCGs and the Trusts, and that both may <span style="font-style:italic">in fact</span> have regarded purchase from commercial suppliers as one way in which the Policy could be implemented.  But I do not think that that makes any difference in principle.  It is necessary to respect the legal (and deliberate) separation of CCGs and Trusts.  The point could in truth only go anywhere if CCGs were under a duty to advise Trusts as to what routes were lawful, because their silence on the issue would then be a breach of that duty; but the case was not put that way, and no basis for the existence of any such duty was identified.  It is necessary to construe the Policy, objectively, by reference to its terms.  As I have said, it says nothing about where Trusts should obtain their supplies of CB from.  Indeed the letter from the CCGs relied on by Ms Stratford (see para. 144 above) after saying that a manufacturer of CB had been identified went on at once to say that “of course the choice of supplier is an issue for individual trusts”.  If a Trust chose to obtain CB from a commercial supplier rather than an NHS hospital pharmacy that would (on the assumption I am making) be an unlawful act on its part, but that is another matter.  This is the distinction made by Whipple J at the end of para. 196 of her judgment (see para. 215 above).         </p>

The starting-point is the analysis in paras. 200-202 above.  There are two ways in which an NHS hospital pharmacy could prepare CB, one lawful (using a prior prescription system) and one unlawful (not using such a system).  The Policy is entirely silent as to which should be adopted, nor can any preference be inferred.  For the reasons given, I do not believe that that silence can be said to lead to, permit or encourage the choice of the unlawful route.

But the point can be put more broadly.  Even if it were necessary that the Respondents should have positively identified a means by which the Policy could be lawfully implemented, as they did (namely modes 2 and 3), it would be absurd to hold that that the Policy was unlawful unless they had also identified and worked through every detail.  It is important not to lose sight of the fact that, however much liaison there may be, CCGs are commissioners of services: it is for the Trusts to provide them and to work out how they may be provided. </p>

It was not a situation where the silence of the guidance there in question on a particular issue left open the possibility that the person to whom it was directed might choose an unlawful mode of implementation.  The issue in<span style="font-style:italic"> R (Refugee Legal Centre) v Secretary of State for the Home Department </span>[2004] EWCA Civ 1481, [2005] 1 WLR 2219, and <span style="font-style:italic">R (Tabbakh) v Staffordshire and West Midlands Probation Trust </span>[2014] EWCA Civ 827, [2014] 1 WLR 4620, to which we were also referred, was likewise different.  In both cases the policy-maker had, or had undertaken, the responsibility of prescribing the procedure to be followed in the circumstances in question, and the issue was whether that procedure carried an inherent risk of unlawful outcomes, distinct from the possibility of individual aberrant decisions.  In the present case, by contrast, the CCGs did not have the responsibility for sourcing CB and the Policy is silent on the issue.</p>

The point made by the Vice-President in paras. 202 and 207 is key to understanding why in this case the omission from the Policy of any mention of these problems did not render the Policy unlawful.  Most of the case law dealing with challenges to published policy concern policy or guidance issued by the Secretary of State to his or her staff explaining to them the legal framework in which they perform their functions.  For example, in <span style="font-style:italic">Letts </span>the guidance challenged was issued by the Lord Chancellor to caseworkers considering the applications from next of kin for legal aid and was held to be unlawful because it was misleading and inaccurate in providing a materially misleading impression of what the law was.  In such cases there can be no question of those who are expected to implement the policy taking independent legal advice and making up their own minds as to what the law is.  Some of the cases to which we were referred are similar to the present case in that they involve guidance given by the Secretary of State for Health to independent NHS Trusts, for example <span style="font-style:italic">R (A) v Secretary of State for Health </span>[2009] EWCA Civ 225, </p>
