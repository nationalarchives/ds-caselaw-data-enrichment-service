The respondent cross-appeals, again with the permission of Males LJ, against the judge’s decision not to reach a final determination of the particular preliminary issue which is the subject of the appeal. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The appellant, a Lebanese company, entered into a Franchise Development Agreement dated 16 July 2001 for a period of 10 years with Al Homaizi Foodstuff Company (“AHFC”), a Kuwaiti company, as Licensee. In 2005 AHFC became a subsidiary of the respondent (which I will refer to as “KFG”) following a corporate reorganisation. A dispute arose under the FDA which the appellant referred to arbitration before the ICC in Paris pursuant to Article 14 of the FDA (the relevant provisions of which are set out at [8] below). That arbitration was only commenced against KFG, not AHFC.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The arbitrators had to consider a jurisdictional issue as to whether KFG had become an additional party to the FDA and thus the arbitration agreement in Article 14 and went on to consider issues on the merits as to whether there had been a breach of the FDA and claims for remedies and relief (an application by KFG to bifurcate having failed). By an Award dated 11 September 2017, the majority arbitrators (Professor Dr Mohamed Abdel Wahab and M Bruno Leurent, neither of whom is an English qualified lawyer) found that the question of whether KFG was bound by the arbitration agreement was a matter of French law, but the issue of whether a transfer of substantive rights and obligations took place was governed by English law. They went on to conclude that, as a matter of English law, a ‘novation’ was to be inferred by the conduct of the parties adding KFG as the main franchisee. They determined that, on the merits, KFG was in breach of the FDA. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The dissenting third arbitrator Mr Klaus Reichert SC, who is an English qualified lawyer, agreed that French law applied to the issue of validity of the arbitration agreement, but dissented by concluding that the appellant’s case should fail because, applying English law, KFG never became a counterparty to the FDA which meant that it owed no obligation to the appellant under the FDA and that the appellant had sued the wrong party. </p>

However, whereas there would therefore be a powerful case for English law as being the implied choice in any event, by virtue of its governing the host agreement, I am satisfied that there is no need to resort to such implied agreement in this case, as there is an express choice. Article 15 provides for the laws of England as the governing law of the FDA. Article 14, the Settlement of Disputes clause, expressly states by clause 14.3, that <span style="font-style:italic">"the arbitrators shall apply the provisions contained in the agreement"</span>, which is the FDA, and Article 1 provides that <span style="font-style:italic">"This Agreement …shall be considered as a whole." </span>Article 14 (3) then continues (with my underlining)<span style="font-style:italic"> "the arbitrators shall</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">also</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">apply principles of law generally recognised in international transactions.

It is not necessary to examine the detail of this on the appeal since before this Court Mr Tse essentially put his case on the basis that KFG had become an additional party to the FDA by conduct with the express or implied consent of the existing parties which is what the judge considered at [27] onwards of his judgment.  </p>

The enforcement of No Oral Modification clauses carries with it the risk that a party may act on the contract as varied, for example by performing it, and then find itself unable to enforce it. It will be recalled that both the Vienna Convention and the UNIDROIT model code qualify the principle that effect is given to No Oral Modification clauses, by stating that a party may be precluded by his conduct from relying on such a provision to the extent that the other party has relied (or reasonably relied) on that conduct. In some legal systems this result would follow from the concepts of contractual good faith or abuse of rights. In England, the safeguard against injustice lies in the various doctrines of estoppel. This is not the place to explore the circumstances in which a person can be estopped from relying on a contractual provision laying down conditions for the formal validity of a variation. The courts below rightly held that the minimal steps taken by Rock Advertising were not enough to support any estoppel defences. I would merely point out that the scope of estoppel cannot be so broad as to destroy the whole advantage of certainty for which the parties stipulated when they agreed upon terms including the No Oral Modification clause. At the very least, (i) there would have to be some words or conduct unequivocally representing that the variation was valid notwithstanding its informality; and (ii) something more would be required for this purpose than the informal promise itself: see <span style="font-style:italic">Actionstrength Limited v International Glass Engineering INGLEN SpA </span>[2003] 2 AC 54, paras 9, 51, per Lord Bingham of Cornhill and Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe.” </p>

The FDA itself was governed by English law supplemented by the obligation of good faith and fair dealing in Article 2 and by “principles of law generally recognised in international transactions” (Article 14.3) which included the UNIDROIT principles. In the remainder of this judgment I will refer to English law as so supplemented as “English law plus”. Mr Tse submitted that this supplementation meant that the arbitration agreement could not be governed by pure English law. It was not possible for it to be governed by English law plus as the common law required the law applicable to an arbitration to be the law of a country, not some hybrid: see <span style="font-style:italic">Russell on Arbitration</span> 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> edition [2-119].  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Further, the fact that the arbitration agreement in Article 14 referred to this supplementation was a contra-indication to English law being the express governing law. Mr Tse submitted that the judge had been wrong to conclude that there was anything in the wording of Article 14 (and specifically 14.3) which supported the case for an express choice of English law as governing the arbitration agreement. The Article was concerned with how the arbitrators should determine substantive disputes, so that the first sentence of 14.3 was saying no more than that the arbitrators should apply the provisions contained in the Agreement to substantive disputes. Contrary to the judge’s conclusion at [17] of the judgment, the word “also” in the second sentence did not mean in addition to English law but in addition to the first sentence. He submitted that the third sentence was also important since the mandatory provisions to which the arbitrators might have to give consideration could include mandatory provisions of French law as the law of the seat of the arbitration, for example as to the circumstances in which there could be a challenge to an award. Mr Tse placed particular emphasis on the fact that the words “English law shall apply to this arbitration agreement” were absent from Article 14 which did not mention England or English at all. This was in contrast to the position in <span style="font-style:italic">Arsanovia</span> where the express reference to the Indian Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 in the arbitration clause pointed to an express choice of Indian law. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Tse also relied upon the fact that, under Article 25, the arbitration agreement in Article 14 was one of the Articles which would not survive termination of the Agreement. I should say at once that I do not see how this has any bearing on what is the governing law of that arbitration agreement. In any event Article 25 is very odd since it refers to Articles 28.2, 29, 30 and 33 when there are only 27 Articles in the FDA, suggesting it has come from another agreement, further support for which is that one would normally expect an arbitration clause to be one of the clauses which survived termination, given that there might be outstanding disputes. After all, this is the rationale for the concept of separability, given statutory effect by section 7 of the Arbitration Act 1996 (as to which see further below). If in fact the numbering is awry and it was intended that the arbitration agreement survives, there would be nothing at all in this point.  </p>

Express terms do not stipulate only what is absolutely and unambiguously explicit, and it seems to me strongly arguable that that is the ordinary and natural meaning of the parties' express words (notwithstanding relatively recent developments in the English law about the separability of arbitration agreements from the substantive contract in which it was made and assuming that these foreign companies are to be taken to have known about the developments in 2008 when they concluded the SHA).

Secondly, in circumstances where oral discussions can easily give rise to misunderstandings and crossed purposes, it avoids disputes not just about whether a variation was intended but also about its exact terms. Thirdly, a measure of formality in recording variations makes it easier for corporations to police internal rules restricting the authority to agree them. These are all legitimate commercial reasons for agreeing a clause like clause 7.6.

Application of any such broad principle would contradict the strict terms of the No Oral Modification clauses in the FDA which was not permitted by the last sentence of Article 14.3.

There were no documents other than conduct based documents, none of which would satisfy the requirements of the No Oral Modification clauses or of the estoppel required to override those clauses, as the judge correctly found. He described as a “phantom submission” the submission on behalf of the appellant that there were or might be any more documents not referred to by the judge which would have a bearing on the legal requirements of the FDA or satisfy Lord Sumption’s test for estoppel. Whilst there had been invoices from the appellant in relation to the royalty payments paid by KFG which were not before the Court, the royalty payments had been reimbursed by AHFC. As I pointed out in the course of argument, this would make the invoices equivocal, in the sense that KFG could have been paying them as agent for its subsidiary AHFC, which was the point the judge made at the beginning of [47] of his judgment. Mr Diwan QC submitted that if his submissions as to the construction of the double lock and the limited override of No Oral Modification clauses permitted by <span style="font-style:italic">Rock Advertising</span> were correct, there was no basis for reopening the judge’s factual assessment of the documents before him.  </p>

No problems of comity or conflict of laws arose because, on the basis that both the FDA and the arbitration agreement were governed by English law, the English Court must be more appropriate than the French Court to determine issues of English law.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In my judgment, Mr Diwan QC is correct that Articles 1 and 15 of the FDA in themselves provide for the express choice of English law to govern the arbitration agreement in Article 14. Article 1 makes it clear that “This Agreement” (capitalised) includes all the terms of agreement then set out, which include Article 14. Because Article 15 provides that: “This Agreement [again capitalised] shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England” it is making clear that all the terms of the Agreement, including Article 14, are governed by English law. The answer to the suggestion that, if this analysis were correct, there would be an express choice of governing law of the arbitration clause in every contract which contains a governing law clause is essentially that given by Andrew Smith J in <span style="font-style:italic">Arsanovia</span> at [22]. Governing law clauses do not necessarily cover the arbitration agreement. This one does because of the correct construction of the terms of Articles 1 and 15 taken together. </p>

On the contrary, as Mr Diwan QC submitted, the first sentence of Article 14.3 supports the conclusion that, on the true construction of the FDA as a whole, there is an express choice of English law to govern the arbitration agreement. That sentence provides: “The arbitrator(s) shall apply the provisions contained in the Agreement.” In my judgment, that means that the arbitrators must apply all the provisions, including the governing law clause in Article </p>

The arbitrators are directed to “apply principles of law generally recognised in international transactions”, in other words for present purposes UNIDROIT principles, in addition to applying all the provisions of the Agreement including the governing law clause, which will also determine the governing law of the arbitration agreement, for the reasons I have given.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">So far as the “English law plus” provisions are concerned, they do not assist Mr Tse’s argument on this part of the appeal, in the sense that they do not point to some different system of law (specifically French law) as governing the arbitration agreement than English law plus. The first sentence of Article 2 is concerned with how the parties carry out their obligations under the FDA and has nothing to say about what law governs their arbitration agreement. The second sentence provides that the provisions of the Agreement are to be interpreted in good faith but that also tells one nothing about the governing law of the arbitration agreement. In any event, the fact that the provisions are to be interpreted in good faith cannot justify an interpretation which goes beyond what has been agreed or which seeks to rewrite the Agreement: see per Lord Bingham of Cornhill at [19] of <span style="font-style:italic">R v Immigration Officer at Prague Airport</span> [2004] UKHL 55; [2005] 2 AC 1, albeit in the context of the interpretation of international treaties in good faith. Likewise, the UNIDROIT principles, upon which Mr Tse placed so much reliance, are silent as to which system of law governs any agreement, let alone the arbitration clause in an agreement.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The concept of the separability of an arbitration agreement now enshrined in section 7 of the Arbitration Act 1996 does not assist Mr Tse in this context. The rationale of separability is that it ensures that the dispute resolution procedure chosen by the parties survives the main agreement becoming unenforceable for example because of fraud or misrepresentation. As Moore-Bick LJ said in <span style="font-style:italic">Sulamerica</span> at [26]: “Its purpose is to give legal effect to that intention, not to insulate the arbitration agreement from the substantive contract for all purposes.” In other words it does not preclude the arbitration agreement being construed with the remainder of the main agreement as a whole, <span style="font-style:italic">a fortiori</span> where the clear intention is that the main agreement should be construed as a whole and where, as here, there is nothing in the wording of the arbitration agreement which suggests that it is intended to be construed in isolation from the remainder of the main agreement; quite the contrary, as the first sentence of Article 14.3 demonstrates for the reasons I have given.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Likewise, there is nothing in Mr Tse’s point that Article 14 does not contain the express words: “This arbitration agreement shall be governed by English law”. As Andrew Smith J said in <span style="font-style:italic">Arsanovia</span> at [22]: “Express terms do not stipulate only what is absolutely and unambiguously explicit”. If, as I have held, the express words the parties have used in Articles 1 and 15 and the first sentence of Article 14.3, demonstrate a clear intention that the entire FDA including the arbitration agreement, is to be governed by English law, it matters not that this is not spelt out expressly in Article 14 itself.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Likewise, I do not consider that the appellant gains any assistance from the third sentence of Article 14.3: “The arbitrator(s) may have to take into consideration some mandatory provisions of some countries <span style="font-style:italic">i.e. </span>provisions that appear later on to have an influence on the Agreement.” Contrary to Mr Tse’s submission set out at [35] above, it does not seem to me that the sentence is focusing on mandatory provisions of French law as the seat of the arbitration. The words “may” and “appear later on” suggest that what is in contemplation is something which may happen after the FDA is made, for example, it suddenly becoming illegal under the law of Kuwait to sell these particular food products. Even if that third sentence has the meaning for which Mr Tse contends, the mandatory application of French law as the supervisory law of the arbitration because its seat is Paris cannot overcome the clear express choice of English law as the governing law of the arbitration agreement. </p>

Since those questions do not require to be answered, it seems to me better to leave them for determination in another case where they are a necessary part of the determination to be made by the Court.  </p>

In his judgment, at [13], Lord Sumption discussed the fact that the UNIDROIT principles did recognise in the first sentence of Article 2.1.18 that No Oral Modification clauses are effective although the second sentence went on to provide an exception to the application of that rule: “However, a </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Similarly, the principle of good faith and fair dealing, whether in Article 2 of the FDA or Article 1.7 of the UNIDROIT principles, cannot be used to override the clear wording of the No Oral Modification clauses to a greater extent than identified by Lord Sumption JSC. The first sentence of Article 2 is focusing on good faith and fair dealing in the performance by the parties of their obligations under the FDA. It cannot be used to make someone a party to the FDA who would not otherwise be a party as a matter of English law, assuming that there was no estoppel precluding reliance on the Oral Modification clauses. The second sentence of Article 2 refers to interpretation of the provisions of the FDA in good faith, but in my judgment that sentence cannot enable the appellant to override the No Oral Modification clauses on broader grounds than laid down in <span style="font-style:italic">Rock Advertising</span> for two reasons. First, I consider that the analogy with the interpretation of treaties considered by Lord Bingham in the <span style="font-style:italic">Immigration Officer at Prague Airport</span> case is an apt one. Interpretation in good faith cannot be used to rewrite the FDA so as to dilute the strict wording of the No Oral Modification clauses. The second, related, reason is that to use interpretation in good faith as justifying the overriding of the No Oral Modification clauses in wider circumstances than laid down by <span style="font-style:italic">Rock Advertising</span> would be to apply a rule which contradicts the strict wording of the FDA, contrary to the last sentence of Article 14.3. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Furthermore, although Mr Tse sought to make much of the reference in the second sentence of Article 14.4 to the remedies provided by the FDA being “cumulative”, I do not consider that provision assists his case. Article 14.4 is preserving the right to apply for injunctive relief under any applicable law and is making clear that this is permissible, as the full sentence reads: “All remedies provided in this Agreement are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law.” In that context, it is not entirely clear what is intended to be conveyed by saying that the remedies under the FDA are “cumulative”, but whatever it means, it cannot cut across the prohibition in the last sentence of Article 14.3 or permit some broader overriding of the No Oral Modification clauses than permitted by application of the <span style="font-style:italic">Rock Advertising</span> test.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Accordingly, given that there was no question of the addition of KFG as a party having been agreed in writing or of any consent in writing to their addition, the No Oral Modification clauses in the FDA would mean that KFG did not become a party to the FDA or the arbitration agreement unless, applying the <span style="font-style:italic">Rock Advertising</span> test there were “(i)…some words or conduct unequivocally representing that the variation was valid notwithstanding its informality; and (ii) something more would be required for this purpose than the informal promise itself.” It is clear from the judge’s findings of fact, particularly at [50] to [53] of his judgment that the appellant cannot begin to satisfy the <span style="font-style:italic">Rock Advertising</span> test. Furthermore, none of the matters now relied upon by the appellant as set out at [43] above, satisfy that test. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">At various points in the submissions he made to this Court, Mr Tse sought to take the Court to the documents upon which he had relied before the judge. Quite apart from the fact that no permission was granted for an appeal on the facts, so that this Court could not go behind the judge’s findings, it is clear that, at most, the documents relied upon are consistent with KFG treating itself as if it were the licensee, but as the judge correctly concluded for the reasons he gave in [51] of his judgment, that would not be enough. Furthermore, at most that would equate to “the informal promise itself” and would come nowhere near being an unequivocal representation that the variation of the FDA to add KFG as a party was valid notwithstanding that the formal requirements of the No Oral Modification clauses had not been complied with.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In my judgment, given that the appellant could not satisfy the <span style="font-style:italic">Rock Advertising</span> test, the judge should have made a final determination that KFG was not a party to the FDA or the arbitration agreement, so that the Award was not enforceable against KFG under section 103(2) of the Arbitration Act 1996. I consider that in failing to make that final determination but adjourning the appellant’s application for enforcement for a possible further hearing after the determination of the issue of annulment by the Cour d’appel de Paris, the judge erred in principle and in law in two respects. First, he overlooked that the decision of the French Court was not relevant to the questions of English law and its application to the facts which were before the judge. This was <span style="font-style:italic">a fortiori</span> the position given that the French Court would not apply the Article V(1)(a) of the New York Convention test in determining the law of the arbitration agreement, but internal French law. I suppose the only possible relevance of the decision of the French Court would be if it annuls the Award, so that in effect the English proceedings become academic, but that future possibility would be no reason for adjourning the English proceedings at the behest of the Award creditor after three days of hearing on the merits of the application to enforce the Award.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The second error the judge made is that he failed to make any assessment as to whether, in the event that the application was restored for further hearing after the determination by the French Court, the appellant had a real prospect of successfully establishing that KFG was a party to the FDA and the arbitration agreement and thus of enforcing the Award as a judgment in this jurisdiction under section 101 of the Arbitration Act 1996. In other words the judge should have considered whether the appellant could satisfy the summary judgment test, in accordance with <span style="font-style:italic">Honeywell</span>.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In his submissions before this Court, Mr Tse sought to argue that the preliminary issues as ordered by Teare J were intended to be issues of law and that it had been contemplated that, after their determination, there would be a further full hearing on the merits with evidence. This seems to me to be unrealistic. It is quite clear that what took place before Sir Michael Burton was a three day hearing at which the appellant referred the judge to the evidence before the arbitrators upon which it relied to establish that KFG was a party to the FDA and the arbitration agreement. As the judge noted, the decision of the Supreme Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Rock Advertising</span> came after the Award was published.  In the light of that decision, it was for the appellant to establish that it could satisfy the <span style="font-style:italic">Rock Advertising</span> test for estoppel, as if it did not the No Oral Modification clauses made it quite clear that the formal requirements for KFG to have become a party to the FDA or the arbitration agreement were not satisfied. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in">that at a further hearing before the Commercial Court the appellant had a real prospect of successfully enforcing the Award. It is obvious from the judge’s findings, particularly at [47] to [53], that, on the material before the judge, there was no such prospect given that the appellant could not begin to satisfy the <span style="font-style:italic">Rock Advertising</span> test. The error in the judge’s approach in nonetheless granting the adjournment is that he does not seem to have given any consideration to what additional material or evidence would, or even might, emerge during the proceedings before the French Court or otherwise before any further hearing before the Commercial Court, which would give the appellant a real prospect of satisfying the <span style="font-style:italic">Rock Advertising</span> test and thus of being entitled to enforce the Award as a judgment. On the contrary, the judge appears to have considered the prospect of any further evidence improving the appellant’s position as remote. In [54] he referred to the “remnant of the [appellant’s] case” and at [66(3)] to “the unlikely possibility that a further consideration by reference to English law…might give a different answer”.  </p>

In those circumstances, this whole part of the appellant’s case that it should have a “last chance” at a further hearing was no better than Mr Micawber’s hope that something would turn up. In my judgment the judge should have concluded, in view of his conclusion that the prospect of a different decision being reached at a later hearing was remote, that an adjournment should not be granted and that he should have made a final determination refusing recognition and enforcement of the Award.  </p>
