Secondly, where the values under the two articles are in conflict, an intense focus on the comparative importance of the specific rights being claimed in the individual case is necessary. Thirdly, the justifications for interfering with or restricting each right must be taken into account. Finally, the proportionality test must be applied to each.

This is the reason it is so important not to forget why proceedings are required to be subjected to the full glare of a public hearing. It is necessary because the public nature of proceedings deters inappropriate behaviour on the part of the court. It also maintains the public’s confidence in the administration of justice. It enables the public to know that justice is being administered impartially. It can result in evidence becoming available which would not become available if the proceedings were conducted behind closed doors or with one or more of the parties’ or witnesses’ identity concealed. It makes uninformed and inaccurate comment about the proceedings less likely. … Any interference with the public nature of court proceedings is therefore to be avoided unless justice requires it.

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:0.04in">Fourth, the Appellant mischaracterises [47] where the UTJ actually said: “[i]t is true, of course, that Judge McKenna’s own decision was not reasoned out as fully as the discussion above but nor did it need to be”. The UTJ also correctly found that interlocutory decisions can be summary in nature. Further, the FTT did indeed give sufficient reasons, and the Appellant did not allege otherwise in the appeal before the Upper Tribunal: it was on the narrow point of anonymity.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.04in">The Respondent correctly points out that the Appellant has raised new arguments which were not before the Upper Tribunal.  More importantly, the Appellant seeks to argue matters which stray beyond that for which he was given leave in this appeal. FTTJ McKenna granted permission to appeal her interlocutory ruling refusing <span style="font-style:italic">anonymity</span> only, and the Upper Tribunal granted permission to appeal to this Court on a point of law related to that issue. The Appellant did not appeal FTTJ McKenna’s finding that certain documents were irrelevant and could therefore be excluded from the trial bundle. In light of that, the Appellant’s arguments about his documents being wrongly excluded, as they contained evidence necessary to secure his Article 6 rights, are outside the scope of this appeal. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.04in">The other complaints that the Appellant raises under this ground are misconceived for two reasons. First, as highlighted by the Respondent, the Appellant mischaracterises the UTJ’s remark on the FTT decision not being “reasoned out as fully as the discussion” in the Upper Tribunal, as stating that the decision did not need to be fully reasoned.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.04in">Second, the Appellant’s argument that he would have to abandon the proceedings in the FTT, absent measures being granted to protect his privacy, is circular and without merit for the reasons given by the Upper Tribunal.  As outlined below, there was no appreciable risk of a breach of his privacy. UTJ Wikeley therefore correctly held at [46] that the Appellant’s Article 6(1) arguments “essentially stand or fall with those put under Article 8”. Further, and in light of the lack of risk of a breach to his privacy, such an argument seeks to arrogate the fate of the open justice principle from the hands of the court to his own.  The impermissibility of this was highlighted by the Court in <span style="font-style:italic">ex p. Kaim Todner</span> at [9] (p 978G-979B): </p>

There must be some objective foundation for the claim which is being made. … It is not a reasonable basis for seeking anonymity that you do not want to be associated with a decision of a court. Nor is it right for an appellant to seek to pre-empt the decision of this court by saying in effect we will not cooperate with the court unless the court binds itself to grant us anonymity ”. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.04in">The Respondent submits that Ground 3 is misleadingly framed as one relating to the decision on anonymity, because the Appellant in fact argues that there has been a breach of Article 8 due to the UTJ referencing his medical condition. The references by the UTJ at [8] and [11] were broad: “I have a number of debilitating physical and mental health problems”; and “he is vulnerable, has a mental illness”. This amounts to a parasitic complaint against the substance of the Upper Tribunal decision, as opposed to identifying an error of law within<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>the decision.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.04in">The Respondent also submits that if anonymity is not maintained, then the Appellant’s medical condition will have been referred to in broad terms in a public decision. However, the denial of anonymity in that scenario would be the result of the Appellant’s Article 8 rights not prevailing in the ultimate balancing test. The Appellant submitted his information to the tribunal and was never guaranteed anonymity in respect of it. The starting point is open justice and the reasonable expectation is that such information will become public. Accordingly, the broad references do not breach Article 8. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.04in">In my view, Ground 3 must fail for two main reasons.  First, UTJ Wikeley’s claim at [45] of drafting decisions in a way that <span style="font-style:italic">minimises</span> risk of Article 8 interference is not tantamount to promising the <span style="font-style:italic">complete removal</span> of that risk.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.04in">Second, even if anonymisation is not granted, the broad references to the Appellant’s medical information by the UTJ would amount to a justified and proportionate interference with the Appellant’s Article 8 rights, as opposed to a breach of them. This is evident from the ultimate balancing exercise conducted by the UTJ, which rightly concluded that the principle of open justice prevails on the facts of this case. The Appellant failed to justify any derogation from that principle, and little weight attaches to his privacy rights for two reasons.  First, the Appellant had voluntarily initiated the present legal proceedings himself.  Second, the risk of ‘jigsaw’ identification in relation to previous proceedings subject to an anonymity order was less than negligible: there was no evidence of any wider public interest in the Appellant’s previous proceedings, which are no longer extant. </p>
