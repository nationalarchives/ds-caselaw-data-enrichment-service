	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The appeal concerns the inter-relationship between the Government’s Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (the Scheme) and the “adoption” of contracts of employment by administrators under the Insolvency Act 1986 (the Act). Specifically, the issue is whether by paying only the amounts which may be claimed under the Scheme to employees while they are “furloughed” under the Scheme and therefore not permitted to work for the Company, the administrators have adopted the contracts of those employees.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In summary, the effect of the adoption of a contract of employment is that the wages or salaries, together with some other amounts such as sick pay and holiday pay, for the period after adoption until termination of the employment or, if earlier, the end of the administration, are payable as expenses of the administration ahead of not only pre-administration unsecured liabilities but also many of the costs and expenses of the administration.  </p>

The Company has some 15,550 employees. Following the introduction of lockdown measures by the Government to combat the spread of the Covid-19 infection, the Company closed its stores and on 25 March 2020 wrote to approximately 13,000 employees, informing them that they were being placed on furlough under the Scheme. A further 867 employees were similarly furloughed in the following days.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In doing this, the judge followed the course adopted by Snowden J on 9 April 2020 when he gave similar directions on an application by the administrators of Carluccio’s Limited, which has a chain of over 70 restaurants with some 2,000 employees. The restaurants had closed in accordance with the lockdown measures and an administration order was made by the court on 30 March 2020. As recorded by Snowden J in his judgment at [13], the administrators’ strategy was to “mothball” the business and to seek a sale of it. As part of that strategy, they wished to put the employees on furlough under the Scheme. Snowden J heard the application in parts over 6-9 April 2020. Again, there was insufficient time to serve employees or to join a representative employee, but the judge heard submissions made by leading and junior counsel instructed by Unite the Union. Snowden J handed down a reasoned judgment on 13 April 2020: see <span style="font-style:italic">Re Carluccio’s Limited </span>[2020] EWHC 886 (Ch) (<span style="font-style:italic">Carluccio’s</span>). </p>

The guidance is not written in legal terms and Mr Smith QC, appearing for the administrators, accepted that the reference to “rehiring” was not to be taken to mean that the employees’ contracts of employment had been terminated.

In those cases, the relevant employees had all performed services for their employers after the expiry of 14 days from the appointments of the administrators or receivers, for which they had been paid. On those facts, it would be difficult, if not impossible, to contend that their contracts of employment had not been adopted, were it not for the letters that the officeholders had written to the employees in terms that were then standard. In those letters, the officeholders stated that they were not adopting the contracts of employment and were not assuming any personal liability for any sums that might fall due under them. The issue for the House as regards adoption was whether these letters had the effect that the contracts of employment had not been adopted. A further, and important, issue concerned the sums due under the contracts which enjoyed super-priority or for which the receivers would be personally liable, an issue that does not arise on the present appeal. </p>

What was needed was conduct on the part of the administrator which could be said to amount to an election to treat the contracts as continuing: see [53]. At [64], the judge said that in his view it was plain that by participating in the Scheme and paying remuneration to furloughed employees the Company “comes under a separate liability incurred in the administration which flows from the continued existence of the contract.

Those will be payments of remuneration pursuant to their contracts of employment, subject only to the limits. The employees’ entitlement to those payments is derived exclusively from their contracts. This is reflected in the tax position of both the employees and the Company. The remuneration will be income in the hands of the employees, chargeable to income tax (which will, in all or most cases, be collected through the PAYE system). The remuneration will be an expense of the Company’s trade and the payments by the Government under the Scheme will be income of the Company, for corporation tax purposes. </p>

For example, as the Scheme states, furloughed employees are free to undertake voluntary or paid work for others, but only if permissible under their employment contracts. They remain bound by duties of loyalty and the like. They will remain available, and they will be obliged, to provide their services to the Company as and when it is able to re-open its stores. </p>

The administrators rely on paragraph 66 of schedule B1 to continue to pay the remuneration of the furloughed employees but to do so they must think “it likely to assist achievement of the purpose of administration”.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Smith relied on three principal points for the opposite conclusion. First, the employees are not and will not be providing any services to the Company. It is a condition of the Scheme that they do not do so. Second, while they are furloughed, the employees’ remuneration is limited to that which is covered by the Scheme. The effect is therefore neutral as regards the administration estate. All payments made to the furloughed employees will be reimbursed to the Company under the Scheme or, once there are insufficient funds in the Company, the payments will be made out of the funds provided by the Government under the Scheme. As a matter of economic substance, the Company is the conduit for Government funds. Third, any decision whether to terminate the contracts of furloughed employees will be made only once the Scheme has ended. What that decision will be, as regards any employees, is presently impossible to predict and will depend on the circumstances when the Scheme ends. This is consistent with the basic aim of the Scheme, to prevent redundancies as a direct result of the lockdown. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">As to the first factor, the furloughed employees are not carrying out any work for the Company, and indeed are not permitted to do so under the terms of the Scheme. This is clearly a significant factor, and one that distinguishes the present case from <span style="font-style:italic">Paramount</span>. It is not, however, one that is sufficient by itself.

Even if there was no new work for the employee to do in the administration until it was known whether the business could be sold, it would be commercially important for the administrator not to terminate the employee’s contract. In that way, the employee would continue to be available to the purchaser of the business, the restrictive covenants in his contract would continue in effect, and the maximum post-termination period of restraint would be available for the potential benefit of the purchaser. Given those benefits to the administration, even if, with the permission of the administrator, the employee were not required to attend the premises to work, it would be wrong if they were not entitled to payment of their wages or salary [as a super-priority expense].” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Smith accepted, correctly in our view, that Snowden J was right in that example to conclude that the administrator would have adopted the contract of employment. While the enforced non-provision of services under the Scheme is a relevant factor, it is not decisive and must be balanced against the continued performance of the employment contracts by both sides in all other respects, save for the limit on remuneration, and against the administrator’s purpose in continuing with the employment contracts and the potential benefit to the administration. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The second factor on which Mr Smith relied was that, while the employees are furloughed, their remuneration is limited to the amounts payable under the Scheme. The effect is therefore neutral as far as the administration is concerned. In economic terms, the Company is a conduit for the payment of Government funds to the employees. We do not consider that this is a well-founded point. The legal analysis is clear, as explained above. The furloughed employees remained employed and they are paid the remuneration due under their contracts, subject to the maximum under the Scheme. The remuneration is an expense of the Company and the Government grants are income of the Company. The Government could have devised a furlough scheme which did not involve using the employer as the conduit for the remuneration, but it did not do so. The legal consequences of the Scheme must be decided by reference to its actual terms. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The third factor is that any decision to terminate the furloughed employees’ contracts is postponed until after the Scheme has ended. What that decision will be, as regards any employees, is presently impossible to predict and will depend on the circumstances when the Scheme ends. The short answer to this is that in the meantime the administrators have themselves taken steps to keep the contracts in being. They have done so in the hope, for which there must exist reasonable grounds, that the employees will be able to resume work under their contracts either during the administration or on its successful conclusion.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The question of the authority for paying wages or salaries was raised in <span style="font-style:italic">Carluccio’s</span>. Snowden J took the view that paragraph 99 was the provision “specifically designed to deal with the ability and obligation of administrators to pay wages or salaries to employees in an administration”. Without completely ruling out paragraph 66 as a source of authority, he considered that analysis of the authority to pay remuneration must begin with paragraph 99: see [55]-[56] and [111]-[112]. He accordingly considered that it would promote the rescue culture which underlies schedule B1 if paragraph 99 were interpreted to include the contracts of furloughed employees; see [73]-[74]. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">We agree with Mr Smith’s submission that paragraph 66 is an appropriate and perhaps the most obvious source of authority for these payments. The condition for payments under that paragraph, that the administrators think that the steps they are taking will be “likely to assist achievement of the purpose of administration”, will necessarily be satisfied. In contrast, by its terms, paragraph 99 operates only where a person ceases to be the administrator, although it may well the case, as Trower J observed at [40]-[41], that authority can also be derived from paragraph 99.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Smith very fairly outlined to us the difficulties that may face administrators in deciding whether to take the steps necessary to retain furloughed employees, or to place employees on furlough, if (as we have held) that will involve adoption of their employment contracts. In the present case, and it appears also in <span style="font-style:italic">Carluccio’s</span>, the administrators have been able to agree terms with the vast majority of employees, so that it is only in respect of 20 per cent of holiday pay that super-priority may arguably arise. However, as Mr Smith pointed out, whether this is practical in any given case will depend on factors such as whether employees are paid weekly or monthly, the timing of the next payroll, and the availability of email and similar links with employees. We can see that there may be good reasons of policy for excluding action restricted to implementation of the Scheme from the scope of “adoption” under paragraph 99, but such exclusion cannot be accommodated under the law as it stands.     </p>
