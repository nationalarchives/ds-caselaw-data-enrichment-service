She appeals from the order of Kerr J, sitting in the Employment Appeal Tribunal (“EAT”), dated 23 July 2019, by which he allowed the Respondent’s appeal against the decision of the Employment Tribunal (“ET”) sitting at Huntingdon (Employment Judge James, sitting with Mr T Wilshin and Mrs L Gaywood), dated 23 October 2018. On 25 November 2019, Henderson LJ granted permission to appeal to this court. Mrs Robinson (whom I shall call “the Claimant” or “the Appellant”) was represented before us, as she had been in the ET and EAT, by her daughter Ms Rachael Robinson. Mr Tom Kirk appeared for the Respondent (“the DWP”), as he too had done in the ET and EAT. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In November 2014, the DWP changed its computer hardware, which reduced the screen resolution on the computers and further impacted on the Claimant’s ability to see the monitor clearly. The Respondent undertook a risk assessment and its workplace adjustment team recommended that Mrs Robinson use screen magnification software. The team encountered a considerable number of technical difficulties when it tried to adapt the software to accommodate the Claimant’s needs. This lasted a lengthy period. There was a series of problems with: (a) the incompatibility of the screen magnification software, called “Zoom Text”; (b) the Debt Manager programme which the Claimant had to use; and (c) a new computer called “Thick Client” which the Respondent tried to build for the Claimant. Even when Zoom Text and Debt Manager worked together to any extent, Mrs Robinson could not see all she needed to see because of the magnification, which could cause migraines. </p>

She took some leave of absence in July 2015 and more leave at later dates. There were discussions as to whether the leave should be classed as “special leave” or annual leave, and the Claimant later took sick leave. The difficulties continued throughout 2015 and into 2016, during which time the Respondent commissioned an occupational health assessment report from its Reasonable Adjustments and Support Team (“RAST”).  </p>

Accordingly, they consider that individual culpability is not an issue in this case. However, this does not alter the fact that a year after ZoomText was recommended it was still not in place neither does it diminish the impact various events had on Elaine. </p>

It is also clear that the Respondent was aware of the disability. The Tribunal has been referred to a number of instances of claimed unfavourable treatment. The Respondent suggests that the Claimant has wrongly asserted that she was removed from the debt management department. She was not removed from the department but she was removed from her existing role using the Debt Management software and placed into another element of the debt management department involved in EU collections. There is an assertion that the Claimant’s grievances were not completed in a fully or in a timely manner. The Tribunal is satisfied that the grievances and the appeal were fully completed but there were delays in dealing with the second appeal it was not dealt with in a timely manner. The Respondent has asserted that the delay was caused by the lack of suitable persons to deal with the grievance. In an organisation as large as the Respondent the Tribunal does not find it acceptable that a suitable person could not be found to hear the appeal. If there was noone locally the Respondent should have sought someone elsewhere in the department.  </p>

For the most part those recommendations were implemented in full. The problem lay in trying to get Zoomtext working on the available hardware in conjunction with other software. This was significantly delayed due to an apparent lack of technical support and knowledge as to how Zoomtext would (or would not) work on the Respondent’s hardware and in conjunction with other software. Ultimately the Respondent concluded that Zoomtext could not be made to work on the available hardware and that other screen magnification software was not suitable. Late in the day the Claimant was provided with a CCTV magnifier and this appears to allow her to successfully undertake her new role in EU work although it is clear that it doesn’t resolve all the Claimant’s difficulties.  </p>

In relation to moving the Claimant to the EU role the Respondent asserts that not later than 5 July 2016 she should have known that this was a permanent adjustment meaning that her claim should have been filed not later than 4 October 2016. The Respondent accepts that any claim of unfavourable treatment in relation to her second grievance, the outcome of which was notified to the Claimant on 4th May 2017 is in time bearing in mind the time for conciliation. The Tribunal has considered this submission. It is clear that the whole of the background circumstances to the Claimant’s claims arise out of a single narrative, albeit that it may be compartmentalised. The second grievance arose directly from the first grievance and while it related to different complaints, those complaints were derived from the outcome of the first grievance. </p>

The Tribunal has already found that the findings of the first grievance represent an acceptance that there has been discrimination arising from disability. Compensation was not an unreasonable request. The Respondent did not make any final determination in relation to the request for compensation until 4 May 2017 and it has been accepted that any claim of discrimination arising out of the second grievance and its appeal would be in time. Throughout the two grievances and the appeal the Respondent has been fully aware of the Claimant’s claim. The Tribunal is satisfied that it would be just and equitable to allow the Claimant’s claim of discrimination arising from disability to proceed and that it would not prejudice the Respondent who was aware of all the relevant facts and circumstances throughout.

The Claimant was represented by a family member who is not a legal professional or at least did not disclose that she was. It is clear that the Claimant considered that her internal claims were ongoing as were her IT problems. She has submitted that it would be proper to allow her claims to proceed although the Tribunal was not directly addressed on the question of being just and equitable.

The Respondent persisted in its seeking to find a solution that would enable the Claimant to return to her original role until it became clear that such a solution was not available. The Respondent assigned the Claimant work that would enable her to continue working at her same grade and as a result she has remained in employment. In reaching this conclusion the Tribunal has been mindful of the second finding in the first grievance to the effect that the Respondent had not provided the Claimant with a suitable workstation. That conclusion was drawn at a time when the use of Zoomtext remained a feasible solution. In the event Zoomtext and other magnification were all unsuitable for reasons given above and the Tribunal is satisfied that the finding in the first grievance would have been different had the true position been known.” </p>

Also, references to the "industrial jury" have less force now, when so many decisions are taken by an employment judge sitting alone. I should have preferred a more flexible approach, under which the EAT had a discretion, in a case where it was genuinely in as good a position as the ET to make the decision in question, whether to remit it nevertheless or to decide it for itself.

The first and most obvious (which has never been in dispute in this case) is that the ET is the sole judge of fact. The next is that it is well established (for example by <span style="font-style:italic">Chief Constable of West Yorkshire v Vento</span> [2003] ICR 318) that on an appeal to this court in a case which has been before the ET and then the EAT the question, strictly speaking is whether the ET made an error of law, not whether the EAT did so. This may seem counter-intuitive to litigants who are appealing “against the decision of the EAT” but it follows from the previous point. If the ET committed no error of law, the EAT cannot interfere. Conversely, if the ET’s judgment does contain an error of law it does not matter whether the EAT’s analysis of that error or of the claim as a whole was exactly accurate. </p>

Ms Robinson submits that this sentence is correct, should be taken at face value, and powerfully supports her submission that Kerr J was wrong to decide for himself that the s 15 claim must fail. Mr Kirk, on the other hand, submits that it is to be read in conjunction with the rest of  paragraph 18 and paragraph 19, with their respective use of the words “in principle” and “equivocal”, and that it is plain from Kerr J’s conclusion at paragraph 23 that in his view the facts found by the tribunal were <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> capable of supporting its conclusion that s 15 was breached.” I think Mr Kirk’s interpretation is the preferable one, but the important question is whether the ET were right, not whether Kerr J was right. </p>

This rejection of the claim under s 20 was the subject of an unsuccessful cross-appeal by the Claimant before the EAT, but Ms Robinson did not seek permission to reopen the issue before us. She was right, in my view, not to do so. There is no arguable error of law in paragraphs 66-67 of the ET judgment and these were conclusions plainly open to them on the facts. </p>

I do not read the grounds of appeal in that way: indeed, such an interpretation is flatly contradicted by the next paragraph of the notice of appeal in which the Appellant seeks an order allowing an appeal against the EAT judgment and substituting a finding that the Claimant was discriminated against under s 15, alternatively an order remitting the s 15 claim back to the same or a newly constituted ET.

In November 2014, he applied for early ill-health retirement on account of his depression. There was a long delay in dealing his application and he initiated a grievance. The position was complicated as he also had a serious heart condition that was worsening. He went off work in March 2015. The application for early retirement was  mishandled. A final decision was made in December 2015 to permit him to retire on ill-health grounds.

Moreover, he submits that the Claimant did not have to prove the reason for the unfavourable treatment but simply that disability was a significant influence in the minds of the decision makers. We agree with him that motive is irrelevant. Nonetheless, the statutory test requires a tribunal to address the question whether the unfavourable treatment is because of something arising in consequence of disability. As we have said, it need not be the sole reason, but it must be a significant or at least more than trivial reason. <span style="font-style:italic">Just as with direct discrimination, save in the most obvious case an examination of the conscious and/or unconscious thought processes of the putative discriminator is likely to be necessary. </span>In relation to issue 4.1.9, the Tribunal did not identify the reason for Ms Afsar's failure. In relation to issue 4.1.2, it made no examination of her thought processes. To the extent that the Tribunal addressed her thought processes at all in relation to issue 4.1.2, these were addressed at [107] by a finding that the reason for her failure to treat the Claimant as it was said she should have done was incompetence.

Whilst it is obviously a matter of concern that senior people were so seriously concerned about the process, that in itself has no other sensible relevance to the reasons for the delay in the particular process in the Claimant's case, nor does it touch on the reason why there was such a delay or even begin to demonstrate that those reasons included, consciously or unconsciously, the Claimant's disability or something arising from that disability………… </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Bousfield raises a second point, namely that early retirement was regarded as expensive and therefore the process was deliberately made more difficult. However, that too was addressed by the Tribunal at [122] where the Tribunal dealt with and rejected issue 4.1.15. The Tribunal rejected the factual basis for the allegation, going on to say that even if the burden shifted it was satisfied that ill-health retirement had a high hurdle and that it was not satisfied that there was either direct discrimination or discrimination arising from disability in this regard. In other words, it found this to be a difficult ill-health retirement process that demands a high hurdle before an individual is accepted as fulfilling the criteria for ill-health retirement, in part because the benefits provided are expensive to provide. That fact on its own does not mean that people without disability are treated any differently from those who do have a disability or that unfavourable treatment is involved by reference to the consequences of such disability. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.00in;text-indent:0.5in">It seems to us that the Tribunal did not find anything more in relation to issue 4.1.10 than that the ill-health retirement process was operated unreasonably and perhaps even to some extent unfairly. It did not find that there was unexplained, unreasonable conduct, and, as we have already indicated, whilst there was no clear explanation, as the Tribunal said, for all of the delay, there were a number of reasons that explained, at least, some delay, none of which involved unlawful discrimination of any kind. In those circumstances, we have come to the somewhat reluctant conclusion that this is a case where there is nothing in the findings of fact or in the evidence drawn to our attention that could lead a properly directed tribunal to reach the conclusion that a prima facie case of less favourable treatment on disability grounds or unfavourable treatment caused by something arising in consequence of disability has been established. The inevitable conclusion in this case is that there was no such unlawful discrimination, and we accordingly substitute that finding in relation to all three findings of unlawful treatment.” </p>

The lay members in particular, who have experience of managing absence and ill-health retirement processes of the kind in focus in this case, are concerned by the manner in which it was applied and operated by MoJ as found by the Tribunal. The Tribunal found that the system operated in a manner that caused stress and anxiety to the Claimant, who was already unwell with depression and who suffered a worsening of his heart condition as a consequence. It undoubtedly led to inordinate delay. The systemic failures and the inordinate delay that occurred here may have impacted more harshly on the Claimant as a disabled person and in future might operate more harshly on others with disabilities. However, that was not the case advanced by the Claimant to the Tribunal and not a case, accordingly, that we have been able to address. The lay members in particular feel that these systemic failures and the delays that they cause should be addressed for the future by those with responsibility at MoJ so that others are not subjected to what may be both unfair and disadvantageous treatment.” </p>

This argument depended, as Underhill LJ noted at paragraph 39, on the delays and mishandling being “an inseparable part of the system”, so that any applicant for ill-health retirement was inevitably subject to them and there was no need for an examination of the thought processes of individual decision takers. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.00in">“… I do indeed see real difficulties with Mr Westgate's argument. In the context of direct discrimination, if a claimant cannot show a discriminatory motivation on the part of a relevant decision-maker he or she can only satisfy the 'because of' requirement if the treatment in question is inherently discriminatory, typically as the result of the application of a criterion which necessarily treats (say) men and women differently. In this case, if the ill-health retirement process was inherently defective in the ways found by the ET, it does not follow that it was inherently discriminatory. In truth Mr Westgate's argument appears to be 'I would not be in the situation where I was the victim of delay and incompetence if I were not disabled'; but that kind of 'but for' causation is not regarded as sufficient to constitute direct discrimination. There is an analogy with the not uncommon case where an employee who raises a grievance about (say) sex discrimination which is then, for reasons unrelated to his or her gender, mishandled: the mishandling is not discriminatory simply because the grievance concerned discrimination. Mr Westgate's answer is that s 15 cases require a different approach. But as at present advised I cannot see why the differences between s 13 and s 15 (essentially (a) the extension of protection to cases where the cause of the treatment is 'something arising from' the protected factor, and (b) the use of 'unfavourable' rather than 'less favourable') justify any different approach to the meaning of </p>

One difference between the sections is that s 13 explicitly involves a comparison between how the claimant and other persons without the protected characteristic are treated – “less favourable treatment” – whereas s 15 refers only to “unfavourable treatment”. But both sections require the ET to ascertain whether the treatment (whether less favourable or unfavourable) was <span style="font-style:italic">because of </span>the protected characteristic and, as such, require a tribunal to look at the thought processes of the decision-maker(s) concerned.  </p>

Secondly, I agree with Kerr J that to uphold a claim under s 15 based on failure to implement the reasonable adjustments recommended within a reasonable time is incompatible with the tribunal’s rejection of the s 20 claim for failure to make reasonable adjustments.
