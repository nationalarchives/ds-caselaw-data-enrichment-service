	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The appellant, Mr Robin Clarke lives on the 20th (top) floor of a tower block owned by the respondent, Birmingham City Council. He appeals against the order of HHJ David Cooke (sitting as a Deputy High Court Judge) dated 4 July 2019 dismissing his claim for judicial review of a decision by the Council's Cabinet taken on 24 May 2018 ("the May 2018 Decision"): [2019] EWHC 1728 (Admin). By that Decision the Cabinet confirmed its earlier decision of 27 March 2018 approving an amended capital investment budget that included provision of some £19m (out of anticipated total expenditure of £31m over three years) to fund the retrofitting of sprinkler systems to all tower blocks owned by the Council ("the March 2018 Decision"). The decisions in 2018 followed a decision taken by the Cabinet on 27 June 2017 in principle to install such systems in the wake of the Grenfell Tower fire ("the June 2017 Decision").     </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Clarke considers that the decision to fit sprinklers is a waste of public money that could be better spent elsewhere.  He believes that the improvement in safety does not justify the expense and what he sees as other disadvantages, especially disruption to tenants. He complains that the Council has not investigated in any detail whether or not its tower blocks are subject to any material risk of catastrophic fire, sufficient to justify the cost of an additional contribution to reduction of risk of such a fire that might be achieved by fitting sprinklers ("the value for money issue").  In his view, the decision to fit sprinklers was a panic response by politicians, keen to be seen to be doing something in response to the tragedy at Grenfell Tower. A more considered evaluation would have shown that the fitting of sprinklers was not necessary or justified. </p>

We dismissed that application.  The witness statement was materially identical to an earlier statement for which permission to rely had been refused by Phillips LJ. Like that earlier application, it satisfied none of the tests applicable to introducing fresh evidence in an appeal and additionally was an abuse of process.  </p>

The Council's Director of Housing summarised existing fire protection measures and risk evaluation procedures at Birmingham's tower blocks.  It recommended that the Cabinet note and endorse the addition of water sprinkler systems in tower blocks through a rolling programme of sprinkler installation and fire prevention measures from capital receipts (and whether or not the Government was willing to pay).  It referred to expert consideration by the Fire Brigade. The Cabinet endorsed the action referred to in the report; </p>

He had been refused permission to challenge the decision itself as irrational. His second ground is not the subject of an appeal. The Judge concluded that the proposition that the Council was obliged as a matter of law to enter into a more detailed analysis before proceeding to approve the budgeted expenditure was unsustainable.  The Cabinet addressed the question asked of it by the Scrutiny Committee. It was entitled to decide, as it did, against further delay. As for a suggested failure on the part of Cabinet to give adequate reasons, it was doubtful that there was any obligation at all to provide reasons but in any event sufficient reasons could be identified. He dismissed Mr Clarke's challenge.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">We have referred above to various decisions taken by the Cabinet before the May 2018 Decision as "decisions". Mr Clarke does not accept that the June 2017 Decision was a formal (as opposed to an informal) decision to proceed with the retrofitting works.  He submits that all that the Cabinet was doing by the June 2017 Decision was noting the proposal for the retrofitting works.  Like the Judge, we consider it to be clear that the June 2017 Decision was a formal decision. That did not prevent further discussion on the merits and value of the proposed expenditure or, most relevantly, mean that there should not be proper consideration of the Scrutiny Committee's request following the call-in. However, in assessing the adequacy of that consideration, the earlier decisions are relevant context to the question of whether or not there was an unlawful failure to take relevant matters into account. The inprinciple decision to retrofit the sprinklers had been taken almost a year before the May 2018 Decision, and the budgetary and accounting formalities required to accommodate the installation programme had all been completed. It was not therefore necessary for all those matters to be repeated in the May 2018 Decision. </p>

She recommended upholding the March 2018 Decision. The Cabinet discussed the expert advice received; it discussed the possible lack of justification for a distinction between new and existing tower blocks in respect of fire safety measures. The Cabinet acknowledged that central government funding would not be available but continued to support the programme. In short, the Cabinet assured itself that the significant expenditure was justified. The chair then put the matter to a vote with the concluding remarks that the advice from the West Midlands Fire Officer and the Fire Commissioner in London was "crystal clear" and that there could be no further delay.   It is not appropriate to pick over the language used in debate to divine the thought processes of individual members or collective reasoning of a decision-making body.

There was from the outset detailed fire safety evidence which considered risk.  The written materials before the Cabinet as part of its consideration over almost a year did not deal with all the points that Mr Clarke now raises. That said, there was no legal obligation to do so.   We reject the submission that the Council was under any implied duty to consider factors beyond those that it did (or that any failure to do so was irrational). There is no basis for criticising the reasoning behind the May 2018 Decision, set against the background of the earlier considerations and decisions in 2017 and 2018, let alone interfering with it.   </p>

As confirmed by a witness statement from Mr Martin Tolley, one of the Council's local government officers, there are strict rules of local government finance as to how works such as the retrofitting of sprinklers to Council housing stock, held under Part II of the Housing Act 1985, can be funded. Those rules are principally to be found in Part VI of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989.  Their effect is that council tax payers and business rate payers cannot fund any of the works in question. Nor could the Council increase rent levels to cover any additional costs (because of s. 23 of the Welfare Reform and Work Act 2016).  In so far as there has been a recent change permitting the Council to increase rent levels from April 2020, that was not a change known in May 2018 and the Council has in any event not sought to fund the retrofitting works from rental payments. In short, at the time of the May 2018 Decision, there was no material conflict between the interests of those residents benefitting from installation of the sprinklers and council taxpayers, business rate payers or tenants. It is true that council tax and business ratepayers could be liable for the Council's borrowing to fund, in part, the retrofitting works if the ring-fenced Housing Revenue Account ran into difficulties in meeting interest and capital payments in the future, given the terms of s.13 of the Local Government Act 2003.  But that is entirely theoretical and does not bear on a fiduciary duty argument. In the result, there was no balancing exercise by reference to those interests to be carried out; </p>
