He noted that “[h]is [the reviewing officer’s] logic was that there had been a refusal to sign the tenancy agreement and that was equivalent to a refusal to accept the offer” and that there was no challenge to that reasoning.

Read as a whole, the judge decided that the reviewing officer had found that there had been a refusal of the offer and that the refusal was constituted by the failure to sign the agreement.

The judge held that on the face of it, the point was hopeless because “the offer remained open for acceptance up until the letter of 7 July 2017 by which [time] the council indicated that it was relying on the facts which had occurred to trigger a cessation of the duty”. See judgment at [81]. However, having considered the Redbridge file notes of 3 and 7 July 2017 concerning the availability of the Property, the judge stated that he was not concerned with any offer made by Sanctuary, but only the offer made by Redbridge itself. As there was no suggestion that Redbridge had withdrawn its offer prior to the 4 July 2017, the Reviewing Officer did not need to consider it. See judgment at [86] - [88].

First, it is said that he ought to have set aside the Review Decision because it was based on a finding that Mrs Nikolaeva had refused an offer of accommodation made by Redbridge on 4 July 2017, which was irrational and contrary to the evidence; and to the extent that the judge concluded that the Review Decision should, nevertheless, stand because Mrs Nikolaeva had been given reasonable opportunity to consider the offer by 29 June 2017 and/or the reviewing officer had made a clear finding to that effect, the judge’s conclusions were contrary to the evidence. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Secondly, it is said that the judge erred in concluding that there was no requirement on the reviewing officer to consider whether the accommodation had still been available for Mrs Nikolaeva on 4 July 2017. The judge distinguished between the offer of accommodation made by Redbridge and the offer of a tenancy made by the proposed landlord, Sanctuary, and in doing so, it is said that he misdirected himself as to the requirements of section 193(7) of the 1996 Act. On a proper reading of that section, it is alleged that the acceptance or refusal of an offer of accommodation can only lead to the cessation of the housing duty if the accommodation is still available so that acceptance of the offer would result in an assured or secure tenancy.  </p>

Given that the challenge in the County Court is treated as a first appeal, the responsibility on the Judge considering the challenge is heavy, and, if he or she is satisfied that there is an error in the reasoning which undermines the basis upon which the decision was arrived at, then the decision should obviously be set aside.  </p>

Although they may often be checked by people with legal experience or qualifications before they are sent out, review decisions are prepared by housing officers, who occupy a post of considerable responsibility and who have substantial experience in the housing field, but they are not lawyers. It is not therefore appropriate to subject their decisions to the same sort of analysis as may be applied to a contract drafted by solicitors, to an Act of Parliament, or to a court's judgment.  </p>

To my mind, given the importance, particularly to the applicant, of the issues considered in review decisions, such fullness is to be strongly encouraged. However, as any lawyer knows, the more fully an opinion is expressed, the greater the opportunity for alleging mistakes of fact, errors of law, or inconsistencies.

Although the court will adopt the benevolent approach outlined by Lord Neuberger, given the huge importance of a review to the  homeless person in question or those threatened with homelessness, it is essential that review decisions are concise where possible, contain an accurate record of the relevant facts and are structured in a way which enables the reader easily to follow the conclusions which have been reached and the reasons for those conclusions. There is no set rubric. However, the structure adopted should leave the person to whom the housing duty is allegedly owed and the local housing authority which allegedly owes it, in no doubt about the reasoning which has led the reviewing officer to his conclusions.  </p>

Section 193(7) of the 1996 Act is concerned with the refusal of “a final offer of accommodation under Part 6.” If one reads section 193(7) in the context of section 193 as a whole and section 193(7F), in particular, it is clear that the offeror in relation to a final offer is the local housing authority itself. Section 193(7F) provides that the local housing authority shall not “(a) make a final offer of accommodation under Part 6 for the purposes of subsection (7) . . . unless they are satisfied that the accommodation is suitable for the applicant and that it is reasonable for him to accept </p>

This is consistent with the fact that it is the local housing authority which owes a duty to the homeless: see section 193(1) – (3). The offer in question, in this case, therefore, is the final offer of accommodation made by Redbridge.  </p>

In this regard, Mr Chataway pointed, by way of example, to section 193(6)(c) and (cc) which contain two ways in which the local housing authority can cease to be under the main housing duty contained in section 193(2). They are where the applicant accepts an offer of accommodation under Part 6 or where he accepts an offer of an assured tenancy from a private landlord. He submits, therefore, that it is clear that the final offer must be linked to a concrete offer of a tenancy which can be accepted.  </p>

The plain wording of section 193(7) makes the matter quite clear. The local housing authority ceases to be subject to the duty under section 193 if the applicant refuses “a final offer of accommodation”. In order to be an “offer of <span style="font-style:italic">accommodation</span>” (emphasis added) it seems to me that it must be made by reference to an actual property which the applicant can occupy. Otherwise, the offer is not “of accommodation”. It is merely abstract.  </p>

For example: the local housing authority’s duty is ended by the acceptance of an offer of accommodation or an assured tenancy under section 193(6)(c) and (cc); and section 193(7F) requires the local housing authority to be satisfied that the accommodation is suitable for the applicant and that it is reasonable for the person in question to accept the offer.

It stated that Mrs Nikolaeva had been nominated to an assured tenancy of the Property and that the nomination had been made under Part 6 of the Housing Act 1996. It went on, quite properly, to distinguish the nomination from the final offer of accommodation. Redbridge stated that: “[<span style="font-style:italic">I]f the nomination is successful</span> and you are offered [the Property] this offer will constitute a final offer of accommodation for the purpose of Section 193 of the Housing Act 1996, Part VII.” (emphasis added)  </p>

That condition was satisfied on 29 June 2017. It follows that I agree with the judge that the offer for the purposes of section 193 is that of the local housing authority and not the housing association which may grant an applicant a tenancy. I also agree with Mr Chataway that a final offer of accommodation must be connected to the actual provision of accommodation.   </p>

I am satisfied, therefore, that at this point your client had the opportunity to change her mind and say she would be accepting the offer and would sign the agreement as, at this point, the accommodation was still potentially available. The information recorded by the officer that spoke to your client does not indicate to me that she was seeking advice or clarification before agreeing to sign the tenancy agreement. There is no indication that your client requested more time to consider her position nor advised that she was now willing to sign the agreement. In fact, I note that the officer noted that your client’s refusal was specifically because of the communal garden, which would indicate to me that your client was actively refusing the offer of accommodation. I am mindful that it seems reasonable for the Allocations team to have taken this as a refusal of the offer. The fact that the accommodation was no longer available to your client at the point Mr Sharma interviewed your client to decide whether or not to discharge the duty owed is not, to my mind, relevant to whether or not he could or could not elect to make use of the London Borough of Redbridge’s ability to consider the duty owed to your client to be complete as the fact that your client was considered to have refused the offer on the 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> of July is the relevant fact . . . ” </p>

The former stated that the housing officer had tried unsuccessfully to speak to Mrs Nikolaeva to let her know that Redbridge did not accept her reasons for refusing the tenancy and the latter made clear that the housing officer spoke to Mrs Nikolaeva regarding her 3 July letter and her refusal to sign the tenancy agreement.

As the reviewing officer’s conclusions about 4 July 2017 were not irrational, this submission goes nowhere.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Chataway submitted that, at best, the reviewing officer was vague about whether the Property was available on 4 July and that he needed to be clear. For example, the reviewing officer noted at [33] of the Review Decision that the Property was “still potentially available” on 4 July and at [43] suggested that he might have taken a different view if Mrs Nikolaeva had been willing to sign the tenancy agreement on 4 July 2017 but Sanctuary had not allowed her to do so.    </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">This issue can be dealt with very shortly. As Mr Chataway points out in his written submissions, when considering this aspect of the matter at [81] – [92] of his judgment, it seems that the judge focussed solely upon Redbridge’s offer (using the term in the widest sense) rather than coupling it with the availability of the Property. As I have already mentioned, my analysis is slightly different. Redbridge’s final offer of accommodation was conditional upon accommodation actually being offered. It follows therefore, that the availability of the Property was an important part of the reviewing officer’s reasoning.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It seems to me, however, that the decision is the only one which rationally could have been reached. There was no evidence that the Property had been taken back on 4 July 2017 or at any relevant time. It is clear from the file note of the conversation on 3 July 2017 that the Property remained available then, had not been taken back by Sanctuary at that stage and that Sanctuary needed a nomination by the following day (4 July 2017) or they would be taking the Property back. The file note does not record that the Property would be taken back on 4 July 2017, just that a nomination was needed that day or the Property “would be taken back” at an undefined time in the future. Further, there is no evidence whatsoever to suggest that it was taken back on 4 July. In any event, Mr Chataway accepted that it could be safely assumed that had Mrs Nikolaeva changed her mind on 4 July and had the Property actually been taken back at that stage, Redbridge would have been able to re-nominate her for the Property.   </p>
