He challenged both requests, and there were prolonged proceedings in the Magistrates Court culminating in a decision dated 3 September 2014 dismissing his challenge.  He appealed to the High Court.  By a decision dated 11 December 2015 ([2015] EWHC 3535 (Admin)) a Divisional Court comprising Leggatt J and Sir Richard Aikens dismissed his appeal. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">One of Mr Devani’s grounds of challenge to his extradition was that prison conditions in Kenya were such that his return to face detention there, whether on remand or following any eventual sentence, would contravene article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  The Divisional Court found that prison conditions in Kenya generally were indeed not “article 3 compliant”.  But it upheld the District Judge’s rejection of the challenge because the Commissioner of Prisons for Kenya and its Director of Public Prosecutions had written formal letters of assurance to the Home Office stating that Mr Devani would be detained in a particular prison in Nairobi, Kamiti prison, where the accommodation and facilities were article 3 compliant and where he would have a cell to himself: see paras. 165-167 of the judgment of Sir Richard Aikens. </p>

He claimed that equivalent assurances given in the case of a Mr Gilbert Deya, and on the basis of which he had been extradited to Kenya, had been disregarded.  Mr Deya, who held himself out as an evangelist, was extradited to Kenya to face charges of child trafficking in connection with a “miracle babies” scam. </p>

FTTJ Sullivan held that she could place no reliance on this, and I need say nothing more about it.  The other was a print-out of a story dated 11 August 2017 on what appears to be a Kenyan news website and apparently written by a journalist.

The news article at page 1 of the Appellant’s bundle (only the first of two pages has been included), dated 11 August 2017, confirms that Mr Deya was being held at Kamiti prison.  It sets out his complaint that, in breach of Kenyan assurances, he was being held in a dirty room with 11 other people.  It refers to him appearing before a Chief Magistrate.  The report is dated within one month of the High Court decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Deya</span>.  Its contents suggest that it was written within 6 days of Mr Deya’s return to Kenya.  Based on this report and in the absence of anything on its face undermining its reliability and of any evidence from the Respondent challenging the contents of the report I find that on return to Kenya Mr Deya was held in shared prison accommodation for 6 days, in breach of assurances which had been given by the Kenyan government.   </p>

In light of the subsequent evidence relating to Mr Deya I find that there is a real risk that on return to Kenya the Appellant would not be held in keeping with the Kenyan assurances given to the High Court but would be held in conditions breaching Article 3 of the 1950 Convention.” </p>

It is, however, instructive to consider the authorities on the meaning of CPR 40.12, allowing the Court to correct at any time ‘an accidental slip or omission in a judgment or order’. Despite the width of the wording in the CPR, there is an important restriction on the power given by that rule. The power is there to enable a misprint to be corrected, or to make the judge's meaning clear: <span style="text-decoration:underline">Bristol-Myers Squibb v Baker Norton</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">Pharmaceuticals Inc</span> [2001] EWCA Civ 414. The power cannot be used to change the substance of a judgment or order: further authorities are cited at CPR 40.12.1 in the White Book. It is because the judge can use the slip rule only to make his original meaning plain rather than to change his original decision, that the Civil Procedure Rules and the Tribunal's Procedural Rules contain no provision for consultation with the parties. Indeed it is difficult to see that the parties ought to have any input into the judge's expression of what he originally meant. </p>

As I say there, how the distinction applies in a particular case may not always be straightforward, but the concept is clear.  The proposition which the UT drew from the case to which it referred and from the White Book commentary, namely that the slip rule “cannot be used to change the substance of a judgment or order”, is perfectly apt as a reference to the second of the two classes of case that I have mentioned; but it appears from the UT’s actual decision that it understood it to mean that the slip rule could not be used in a case where the correction would produce a decision with the opposite effect to that promulgated.  With all respect, that is simply wrong.  In the case of a simple failure of expression – most obviously a straightforward slip of the pen – the error can and should be corrected even if it alters the outcome (as initially expressed) by 180°.   </p>

His reason for taking that course was that she had failed to raise that challenge in accordance with “the relevant procedure rules”: specifically, he referred to her failure (a) to appeal or (b) to provide a rule 24 response or (c) to serve a skeleton argument.  Mr Chapman submitted that that was a misdirection: there was no obligation on the Secretary of State to take any of those steps. </p>

In my view Mr Tufan was quite right in his submission to DUTJ Latter (see para. 16 above) that that course was not open to her because she was (ostensibly) the winning party.  As appears from para. 17 of his decision, the Judge acknowledged that that had once been the law, but he said that the position was changed by section 11 (2) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007, which reads “Any party has a right of appeal, subject to subsection (8)<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="3">

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in">Subsection (1) defines a right of appeal, so far as relevant, as a right of appeal to the UT on a point of law.  I accept that on a literal reading subsection (2) could be construed as giving a right of appeal not only to a party against whom an order has been made but also to a party who has obtained, as regards that order, the exact outcome that they sought: although usually the winning party would have no wish to appeal, occasionally they may be dissatisfied with particular findings made by the Court or with aspects of its reasoning (the present case, if the slip rule were unavailable, would be an example albeit of a very specific kind).  But for the winning party to have a right of appeal in such a case would be contrary to well-established case-law governing the position in the common law courts, which reflects important policy considerations; the authorities are well-known, and I need only refer to the commentary in para. 9A-59.3 of the White Book.  It was not suggested to us that there was any reason why Parliament should have intended a different approach in the case of appeals to the Upper Tribunal.  Ms Broadfoot sought to support DUTJ Latter’s conclusion by reference to the decision of the UT in <span style="font-style:italic">EG and NG (Ethiopia)</span> [2013] UKUT 000143 (IAC), but that was not concerned with the present point at all.  I am sure that section 11 (2) of the 2007 Act is intended to confer a right of appeal only against some aspect of the actual order of the FTT, and that the phrase “any party” must be read as referring only to a party who has in that sense lost.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="4">

Accordingly the requirement in paragraph (3) (e) – and in particular the additional grounds provision – only applies in cases where the respondent chooses to provide a response in the first place.  He noted the contrast with rule 52.13 (2) of the Civil Procedure Rules, which provides that a respondent’s notice “must” be filed where the respondent wishes to uphold the decision of the court below on different or additional grounds.   </p>

I also note the requirement of paragraph (4) that a respondent who provides a response out of time must seek an extension: that would seem to be empty if there were no circumstances in which a response was mandatory.

Any appeal to the UT must be on legal grounds in the sense that it asserts an error of law on the part of the FTT; and the challenge advanced by Mr Tufan to the conclusion in paras. 48-49 was essentially that it was perverse.  That is a sufficient answer, but I should say that I do not in any event understand the significance attached to the separate reference to the additional grounds point or to the parenthesis. </p>

That notice would most appropriately have been given by providing a rule 24 response sooner than the deadline under paragraph (2) (a), but it would have been acceptable for the point to be made in correspondence or, as the Judge said, in a skeleton argument.

I do not know what arrangements exist for considering in good time before a UT hearing what steps need to be taken by way of preparation, but the Home Office might wish to consider whether this was a one-off error (it is fair to say that the appeal came on pretty quickly) or whether it reveals some more systemic deficiency.   </p>

This is a premise of effective relations between sovereign States.  As I have said the assumption may be contradicted by evidence; and it is the court’s plain duty to consider such evidence (where it is presented) on a statutory appeal under the 2003 Act.  But where the requesting State is one in which the United Kingdom has for many years reposed the confidence not only of general good relations, but also of successive bilateral treaties consistently honoured, the evidence required to displace good faith must possess special force.  The second obstacle is linked to the first.  It is a general rule of the common law that the graver the allegation, the stronger must be the evidence to prove it.  In this case it has been submitted that the United States will violate, at least may violate, its undertakings given to the United Kingdom.  That would require proof of a quality entirely lacking here.” </p>

Mr Deya was, to put it no higher, a witness whose reliability was highly questionable. To the extent that the report was based on statements by Mr Swaka, Mr Deya’s lawyer, he was a witness whose evidence had already been held by FTTJ Sullivan to be unreliable.   </p>

To make the finding which she did, the Judge must have attached considerable weight to this report which it simply does not carry.  In my judgment, it was an assessment of evidential weight which can only be described as perverse and as such represents an error of law.  The article did </p>
