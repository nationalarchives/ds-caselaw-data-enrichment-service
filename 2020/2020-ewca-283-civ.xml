On 11 December 2019 hehanded down a judgment making factual findings about three aspects of the father's conduct which are said to be relevant to the contact arrangements, including the risk of abduction ("the fact-finding judgment"). On 17 January 2020 he handed down a judgment determining issues which arose from certain assurances given to the Court on behalf of the Government of UAE and the Emirate of Dubai and from a waiver of immunity made by the father as Vice-President and Prime Minister of the UAE and as Ruler of Dubai, again principally directed at the mother's fear that the children might be abducted ("the assurances and waiver judgment").

Also in accordance with normal practice, accredited representatives of the UK media have been entitled to attend each hearing, and several have done so; but because of the private nature of the proceedings there have been very strict limitations on what they could report.

He decided that both the previous judgments should be made public and that the journalists who had attended the hearings should be able to report what they observed in so far as it related to them. Prohibitions on reporting the names, age and gender of the two children were lifted. Other restrictions, including the publication of where they live and go to school, and of their photographs, remain in place.</p>

The father has appealed against that order also, again with the permission of the President. It is common ground that that appeal is in practice dependent on the outcome of the primary appeal. Publication of all three judgments has been stayed pending the decision on the appeals.</p>

That meant not only that he personally gave no evidence, about which there were real difficulties in view of his special position, but that he called no witnesses of his own and did not instruct counsel to cross-examine the mother and her witnesses or to make any submissions. The President was accordingly obliged to assess the truth of the mother's allegations on the basis of the evidence adduced by her; but he nevertheless carried out a thorough and careful assessment of that evidence. His conclusion was that each of the three allegations had been proved by the mother to the requisite civil standard of proof.</p>

More detail can be found at paras. 44141 of his judgment, but it is sufficiently clear from that summary alone that there is an important public interest in the publication of the President's findings about the father's conduct. There has indeed already been considerable interest, both in this country and internationally, in what has happened to the two princesses, and it has received very wide coverage in the press, both in this country and abroad, and in online media.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.41in;margin-right:0.01in">We need to say rather more about the President's findings about the third allegation. He found that fromabout January 2019 the mother had experienced an increasingly hostile climate in her dealings with the father and those around him, involving various humiliations and threats to her safety and to her relationship with the children: we need not give the details but they appear at paras. 144-151 of the judgment. He makes no express finding about the father's motivation: at para. 144 he finds that in 2017/18, when she had not for some time been in an intimate relationship with the father, the mother had started an affair with one of her bodyguards, but that the change in the father's attitude did not begin when he first became aware of that but when she began to take an interest in what had happened to Shamsa and Latifa. He finds that it was as a result of his treatment of her over this period that she concluded that her position in Dubai was "wholly unsafe and untenable" (para. 152) and decided to come to England with the children.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.41in;margin-right:0.01in">The President finds that the father's campaign of intimidation and humiliation continued after the mother hadcome to England. Again, we need not give the details, which appear at paras. 153-157 of the judgment. More importantly for the purpose of the issues before us, he found that the father commenced a "media war" against the mother. In a three-week period in June/July 2019 over a thousand articles were published about her worldwide containing what the President describes as "hostile stories aimed at destabilising and harming her". The judgment does not contain full details, but he comments that many were "wholly inaccurate, for example, suggesting … that [she] is an agent of Hamas and intending to overthrow the State of Jordan". We have seen examples of the articles referred to, which relate both to her private life and to her alleged financial and political activities and are indeed deeply offensive; many of them contradict the President's findings about the circumstances in which, and the reasons why, she left Dubai. To anticipate, this part of the father's conduct is referred to in the subsequent evidence and the publication judgment as the creation of a "false media narrative" about the mother, to which she is acutely sensitive and which has had a serious impact on her relationships in the community and circles in which she would normally move.</p>

Where a parent is an ordinary citizen there is a powerful deterrent to any such attempt because he or she would be subject to serious sanctions from the courts, here or abroad, if they acted in breach of a court order. But in this case the father enjoys various immunities because of his position as Vice-President and/or Prime Minister of the UAE and/or as Ruler of Dubai, which on the face of it would mean that such sanctions were unavailable against him personally and might prove ineffective against persons acting on his behalf. That issue was sought to be addressed by a number of assurances and waivers offered by the father personally, by the UAE and by the Emirate of Dubai. The purpose of the assurances and waiver judgment was to decide what weight could be given to them as providing protection for the children from the risk of abduction.</p>

That position was based on a recent report from the Guardian directed specifically to the question whether the fact-finding judgment should be published (the assurances and waiver judgment had not at that point been handed down) and also whether that should occur in advance of the final welfare hearing. The Guardian had already had meetings <span style="background-color:000000">¦¦¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦¦</span></p>

Although he had at an earlier stage expressed caution about publication in advance of the final welfare hearing, his recommendation, after conducting a careful review of all the considerations, was that such publication would be in the best interests of the children. He believed that the absence of an authoritative account of the father's past conduct towards Shamsa and Latifa, and the dissemination of a distorted narrative of the reasons why the mother had left Dubai, was causing the mother what the President (summarising the Guardian's evidence) called "clear and stark psychological, social and emotional pressure", which in turn had a direct impact on the welfare of the children. The Guardian acknowledged that publication would be potentially harmful to the children by exposing their family history and their parents' relationship to public scrutiny but that that was outweighed by the advantage of there being what he called "an established narrative of their family history or life story". He believed that publication should occur now "so that contact can be re-established, supported and encouraged against a 'clean slate' rather than have any progress being derailed later". <span style="background-color:000000">¦¦¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦¦</span></p>

His essential conclusion is that the publication of the judgments will be of substantial benefit to the children for the reasons given by the mother and the Guardian. That is, it would counteract the father's false narrative which, as he found, adversely influences the attitudes towards the mother and the children of most of the people with whom they come into contact, even the mother's own family, and which is very damaging to them and has led to a high degree of social isolation. He acknowledges that publication is likely to result in a media storm and that in normal circumstances the Court would not sanction publication of negative findings about a father "at the very moment that [it] is actively contemplating the delicate task of re-establishing the father's relationship with his daughter and son"; and he acknowledged (see para. 68) that for that reason both he and the Guardian had initially been very cautious about the idea. But he finds that in the very special circumstances of this case publicity will be beneficial because of its impact on "the landscape of public opinion" (para. 73).

He is, of course, factually correct in that regard. However, the same factors will be in play if publication is delayed for, say, eight weeks until the conclusion of the welfare hearing. If the lives of the children are to be upset by publicity, that upset will happen at a stage during the process of considering contact and attempting to reintroduce it because that very process is bound to occupy the next six months or more, if not longer.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.84in;margin-right:0.46in;text-indent:0.5in">I have previously voiced the tentative opinion that it may well be right for the question ofpublicity to be evaluated along with all the other welfare issues and only determined at the final hearing. That view is one to which the father adheres and, through counsel, firmly submits to this court should be the outcome. I, however, no longer hold to that view for three principal reasons. Firstly, it is clear that, whatever the other welfare determinations the court may make, publication of these judgments in the course of the next two or three months is inevitable. On that basis, nothing is to be gained by awaiting an overall welfare evaluation and a full report from the children's guardian. Secondly, I accept the submission of Ms Palin that, with respect to Princess Shamsa and Princess Latifa and the implications that flow from the court's findings, the need for publication can be said to be urgent. Thirdly, the strength of the evidence in the mother's recent witness statement indicates that the need for publication in order to correct the negative narrative that surrounds the everyday existence of this mother and these children is also urgent and pressing. I repeat my observation that the baseline here is not of a family living in obscurity about whom nothing is known. Doing nothing, or postponing publication, allows for the continuation of the highly negative and harmful experience of living in circumstances in which all those with whom they have contact are likely to have been influenced by a largely false account of the mother's actions."</p>

Lord Pannick submits that the President had been wrong to decide the publication issue prior to having all the evidence made available to him: he had, he said, not therefore been in a position to conclude that publication of the judgment was inevitable in two to three months, or at all. In particular, Lord Pannick identified that the Guardian had not filed a report in relation to contact, there had been no cross-examination of the Guardian and the court had not yet had the benefit of the submissions on contact.</p>

Lord Pannick submitted that publication now would be an irrevocable act, but that the position in respect of publication might change by the time of the final welfare hearing. Should it be decided at a later stage that publication should not be allowed it would then be too late to put the matter right.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.41in;margin-right:0.01in">Lord Pannick characterises Reason 1 as being a classic example of impermissible predetermination andsubmitted that had the President delayed any decision until such time as he had available all the material presented at the welfare hearing, it would, at the very least, have been possible that he would have decided that publication would not be in the best interests of the children. In support of this submission, Lord Pannick relied upon a note prepared on behalf of the Guardian for a hearing on 13 December 2019. At that stage, the Guardian was of the view that any consideration of publication of the judgments was inextricably bound up with considerations of welfare. Whilst the Guardian, Lord Pannick says, is of course entitled to change his mind, the fact that he has done so once demonstrates that this order is premature since, upon preparing his welfare evaluation, he could change his mind again, by which time it would be too late if publication had already been permitted.</p>

In addition, the Guardian had had the benefit of seeing the children and the mother. As noted at para. 30 above, he filed a detailed welfare analysis recommending immediate publication of the finding of the fact-finding judgment.

Whilst technically the proceedings are part-heard (the factfinding hearing having been completed and the welfare hearing yet to be heard), these findings of fact are not, in our judgment, "interim" findings and Lord Pannick accepts that the fact-finding judgment is itself a final judgment. In our view, given that the facts found do not relate directly to the children, this is not a case where there is any likelihood of those facts being revisited at the welfare hearing.</p>

That was a conclusion that he was fully entitled to reach. In our judgment it is entirely reasonable to believe that the publication of the fact-finding judgment, representing as it does reasoned conclusions reached by the President of the Family Division after a self-evidently careful assessment of the evidence which he heard, will carry considerable weight and will, if not completely and if not in relation to anything like all of those people who may see reports of the case, nevertheless go a long way to correcting the false narrative which the President found to be current. In particular, he was entitled to conclude that the judgments would be of considerable value in altering the attitudes of those friends and family who have been influenced by that narrative into so hurtfully withdrawing their support and company from the mother and children.</p>

It cannot in our view now be said, in reliance upon that forensic decision, that the President should in some way have put into the balance against publication a view that his judgment, which is final in character, should be regarded as inadequate or its findings treated as unreliable.

He did not develop the submission with any force, and he was plainly right not to do so. It is hard to see what harm, given its very specific subjectmatter, the publication of the assurances and waivers judgment could do to the article 8 rights of the children. It is true that its backdrop is the perceived risk that they might be abducted, but that is equally apparent from the fact-finding judgment. The President held, at para. 85 of his judgment, that if the one was to be published there was no principled reason why the other should not be. That was in our view entirely correct. He went on to advance an additional reason supporting publication of the assurances and waivers judgment. Lord Pannick advanced some criticism of this, but since the President's primary reason is sufficient we need not take up time in addressing the issue.</p>

For example, it is said that the Judge under-estimated the force of the likely media storm following publication of the judgments, that he made an unrealistic estimate of the ability of such publication to vindicate the mother, and that he failed to take account of what was said to be the shift in the position of the Guardian. As to the first two points, we have held that the President's conclusions were entirely open to him on the basis of the evidence which it was his role to evaluate; as regards the third, we have accepted Ms Fottrell's explanation that there was no inconsistency in the Guardian's position at different stages, and the President of course expressly referred to his initial caution.</p>

The mother points in particular to the President's finding at para. 74 of the publication judgment, which we have cited above, that widespread media publicity with the aim of presenting the facts as found by a judge in a court of law was "a necessary step in order to meet the private and family life needs of the mother and the children"; and to the President's conclusion at para. 80 that he regarded "the case in favour of publication as being strong to the extent of being overwhelming", precisely because publication was in the interests of the children as well as in the public interest. We reject as not arguable Lord Pannick's suggestion that the President might have reached a different conclusion if he had applied the paramountcy test.</p>

But our decision is reinforced by other considerations.We are bound to say that it is our strong provisional view that the argument which the father wishes to advance is ill-founded. But if it is indeed arguable that the question whether a judgment in proceedings involving children can be published is "a question with respect to the upbringing of a child" within the meaning of section 1 (1) of the Children Act 1989, and thus to be governed by the paramountcy principle, that is indeed an issue of great importance. Quite apart from anything else, the practice of the Family Court embodied in the <span style="font-style:italic">Practice Guidance: Transparency in the Family Courts: Publication of Judgments</span> issued by Sir James Munby P on 16 January 2014 would require significant reconsideration. It is all the more important that this Court should consider the question, if at all, with the benefit of a reasoned judgment at first instance, and with the benefit of full argument and in a case where it will or at least may determine the outcome. Lord Pannick was right to say that the media did not claim to be prejudiced by the father's very belated <span style="font-style:italic">volte-face</span>, and we did hear some helpful submissions from Mr Caldecott; nevertheless, there was not the opportunity for the full examination of the authorities that the issue would merit.</p>

Secondly, we do not accept his argument that this is a "pure point of law" which can be raised for the first time on appeal without causing any prejudice to the mother or the children. It was not suggested that (if we rejected the pleaded grounds of appeal, as we have) we could decide ourselves that, treating the welfare of the children as the paramount consideration, the judgments must not be published. That issue would have to be remitted to the President and argued before him. This would involve further delay.</p>

Lord Pannick, in oral argument, said that it was "not an easy test to apply", though those aspects of the case were plainly not the father's main concerns. He did not identify any specific matters, mentioned in court but not in the President's judgments, which gave cause for concern, but the possibility was at least canvassed that the legitimate interests of the press would be sufficiently respected by allowing the publication of the judgments and that the publication of anything that was said during the hearings was unnecessary.</p>

It is therefore inevitable that there has to be some definition of the dividing line between what can and cannot be reported. We do not know whether there was any dispute at the time of the original formulation of paragraph 8 (b) of the President's order. But it was not the subject of an appeal by any of the other parties, and in particular not by the Guardian, who might have been expected to object if he believed that there was a risk that the restrictions were too loosely expressed. We are not persuaded that they are. The phrase "directly related to" the two judgments clearly means that publication, for example, of things said at the hearings relating to other aspects of the welfare of the children remains prohibited – for example, about their experiences, their health and education, or their views about publication, or the history of contact between them and their father. We will hear submissions about the precise form of any order relating to the hearing before us and also about the extent of any necessary redactions in the published form of this judgment.</p>
