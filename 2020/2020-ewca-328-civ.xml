Under the CIS, a “net paid” subcontractor has tax deducted at source by the employer who holds it on account of the subcontractor's tax liability.  Subcontractors are not subject to such deductions if they are "gross paid", in other words, registered as such with HMRC under the CIS.  But a contractor seeking gross paid status must satisfy various turnover and tax compliance tests, meaning in general, small sole traders, including labour-only subcontractors, tend to be net paid.  Until 2015 Hudson was not registered for gross payments, had not registered with the Board and had never been asked by the Board to register.  Hudson had never been assessed to levy until this time. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Hudson No.1 was a judicial review challenge by Hudson to the lawfulness of the 2015 Order.  Kerr J accepted in broad terms that the 2015 Order was enacted to simplify levy collection while raising adequate funds to train the workforce and secure an adequate supply of skilled labour.  He held that while Hudson did not retain the services of or employ a constant pool of construction industry labour, it benefitted nonetheless from a stable, well-trained workforce, without which it could not trade as effectively as it does.  At [111] Kerr J held the new method of levy calculation did not lead to double taxation in the strict sense, in that no one person was liable to pay levy twice in respect of the same subject matter.  Whilst there may be an element of double or multiple recovery in that levy payments may have to be made in a significant number of cases by more than one person in respect of the same subject matter, this was not unlawful. </p>

First, the Employment Tribunal concluded that what an employer does is to be determined by what its employees do.  Secondly, since employees are defined by the 1982 Act to include selfemployed contractors as well as directly employed employees, the question whether Hudson is an employer in the construction industry falls to be determined not just by reference to what its directly employed staff do, but also by reference to what the many thousands of self-employed operatives do.  As the self-employed operatives are “in the construction industry”, so too, the Employment Tribunal found, Hudson is also in the construction industry. </p>

There are more ways of being in the construction industry than wielding a pickaxe or donning a high visibility jacket or by directing or supervising or controlling those engaged in the physical side of the industry.  The employment contract is between Hudson and the operative.  It is Hudson who pays the operative (having received cleared funds from the client).  At a most basic level, Hudson's profits are derived from the construction industry.  Mr Maugham reminds me of Kerr J's observation that Hudson provided “<span style="font-style:italic">services to employers in the construction</span>” industry (at [2]).  I however do not have a difficulty with Hudson providing both a service to the construction industry and also being in the construction industry: the concepts are not mutually exclusive.  Further, the construction is consistent with the purpose of the Board and the purpose of the levy which is for the better provision of training of persons for employment in the relevant industry as a whole, not just those who are directly employed, but everyone who is engaged in the construction industry and, as Kerr J identified, Hudson benefits from the existence of a large pool of </p>

The Tribunal reasoned, “<span style="font-style:italic">If the employer is</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">an employer in the industry, because he does what his employees do, and they are all cleaners, and he has only one establishment, he has a cleaning establishment from which his employees work</span>”. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The Tribunal held that this provision (article 5(4)) is only concerned with who in the levy period is to pay levy assessed on activity in the corresponding base period in circumstances where construction activity during the base period may have been intermittent and there may also have been changes of management or ownership in the period between the end of a base period and the start of the levy period or indeed during the levy period.  The Tribunal held that if Hudson was an employer in the industry and construction activities were carried out from its only establishment during a necessary period of the relevant base period, article 5(4) would only be relevant if there was a change of ownership or responsibility in respect of its establishment after the end of the base period, or after the start of the levy period.  Since neither circumstance applied, article 5(4) was not relevant in this case.  Accordingly, the Employment Tribunal concluded that Hudson’s head office in Bridlington was a construction establishment wholly or mainly in the construction industry and that construction activities took place <span style="font-style:italic">from</span> the head office in the relevant period. </p>

I have no difficulty in concluding that for the purposes of the 2015 Order, there is a sufficient connection between Hudson's head office and the statutory employees and their activities.  The relevant facts are those which were available to the Tribunal.  First, the contract is between Hudson and the employee.  The fact that the contract is signed at the client's offices is irrelevant; the client is acting as Hudson's agent.  The operative is informed in clear terms that there is no contractual relationship between the client and him and that his contract is with Hudson.  The operative is told that Hudson steps into the shoes of the client.  Hudson knows the name of the operative and his trade and the client company, site address and client representative.  The operative is paid by Hudson from the Bridlington head office, subject to Hudson deducting the appropriate tax figure.  Hudson's operations are conducted from its head office; if status issues arise (in respect of which Hudson is liable) those issues will be handled from the Bridlington head office.  These connecting elements are sufficient to meet the test.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">As set out above, the power to impose levy is provided by s.11(2) of the 1982 Act which determines that levy is to be imposed on “employers in the industry, except in so far as they are exempted from it”.  Consistently with that, article 3 of the 2015 Order, the critical levy imposing provision, imposes levy liability on “employers in the construction industry”.  Liability is not imposed on establishments, which are not the key concept or means by which the policy objective of this legislation is achieved as Mr Maugham QC submitted. Nor is the concept of employer subordinate to the concept of an establishment. I am in no doubt that the governing concept is the concept of an “employer in the industry” on whom liability is imposed. Just as employers are the target of liability to levy (see s. 11(2) of the 1982 Act and article 3 of the 2015 Order), employers may be exempted from such liability, and if so, exemption certificates are given to the employer (albeit in respect of one or more of its establishments) where the Board is satisfied that the employer has made its own training arrangements (ss.13 and 14 of the 1982 Act). Liability to levy does not depend on having a construction establishment, although the actual assessment of the amount of any liability depends on whether or not and if so how many relevant establishments an employer has. </p>

The “industry” is separately defined by s.1(2) of the 1982 Act simply because the 1982 Act applies across a range of industries and potential levying boards.  The specific industry definition is set out separately in secondary legislation.  There is no warrant in the legislation for separating the two concepts, or ignoring the concept of employer when considering whether the levy target is “in the construction industry”.   </p>

That is unsurprising in context.  The levy funds the training of “employees” as defined and it is rational for levy to be imposed on those who benefit from a trained workforce of employees (as extensively defined), namely employers of those employees. </p>

As a matter of commercial reality and fact, Hudson performs office based activities only (payroll and the like), in the course of its business of supplying operatives. The mere fact that the operatives perform construction industry activities does not mean their activities are Hudson’s activities simply by virtue of the extended definition of employee. What is important is to consider how Hudson defines its activities and what Hudson itself does. Critically in his submission, Hudson does not itself carry out any of the “principal activities” listed in sub-paragraphs (a)-(g) of Schedule 1 of the Scope Order (and therefore cannot be brought into scope by reference to the related activities at sub-paragraphs (h)-(i)).  Rather, he submits that Hudson’s business is essentially that of (or comparable to) a payroll agency.  The focus must be on what Hudson contracts to do and the type of risk it takes because that reflects the economic and commercial reality.  Here, he submits Hudson neither delivers, nor does it enter into contracts to deliver, construction industry outputs.  It takes no construction risks. Its activities are solely “related activities”.  As a result, he submits Hudson is not in the construction industry. </p>

At one point during the course of argument, Mr Maugham came close to accepting that concepts of risk and output could be restated so that his suggested test is whether the levy target has contracted to perform construction industry activities, but in my judgement, the key concept on the plain language of the 1982 Act and 2015 Order is whether the employer is performing relevant activities. </p>

No such words are present. This is unsurprising given that the whole purpose of the legislation is to fund the training of <span style="font-style:italic">all</span> workers in the industry; training is not confined to direct employees only (see for example, s.5(1)(c) and (e) of the 1982 Act); and it is funded by reference to both categories of worker (direct employees and self-employed contractors – see article 7(2) definitions A and B of the 2015 Order). Moreover, as Mr Grodzinski QC submits, where the 1982 Act permits distinctions to be drawn between different classes of persons by way of consideration of levy, specific provision is made. For example, s.11(1) of the 1982 Act allows an industrial training board to submit levy proposals for the raising and collection of a levy to the Secretary of State, from time to time, and s.12 makes supplementary provision including at s. 12(2), that levy proposals may make different provision in relation to different classes or descriptions of employer. This represents a potential departure from the general approach otherwise adopted and could allow for a focus on the nature or activities of the employer as distinct from its employees. But there is no provision for treating different classes of employee differently.  </p>

It follows that Hudson performs these activities by or through its operatives and there is no compelling basis for excluding the activities performed by the majority of Hudson’s 20,000 self-employed operatives who are, it is common ground, engaged wholly or mainly in construction industry activities. </p>

On Mr Maugham’s argument, these companies or businesses would not be in scope because all they do is supply labour (as Mr Maugham himself appeared to accept at one point during his submissions, albeit he sought to retreat from that position subsequently).   </p>

Given the wide definition of employee and employment, labour only subcontractors are plainly “employers in the construction industry” performing construction activities by or through their labourers or labour force.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">As a matter of statutory construction, the concept of a construction establishment is relevant to the assessment mechanism for levy but not to the imposition of liability. For liability purposes, the governing concept in the 1982 Act is an “employer in the industry” on whom liability to levy is imposed both by the 1982 Act and by article 3 of the 2015 Order, where liability depends on the person in question being “an employer in the construction industry” (see article 3(2)). The levy provision in article 3(2) is unqualified by reference to the existence or otherwise of a construction establishment and is framed in mandatory terms.  All persons who are “employers in the construction industry” are by virtue of that status, at risk of an assessment.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">However, the risk is mitigated when it comes to the Board making an assessment of levy to be paid. By article 5(1) and (2) of the 2015 Order, levy can only be assessed in respect of any particular establishment of an employer that is a “construction establishment” by virtue of it being “engaged wholly or mainly in the construction industry”. In other words, where there is an employer in the construction industry with one or more potential construction establishments but none is “engaged wholly or mainly” in the construction industry, there can be no assessment to levy. Likewise, article 5(3)(a) provides for circumstances where even if the establishment is engaged wholly or mainly in the construction industry (by virtue of the construction industry activities of those employed at or from the establishment), it cannot be assessed to levy as a construction establishment unless it is so engaged for at least 27 weeks falling within the relevant base period. It is to my mind clear from the terms of article 5 that the purpose of assessing levy by reference to a construction establishment of an employer in the construction industry, is to ensure that such an employer with a mixed and/or varying workforce in which construction industry employees are either a minority of the workforce or their activities comprise both construction industry and non-construction industry activities and/or change over time, is not assessed to levy. This is for sound reasons in an industry involving a wide range of construction activities, from short and simple jobs to large scale projects; and workers with different skills or trades, who may work on a variety of jobs at different premises or establishments and/or for a variety of employers during any given levy period. </p>

I do not accept Mr Maugham’s argument that the concept of being employed <span style="font-style:italic">from</span> is limited to a situation where, for example construction industry tools and/or equipment are kept at a base (or yard) and workers go from the base or yard to a construction site. That too may be a paradigm example. However, it is not difficult to imagine many different kinds of self-employed, agency and labour-only workers in the construction industry, who may never go to a yard or base of any kind, but instead, go straight from home to the particular site at which they are then working.  (The cleaning agency analogy adopted by the Tribunal is an example in a different industry; there are many others). It seems to me that in that situation, if an operative is employed (in the extended sense used in the 1982 Act) by a </p>

That the company does not control, supervise or organise the worker’s work from the head office (or at all) is irrelevant in the context of employment in this extended sense.

Significantly, the contract made between Hudson and the operative (and indeed Hudson and the client) makes clear that Hudson steps into the shoes of the client and contracts with the operative on the terms negotiated between the operative and the client. The operative expressly agrees that he or she has no contract of any type whatsoever with the client. In these circumstances the fact that the contract is signed at the client’s offices is nothing to the point – the client is merely acting as Hudson’s agent – and the contract is returned to Hudson’s head office since Hudson is the contracting counterparty. Further, Hudson knows (from the completed contract) the name of the operative, his trade and the client company, representative and address of the site where the contract is completed. Hudson is responsible for deducting tax and national insurance contributions and paying each operative from the Bridlington head office. If and to the extent that any status issue arises, it is dealt with from the head office by Hudson. </p>

Article 5(4) focuses on the construction establishment: as shown by its clear words, “owns or … has responsibility for a construction establishment” and “persons employed at or from that establishment”. It deems each establishment to be the levy responsibility of a single employer (who on the first day of the relevant period owns or is responsible for the construction establishment in question) during the levy period. That is not the same as saying that each employee must have or must be the responsibility of a single employer during the levy period as Mr Maugham submits. As Mr Grodzinski submits, such an interpretation is at odds with the clear wording of article 5(4) and would be highly impractical in an industry with a high self-employment rate and a wide range of construction activities, in which people work on numerous jobs for a variety of employers during any given levy period.   </p>
