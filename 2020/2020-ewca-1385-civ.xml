The respondent ordered the deportation of the appellant following his convictions for offences resulting in a total sentence of 18 months.   KB appealed to the First-tier Tribunal (“FTT”), where the FTT Judge reached a decision that the effect of KB’s deportation on four of his children would be unduly harsh, and quashed the deportation order.  The Upper Tribunal (“UT”) held that the FTT Judge had made an error of law and overturned her decision.   In a remade decision, another UT Judge reached a contrary conclusion to that of the FTT Judge and upheld the deportation order.   KB appeals with leave against the UT error of law decision.  Permission to appeal was refused in relation to the remade decision. </p>

They were all born and brought up in the United Kingdom and have British citizenship.  There are two boys, now aged 15 and 14, and two girls, now aged 8 and 6.  At the time of the FTT decision they were aged 12, 11, 5 and 3.  KB does not reside with the mother, but it is not in dispute that he has a genuine and subsisting relationship with all the children and plays a significant role in their day-to-day life.  He also has a child by another woman with whom he has no subsisting relationship, and who is irrelevant to this appeal.   </p>

Deportation of foreign criminals is in the public interest, but that interest must be balanced against the rights of children, amongst others, under article 8 of ECHR.

	    <p style="margin-left:1.18in;margin-right:0.13in;text-indent:0.00in">“19. I start with two preliminary observations about the nature of, and approach to, an appeal to the UT. First, the right of appeal to the UT is "on any point of law arising from a decision made by the [FTT] other than an excluded decision": Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 ("the 2007 Act"), section 11(1) and (2) . If the UT finds an error of law, the UT may set aside the decision of the FTT and remake the decision: section 12(1) and (2) of the 2007 Act. If there is no error of law in the FTT's decision, the decision will stand. Secondly, although "error of law" is widely defined, it is not the case that the UT is entitled to remake the decision of the FTT simply because it does not agree with it, or because it thinks it can produce a better one. Thus, the reasons given for considering there to be an error of law really matter. Baroness Hale put it in this way in <span style="font-style:italic">AH (Sudan) v Secretary of State for the Home Department</span> at [30]:  </p>

However what was required to justify setting aside an FTT decision was a <span style="font-style:italic">material</span> error of law.  This error was not material because it was adverse to KB.   Having concluded that the effect on the children was unduly harsh despite the factors going the other way in the form of KB’s criminality and the public interest in deportation, the FTT Judge would have been bound to have found that the effect was unduly harsh ignoring those countervailing considerations, as required by <span style="font-style:italic">KO (Nigeria).</span>  Mr Malik on behalf of the Respondent accepted this analysis and accepted that the Error of Law decision could not be upheld on this basis. </p>

That formulation presupposed that the evidence was arguably sufficient.   The UT must decide whether there is in fact an error of law before interfering, not whether there is an arguable error of law.  In order to demonstrate an error of law by reference to evidential insufficiency it was necessary to show that the evidence was incapable of supporting a finding of undue harshness if the correct test were applied.  As to that, she drew attention to the detailed findings made in the FTT decision relating to the role of KB in the children’s lives and the effect which his deportation would have on them, which demonstrated the significant educational, psychological </p>

Mr Malik accepted that merely arguable insufficiency of evidence was not enough to establish an error of law and the third basis of the Error of Law decision could not be defended.   Moreover he went on to accept that this was one of those cases in which applying the correct test might lead different FTT judges to different outcomes; the FTT Judge in this case was not bound to have come to the conclusion that the effect of separation on the children was unduly harsh if she applied the correct test; but conversely she would have been entitled to reach that conclusion.  In my view this concession was rightly made, and obviates the need to set out in any detail the factual findings made by the FTT Judge which support it.  The realism of this concession is pointed up by the UT Judge in the Remade decision, going the other way from the FTT decision, stating that the case involved a very difficult determination. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.13in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly, there are several indications that the FTT Judge was well aware that it was an elevated test and that mere undesirability was insufficient.  The Judge said at paragraph 62: “I keep in mind what the Court of Appeal said in <span style="font-style:italic">EJA v SSHD </span>[2017] EWCA Civ 10, namely that there must be relatively few cases in which there is a meaningful relationship between a parent and children where deportation of the parent, with consequential physical separation, will not have an adverse impact on the children.  Whilst the interests of the children are of primary consideration, they can be outweighed by the public interest considerations….”  Although <span style="font-style:italic">EJA</span> was not a case concerned with Article 117C(5) of the 2002 Act, this passage is a recognition that the public interest in deportation imposes an elevated standard of adverse impact, and chimes with what Underhill LJ said at para 51 of <span style="font-style:italic">HA (Iraq)</span>: the underlying question for tribunals is whether the harshness which the deportation will cause for the partner or the child is of a significantly elevated degree to outweigh that public interest.  Further, the passages from <span style="font-style:italic">KO (Nigeria)</span> which stress that more is required than mere undesirability, difficulty, inconvenience or discomfort were not new; they come in paragraph 27, approving that aspect of the Upper Tribunal’s decision in <span style="font-style:italic">MK (Sierra Leone) v Secretary of State for the Home Department</span> [2015] INLR 563 para 46.  That was the prevailing authority as to the unduly harsh test at the time of the FTT Judge’s decision in this case, and one which will have been familiar to FTT tribunals and which they can be assumed to have been applying.   As this Court observed in <span style="font-style:italic">AA (Nigeria)</span> at paragraph 9,  judges who are experienced in these specialised courts can be assumed by any appellate court or tribunal to be well familiar with the principles, and to be applying them, without the need for extensive citation unless it is clear from what they say that they have not done so.  Indeed the passage in <span style="font-style:italic">MK (Sierra Leone)</span> subsequently approved by Lord Carnwath JSC in <span style="font-style:italic">KO  (Nigeria)</span> was adopted and applied by the Upper Tribunal in <span style="font-style:italic">MAB (USA) v Secretary of State for the Home Department</span> (2015) UKUT 435 (IAC) which was in turn cited in <span style="font-style:italic">MM (Uganda)</span> to which the FTT Judge referred.  Moreover there is some force in Ms Naik’s submission that the fact that she held that the unduly harsh test was fulfilled <span style="font-style:italic">despite</span> the countervailing public interest considerations of KB’s criminality demonstrates that she was applying a test which was elevated above that which she would have applied if she had (correctly) ignored the criminality.  </p>

They must be read as a whole and taken cumulatively.  If addressed compendiously they are capable of meeting the correct elevated test, it is difficult to see how any of them taken individually can properly support an argument, advanced by way of inference, that a test involving too low a threshold was being applied. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.13in;text-indent:0.5in">The section headed “consideration and reasons” commences at paragraph 35.  It addresses first whether there was a genuine and subsisting relationship between KB and the mother of their four children.  The FTT Judge held not.  From paragraph 45 she considered the position of the children.  She addressed what Underhill LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">HA (Iraq)</span> called the “go scenario”, and concluded that it would be unduly harsh for the children to go with their father to Jamaica.  There is no challenge to that conclusion.  She therefore concluded at paragraph 47 that the crux of the appeal was whether it would be unduly harsh for the children to remain in the UK without KB pursuant to paragraph 399(a) of the Immigration Rules (which reflects s. 117C(5) of the 2002 Act).  Having referred to <span style="font-style:italic">MM (Uganda)</span> and the need to take into account the best interests of the children, she recited the evidence relevant to that question, making findings in relation to it, and concluded at paragraph 69 that looking at the whole of the evidence it would be unduly harsh for the children to have to remain without him.  Within that section she addresses KB’s criminality, observing that the facts of KB’s offence made it a serious one, noting that he had pleaded guilty, and noting that he had shown remorse and that he was assessed as being at low risk of reoffending and had completed courses in prison, but that he had committed a further offence of possession of cannabis after release.  After the conclusion in paragraph 69 that on the whole of the evidence the effect of separation on the children would be unduly harsh, she referred at paragraph 70 to the fact that he regretted his actions and was determined to be a good role model for his children.  She said she took into account his efforts to start a business running a Caribbean restaurant, which had suffered a setback when the restaurant was destroyed by an explosion, but he hoped to start another one.  At paragraph 71 she repeated that applying the approach in <span style="font-style:italic">MM (Uganda)</span> the deportation would have an unduly harsh effect on the children and that the requirements of para 399 of the Immigration Rules were met.  There then followed a section from paragraph 72 to the end, referring first to <span style="font-style:italic">Hesham Ali v Secretary of State for the Home Department</span> [2016] 1 WLR 4799 and then carrying out a freestanding article 8 proportionality balancing exercise, which concluded that the public interest in deportation was outweighed by the interests of the children. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.13in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Malik’s first criticism of an irrelevant factor taken into account relied on what was said at paragraph 57, in which the FTT Judge referred to the fact that KB was supporting the mother of the children in caring for the latter’s 58 year old mother, the children’s maternal grandmother.   The Judge had earlier explained that the mother was the sole carer for the grandmother and that KB helped by living with the grandmother at her home, and looking after her whilst he was  living there.   Mr Malik criticised the Judge’s reference to KB supporting the children’s mother, submitting that a loss of that benefit to her as a result of deportation was not a loss of benefit to </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.13in;text-indent:0.00in">the children which could be relevant to an assessment of undue harshness for them.  However, as the Judge explained in an earlier paragraph, the absence of KB would have an adverse effect on the welfare of the children, because it would require the mother, who had no siblings available to help, to spend more time caring for the grandmother and so less time with the children.  The Judge found in terms that the need for her to become more involved in the grandmother’s care would “in turn …  impact on her ability to manage the family routine” (para 53).  This was treated as an exacerbating factor in respect of the finding expressed earlier in the very same paragraph that the mother would struggle in the absence of KB to give each child the individual attention they needed; and was followed in the next paragraph by acceptance of the evidence from the independent social worker that the children would suffer significant trauma if KB were deported.  The loss of KB’s support for the mother in caring for the grandmother was therefore a relevant consideration because it would have a knock on effect on the welfare of the children. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.13in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly, Mr Malik criticised various references to the fact that KB pleaded guilty, to his remorse and to his rehabilitation.  He submitted that although rehabilitation and the seriousness of offending might be relevant to an inquiry as to whether there were very compelling circumstances which engaged s. 117C(6) of the 2002 Act, they could not be relevant to the s. 117C(5) inquiry into undue harshness which focused solely on the effect of separation from the children.

That is an exercise, as Mr Malik conceded, which was adverse to KB and so not material to whether the decision was erroneous: the Judge would have reached the same conclusion had she not taken them into account.  In other words, they were not being taken into account as supporting the finding of undue hardship, but rather as factors counting against undue hardship in the erroneous balancing exercise.  As such they cannot comprise a material error of law, in the same way as Mr Malik concedes that adopting the <span style="font-style:italic">MM (Uganda)</span> approach was not a material error of law.  </p>

This criticism is well founded, but it provides no basis for interfering with the FTT decision.  It comes in a section after she had reached her conclusions on the application of the unduly harsh test and cannot affect their validity.  Had she found that s. 117C(5) was not fulfilled and the effect of deportation on the children would not be unduly harsh, she would have been bound to consider whether nevertheless there were very compelling circumstances fulfilling s. 117C(6); and to have done so within the statutory framework.  Had she decided the case on the basis that the effect on the children would not be unduly harsh, Mr Malik’s criticism would be relevant.  As it is, however, the point is addressed to a passage in the decision which has no bearing on whether s.117C(5) is fulfilled. </p>
