	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The proceedings concern RS, a man in middle age.  On 6 November 2020 he very sadly suffered a heart attack at his West Country home, where he lived with his wife and three children.  His brain was deprived of oxygen for at least 45 minutes.  Since then he has been in a coma in hospital.  On 25 November, the NHS Trust began proceedings.  On 15 December, Cohen J determined that it is in RS’s best interests not to receive life-sustaining treatment, including artificial ventilation, nutrition and fluids.  The result is that RS will die within a few weeks while receiving palliative care to relieve any suffering.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The catastrophe that has befallen RS has been compounded by disagreement among members of his family as to his best interests.  The disagreement reflects what the Judge described as a deep family rift extending back for a number of years.  The family, which originates from abroad, shares a strong Catholic faith.  RS’s mother and one sister remain in the country of origin, and another sister and her daughter live in the UK.  RS married 17 years ago, his wife being a divorcee.  He came to live in the UK some years ago and his wife and children followed.  Since his marriage, he had much less contact with his family overseas and he became estranged from his family in England, with whom he had had no contact for eight years or more. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The Judge’s decision was supported by RS’s wife and children, by his treating doctors and by the Official Solicitor, who has acted as litigation friend and commissioned independent medical advice.  It was opposed by RS’s niece Z, speaking on behalf of herself and other family members, including his mother and two sisters.  Z now seeks permission to appeal.  She is represented today by Mr David Lock QC and Mr Bruno Quintavalle; the NHS Trust by Mr Vikram Sachdeva QC; and the Official Solicitor by Mr Andrew Hockton.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The Trust’s application came before Cohen J at a remote hearing on 9 and 11 December, when Z was represented by Ms Bridget Dolan QC.  The Judge heard oral evidence from the Official Solicitor’s expert Dr Dominic Bell (a consultant in intensive care and anaesthesia) and from the treating doctors, Dr W (clinical director, intensive care) and Dr A (consultant neurologist).  Their opinions were concordant and undisputed.  Enough is already known about RS’s medical status to allow for a robust but bleak prognosis.  He is in a coma.  He may be progressing to a vegetative state.  The most optimistic onward prediction is that he may progress to the lower end of a minimally conscious state, with a small (10-20%) chance of being able to acknowledge in the most rudimentary way the presence of another human being.  With continued ventilation and ANH his life may continue for five years or longer.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The Judge identified the focus of the hearing as being on whether RS had expressed any views which would help to inform the court  as to how he would wish to be treated in his current situation, it being agreed that he had never said anything about the exact circumstances that have arisen.  The evidence of family members centred on relevant things that he had said in the past and on his religious faith, his adherence to the tenets of the Catholic religion, and their application in these circumstances.   </p>

In her oral evidence she said that he had said that he never wanted to be a burden if he was seriously ill.  She also felt that he would not want his children to see him in his current condition but to remember him as an able-bodied person.  She recalled him saying that every life is precious and that you must hold onto life, and also that if anything happened to him, he would want all steps to be taken to save him but that if he was beyond saving he did not want to be kept alive.  She believed that he would not regard ceasing treatment as removing life.   </p>

He had been clear that they should be cared for and have a chance of life.  He had expressed his disagreement with a widely reported case in England where the decision was to terminate medical treatment for a very small child born with serious abnormalities.  He was religiously conservative, opposed to abortion, even for an unborn child likely to be medically compromised, and was opposed to euthanasia.  It was painful to him that he and his wife were unable to obtain an annulment of her previous marriage and thus marry in Church and that thereafter he was unable to take Holy Communion.  He would not want his life terminated if it could be sustained.  The preservation of life would outweigh all other factors in his thinking.    </p>

He directed himself as to the law, referring in particular to Sections 1 and 4 of the Mental Capacity Act 2005.  A decision made for a person who lacks capacity must be made in his best interests.  In identifying what those are, the decision-maker must consider all the relevant circumstances, including the person's individual perspective – his past and present wishes and feelings and the beliefs and values that would be likely to influence his decision if he had capacity.  The decision-maker must also take into account the views of anyone interested in the person’s welfare as to what would be in his best interests and, in particular about his individual perspective. </p>

The note of the hearing shows that after she had been asked about twenty questions by Mr Sachdeva and the Judge, her friend and informal interpreter (MP) indicated that she was becoming “really distressed”.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Lock now submits that the reception of the letter amounted to a serious procedural error and a breach of Art 6.  Counsel, he submits, had been placed in an impossible situation and it is unclear what reliance if any the Judge placed on the contents of the letter.  I disagree.  The fair conduct of these agonising hearings is highly casespecific.  The professional response of counsel at the time shows that this matter does not bear the significance that is now suggested.  Had it been appropriate for Ms Dolan to “push” she would no doubt have done so.  The Judge’s suggestion was a humane judicial response to a witness’s distress and the judgment is founded on evidence well-known to all and, as Mr Lock accepts, contains no hint that the decision was influenced in any way by the contents of the letter.  It would, I think, have been better if the Judge had made it clear that any further communication would probably need to be shown to all parties, and if he had afterwards expressly confirmed that he would place no weight upon any matter not disclosed.  However, the nature of the communication is clear enough from the exchanges recorded above – namely that RS had made choices in his personal life that were not in complete harmony with his religious obligations.  That much was clear from the known history and it cannot plausibly be said to have played any part in the decision in this case. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">My conclusion is that we have heard no arguable case that the Judge’s decision was wrong or unjust.  An appeal would have no prospect of success and I would therefore refuse this application for permission to appeal.  In doing so, I recognise that all members of RS’s family have put forward their honest beliefs about what he would have wanted but it is not in my view surprising that the Judge should have placed particular weight on the understanding of those who have for many years been closest to him.  It is to be hoped that at this very difficult time for all the family, disagreement can now be put aside out of respect for this much-loved man.    </p>
