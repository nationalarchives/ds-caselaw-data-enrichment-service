Specifically, the requirements for settlement of Turkish businesspeople were those set out in the Statement of Immigration Rules for Control after Entry dated 23 October 1972 (HC510), paragraph 28 of which, so far as material, provided: "A person who is admitted in the first instance and who has remained here for 4 years in approved employment or as a businessman or a self-employed person or a person of independent means, may have the time limit on his stay removed unless there are grounds for maintaining it".

On page 2 of 117 it stated "Turkish nationals who have completed at least four years lawfully in the UK as a businessperson are entitled to apply for indefinite leave to remain to settle in the UK." On page 3 of 117 next to the question “How long is leave to remain normally granted for?”, the statement was made "applicants may be granted indefinite leave to remain on completion of 4 years in the category …". Next to the question "Are dependants allowed?" the answer was "Yes …". At the bottom of the page going onto page 4 of 117 the question was "Does this category lead to settlement (indefinite leave to remain)" and the answer given was "yes". On page 6 of 117 it was stated "Turkish nationals intending to come to the UK to establish in business generally have the right to have their application considered against the businessperson requirements in force in 1973. This date reflects when the UK became a signatory of the agreement with Turkey. Since then, Turkish ECAA applications have to be assessed against the Immigration Rules in force at that date. This `standstill clause' means applications for entry in this category are judged against HC509, while applications for leave to remain are decided by HC510 …".  </p>

Page 60 of 117 set out how paragraph 28 of the 1972 Control after Entry Rules was to be applied. Page 63 of 117 set out how to consider applications from dependant family members. There was an explanation of the background to the Ankara Agreement on page 114 of 117. Having rehearsed the background and the terms of the standstill clause it was stated "in respect of Turkish nationals seeking to enter or reside in the UK to establish themselves in business or provide a service, the UK must apply the domestic business provisions as they were within the Immigration Rules in force in 1973. These are HC509 (on entry rules) and HC510 (after entry rules). The Immigration Rules as they were in 1973 are far less stringent than the corresponding requirements in the current rules and must be applied in the context of the objectives of the ECAA".” </p>

However, that understanding was demonstrated to be incorrect by two cases decided in 2017.

All that is necessary is residence of a character which subsists so long as the freedom of establishment is exercised, and is sufficient to allow the pursuit of that economic goal.” </p>

However, following the decisions in <span style="font-style:italic">BA (Turkey) </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">Aydogdu</span>, the respondent paused the processing of ECAA applications for ILR between March and July 2017 before resuming the processing and grant of such applications under the terms of the 1973 Rules and the 2015 Guidance.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">On 16 March 2018, the respondent changed the policy. As appears from the Guidance issued on that day, anyone who had applied on or before 15 March 2018 who was eligible for ILR was dealt with under the old policy, whereas after that date, anyone applying for ILR would be granted 3 years leave to remain. Although that was renewable, in the sense that, at the end of the 3 year period, a further 3 years leave to remain would have been granted, at that stage at least, ILR was not granted. </p>

Their effect was: (i) 5 years residence rather than 4 was required before an application for ILR could be made; (ii) an applicant for ILR had to demonstrate sufficient knowledge of the English language and of life in the UK and (iii) the waiver of fees on an application for ILR by a Turkish businessperson was removed, so that a fee of £2,389 per applicant was payable. Revised Guidance was published on 6 July 2018 which set out the new policy.  </p>

This is so even when the policy speaks to the future, for example by setting out a route by which a particular status may be acquired.

Unlike the statement made in the Guidance in the <span style="font-style:italic">HSMP Forum</span> cases, no promise or representation was being made as to the future and, specifically, no promise was being made that, if the policy did change, those already in the scheme would continue to be treated under the 1973 Rules. In my judgment, that is the critical difference between the present case and the <span style="font-style:italic">HSMP Forum</span> cases. Nor do I consider that there is anything in the point that the application of the 1973 Immigration Rules under the scheme had remained unchanged for 45 years. As Sir James Eadie QC submitted, the fact that the Immigration Rule in question has been in force for a very long time does not change its fundamental nature or mean that, unlike any other Immigration Rule, it may not change if the government policy changes. </p>

She noted that at [69] he had identified factors bearing on the issue of proportionality as including whether there was an unambiguous promise, whether there was detrimental reliance and whether the promise had been made to an individual or specific group.

The changes were limited: another year’s residence to qualify for settlement and the introduction of an English language test and a fee requirement which were standardised requirements under the points-based system. There was a concern that Turkish businesspeople should not be treated more favourably than other migrants and, as Sir James Eadie QC put it, lurking in the shadows was an issue about discrimination. </p>

It was not accepted that the changes caused any significant hardship or irredeemable prejudice. It was not unfair that the new policy also applied to those who were already within the scheme as how to align Turkish businesspeople with other migrants was a policy judgment for the respondent. This was a macro-political policy judgment: the 6,000 people said to have been affected was a significant number of people.  </p>

As I see it however, the problem with his analysis is how he then dealt with the issue of proportionality. I agree with Ms Ford QC that, at [49] of his judgment, the judge has only addressed whether the respondent had shown good reasons for the change of policy so far as the future is concerned. In relation to those who were already in the scheme, the judge has not considered at all whether there was any necessity for an immediate change of policy which affected them adversely, as opposed to a change for the future which affected only those yet to enter the scheme.

Nothing in the evidence put forward by the respondent suggests that, in either March or July 2018, it was necessary to make a change of policy which also affected those already in the scheme, nor has the respondent put forward any evidence suggesting that transitional provisions protecting those already in the scheme would have been impractical.  </p>
