This is a domestic provision which does not owe its origin to EU law. The purpose underlying the enactment of section 41 was to encourage public authorities to “outsource” the provision of services. When they perform services in-house, using their own employees, they incur no VAT.

As I understood it, it was common ground that (a) where the Trust leases cars to outside organisations (such as local authorities) it is carrying on the business of doing so and both deducts the input tax attributable to its acquisition of cars so leased, and charges output tax to those organisations on the supply of those cars; and (b) the fact that it carries on that business is of no real consequence in relation to the issues that we have to decide. </p>

The key question, therefore, is whether the acquisition of the cars by the Trust for the purpose of leasing them to its own employees was for the purpose “of any business carried on” by the Trust, which is the phrase both in section 41 (3) and in COSD.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Mantle stressed the need to discern the limited purpose of the deeming provision (as Lord Briggs’ proposition (2) requires). That purpose, he said, was simply to prevent the charging of output tax on the provision or leasing of a car by an employer to an employee as part of a salary sacrifice scheme. In the alternative its purpose was to preclude the charging of output tax on the supply of the car by the employer; and the deduction of input tax on the antecedent supply of the car to the employer. The De-Supply Order could have provided that the provision of the car was not to count as an economic activity (or as part of a business) but it did not. The concept of a supply and the concept of economic activity, though related, were distinct concepts. Although the De-Supply Order only deemed the provision of the car by the employer to the employee as not being a supply, the consequence was that under section 26 of VATA the employer was not entitled to deduct input tax on the antecedent supply of the car to him, because it was not a supply with a sufficient link to the making of a taxable supply. Section 24 only permits the deduction of input tax on goods or services “used or to be used for the purpose of any business carried on or to be carried on by” the taxable person. Section 26 allows deduction of input tax in relation to taxable supplies made by a taxable person in the course of his business. The effect of the UT’s decision was that a car leased by the Trust to an employee enters final consumption without having borne any VAT. That is an unjust and anomalous result, which in accordance with Lord Briggs’ proposition (4) ought to be avoided. The language of the De-Supply Order is not so clear as to compel that result. Section 41 (3) was not designed to apply in such a situation.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in">I wish to make. First, the Value Added Tax (Input Tax) Order 1992 (referred to as the Blocking Order) which purports to exclude the right to deduct input tax on the antecedent supply in almost all cases would, on this analysis, have been largely redundant. Second, the Blocking Order expressly permits the deduction of 50 per cent of input tax where the antecedent supply to the employer consists of a lease. It is hard to see how that can be justified if there is no sufficient link between that supply and the subsequent provision of the car to an employee (which is deemed not to be a supply at all). Third, if the analysis is correct, it must be because the consequences of the deeming provision must be tracked though the general VAT regime. Fourth, if section 24 does not permit the deduction of input tax, it must be because the provision of the car by an employer to an employee does not count as carrying on a business (i.e. is not an economic activity). The upshot is, in my judgment, that this argument reinforces the Trust’s position, that the acquisition of a car in order to provide that car to an employee is not an acquisition for the purposes of a business; and hence qualifies for a refund of VAT. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In the present case, the language of the De-Supply Order uses an expression (“supply”) which has a well-recognised meaning in VAT law. The concept of making a supply for a consideration is an essential element of the carrying on of an economic activity. As Mr Scorey QC put it, by making the De-Supply Order in the form that it did, Parliament chose to effect the change at a structural level. It did so by recharacterising the activity that might otherwise have amounted to the carrying on of an economic activity. It is the inevitable consequence of the absence of supplies that there cannot be the carrying on of an economic activity. That is simply to apply Lord Briggs’ proposition (5).  I agree. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Nor do I accept that this interpretation produces unjust results. As Mr Scorey emphasised the facts of this case are highly unusual. The De-Supply Order applies to all employers whether or not they are taxable persons, and whether or not they make other taxable supplies. It applies in its terms only to the transaction between the employer and employee. It does not apply to the antecedent acquisition of the car by the employer.  In some cases, the Blocking Order will preclude (or limit) the deduction of input tax on that acquisition, but that Order does not apply to the Trust in so far as it is not a taxable person. The Trust carries out no relevant economic activity apart from the activities that are deemed not to be supplies. The purpose of section 41 (3) is to give public authorities a specific right to a refund of VAT where they are not charging output tax on supplies and not able to deduct input tax. The fact that in the case of the Trust a car enters final consumption without having borne VAT is simply a consequence of the deeming provision. </p>

It is clear from a later part of their decision, dealing with what the position would have been if the De-Supply Order had not applied, that the UT well understood the legal test for deciding whether or not a person carries on an economic activity. Indeed, it is common ground that the UT applied the right legal test. I do not consider that we should or could conclude that in paragraphs [34] and [38] they applied some different test. Accordingly, in my judgment the UT’s evaluation of the Trust’s overall activities was a question of fact to which they were entitled to come.  </p>

Why the De-Supply Order has not been revoked in the 10 years that have elapsed since that decision is unexplained.

He did at one stage argue that we should interpret the DeSupply Order so as to bring it into conformity, so far as possible, with EU law.
