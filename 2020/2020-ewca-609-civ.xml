The appeal raises the issue whether and in what circumstances a firm of solicitors can be restrained from acting for a defendant where, in earlier similar litigation, the same firm has acted for another defendant against the same claimant, in circumstances where that earlier litigation has been settled through a mediation and/or confidential settlement.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">At about the same time, Glencairn and Dartington agreed to conduct a mediation in an attempt to settle their differences. Position statements were exchanged a few days before the mediation. As is usual, they were stated to be confidential. The mediation took place on 11 December 2018 under a mediation agreement. Although Glencairn did not disclose the mediation agreement before the judge, the relevant provisions were disclosed by Glencairn to this Court following an Order by the Court at the appeal hearing. The body of the agreement was signed by Mr Partington of Virtuoso as solicitor for Dartington. There was then a separate declaration undertaking to keep information disclosed at the mediation confidential, which was signed by all those participating in the mediation, who were, so far as Virtuoso was concerned, Mr Partington, Mr Walawage and Mr Popa. It is to be noted that none of the solicitors at Virtuoso now acting for Final Touch was in attendance at the mediation or signed that declaration of confidentiality.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">The Dartington matter did not settle at the mediation but after further discussions, a settlement was reached. This was set out in a confidential Settlement Agreement annexed to a Tomlin Order dated 8 January 2019. Again, that was not disclosed before the judge, but following the Order of this Court referred to in the previous paragraph, Glencairn disclosed a redacted version to this Court. Clause 3 imposed a duty of confidentiality on the parties to the Settlement Agreement, who were Glencairn and Dartington, but not their solicitors.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">By the time of the mediation, Virtuoso had taken the view that it would not be appropriate for their Dartington team to be involved in the Final Touch litigation. An information barrier was set up on 11 December 2018, the day of the mediation. On 19 December 2018 Mr Partington of Virtuoso, who headed the Dartington team, sent an email to Stobbs, the solicitors acting for Glencairn, stating that he and his colleagues, Mr Walawage and Mr Popa, would not be acting for Final Touch and that a 'Chinese wall' had been implemented within Virtuoso. Since the mediation, the Final Touch Team has been led by the principal of Virtuoso, Ms Elizabeth Ward. She has been assisted by Ms Lauren Waterman then a paralegal, now a trainee solicitor. She was also assisted by a solicitor, Ms Jordan Davies, but she left the firm on 22 February 2019, being replaced by Ms Gemma Wilson. Ms Davies had previously assisted Mr Partington on the Dartington matter, but prior to the mediation, Mr Walawage took over from her.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">The evidence of Ms Ward before the judge, which he accepted, was that she and her team were based in the firm’s Leeds office. Mr Partington and Mr Walawage were based in the London office. The firm used an online case management system, without paper files. The encryption in place meant that only Mr Partington, Mr Walawage and Mr Popa had access to the Dartington files. She confirmed that she, Ms Waterman and Ms Wilson had no knowledge of the terms of the Dartington Settlement.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">On 13 or 14 February 2019, a telephone conversation took place between the parties’ respective US attorneys, the content of which was disputed. Glencairn’s attorney Mr Miller says in his witness statement that Final Touch’s attorney, Mr Shapiro, called him and said that he had become aware of details of the Dartington Settlement and in particular that, as part of the Settlement, Dartington had obtained payment from Glencairn for redesigning its glass. Mr Miller says that Mr Shapiro indicated that Final Touch might be prepared to settle on similar terms. Mr Shapiro denies this account, saying he told Mr Miller that he did not know the terms of the Settlement, but that there was speculation on the part of Final Touch as to the terms and, if the speculation was correct, a similar deal might be the basis for productive discussions. Mr Miller told him that Glencairn had no interest in such discussions. Neither attorney was called to give evidence and the judge quite rightly said in [88] of his judgment that he could not reach a conclusion about this conversation and whether any confidential information was passed by Mr Shapiro to Mr Miller but that if it was, it did not subsequently reach the solicitors in the Final Touch team at Virtuoso.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">On 14 February 2019 Mr Sleep of Stobbs sent a letter to Virtuoso stating that the Chinese wall at Virtuoso was inadequate and expressing doubt that any information barrier set up between the Dartington and Final Touch teams at Virtuoso could be effective. Mr Sleep was not aware at the time that letter was sent of the telephone conversation between Mr Miller and Mr Shapiro, whatever its content. In his letter, Mr Sleep requested that Virtuoso should cease to act for Final Touch. On 18 February 2019 Virtuoso declined to stand down. On 8 March 2019 Glencairn filed the application notice that is the subject of this appeal.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">As the judge noted in [12] of his judgment, Glencairn's concern was that Virtuoso became aware of information disclosed by Glencairn during the Dartington mediation and during discussions both leading up to it and afterwards. This included Glencairn's negotiating position and the terms on which Glencairn was prepared to settle. Glencairn contended that there is a risk that this information or some of it will become known to Final Touch via Virtuoso and that this will provide Final Touch with an advantage in these proceedings, particularly in any settlement negotiations that may take place. This essentially remained Glencairn’s concern before this Court as to the risk of information which is confidential to Glencairn becoming known to Final Touch. </p>

	      </a>(hereafter referred to as <span style="font-style:italic">Bolkiah</span>), the leading case on the potential for conflict of interest where professional advisers such as solicitors act for different parties. As he noted at [13], in that case KPMG had acted for the first party then ceased to act. They were then instructed by the second party in litigation against their former client, the first party. It was common ground that, although they had acted as litigation advisers and forensic accountants, their position was to be equated with that of solicitors. The central issue before the judge and, indeed before this Court, was whether the principles established in that case and, in particular, in the speech of Lord Millett, are applicable to a case such as the present where the solicitors never acted for the first party, here Glencairn, but acted for a second party in litigation against Glencairn in circumstances where confidential information emerged in a mediation and settlement discussions and the same firm of solicitors is now acting for a third party in litigation against the first party.  </p>

It is not necessary to repeat that summary here, since, to the extent that the principles are applicable and relevant to this appeal, they are set out hereafter. The judge went on to the critical question whether the principles applied in the present case at [22], noting the essential distinction from <span style="font-style:italic">Bolkiah, </span>that Virtuoso had never acted for Glencairn. He then went on to consider the handful of cases here and in the Commonwealth which have involved similar factual situations to the present. At [23] he considered the decision of HHJ Hallgarten QC in <span style="font-style:italic">Adex International (Ireland) Limited v IBM United Kingdom</span> (2000). There, a claimant, Time, brought a claim against IBM in respect of defects in chipsets. Following settlement negotiations, a confidential settlement was reached. The same solicitor then acted for Adex in its claim against IBM in respect of defects in chipsets. IBM sought an order for Adex to be represented by alternative solicitors. HHJ Hallgarten QC accepted that, in any negotiations between Adex and IBM, the solicitor would not be able to put out of his mind the terms on which IBM had settled the first case and concluded that the solicitor should not continue to act. However, as the judge noted, it appears from the end of the judgment in that case that, subject to submissions from counsel, HHJ Hallgarten QC may have been prepared to allow the solicitor’s firm to continue to act if an adequate information barrier was put in place. </p>

Beyond pointing to the general circumstances of the particular case – here the apparently overlapping claims arising out of a similar factual background of purchases of machinery and equipment on the basis, as alleged, of representations of CHHF – it should not be required of a party seeking to ensure the protection of its confidential information that it must spell out particular matters of concern. To ask it to do so might be to ask it to reveal the very matter it is seeking to keep to itself. Moreover, it may not be able to be sure exactly what the lawyers may have learned from their observations during the mediation process. The disadvantage it is seeking to prevent may be as subtle as something which may have been observed by the lawyers in the body language of one of its representatives. Even an observation of that kind might give the lawyers a tactical advantage in deciding how to pursue the claim of their other client.” </p>

The <span style="font-style:italic">Adex International</span> case (unreported) 17 November 2000 was correctly decided, but it is a rare example of a situation where a solicitor was precluded from acting for a different claimant against the same defendant in respect of a similar claim as a result of confidential information obtained about the defendant in the earlier proceedings. The approach of the Court of Appeal of New Zealand in the <span style="font-style:italic">Carter Holt Harvey Forests</span> case [2001] 3 NZLR 343 was adopted in a case involving an express confidentiality agreement in mediation.

The policy in both cases is that parties must retain the freedom to be candid, in the one circumstance to their solicitors and in the other, in a mediation. Those freedoms should not be eroded. However, it seems to me that the two freedoms are not identical. Candour in a mediation will take the form of disclosing information to an adversary or potential adversary. Candour on the part of a client to his lawyer, whose duty and interest lies in promoting the cause of his client, is likely to be the product of little or no inhibition and a complete assumption that the information disclosed will go no further without the client's consent.

The judge said at [56] that if Laddie J was right, it did not matter whether the information barrier was part of the organisational structure of the firm or an ad hoc arrangement. What mattered was whether it worked. At [57] the judge said that he would assume that the risk of disclosure across an information barrier was greater in a small firm like Virtuoso than in a larger firm.  </p>

He then set out his conclusions in the Discussion section. So far as relevant to the appeal, he considered first whether Virtuoso was in possession of information confidential to Glencairn. The judge had not had the benefit of seeing any of the relevant provisions of the mediation agreement or Settlement Agreement so, as he said, he had to fall back on inferences. He concluded at [84] that: “on the limited information I have I will assume that the Dartington team at Virtuoso is aware of the contents of the Settlement Agreement and that at least some of this is confidential to Glencairn. My assumption goes no further.” He also accepted at [85] that the confidential contents of the Settlement Agreement would be particularly relevant to potential settlement discussions between Glencairn and Final Touch. It is to be particularly noted that the judge was therefore making a finding, on the limited information that Glencairn had chosen to disclose, that the only confidential information of any relevance was in the Settlement Agreement. </p>

This is likely to be inevitable in a small firm and is one of the reasons why the risk in a small firm may be greater. But it also seems to me to be likely that all individuals are highly aware that nothing should be said about the Dartington litigation. The fact of this application having been made may well have made that understanding even more acute. It is also relevant that the Final Touch team works in Leeds whereas the Dartington team is for the most part in London. Ms Ward has explained that the Final Touch team cannot access the Dartington documents. Although Virtuoso does not run a completely paperless system, the Dartington litigation is now at an end so I have no reason to believe that there will be many, if any, new documents created on that subject or that they will be created in hard copy to which the Final Touch team will have access.

Where in addition the information in question is not only confidential but also privileged, the case for a strict approach is unanswerable. Anything less fails to give effect to the policy on which legal professional privilege is based. It is of overriding importance for the proper administration of justice that a client should be able to have complete confidence that what he tells his lawyer will remain secret. This is a matter of perception as well as substance. It is of the highest importance to the administration of justice that a solicitor or other person in possession of confidential and privileged information should not act in any way that might appear to put that information at risk of coming into the hands of someone with an adverse interest.” </p>

In answer to the suggestion from the Court that the issue of the effectiveness of information barriers must be a question of fact not a question of law, he submitted that it was a binding proposition of law that the barrier needed to be in place as part of the structure of the firm. </p>

He submitted first that the judge’s reliance on Ms Ward’s evidence was unjustified. She had said that none of herself, Ms Wilson and Ms Waterman had any knowledge of the confidential terms of the settlement and all came to the matter cold. However, Ms Waterman had in fact worked on the Dartington litigation previously which Ms Ward did not mention. Furthermore, it was not sufficient to deal with lack of knowledge of the terms of the settlement.

The judge at [64] relied upon Ms Ward’s evidence that Ms Davies was replaced by Mr Walawage before the settlement negotiations took place, but this was not correct because she had received the document recording the parties’ agreement to mediate; (ii) As Ms Wickenden had accepted in oral argument before the judge, Ms Waterman had worked as a paralegal on the Dartington team. She had conducted minor research and sent a mediation position statement by email. Because she was a paralegal and not yet a qualified solicitor, the position was worse because there was a greater risk of disclosure by her; and (iii) the conversation between Mr Miller and Mr Shapiro demonstrated that there might have been a breach of confidence. Mr Barclay submitted that whilst the conflict of evidence could not be resolved, its existence pointed to the risk of there having been a breach. </p>

Part of the explanation for what was a relatively short delay was that the Final Touch litigation was stayed pending the settlement of the Dartington litigation which did not formally occur until 9 January 2019. Once the stay was lifted, Glencairn started to consider the issue of whether there was a conflict of interest, sent the letter of 14 February 2019 setting out potential concerns and sought counsel’s advice the following day. Virtuoso sent a reply letter on 18 February 2019 and this application was made less than three weeks later on 8 March 2019. Any delay was modest.  </p>

However, as Ms Wickenden pointed out, the judge had made a finding, in the section of his judgment at [79] to [84], repeated in the various sub-paragraphs of [86], that the only confidential information of relevance was contained in the Settlement Agreement. Glencairn was now seeking to argue that there was confidential material in the mediation and what led up to it but no evidence to that effect was advanced before the judge and if Glencairn had wanted to contend that there was confidential information other than in the Settlement Agreement, it was incumbent on it produce evidence detailing that confidential information.  </p>

The crucial point was in relation to Ms Ward’s evidence that she and her team had no knowledge of the terms of the Settlement Agreement or of any confidential information. As the judge recorded at [86 (b)], Mr Barclay had not challenged the credibility of her evidence, nor had Glencairn put in contrary evidence. Since her evidence was not contested, the judge was entitled to place weight upon it.

Whilst Ms Davies had worked on the Dartington matter, she had ceased to do so by the time of the mediation, so that when the information barrier was erected she was on the Final Touch side of the barrier and left the firm shortly thereafter.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Attractively though Mr Barclay’s submissions on the first ground of appeal were presented I cannot accept them. The fallacy in Glencairn’s argument is that it seeks to equate the position of a solicitor who formerly acted against the applicant (the former opponent case) with that of a solicitor who was formerly acting for the applicant (the former client case). However, the former client case is essentially at one end of the spectrum. In such a case, the information which the applicant wishes to keep confidential was imparted to the solicitor when he was acting for the applicant, when there was a fiduciary relationship of trust and confidence. It is clear from what Lord Millett said in <span style="font-style:italic">Bolkiah</span> that although the fiduciary relationship between a solicitor and his client comes to an end with the termination of the retainer, the solicitor remains subject to a strict duty of confidentiality because the information was imparted to him during the course of the fiduciary relationship: see 235C-D and 236F-H. In the latter passage, Lord Millett stated that the rationale for this strict rule in these terms: </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.04in;text-indent:0.00in">“It is in any case difficult to discern any justification in principle for a rule which exposes a former client without his consent to any avoidable risk, however slight, that information which he has imparted in confidence in the course of a fiduciary relationship may come into the possession of a third party and be used to his disadvantage. Where in addition the information in question is not only confidential but also privileged, the case for a strict approach is unanswerable. Anything less fails to give effect to the policy on which legal professional privilege is based. It is of overriding importance for the proper administration of justice that a client should be able to have complete confidence that what he tells his lawyer will remain secret. This is a matter of perception as well as substance. It is of the highest importance to the administration of justice that a solicitor or other person in possession of confidential and privileged information should not act in any way that might appear to put that information at risk of coming into the hands of someone with an adverse interest.”  </p>

This would run counter to the fundamental principle of equity that a fiduciary may not put his own interest or those of another client before those of his principal. In my view no solicitor should, without the consent of his former client, accept instructions unless, viewed objectively, his doing so will not increase the risk that information which is confidential to the former client may come into the possession of a party with an adverse interest.”    </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">As Arnold J (as he then was) noted in <span style="font-style:italic">Shlosberg v Avonwick Holdings Ltd</span> [2016] EWHC 1001 (Ch); [2017] Ch 210 at [148], Lightman J was setting out the relief normally granted in the “no relationship case” and was not suggesting that there would not be cases where, in the particular circumstances, it would be appropriate to grant an injunction restraining the solicitor from continuing to act even in a “no relationship” case. <span style="font-style:italic">Shlosberg</span> was such a case. However, what is important for present purposes is that in “no relationship” cases where a solicitor for the opposing party has come into possession of the applicant’s privileged information, the courts have not applied the special <span style="font-style:italic">Bolkiah</span> jurisdiction, imposing the burden of proof on the solicitor to show that there is no risk of disclosure of the confidential information. Rather the general law on confidentiality has been applied, that the burden of proof is on the applicant to show that there is a real risk of prejudice to him from the other party’s solicitor having had access to confidential or privileged information. That is precisely why in the usual case, the appropriate remedy is not an injunction to restrain the solicitor from acting but an injunction to restrain use of the confidential or privileged information, which adequately protects the applicant.

Unlike cases such as <span style="font-style:italic">English &amp; American Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Herbert Smith </span>the case is not one of inadvertent disclosure to the opposing firm. Rather, disclosure has been made in the context of a mediation or settlement. Mr Barclay argued that this was a case like <span style="font-style:italic">Carter Holt</span> where the opposing solicitor had entered an express confidentiality agreement contained in the declaration to the mediation agreement. Although he did not press the point orally, in his skeleton argument he contended that such an express contractual obligation of confidentiality was a fiduciary duty of an equal status to that imposed by a solicitor-client retainer, relying on what Lord Woolf MR said in <span style="font-style:italic">Attorney-General v Blake</span> [1998] Ch 439 at 454E-H and extra-judicial observations by Lord Millett in an article in the Law Quarterly Review: <span style="font-style:italic">Equity’s place in the law of commerce </span>(1998) 114 LQR 214. </p>

The first is that, as Ms Wickenden submitted, the judge made a finding that the only confidential information was in the Settlement Agreement so that unless Glencairn could overturn that finding (an issue to which I return below in the context of the second ground of appeal) it is of no relevance that the solicitors involved in the mediation signed the declaration of confidentiality in the mediation agreement. Virtuoso was not a party to the Settlement Agreement and thus to the confidentiality provision in clause 3. Accordingly, the highest it could be put is that if Mr Partington, Mr Walawage and Mr Popa saw clause 3, they came under an equitable duty of confidence.  </p>

The <span style="font-style:italic">Bolkiah</span> jurisdiction should be limited to cases where there is or was a true fiduciary relationship, of which a paradigm example will be the case of a solicitor who formerly acted for the applicant and who came into possession of the relevant privileged confidential information during the course of the retainer. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Furthermore, contrary to Mr Barclay’s submission, there is an obvious distinction between legal professional privilege and without prejudice privilege in the context of the present debate. In the former case, the former client has imparted privileged information to his solicitor during the course of a true fiduciary relationship, in circumstances where the solicitor now wishes to act against the former client. In those circumstances, the strict <span style="font-style:italic">Bolkiah</span> test and the placing of the burden of proof on the solicitor are clearly justified. In the case of without prejudice privilege, the applicant and his legal advisers will have chosen to share privileged information with his opponent and the opponent’s legal advisers during the course of a mediation or settlement discussions. Whilst the opponent and his legal advisers cannot use the privileged information other than for the purposes of the mediation or settlement discussions, they have not received it in a fiduciary capacity, as the underlined passage from Lord Millett’s article makes clear. If, for whatever reason, the information is misused and/or openly disclosed or there is some threat that it will be, the remedy of restraining the opponent and his legal advisers from misusing the information is usually sufficient protection. If the applicant wishes to obtain wider injunctive relief such as sought in this case, the burden of establishing that such relief is necessary should be on the applicant as it would be in the general law of confidentiality, without what might be described as presumptions in favour of the applicant such as apply under the strict <span style="font-style:italic">Bolkiah</span> test. </p>

In any event, the judgment was <span style="font-style:italic">ex tempore</span> and is of limited assistance, not least because it is apparent from the end of the judgment that the judge may not in fact have imposed an injunction restraining the opposing solicitors firm from acting, but may have accepted an undertaking that the particular partner involved in the previous Time mediation would not be involved in any settlement discussions in the Adex litigation. </p>

Of course, in an appropriate case, an applicant in the position of Glencairn may be able to satisfy the Court that the risk of misuse and prejudice is sufficiently great that an injunction to restrain the opposing party’s solicitor should be granted.

I agree with Ms Wickenden that this ground is seeking to attack and overturn findings of fact, inferences and evaluative assessments which are quintessentially matters for the judge at first instance with which this Court will be reluctant to interfere. The proper approach in the light of the authorities summarised at 52.21.5 of the White Book was summarised by this Court recently in <span style="font-style:italic">Scott v Potamianos</span> (also known as <span style="font-style:italic">Re Sprintroom</span>) [2019] EWCA Civ 932:  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">At the outset of consideration of this ground of appeal, I consider three important points need to be emphasised. First, Mr Barclay fairly accepted in argument that his criticism, that the evidence of Ms Ward about the Virtuoso Final Touch team having no knowledge of any confidential information was inadequate and that statements from the other lawyers were required, was only applicable if he was right on his first ground of appeal, that the <span style="font-style:italic">Bolkiah</span> test applied. Given that I have concluded that the first ground of appeal must be dismissed, that criticism falls away. Although no formal concession was made by Mr Barclay, it seems to me to follow that, given that the burden of proof remains on Glencairn to show sufficient risk of misuse and prejudice to justify an injunction, it is not sufficient for Glencairn to submit that the information barrier put in place failed to comply with the elements required by Lord Millett as set out at [31] above. In other words, the judge was right to conclude that the critical question was whether the information barrier put in place worked, which is a question of fact, in relation to which the burden of proof to show that it did not work was on Glencairn. There is no question of there being any binding proposition of law that the information barrier has to be part of the structure of the firm.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Second, although Mr Barclay sought in his submissions to make much of potential breaches of confidentiality prior to the information barrier being put in place, for example Ms Davies’ receipt of the mediation position statement, because Glencairn had not produced evidence as to the confidential information which it was alleging might have been disclosed, the judge made a finding that the furthest he could go was to conclude that the only relevant confidential information was in the Settlement Agreement (see [84] of his judgment). Contrary to Mr Barclay’s submissions, I consider that the judge was right in the finding he made. If Glencairn wanted to make good a case that there was confidential information in the mediation position statements or other without prejudice communications before or after the mediation or in what occurred at the mediation, it was incumbent on it to produce evidence detailing the confidential information in question. Mere assertion, which is what Mr Barclay’s submissions on this issue necessarily were in the absence of such evidence, is not sufficient. If it were to be suggested by Glencairn (which I do not understand that it was before this Court) that this would have entailed disclosing confidential information not just to the Court but to Final Touch and its lawyers, there are arrangements which could have been made to avoid that consequence, for example the appointment of special counsel to represent Virtuoso such as occurred in <span style="font-style:italic">Stiedl v Enyo Law LLP</span>.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Third, Mr Barclay’s reliance on the telephone conversation between Mr Miller and Mr Shapiro as somehow showing that there was a risk that there had been a breach of confidence was misconceived. The judge rightly concluded that there was a conflict of evidence between the two US lawyers as to what had been said which could not be resolved because neither had been called to give evidence and to be cross-examined, so that, as he said at [88], he could not reach a conclusion as to whether confidential information was disclosed. However, as Arnold LJ pointed out to Mr Barclay in the course of argument, by serving the evidence of Mr Miller openly, Glencairn had impaled itself on the horns of a dilemma. Mr Miller’s evidence in his witness statement is that  Final Touch’s attorney, Mr Shapiro, called him and said that he had become aware of details of the Dartington Settlement and in particular that, as part of the Settlement, Dartington had obtained payment from Glencairn for redesigning its glass. Mr Miller does not say that what he alleges Mr Shapiro said to him was inaccurate. Moreover, if it was inaccurate, it is difficult to see why Glencairn would be concerned.  Mr Miller’s evidence therefore implies that the statement as to the terms of the settlement attributed to Mr Shapiro was accurate. From all this it follows that by serving its evidence, Glencairn has “let the cat out of the bag” as to what confidential information was contained in the Settlement Agreement. I agree with Ms Wickenden that this is a very important factor militating against the grant of an injunction.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">In a very real sense those three points, whether taken individually or collectively, are a complete answer to this ground of appeal and demonstrate that the judge was quite right to conclude that confidential information had not passed to Ms Ward or the others on the Final Touch team at Virtuoso and that the likelihood of it doing so in the future was “very low” ([94] of the judgment).

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Mr Barclay’s criticism of the judge’s reliance on Ms Ward’s evidence as being unsustainable cannot stand, not just because of Mr Barclay’s confirmation that the criticism was only made if he was right on the first ground of appeal, which I have held he is not, but because, since Glencairn did not challenge Ms Ward’s credibility or put in any contrary evidence, it not open to it to criticise the judge for relying and placing weight on her evidence as he was entitled to do. </p>

Rather the question is whether the barrier works and the burden of proof is on Glencairn to show it does not. The evidence of Ms Ward shows clearly that the barrier does work and Glencairn have not put forward any evidence to the contrary. The points made are no more than assertion and supposition. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">As for Mr Barclay’s so-called “major incidents”, none of them is of any significance. The first concerns Ms Davies, but, given that the only confidential information found by the judge was in the Settlement Agreement, there is nothing in the point about what she might have known prior to being on the Final Touch side of the barrier and she left the firm soon after the settlement was concluded. In any event, there is no evidence that she ever had access to any confidential information, let alone that she passed it to anyone else in the firm. Such evidence as there is shows that although she was only a trainee solicitor she understood her responsibilities. As Ms Wickenden said, her integrity was tested on 18 December 2018 when Mr Haig of Glencairn’s solicitors attempted to speak to her to confirm the office address, but perhaps with an unnecessary abundance of caution, she refused to speak to him because of the information barrier.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">The second “major incident” concerned Ms Waterman but this too is a non-point given that the only confidential information the judge found was in the Settlement Agreement. She only ever worked on the Dartington matter as a paralegal before the mediation and there is simply no evidence whatsoever that she ever had access to confidential information. Mr Barclay’s suggestion that she may have done is unsustainable speculation. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">The third “major incident” concerned the conversation between Mr Miller and Mr Shapiro. Mr Barclay recognised that he cannot suggest that the judge should have accepted Mr Miller’s evidence, but tried to use the fact of the conversation having taken place as somehow demonstrating that a breach of confidence may have occurred. That again is pure speculation, but in any event, as I have already held, by putting in this evidence openly, Glencairn has effectively disclosed what the confidential information was, militating against the grant of an injunction.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">In my judgment, the judge’s evaluation of the evidence is not open to criticism and he carried out the balancing exercise correctly. His conclusion that the balance of justice was against the grant of an injunction was unimpeachable. The second ground of appeal should also be dismissed. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">I should add that, if I had considered that it was appropriate to grant an injunction, I would not have concluded that the delay in bringing the application, which was relatively short, should lead to the application being refused. As it is however, I consider that the judge was right to refuse to grant an injunction and that the appeal should be dismissed. <span style="font-weight:bold">Lord Justice Arnold </span></p>
