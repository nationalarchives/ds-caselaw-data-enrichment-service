In the alternative, the passing of the hypothetical regulations was, according to Ofcom, itself just an administrative step.  In any event, Ofcom was not enriched by the MNOs’ payments because their objective value to Ofcom was what it could and would have obtained in any event, had it exercised its statutory power lawfully, as explained by the Supreme Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Benedetti v.

An authority with statutory power to make regulations could avoid repaying unlawfully levied charges by saying that it could and would have made lawful regulations.  Moreover, there would cease to be much point in overcharged entities challenging the unlawfulness of such regulations, because the counterfactual would always prevent substantial recovery.  Mr Weisselberg’s answer to these points was to submit that his contentions were putting <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich</span> into its proper place as part of the law of unjust enrichment.  It was making sure that public authorities were not deprived of revenue on the basis of technicalities.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Ofcom is the body responsible for managing and licensing radio spectrum in the United Kingdom, including collecting ALFs.  The MNOs operate networks of base stations through which they provide mobile communications services on a retail basis to subscribers and on a wholesale basis to Mobile Virtual Network Operators.  Mobile devices transmit and receive voice calls and data via radio signals sent to and received by antennae on those base stations. Radio spectrum is therefore an essential input into the MNOs’ businesses.  Spectrum in the UK has generally been assigned after spectrum auctions since 2000.  This case, however, concerns the 900 and 1800 MHz bands, which were allocated administratively rather than being assigned at auction.  Four specific licences are in issue in this case, namely licence number 0249664 held by Vodafone, licence number 0249663 held by Telefónica, licence number 0931984 held by Three, and licence number 0249666 held by EE. In the case of each of these licences, an ALF was payable as provided in section 12 of the WTA 2006 and the regulations made thereunder. </p>

The judge also recorded that Ofcom had accepted that it had no claim for counter-restitution in respect of the use of the licences, a concession that he regarded as rightly made.  Any claim for counter-restitution by Ofcom would “undermine the legally binding arrangements by which the parties defined and thereby restricted their mutual obligations”.

That law had not developed so as to recognise a <span style="font-style:italic">condictio indebiti</span> - an action for the recovery of money on the ground that it was not due.  Instead, common law actions for the recovery of money paid under a mistake of fact, and under certain forms of compulsion had developed.  </p>

In any event, it seems strange to penalise the good citizen, whose natural instinct is to trust the revenue and pay taxes when they are demanded of him.

He could see no reason for so limiting the principle, and said that cases of <span style="font-style:italic">colore officii</span> were “merely examples of a wider principle, viz. that where the parties are on an unequal footing so that money is paid by way of tax or other impost in pursuance of a demand by some public officer, these moneys are recoverable since the citizen is, in practice, unable to resist the payment save at the risk of breaking the law or exposing himself to penalties or other disadvantages”.

The respondents were charged more than is warranted by the statute. Then it is clear that, until a court so declares, the respondents have no alternative but to continue to pay the charges demanded of them. In principle the appellants should not be permitted to retain payments for which they have no warrant to charge. The respondents may therefore recover whatever sum they may be able to prove was in excess of such a charge as would have avoided undue discrimination against them. I did not understand it to be disputed that the charges to the low voltage consumers are correct. It is fully within the competence of a court on the evidence before it to estimate the amount by which the respondents have been overcharged, and the respondents have, in my view, averred with sufficient specification the standard by which that amount should be estimated”. </p>

It is not, I think, quite the same to say that British Oxygen can recover whatever sum it can show was in excess of “such a charge as would have avoided undue discrimination against [it]” as to say, which Ofcom does, that the court should ask what the board would have done if it had acted lawfully.  As Lord Patrick explained in the Inner House, the electricity board might have charged everyone higher amounts.  In other words, British Oxygen recovered whatever sum was in excess of what it could lawfully have been charged without discrimination under section 37(8). </p>

Any system of retrospective determination of the sums due would have an element of imprecision at the margin: “[t]his, in part, is because it is accepted as a matter of principle that it is for the decision-maker, here the council, and not the court to fix the licence fee, and in part because it is recognised that deficits and surpluses can be carried forward and the accounting does not have to be on an annual basis”.  He thought at [127] that it appeared from the <span style="font-style:italic">colore officii</span> cases and <span style="font-style:italic">Waikato</span> that “no distinction has been made between the position where part but not all of the payment is due in any event and where nothing is due until a valid public law decision is made”.  Beatson LJ concluded at [128] from his reading of [177] of Wild J’s judgment and the incomplete reasoning of the Privy Council that it must have been the case that, before a further lawful determination of the charge, the entire payment was not due back forthwith (with the attendant consequences for interest), but only that part of it to which the authority was not lawfully entitled.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Before stating any principle, it is necessary, I think, to consider in broad terms the first 3 unjust enrichment questions in the way enunciated by Lord Reed in <span style="font-style:italic">ITC</span> at [37]-[45].  It is obvious that, on the basis of the <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich</span> principle, Ofcom has been enriched by the payment of the ALFs insofar as they exceeded the amounts payable under the 2011 Regulations. Ofcom has received a benefit from the MNOs, and they have suffered a loss through providing that benefit, in the very particular sense explained by Lord Reed at [43]-[45] in <span style="font-style:italic">ITC</span>.  The factor that makes the enrichment unjust is, as stated in <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich</span>, that money paid by a citizen to a public authority in the form of levies paid pursuant to an ultra vires demand by the authority is prima facie recoverable by the citizen as of right.  It is a fundamental principle of law that monies should not be levied without the authority of Parliament, and full effect can only be given to that principle if the return of taxes exacted under an unlawful demand can be enforced as a matter of right.   </p>

At each stage, Ofcom says that the unjust enrichment elements cannot exist because it was open to Ofcom to make regulations that could and would lawfully have charged ALFs close to those set by the 2015 Regulations.  The judge made this clear at [92]-[106] when he dealt with the three elements, and concluded that each of Ofcom’s arguments was another way of repackaging its counterfactual principle. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The question is why, if the proper analysis of the cases is that one can hypothesise administrative steps, should one not also hypothesise delegated legislation that it was open to the defendant to formulate and make?  The answer in my judgment is that the cases do not show that the courts have ever hypothesised any counterfactual steps at all in a <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich</span> case.  The unjust factor in a <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich</span> case is, as I have said, that monies should not be levied without the authority of Parliament, and that principle requires recovery as of right.  In this case, therefore, there was no valid Parliamentary foundation beyond section 12 of the WTA 2006 and the 2011 Regulations. Sums paid over and above what was authorised by those legislative instruments were squarely covered by the <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich </span>claim<span style="font-style:italic">.</span>  In evaluating the quantum of enrichment, it is, however, open to the court, as the cases relied upon by Ofcom show, to identify the sum that is in excess of what could lawfully have been charged, and I would add, <span style="font-weight:bold">under the existing legislation</span>.  No case has ever said expressly or impliedly that the court can reduce a <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich</span> claim by hypothesising new and unenacted legislation.  Such an exercise would anyway be uncharted speculation.  More importantly, it would undermine the <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich </span>principle<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>itself. </p>

Whilst this may appear semantic, I do not believe that it is.  I do not think that any of the cases relied upon by Ofcom can be wholly explained by the existence of a retrospective power to fix charges that might have been lawfully fixed at an earlier stage.  Moreover, the courts have not said, clearly or otherwise, that they will not themselves evaluate what an authority could lawfully have charged.  Either the </p>

First, the <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich </span>principle itself assumes reimbursement of overpaid charges as of right, and secondly, the cases themselves make clear how the enrichment is to be valued in this situation.  The recoverable enrichment is, at the risk of repetition, the amount by which the charge exceeded what could lawfully have been levied under the existing legislation.  There is no need to ask what, hypothetically, the authority might have itself done.

The recognition of the counterfactual principle for which Ofcom contends would be contrary to the principle of legality which is the foundation of the unjust factor in <span style="font-style:italic">Woolwich</span> cases.  As the Chancellor demonstrates, the cases on which Ofcom relies are examples of a different exercise, namely identifying the extent by which the payment in question exceeded the amount lawfully authorised at the time of payment.  Such an exercise is straightforward in cases like <span style="font-style:italic">Dew v Parsons</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Steele v Williams</span> where the amount of the lawful charge is a fixed amount already stated in the legislation.  It is less straightforward where the amount of the lawful charge depends on an assessment which the legislation authorises the defendant to perform, but which it has failed to perform lawfully, as in <span style="font-style:italic">British Oxygen</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">Waikato</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Hemming</span>; but those cases establish that the exercise of identifying the amount of the lawful charge (and thus the excess) can in principle still be done in such a case, if necessary by the Court itself.  (That may at first blush seem rather surprising, but the Privy Council in <span style="font-style:italic">Waikato</span> was at pains to point out that the Court was not usurping the role of the statutory decision-maker: see para. 81 of its judgment, quoted by the Chancellor at para. 72.)  The point is that, even in such a case the exercise is still conceptually the same, and fundamentally different from deciding what the defendant might have been able to charge under a lawful authority which was not then in place.  </p>
