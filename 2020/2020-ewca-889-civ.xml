	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">These appeals are concerned with the classification of the Vauxhall Vivaro (the “Vivaro”) and the first and second generations of VW Transporter T5 Kombi van (the “Kombi” or “Kombis”) for the purposes of income tax and national insurance contributions. The vehicles were provided by Coca-Cola European Partners Great Britain Limited (“Coca-Cola”) to its employees for use in their work and for their own private purposes. The cash equivalent of the benefit of having been provided with a vehicle is treated as earnings from employment and taxed accordingly and there is a corresponding charge in respect of national insurance.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The classification of the vehicles is of importance because the cash equivalent of the benefit of a “van” and a “car”, both of which are defined statutory terms, are calculated differently. Although the calculation is based on numerous factors, including the vehicle’s emissions, in general, if a vehicle falls within the definition of a “car” the benefit and, as a result, the tax levied, will be greater than if it were a “van”.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In fact, the question at the heart of both appeals is whether the vehicles in question were “goods vehicles”, which is also a defined term. The question is of considerable importance. Large numbers of employees are supplied with Kombis or Vivaros, or vehicles which share their attributes.  </p>

The parties asked the FTT to determine, as a point of principle, whether or not the Kombi 1, the Kombi 2 and the Vivaro were “goods vehicles”. It seems that it was accepted that if they were not, they would fall within the definition of “cars” in section 115(1) ITEPA 2003 and the cash equivalent of the benefit would be calculated accordingly. In a decision dated 30 August 2017, the FTT decided that the Vivaro is a “goods vehicle” for the purposes of section 115(2) ITEPA 2003 but that both the Kombi 1 and the Kombi 2 </p>

ITEPA 2003 contains provisions relating to income tax on employment income, amongst other things. Section 6(1)(a) imposes a tax on “general earnings”, which is defined to include “earnings” and “any amount treated as earnings” (section 7(3)). Taxable benefits, set out in “the benefits code”, are treated as earnings (section 7(5); section 63).  </p>

The modifications made to the Vivaro included, but were not limited to, the addition of a second row of seats (that could accommodate two passengers). A window was added next to those seats and a steel bulkhead added behind those seats so that goods being transported could not enter the passenger compartment in the event of sudden braking (see [16(2)] and [16(7)]). </p>

The seats in the mid-section could be removed, but only with the use of tools. Even with the second row of seats in place, there would be around 1.5 m3 of space in the mid-section that could be used to carry goods (see [19] and [21]) and therefore the FTT concluded at [150] that the midsection of the Vivaro was adapted for the carrying of a significant amount of cargo.

In relation to the Kombi 2, it was a contractual requirement imposed by Coca-Cola that the employee/driver of the vehicle had the racking in the mid-section in place during working hours. In other words, during working hours the second row of seats was required to be removed (see [39]).” </p>

In particular: the Vivaro’s engine and transmission are mounted transversely and the driver’s position set high to maximise the load area and load volume; the mechanical components of the Vivaro were packaged to allow a large flat load space and its height was designed to maximise the load and load volume; the design and dimension of the sliding door facilitated loading; and the suspension and braking system were designed to deal with heavy loads and a trailer: ([148]).  </p>

This seemed to me to be an important feature in the overall assessment of the characteristics of the Vivaro. Clearly the majority of the mid-section was taken up by seating (which I recognise could only be removed with tools), but there was a material amount of cargo-carrying space (1.5m3 in Mr Roberts’ estimation) which, in my view, could not be ignored  . . . .

The UT rejected Mr Gardiner’s submission that seating for passengers and driver at the front of a vehicle could not, on their own, be indicative of a suitability for passenger transport but rather, all other relevant aspects of the vehicles should first be identified and, if those characteristics indicated a primary suitability for the conveyance of goods or burden, then the seating at the front should be regarded as ancillary to that primary suitability and “take its colour” from those other features.

At [29], the FTT had found as a fact that the rear section of the Kombi could only be used for the purpose of carrying goods.

Furthermore we consider that, after it had weighed the significance of its conclusion on the seating at the front against other competing considerations, it was open to the FTT to conclude that the Kombis had no overall “primary suitability” with the result that they were not goods vehicles. We therefore reject the criticisms of the Decision under this heading.” </p>

It is clear both from the wording used in section 115 and the context as a whole that that was not the dichotomy which the statutory draughtsman sought to create. The provision must be viewed in context and construed as a whole, as it stands. The section arises in the context of determining the cash equivalent of the benefit of having a vehicle made available for private use whether it is a “car” or a “van”. Although it is true that the private use of a car is likely to be greater than that of a van, the very nature of the cash equivalent provisions assume that either type of vehicle may be used privately and it is the cash equivalent of that benefit which is to be taxed, save in the case of a van in a tax year in which the private use by the employee, or member of his family or household, is insignificant: (section 114(3A)). Once a vehicle falls within one of the definitions, the benefit will be calculated in accordance with its environmental impact amongst other things.

Each of the exceptions from the definition of a car in sub-sub-sections (a) – (d) are disjunctive. It seems to me, therefore, that the reference to “private vehicle” in (d) cannot colour the meaning of “car” or “goods vehicle” and create the juxtaposition which Mr Gardiner suggests. It is merely a means of defining a category of vehicle which must be excluded. Accordingly, a car with dual controls used by a driving instructor or the car in the <span style="font-style:italic">Gurney</span> case with a blue flashing light on the roof which it was illegal for a member of the public to drive on the road, would not be “cars” as a result of section 115(1)(d).  </p>

The use to which a particular vehicle has been put is, in our view, as irrelevant as the intention with which it was bought or altered. A limousine does not become a goods vehicle because it carries potatoes and no passengers; nor does a lorry cease to be a goods vehicle because it carries passengers and not goods. The question is not what does this particular vehicle usually carry nor what is this vehicle capable of carrying, but what is the use for which the vehicle was constructed or adapted. It seems to us that this question falls to be resolved by looking [at] the vehicle and considering whether vehicles of this kind are ordinarily used for the carriage of passengers and their effects, or the carriage of goods. In this connection, it may well be that the manufacturers’ advertisements, etc. can be looked at, not to ascertain the intention or purpose of the manufacturer or purchaser in relation to the particular vehicle, but as some evidence of the use to which vehicles of the same type are ordinarily put.”   </p>

In such circumstances, as Ms McCarthy stated, it is possible for a feature to be appropriate for a particular purpose whilst being over-engineered for another, as the FTT observed at [156] of the FTT Decision in relation to the “Shuttle”, a passenger vehicle, based upon an original panel van design.  Such over-engineering does not of itself render the feature unsuited to another purpose. It is necessary to consider the matter in the round.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">It also follows that I agree with Ms McCarthy that when seeking to carry out an evaluation, it is misleading to look at each feature of a vehicle separately and to determine whether that feature is more typically found in one type of vehicle or another. Not only is “typicality” not the relevant statutory test but also a feature may be typically found in a van because it is suitable for the conveyance of goods, such as strong brakes, but may not detract from another suitability. The presence of such a feature does not necessarily mean that the vehicle is “primarily suited” to one use or another. Accordingly, in my judgment the FTT was wrong to be swayed by whether features were “more characteristic” or “more typical” to a type of vehicle, as it seems to have been at [147] and [148] of the FTT Decision.  </p>

Although the presence of a driver’s seat may be neutral, it was necessary for the FTT to evaluate what conclusions it drew from the possible configurations of the Kombi and the UT was right to decide that the FTT was entitled to come to the conclusion it did on the evidence before it. </p>

Although Mr Gardiner did not press the matter in oral submissions in his written argument he took the point that the FTT concluded that the rear section was “primarily” suited for the conveyance of goods at [161] but had already decided that it was “solely” suited to goods earlier in the FTT Decision. He criticised the UT conclusion at [74] of the UT Decision that the use of “primarily” by the FTT at [161] of the FTT Decision was merely a typographical error and did not indicate an error of reasoning. </p>

As the UT pointed out, there is nothing to suggest that the FTT’s conclusion in relation to the rear section was to any extent influenced by a perception that that section was of a construction suitable to carry passengers or their effects and it had earlier found that it was solely for the conveyance of goods. Furthermore, despite Ms McCarthy’s detailed submissions based on the decision in the <span style="font-style:italic">Flowers</span> case, to the effect that the rear racking and shelving was equally suitable for carrying goods or passenger effects, it seems to me that in the absence of an error of law, it is not for us to re-evaluate the suitability of the rear racking. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In relation to the mid-section of the Kombis, Mr Gardiner’s starting point is that the FTT and the UT took the wrong approach to the removable seating because they misconstrued “construction” in section 115(2) ITEPA 2003. I have already decided that the approach in the <span style="font-style:italic">Coleborn</span> case is not relevant in this context and that the FTT was right to reject that approach in the context of section 115(2)<span style="font-style:italic">. </span>I have also decided that <span style="font-style:italic">Taylor v Mead</span> can be distinguished from this case. It follows, therefore, that in my judgment, neither the FTT nor the UT erred in its approach to the removable seating. The FTT was entitled to find as it did at [158] – [160]. It concluded that both versions of the Kombi were supplied with seats which “when fitted took up most of the space in that section” but when removed, “almost the entire area of the midsection was available for conveyance of goods” ([158]). Accordingly, the FTT decided<span style="color:#993366"> </span>that the mid-section was “equally suited for either purpose” ([160]) and that in essence, Kombis are “multi-purpose vehicles”<span style="color:#FF0000"> </span>([159]).     </p>

Having decided that “primarily” in section 115(2) envisages that a vehicle may have more than one potential suitability and that it “requires the taxpayer to demonstrate that the predominant suitability of the vehicle in question is for the conveyance of goods or burden” ([143] of the FTT Decision), the FTT went on to evaluate each feature of the Vivaro separately at [146] – [152] and having decided that the vehicle has a “dual capability”, nevertheless, came to a conclusion “on a narrow balance” that it is primarily suited to the conveyance of goods. In doing so, it seems to have lost sight of the concept of predominance. The UT endorsed that erroneous approach at [44] of the UT Decision. As I have already decided, it is not enough to slip past the post. “Primarily” means something more than a suitability which is first in the list by a whisker. It means first <span style="font-style:italic">and</span> foremost. It cannot encompass very narrow margins. It is also possible for a multi-purpose vehicle </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Furthermore, in deciding that the Vivaro was primarily suited for the conveyance of goods, it seems to me that the FTT was swayed by its view of the mid-section of the Vivaro which it described and evaluated at [150] of the FTT Decision which is set out at [15] above. The so-called difference in layout from that of the Kombi is the space for goods/tools in the Vivaro mid-section. In this regard, the FTT seems to have lost sight of the fact that it had found at [34(4)] that the mid-section of the Kombi 2 also had removable storage units. Even on the FTT’s view that a narrow balance is enough to be “primarily suited”, it seems to me that the difference is insufficient upon which to differentiate the Vivaro from the Kombi and to decide that the Vivaro is primarily suited for the conveyance of goods. This is all the more so when one considers whether the Vivaro was suited first and foremost for that purpose. It seems to me that the only reasonable conclusion on the facts, having weighed all the features of a Vivaro and considered the vehicle as a whole (including its appearance) is that it, like the Kombis, is multi-purpose and is not primarily suited to the conveyance of goods.  </p>
