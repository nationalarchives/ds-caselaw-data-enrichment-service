	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">This appeal raises issues about the lawfulness of the transfer of data to the British High Commission in Kingston, Jamaica for the purposes of an out of country appeal under Regulation (EU) 2016/679, known as the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”).  The appellant, who is the subject of the data, refused to consent to any transfer of data for the purposes of his appeal and maintains that such a transfer of data is not permissible without his consent.  The appellant contends that he was therefore unable to have a lawful out of country appeal, and says that the remedy is to grant him leave to enter so that he can have his appeal determined in the United Kingdom. </p>

The Upper Tribunal dismissed an appeal from the decision of the First-tier Tribunal (“FTT”) (Judge Clements President; Designated FTT Judge McCarthy; and FTT Judge Carter) which had heard on 17 July 2018 an appeal by the appellant against the decision of the respondent Secretary of State to refuse his human rights claim.     </p>

They were linked by videolink.  The appellant gave evidence by video-link.  The appellant did not object to the fact that the proceedings were by video-link (and this appeal, heard under restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, was heard remotely by video-link) but objected to the fact that giving live evidence from Jamaica involved a breach of both EU and domestic data protection laws.  The appellant also contended that he was the victim of unlawful discrimination. </p>

Although anonymity was ordered before the FTT and Upper Tribunal I can discern no current basis for ordering the anonymisation of the appellant’s name, and no such order should be made. </p>

That meant that the appellant could only appeal out of country, pursuant to section 92(3)(a) of the 2002 Act.

The appellant was a foreign criminal pursuant to section 117D(2) of the 2002 Act.  This meant that it was necessary to consider the provisions of section 117C of the 2002 Act. </p>

In my judgment the transfer and disclosure of the data was necessary for the legal proceedings, being the appeal to the FTT.

However the scheme of section 94B of the 2002 Act provides for an out of country appeal.

Mr Kovats recognised that this did not mean that the territory of the British High Commission in Jamaica became part of the UK, but he submitted that the GDPR required transfer of data to another person in the third country rather than transfer by the Home Office to the Home Office because the critical issue was to have a controller or processor in the EU.   </p>

This is because such an approach might leave unprotected data subjects where there were insolvent controllers or processors located in the EU who had transferred data to third countries in circumstances where because it was considered not to be a transfer to a third country the data subject had no right to object on that ground.  In my judgment, however, it is much better to leave this issue to be determined in a case where it is critical to the outcome.  In this case it is not critical to the outcome because I agree with both the FTT and the Upper Tribunal that if the transfer of data to the British High Commission did amount to a transfer to a third country for the purposes of article 45 of the GDPR, it was justifiable pursuant to article 49(1)(e) of the GDPR.  This is because the transfer was necessary for the establishment and defence of legal claims, and it was proportionate to make the transfer for the reasons given in relation to issue one above. </p>

This is because even if the appeal is heard in the UK, it will involve the processing of the appellant’s data.  If an appellant objects to the processing of his data for the purposes of his appeal overseas it would be difficult to see why the appellant should not object to the processing of his data in the UK.  In these circumstances it is not immediately apparent what would therefore be gained by adjourning the appeal so that the appellant could return to the UK.  Further if an appellant objects to the processing of his data for the purposes of frustrating the appeal hearing and there is no lawful basis by which the appeal may otherwise be heard using the appellant’s data, the FTT may consider that the appellant is deliberately frustrating and therefore abusing the appeal process.

In determining whether the appeal right was effective and fair the Supreme Court adopted a hands-on practical test focusing upon such matters as: the availability of legal aid and the right or ability of the deportee to obtain representation; the ability of that person to obtain access to all relevant documents and evidence; the ability of the person to access relevant video link facilities and its intrinsic quality and whether the link was sufficient to permit effective cross examination, etc.  </p>

Nonetheless, I have some difficulty with the conclusion of the FTT that the appellant’s hostility towards the respondent amounted, in context, to a good reason.  This is because it is the duty of the tribunal to ensure, quite irrespective of the appellant’s stance towards the respondent, that a deportee receives a fair and effective hearing.  The Appellant’s lack of trust in the respondent has nothing to do with the fairness and effectiveness of the proceedings or the duty of the tribunal to provide such a hearing and ensure that, so far as is necessary, the respondent cooperates to meet that standard.   </p>

It therefore seems to me that insofar as this might be an issue in another case it is a point which warrants closer analysis.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The second point concerns the conclusion arrived at by Lord Justice Dingemans at paragraphs [51] – [54] of his judgment concerning the scope and effect of articles 4446 GDPR on transfers of personal data to a third country. It is common ground that because the controller and processor (ie the Home Office) was in the UK (cf Article 3 GDPR) that the GDPR regime applied. The issue is whether the transmission of the court papers and bundles to Jamaica and the transmission of data via video link to and from Jamaica amounted to the transfer of personal data to a third country. If it did then the processing of that data was required to meet the <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">additional</span> requirements of Chapter V GDPR. </p>

Hence there is a need for additional protection of the data subject.  The basic point is well made by recital [101] of the GDPR </p>

The increase in such flows has raised new challenges and concerns with regard to the protection of personal data. However, when personal data are transferred from the Union to controllers, processors or other recipients in third countries or to international organisations, the level of protection of natural persons ensured in the Union by this Regulation should not be undermined, including in cases of onward transfers of personal data from the third country or international organisation to controllers, processors in the same or another third country or international organisation. In any event, transfers to third countries and international organisations may only be carried out in full compliance with this Regulation. A transfer could take place only if, subject to the other provisions of this Regulation, the conditions laid down in the provisions of this Regulation relating to the transfer of personal data to third countries or international organisations are complied with by the controller or processor.”</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Article 46(1) provides that a controller or processor can transfer personal data “<span style="font-style:italic">to a third country</span>” only if the controller or processor has met certain conditions which include the putting into place of adequate safeguards.  Lists of safeguards are then set out in the remainder of the article and conditions are referred to in article 49.  In the present appeal the respondent argues that article 46 does not apply because there was no transfer to a third country but if it does then adequate safeguards were in place.  I agree with Lord Justice Dingemans that if the article applies then adequate safeguards were put in place. I also agree with him that the better provisional view is that there <span style="text-decoration:underline">was</span> a transfer of personal data to a third country in this case.  The provisional view that we both express is contrary to that expressed by the Upper Tribunal (see paragraphs 48ff of its judgment). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">As to this Mr Kovats accepted that there had been a geographical transfer of the personal data in this case, but he argued that this was not what articles 44ff were aimed at.  He argued that since the only people in Jamaica that received and handled the data were Home Office officials and that there was no risk of that data being leaked or hacked or otherwise finding its way into the hands of third parties, this was not, in reality, a transfer of personal data to Jamaica.  It never left the control of the Home Office.  He referred, by way of support for his argument, to recital 25 GDPR which refers to the application of the laws of Member States by reference to public international law and he cited the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relation of 1961 and the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations of 1963 both of which highlight the inviolability of a state’s consular and diplomatic premises and documents.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Again it is not necessary to express a definitive view on this point, but I favour the conclusion that there was a transfer to a third country. The Upper Tribunal recited in some details the  background that I have summarised and, having recognised that the GDPR did have significant extraterritorial effect, concluded (paragraph [53]) that it made good sense for the GDPR to apply to a EU Member State’s diplomatic and consular premises overseas, rather than to treat any data transfer to such premises as a transfer to a third country.  Echoing Mr Kovats’ argument, this was “<span style="font-style:italic">because for all practical purposes the data remains under the sole control of the Member State</span>”.  I </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">agree with the Upper Tribunal that the GDPR exerts significant extraterritorial effect but, with respect, I disagree that one can, in effect, read into article 46 a complex limitation based on consular and diplomatic premises and a test based upon the “<span style="font-style:italic">sole control</span>” of a Member State.  That is simply not what the GDPR says and there is in my view no basis upon which this can be inferred from the much broader words “<span style="font-style:italic">transfers of personal data to third countries”.  </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The transfer of data to an embassy or consulate is an illustration of such a transfer but it is not its defining parameter. The policy underlying Chapter V GDPR is that, in principle, once outside of the jurisdiction of the EU the personal data is subject to greater risk necessitating greater safeguards. The nature and extent of that risk will of course vary enormously from case to case and in the circumstance of a transfer to a foreign consulate the risk might be relatively low.  In this case the data did arrive in Jamaica.  The fact that it was received in the British High Commission and was handled only by Home Office officials and was subject to protections afforded under international law and was to be destroyed after the hearing, adds significant force to the respondent’s argument that there were sufficient safeguards in place to protect the personal data in this third state.  It does not, in my view, mean that the data never passed onto the territory of that third state. At the end of the day whilst expressing this view since this point was not determinative of the appeal, like Lord Justice Dingemans, I leave it to be resolved fully upon another occasion.   </p>
