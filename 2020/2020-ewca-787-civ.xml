Their father is a 56-year-old man of Indian heritage who was married on three previous occasions before his relationship with the children’s mother. Thirty years ago, he was convicted of incest as a result of a sexual relationship with his younger sister which started when she was seven years old and he was aged fourteen and continued for some ten years. The father has five older children by his earlier marriages.

She and her extended family moved into a house owned by the father. The mother quickly became pregnant and gave birth to X in early 2012. Her second son, Y, was born the following year. Local authority social services and the police were involved on several occasions in the next few years because of concerns about the father’s previous conviction and allegations that he was physically abusive towards the mother. In May 2015, the mother was admitted to hospital because of concerns about her mental health. Her condition improved with medication but deteriorated again in 2017 when she stopped the treatment with the intention of having another baby. </p>

The mother’s condition worsened and she was reported as hearing voices and displaying violent behaviour towards the father. A social work visit to the family home revealed that the property was in a very poor condition with the whole family sleeping together in the living room because the bedrooms were unusable. The children were placed under child protection plans following a case conference. There were further reports of domestic abuse between the parents and no evidence of significant improvement in the condition of the home. </p>

The following month, the authority started care proceedings in respect of the children. Upon removal from home, the children were placed together in a foster placement in Kent. It is agreed that they thrived in that placement, but in October 2018 the local authority decided to move the children to another foster placement within its own area. In her judgment, the recorder noted that it was generally accepted that the second placement, although a closer cultural match, was less nurturing and supportive for the children. In July </p>

The local authority sought final care orders in respect of all children, on the basis of care plans which provided for the boys to be placed together in long-term foster care and LC placed for adoption. An application for a placement order for LC was issued and listed for determination at the hearing. The parents opposed the applications and asked the court to return the children to their care. The children’s guardian supported the application for care orders but opposed the application for a placement order in respect of LC. Her preference was for all three children to be placed together, preferably in the foster home in Kent where they had thrived after being removed from the family home, or alternatively with another experienced foster carer. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In her first judgment, delivered after the conclusion of the hearing on 4 October 2019, the recorder concluded that the threshold criteria under s.31 of the Children Act were satisfied and that there was no realistic prospect of the children being returned to the care of the parents, but that it was not possible to reach a final decision about the placement of the children at that stage. She therefore adjourned the hearing, initially for one month, for the local authority to file further evidence. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It is unnecessary for the purposes of this appeal to consider the threshold findings in any detail. Suffice it to say that the recorder made a series of findings that the children had suffered neglect, had been exposed to domestic abuse between the parents and had been subjected to excessive physical chastisement. She also found that the parents had failed to prioritise the children’s needs or to establish and maintain routines and boundaries, that they had shown no insight into the effect of their parenting on the children’s emotional development, and that the mother’s mental health problems made it likely that she would become emotionally and physically unavailable to the children in future. The recorder concluded that the children’s psychological functioning had been significantly affected by the trauma and deprivation they had endured. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In conducting the welfare analysis, the recorder had the benefit of expert evidence about the parents from a clinical psychologist, a forensic psychiatrist, and a PAMS parental assessor. On the basis of that evidence, coupled with the evidence given by the social workers and the parents themselves, the recorder concluded that a rehabilitation of the children with the parents, either together or separated, was not a realistic option for their future care. That decision does not form part of the appeal before us and it is unnecessary to consider the reasons for the decision any further. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The recorder also had evidence from a clinical psychologist who had conducted an evaluation of the children. She approached his report with some caution because of criticisms levelled at the report by a number of professionals. In particular, none of the parties accepted his recommendation that the boys should be separated. The children’s allocated social worker gave evidence of a close bond between the brothers which led the recorder to conclude that separation would be wholly contrary to their best interests. The recorder took into account, however, the psychologist’s observation that LC’s behaviour indicated a lack of secure attachment as a result of the deficiencies in her mother’s care in the first weeks of her life, coupled with the subsequent moves between foster carers. </p>

When he gave his evidence, the allocated social worker was at a disadvantage because the guardian’s proposal to return all three children to the foster carers in Kent had only been put forward at a relatively late stage and no enquiries had been made to establish whether they would be willing to take the children. Having noted the disadvantage which the social worker was under, however, the recorder was critical of his approach in these terms (paragraph 79 of her first judgment): </p>

By the time she gave her evidence, the guardian had spoken to the foster carers in Kent who had expressed a willingness to offer a long-term home for all three children, although they were unwilling to adopt them or to become their special guardians. One difficulty, however, was that at that point they were looking after another sibling group who were awaiting a final decision about their future. The guardian spoke in what the recorder described as “glowing terms” about the Kent foster carers, noting the impact of their care on the boys and the significant emotional connection they had made. The boys told the guardian that they wanted to move back to the Kent carers “tomorrow”.  </p>

In the alternative, she proposed that the local authority should make enquiries about the possibility of another foster placement for all three children. The principle of keeping the three siblings together was her primary position, with adoption as the last resort. It was the guardian’s view that there was not less security or permanence in long-term foster care. She saw a positive benefit arising from the extensive support available to foster carers on a scale which would not be available to adopters. The guardian was also concerned about the risk of adoption breakdown and the catastrophic impact such a breakdown would have on LC. The recorder noted that the guardian was of the view that in LC’s case the benefits of adoption were outweighed by the advantages of continuing a close relationship with her brothers and </p>

It is unusual, in my opinion, that this local authority, having set out so clearly all of the positive benefits that long-term foster care can offer to the boys, have, in my view, closed their minds to the opportunities that might similarly be offered to LC if she remained in long-term foster care. The care plan for LC is one for adoption. That means if I grant the order that all legal ties with her biological family would be severed. The local authority tell me in their care plan that LC will be able to then find an alternative forever home and family which will meet her needs, a family which she can call her own. Adoption is not a panacea. I have concerns that the local authority have promoted the option of adoption for LC above all else due to her age rather than undertaking a careful, considered and evidence-based analysis of the pros and cons of adoption as against alternative options such as long-term foster care. In particular, I am satisfied that the local authority have had too little regard for the very positive benefits that the ongoing relationship of LC with her parents and LC with her siblings would bring to her life and the enormous benefits that will provide to her throughout her life. </p>

It is also the issue of her own cultural identity as I have already touched upon in considering the welfare of the boys. I have already said it is important to recognise that aspect of her heritage.

There is the unusual cultural match which means that it is highly unlikely that LC would be adopted by a family with a similar cultural match.

The court stressed that it is incumbent on (a) the local authority that applies for care and placement orders, (b) the children’s guardian entrusted with representing the children in the proceedings, and (c) the court to carry out a robust and rigorous analysis of the advantages and the disadvantages of all <span style="text-decoration:underline">realistic</span> options for the child and, in the case of the court, set out that analysis and its ultimate decisions in a reasoned judgment. </p>

[T]he discipline of identifying the realistic options and summarising the advantages and disadvantages of each before making a final order is one which should be followed whenever the court is making a decision about the future of a child ….  A judge who fails to adopt that approach runs the risk that his decision may be challenged on the grounds that he has failed to take into account a material advantage or disadvantage of one or other of the realistic options. It does not follow, however, that a judgment in which this approach is not adopted will inevitably be overturned. This court will only allow an appeal where persuaded that the decision below was wrong or unjust because of a serious procedural or other irregularity. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In this case, the recorder acknowledged in her October judgment that there were “powerful arguments in favour of adoption”. In her February judgment, she referred to the argument in favour of adoption identified by the local authority that LC would “be able to then find an alternative forever home and family which will meet her needs, a family which she can call her own”. She also noted that it was unusual for a child of this age to be placed in long-term foster care. In my judgment, these are clear signs that the recorder took into account, as arguments in favour of adoption, (a) LC’s very young age, (b) the fact that an adoptive placement would meet her needs, and (c) that through adoption she would have the opportunity to be part of a permanent “forever” family which she could “call her own”. I am in no doubt that the recorder had these factors in mind and took them into account in her analysis. </p>

It will be a major focus – perhaps the major focus – in nearly every case in which a care plan for adoption is contested by the birth family. In most cases, the effect of adoption is to sever the child’s relationships with all members of her birth family.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In this case, the recorder considered the relationships between LC and her parents and between LC and her siblings as being of very significant value. She emphasised, in particular, the relationships between siblings which are, of course, lifelong relationships. She also concluded that maintaining links with her birth family would be the best way of enabling LC to sustain her distinctive cultural heritage. In my judgment, the recorder was best placed to evaluate the importance of these factors and her conclusions about them were plainly open to her on the evidence. She identified other advantages for LC in a long-term foster placement in this case, including the difficulty the child may have in forming secure attachments as a result of her extremely unsettled early experiences, having had four primary carers in the first 18 months of her life. But in her final analysis in paragraph 24 of her judgment, the recorder identified the importance for LC of maintaining a bond with her birth family and a link to her cultural heritage as being the decisive factor.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I do not consider that the recorder’s judgments delivered in October 2019 and February 2020 can be described as “linear” in the sense identified by McFarlane LJ in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Re G</span>. Although the assessment of the realistic options in the February judgment did not follow the structure recommended in previous authorities, I am satisfied that the recorder did take into account all relevant matters and that her analysis meets the standard of an adequately reasoned judgment required by this court in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Re B-S</span>. To adopt McFarlane LJ’s words, she carried out a “full and effective process of evaluation” in which she “engaged with the very detail of the option of adoption which rendered it 'draconian'”. In this case, the factor which would render the adoption of LC ‘draconian’ would be the consequence that her relationship with her family would be severed. In this case, the recorder clearly engaged with this aspect, scrutinised it carefully, and concluded that the relationships between LC and her birth family were of sufficient importance to outweigh the advantages of adoption. </p>
