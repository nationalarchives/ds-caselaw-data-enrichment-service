	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The issue at the heart of this appeal is whether it was open to the Secretary of State to make a fresh deportation order against the appellant in circumstances where he had successfully appealed to the Upper Tribunal (IAC) against an earlier deportation order based upon the same criminal conviction. The appellant contends that the decision of the Upper Tribunal, promulgated on 20 July 2012, that his removal would be a disproportionate interference with his rights under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, gave rise to an issue estoppel regarding the lawfulness of his removal. It could not be departed from in the absence of a material change of circumstances, and there has been no such change.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Although he accepts that a change in the law is in principle capable of amounting to a material change of circumstances, the appellant contends that the changes in approach to the weighing of the public interest in the removal of foreign criminals against the right to respect for private and family life under Article 8, brought about by the introduction into the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 of Part 5A by section 19 of the Immigration Act 2014, do not justify the Secretary of State making a fresh decision to deport him on essentially the same facts. </p>

The appellant, who was born in 1960, is a Nigerian national who first entered the UK on 9 June 1996. He became an overstayer in March 2000. In May 2004 he married a British citizen of Nigerian background. They remain married, and have three children, who are all British citizens. The eldest child was born in April 2005. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">On 23 May 2005, the appellant was convicted of conspiracy to defraud. Over a period of two years he had been responsible for providing false documentation to 27 EEA nationals to substantiate their false claims to have been working in the UK, as part of a wider conspiracy to deceive the Home Office into granting them residence documents. The scale of the operation made it a very serious matter. The offence was committed for financial gain. Although the appellant was not the principal organiser, he played an important role in the conspiracy, which the trial judge described as sophisticated, with a high degree of planning. He acknowledged the appellant’s previous good character and that he was a family man, but nevertheless passed what he described as a “deterrent sentence” of five years’ imprisonment. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The appellant used his time in prison well, obtaining various academic qualifications, and becoming a teaching assistant. Upon his release, the probation service described him as a “model prisoner” and assessed him as being at low risk of harm and reconviction. That assessment proved to be accurate. In the many years since his release on licence, he has not reoffended. His two younger children were born in 2008 and 2010 respectively. In order to enable his wife, who is self-employed, to work fulltime, he has taken on many of the caring responsibilities for the children. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">For reasons relating to the date of the appellant’s release from custody on licence, this was not a case to which the automatic deportation provisions of the UK Borders Act 2007 applied. The Secretary of State was not legally obliged to make a deportation order against the appellant, but had a discretion to do so under sections 3(5) and 5 of the Immigration Act 1971 if his deportation was deemed to be conducive to the public good. However, nothing turns on this. That discretion was exercised. For reasons that are immaterial to this appeal the initial decision to deport him, taken in February 2007, was successfully appealed. The relevant deportation decision that was challenged in the proceedings culminating in the decision of Upper Tribunal Judge Peter Lane (as he then was) which is said to give rise to an issue estoppel, (hereafter “the 2012 decision”) was made on 8 October 2009. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">A person who is liable to be deported cannot be removed from the jurisdiction if the removal would breach that person’s rights under the Convention. However, the existence of such a legal obstacle to removal does not alter the fact that he is a person whose presence is not conducive to the public good. In such circumstances, any deportation order remains valid unless and until it is revoked, and the revocation of the order will not necessarily preclude the Secretary of State from issuing a fresh one. </p>

If someone in his position cannot at present be deported because to do so would infringe his article 8 rights, and if indefinite leave to remain were thereupon to revive, he would remain irremovable if he turned his back on his family or they on him, as may not infrequently occur.</span>” </p>

His position remains precarious, because in future the legal obstacle to his removal may cease to exist. Whilst in many cases the legal obstacle will depend on the underlying facts, there is no reason in principle why it should not be removed by a change in legislation, policy, or both. </p>

Unlike the further amendments that were made to the Rules in 2014, those provisions did not apply irrespective of when the notice of intention to deport or the deportation order was served.  </p>

He acknowledged that the public interest in deporting someone who had committed an offence of this nature was very strong. However, having had regard to the appellant’s good behaviour in prison, his lack of reoffending and strong family life, he concluded that his removal from the jurisdiction would be a disproportionate interference with his rights under Article 8, because his wife and children would not accompany him to Nigeria. He declined to speculate on whether the outcome would have been the same had the appeal been determined under the 2012 Rules. However, he presciently observed that it was “<span style="font-style:italic">necessary to emphasise that my decision in this appeal is not to be taken by the appellant or his family as any permanent adjudication of the appellant’s ability to resist deportation from the United Kingdom</span>”. </p>

On 24 May 2014, the appellant sought further leave to remain on Article 8 grounds.  Whilst that application was pending, on 28 July 2014, s.19 of the Immigration Act 2014 came into force. The regulation that brought s.19 (and thus Part 5A of the 2002 Act) into force contained no transitional provisions. On the same date, corresponding changes to the 2012 Immigration Rules took effect, but it is unnecessary to consider them separately, since they replicate the approach mandated by the statute. The version of the Immigration Rules brought into force in 2014 expressly stipulates that the provisions of Part 5A of the 2002 Act (which include sections 117A-117D) apply to all appeals heard on or after 20 July 2014, irrespective of when the application or immigration decision was made. </p>

In the case of a foreign criminal who has been sentenced to a period of imprisonment of 4 years or more, s.117C(6) provides that the public interest requires deportation unless there are very compelling circumstances, over and above the two specific exceptions set out in subsections (4) and (5) of s.117C (which replicate those described in the 2014 Immigration Rules).  </p>

Moreover, the amendments to the 2002 Act came into force on the same date, and s.117C(6) provided that in the case of a foreign criminal who had been sentenced to a period of imprisonment of at least four years, the public interest required deportation unless there are very compelling circumstances over and above those described in Exceptions 1 and 2, which reflect the provisions of para 399 of the Rules.

The Secretary of State could not avoid the consequences of those decisions by relying on a change in the law brought about by the coming into force of ss117A-117C of the 2002 Act. Unless there was some new factor which justified making a deportation order, it was unlawful to rely upon the same material that had already been considered and rejected in the 2011 and 2012 Tribunal decisions. </p>

The second is whether in the circumstances it is open to the Secretary of State to make a deportation order in respect of that offender. The fact that there was a legal obstacle to the deportation of the offender in 2012 did not prevent the Secretary of State from deciding that his conviction rendered his deportation conducive to the public good.

In that decision, the Upper Tribunal judge said that “<span style="font-style:italic">if the elections period passes and violence abates and the position is as per CM </span>[the relevant country guidance case] <span style="font-style:italic">the Secretary of State will be able to reconsider her position.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">There is yet another reason why this appeal must fail, which did not arise in <span style="font-style:italic">MA (Pakistan)</span>. This is the aspect of the case to which I referred at the beginning of this judgment as having a wider practical importance in the field of immigration. The appellant has raised arguments in these judicial review proceedings which he could and should have raised before the FtT and the Upper Tribunal on the substantive appeal against the 2016 decision. No good reason has been put forward for the failure to advance them earlier. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The way in which the appellant now puts his case undermines the premise upon which the Tribunal decided his human rights appeal (namely, that the Secretary of State was lawfully entitled to rely on the changes to the law in 2014 when making a fresh deportation decision after they came into force) and therefore amounts to a collateral attack upon the 2017 decision.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Although the doctrine of <span style="font-style:italic">res judicata</span> may not apply with its full rigour in immigration proceedings, the rule in <span style="font-style:italic">Henderson v Henderson </span>(1843) 3 Hare 100 does preclude an applicant from waiting until his appeal rights are exhausted, and then raising different legal arguments in a claim for judicial review of the same decision that was unsuccessfully appealed, or of a further decision taken to implement or enforce it, in an attempt to delay or prevent his lawful removal from the jurisdiction. Irrespective of the merits of the new arguments, that is an abuse of the process and the message needs to go out that this type of abuse will not be tolerated. The appellant is not entitled to have endless bites of the same cherry. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Matters would be different if fresh evidence came to light, or the underlying factual circumstances had changed in a material respect, but that is the sort of scenario that would generally be covered by Rule 353 (and even in a private law context might justify departure from the full rigour of an issue estoppel). In this case, the Secretary of State correctly decided that the test for a fresh claim under that Rule was not met. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Ms Broadfoot explained that the appellant had been served with a notice under s.120 of the 2002 Act  (in conjunction with the setting of a new removal window) and that document invited him to tell the Secretary of State if he had new reasons for wishing to remain in the United Kingdom or grounds on which he should not be removed from the United Kingdom. However, that was not an invitation to reformulate the arguments that had already been rejected, or to use new legal arguments to attempt to re-argue the merits of the issues that the Tribunal had already determined against him. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Ms Broadfoot contended, as Ms Revill had contended before Choudhury J, that there were special circumstances why the rule in <span style="font-style:italic">Henderson v Henderson</span> should not apply. She submitted that this was an Article 8 case, and the United Kingdom would be in breach of its international obligations under the Convention if in fact the removal of the appellant were a disproportionate interference with his and his family’s Article 8 rights. However, human rights claims are subject to the same rules of procedure as any other claim, whether raised in a full appeal or by way of judicial review. Once those rights have been finally adjudicated upon by a competent tribunal or Court,  there is no reason why an individual in this particular type of case should be able to re-open the issue and run new arguments in circumstances in which another person would not, merely by dint of the fact that Article 8 is engaged. Choudhury J pointed out that any claimant seeking leave to remain based on personal family circumstances would be relying on Article 8. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">It would undermine the whole of the Tribunal system if litigants relying on Article 8 or other Convention rights were allowed, as a matter of course, to exhaust their rights of appeal and then bring a fresh indirect challenge by way of judicial review raising points that could and should have been argued before the Tribunal. </p>
