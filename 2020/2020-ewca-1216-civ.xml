There is no appeal against the findings of contempt. Mr Hussain contends that the judge had no power to impose a sanction of imprisonment for those contempts by virtue of section 4 of the Debtors Act 1869. In the alternative Mr Hussain contends that the judge had no power to impose the coercive part of the term (four months) as distinct from the punitive part (eight months). In the further alternative Mr Hussain contends that the sentence is manifestly excessive. At the time of the hearing before this Court Mr Hussain had only just started serving his sentence, having been arrested the night before. </p>

He was the tenant of an apartment owned by the Respondents (“the Vaswanis”) at 3 Riverlight Quay, London SW8 5BF (“the Apartment”). The rent reserved by the tenancy agreement was £1,950 per week. Mr Hussain ceased paying rent in January 2019. On 14 March 2019 the Vaswanis served notice to quit, but Mr Hussain failed to do so. On 1 May 2019 the Vaswanis brought possession proceedings. On 2 October 2019 District Judge Parker sitting in the County Court at Wandsworth made an order requiring Mr Hussain to give the Vaswanis possession of the Apartment on or before 16 October 2019 and to pay the Vaswanis £61,150 for rent appears and occupation rent of £277.80 per day from 23 September 2019 until he gave possession of the Apartment to the Vaswanis. DJ Parker refused permission to appeal. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">On 14 October 2019 Mr Hussain filed an appellant’s notice seeking permission to appeal and a stay of execution. On 28 October 2019 Judge Lethem refused permission to appeal the money judgment, but listed the application for a stay of the possession order for a hearing which was subsequently fixed for 11 December 2019 and the application for permission to appeal that order for a hearing which was fixed for a date in February 2020. On 7 November 2009 the Vaswanis obtained a warrant of possession which was to be executed on 7 January 2020. Mr Hussain did not attend the hearing on 11 December 2019, having unsuccessfully sought an adjournment beforehand. In his absence Judge Lethem dismissed the application for a stay. </p>

Judge Lethem did not find his reasons credible and dismissed the application to set aside the order of 11 December 2019. Mr Hussain told Judge Lethem, however, that he was able and willing to pay the rent arrears, which the judge calculated to be not less than £92,500, in full three working days after being given details of the account to which payment should be made. Not only did Mr Hussain state this in a witness statement, but also he confirmed it orally on affirmation before the judge. Moreover, he told the judge that he had access to £92,500 worth of funds which were being held in an account in the Isle of Man. The judge gave Mr Hussain a warning as to the potential consequences of perjury before Mr Hussain gave this evidence. On Mr Hussain giving an undertaking “to pay to an account nominated by [the Vaswanis] the sum of £92,500 within 4 working days of notification” irrespective of the outcome of his application or the appeal, Judge Lethem adjourned the application for a stay to be heard on short notice to the Vaswanis on 6 January 2020. Again, the judge gave him a warning as to the potential consequences of breaching that undertaking. </p>

On 6 January 2020 Mr Hussain attended court and informed Judge Lethem that the money had been paid. In support of this he produced a letter from Kilimanjaro Capital Management Ltd (“Kilimanjaro”) to himself dated 6 January 2020 stating that Kilimanjaro had historically been liable for payment of the rent on the Apartment, that it agreed to pay the sum of £92,500 and it expected the funds to reach the nominated account in short order and in any event within four working days. </p>

As a condition of doing so, however, Judge Lethem required and accepted a further undertaking from Mr Hussain, namely to “pay monies to [the Vaswanis] for use and occupation at the rate of </p>

Mr Hussain contended that the County Court did not have jurisdiction to deal with the fourth ground, and only the High Court did. Judge Lethem accepted this and struck out the application so far as it concerned the fourth ground. Mr Hussain also contended that the first three grounds were precluded by section 4 of the Debtors Act 1869. Judge Lethem rejected this contention. Mr Hussain did not appeal against Judge Lethem’s refusal to strike out the first three grounds. Mr Hussain’s advocate explained to this Court that Mr Hussain now accepts that the Debtors Act did not preclude the court from finding that he was in contempt of court, although he maintains that it does prevent the court from imposing a sanction of imprisonment.  </p>

Mr Hussain’s second ground is that, even if a punitive term of imprisonment can be imposed, a coercive term cannot. Mr Hussain’s third ground is that a term of 12 months is manifestly excessive. </p>

In addition to the six exceptions listed in section 4, section 5 of the Act empowers courts in certain types of cases to commit to prison for a term not exceeding six weeks any person who defaults on the payment of a debt due pursuant to a court order where it is proved that the person in question has or has had the means to pay the debt. </p>

The object of the Act was to prevent the imprisonment of persons for nonpayment of ordinary debts. No doubt the words used in the Act are very wide; but we must consider what was really meant by the payment of a sum of money. This order was not for the payment of a sum of money to the respondent; nor was it simply an order for the appellant to pay a sum of money into court; but there was an alternative, he was either to pay the money or to give a bond. It was argued that the mention of the bond was only subsidiary to the order for payment of the money, that the order was in effect simply an order to pay the money. I do not take that view.

If the appellant had been ordered to pay the money to the receiver of the Court in discharge of an obligation to which he had been declared liable, that might be different.

Nevertheless, he said that the object of the Act was to prevent imprisonment for non-payment of “ordinary debts” and section 4 had to be construed in that light. Moreover, he went on to say that an order to give security was not within section 4. Lindley LJ held that depositing money into court by way of security was not a payment of money within section 4.

In the interpleader proceedings the master made an order directing the sheriff to sell the goods and pay Mr Townend. The order concluded with the words “[Mr Buckley] undertaking to make good any deficiency on sale”. The goods were sold and there was a deficiency of £139 odd. The master then ordered Mr Buckley to pay that sum to Mr Townend within four days. When Mr Buckley did not do so, Mr Townend applied for an order for committal. Bruce J made the order.

There is however no difference between an order to pay money made in pursuance of an undertaking and any other order to pay a sum of money. It is true that the undertaking is the original ground of the liability, but attachment is never granted except for disobedience of an order to do or abstain from doing some specific thing. Here the only order that could be made in pursuance of the undertaking is to pay the money. The words of the Debtors Act, 1869 (32 &amp; 33 Vict. c. 62), s. 4, shew that under such circumstances, if the case does not come within any of the exceptions mentioned, there can be no imprisonment for default in payment, for the money is due as a debt.” </p>

Although this authority was not the subject of oral submissions from either advocate, it is perhaps the closest to the present case. Mr Cotton brought proceedings against Mr Heyl and a company which were compromised on the terms of a Tomlin order which contained an undertaking by Mr Heyl to pay Mr Cotton £1,000 forthwith and £4,000 out of the first monies received by or on behalf of Mr Heyl from the sale or licensing of certain patents. At that time, Mr Cotton was aware that Mr Heyl had already disposed of half of his interest in the patents. The £1,000 was duly paid. Subsequently Mr Heyl sold the remaining half of his interest for £10,000 payable in stages, but failed to pay Mr Cotton the sum of £4,000. Mr Cotton applied for an order for committal alternatively leave to issue a writ of attachment against Mr Heyl. Luxmoore J held that the undertaking was caught by section 4, but that the exception contained in subsection (3) applied, although he refused the order sought on a different ground (namely that no time for payment had been specified). </p>

Roberts</span> [1903] 2 Ch 312. In that case the defendant gave an undertaking as also did the plaintiff ‘to pay all sums of money which shall be received by them in respect of the matters in dispute in this action to the credit of the partnership account of the plaintiff and defendant with [certain banks].’ … The learned judge decided that that case was not within any exception to the Debtors Act, 1869. The undertaking in fact was merely to pay into a joint account to await the decision of the court, and with all possible respect to the learned judge it is a little difficult to see how this was an order for payment of money covered by the Debtors Act at all. Indeed the decision hardly seems to be in accord with what was said by the Court of Appeal in the case of <span style="font-style:italic">Bates v. Bates</span>. [He proceeded to quote from the judgment of Lindley LJ.] I am satisfied in the present case that there has been a breach of an undertaking which is within the Debtors Act, 1869, s. 4.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It appears from this that Luxmoore J considered that an undertaking to pay money to a party was to be distinguished from an undertaking to pay money into court or into a joint account by way of security. Thus far his reasoning is clear and persuasive. It remains the case, however, that he did not give any positive reasons for concluding that an undertaking to pay money to a party was caught by section 4 unless one of the exceptions applied. In my view the most likely explanation is that, on the facts of the case, the undertaking appears to have been precisely equivalent to an order to pay the sums in question. </p>

The plaintiff’s marriage had been dissolved and her former husband was ordered to pay her maintenance at a specified rate. The husband subsequently filed evidence that he was unable to comply with that order but offered to undertake to pay one-third of his income to the plaintiff. An order was made in 1939 in those terms, but there was no recital of consent by the plaintiff or other indication that the undertaking was part of a contractual bargain between the parties. The husband remarried and later died. The plaintiff claimed against the husband’s executrix, his second wife, an account in respect of arrears of maintenance payable under the 1939 order. Buckley J dismissed the claim on the ground that an undertaking to the court did not confer any personal right or remedy on any other party and that, since there was no evidence of any collateral contract between the parties which might have given rise to a debt recoverable at law, the plaintiff had no cause of action against the husband or his estate for any arrears. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.00in;text-indent:0.00in">“[The 1939 order] contained an undertaking given by the deceased to the court to pay one-third of his income to the plaintiff, but such an undertaking has not, in my judgment, the same effect as an order to pay. An order to pay may be enforced in the same manner as a judgment; R.S.C., Ord. 42, r. 24 … An undertaking, however, is not an order. It is true that an undertaking to do or abstain from doing something other than payment of money may have the same effect as a mandatory or a restrictive injunction; for a breach of such an undertaking, like a breach of an injunction, exposes the culprit to the risk of imprisonment or possibly of sequestration or a fine. These are penal sanctions aimed at enforcing compliance with either a promise made to the court or an order of the court, as the case may be. They are not remedies the purpose of which is to compensate some other party for damage he has suffered as the result of the breach or for recovering any property or enforcing any right of his. In most cases, at any rate, an order to pay money is of a wholly different character and produces quite different results from an undertaking given to the court to pay something. In the first place an order to pay money is most usually, though not always, a consequence of the person to be paid having established a right to payment of the sum in question. The order having once been made, the court would not revoke or vary it. Where, on the other hand, no order for payment has been made but an undertaking has been given to the court to make a payment, the court could at any time upon good cause being shown release or modify the obligation under the undertaking. Secondly, any order for payment to which R.S.C., Ord. 42, r. 24, applies may be enforced by the party who has obtained it in the same manner as a judgment to the like effect. He could, for instance, recover the sum by means of levying an execution or attaching a debt. But an undertaking could not be enforced by such means. The only sanction for breach of an undertaking would be the imprisonment of the culprit or sequestration of his assets or a fine on the ground of his contempt of court. An undertaking given to the court, unless the circumstances are such that it has some collateral contractual operation between the parties concerned, confers no personal right or remedy upon any other party. The giver of the undertaking assumes thereby an obligation to the court but to nobody else.” </p>

I disagree. The first task is to construe the undertaking. As I have pointed out, it was given in circumstances where Mr Jones had assured the court that the funds drawn down under the facility were sitting in a separate account with Hambros and that those funds were available to be transferred to Dragonfly (subject only to there being any problem arising from the terms of the facility itself). In my judgment, the undertaking to ‘procure’ that the facility was discharged is to be understood as an undertaking to procure that the funds so described would be transferred to Dragonfly. There is no question, therefore, of Mr Jones being required to “pay” a debt which he owed, nor of paying anything from his own funds. Ms Felix made much of the point that the claimant would no doubt have been content if <span style="font-style:italic">any</span> money had been procured by Mr Jones, including from his own funds. I suspect that is correct, but there is an important difference between what the claimant would have been content with and what the undertaking, properly construed, required.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I accept this submission. As <span style="font-style:italic">Bates v Bates</span> makes clear, section 4 must be purposively construed. As Cotton LJ stated, its purpose is to prevent imprisonment for non-payment of ordinary debts. Thus, as the authorities make clear, it does not apply to orders or undertakings requiring the provision of security, whether way of payment into court or an appropriate bank account. I shall assume for present purposes that Luxmoore J was correct to decide in <span style="font-style:italic">Cotton v Heyl</span> that section 4 applies to an undertaking to pay money to a party which is otherwise precisely equivalent to an order to pay money to that party. I agree with Zacaroli J in <span style="font-style:italic">Discovery v Jirehouse</span>, however, that it is necessary not only to construe the undertaking, but also to take into account the context in which, and the purpose for which, it was given. In the present case, as counsel for the Vaswanis pointed out, Mr Hussain gave the undertakings in order first to establish a change of circumstances which would open the door to a reconsideration of the refusal of a stay and secondly to persuade the court to exercise its discretion in his favour by granting a stay. Thus the undertakings were the price Mr Hussain paid in order to obtain court orders in his favour and adverse to the Vaswanis. In such circumstances it is vital that the court should be able properly to enforce undertakings given to it. Mr Hussain did not comply with his undertakings. True it is that the non-compliance manifested itself in a failure to pay money to the Vaswanis, but in the circumstances that was not a failure to pay an ordinary debt. On the contrary, it was a failure to honour extra obligations to the court which Mr Hussain assumed, over and above the ordinary debts he owed, for the purposes of obtaining advantages in the proceedings. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Finally, I should address two remaining points. First, if (contrary to my conclusion) section 4 applies, I do not accept counsel for the Vaswanis’ alternative argument that the exception in subsection (3) applies. Mr Hussain’s evidence is that he was a beneficiary of the discretionary trust. There is no evidence that he was a fiduciary in respect of the monies in question. Counsel’s attempt to argue that he must have become a fiduciary because he was an undischarged bankrupt was imaginative but not persuasive. There was nothing to stop Kilimanjaro paying the Vaswanis on behalf of Mr Hussain, and as counsel for the Vaswanis himself submitted that would have amounted to compliance with the undertakings. </p>

We consider that a similar approach should be adopted when—as in this case—a court is sentencing for contempt of court of the kind which involves one or more breaches of an order of the court. The court should first consider (as a criminal court would do) the culpability of the contemnor and the harm caused, intended or likely to be caused by the breach of the order. In this regard, aggravating or mitigating factors which are likely to arise for consideration will often include some of those identified by Popplewell J in the <span style="font-style:italic">Asia Islamic Trade Finance Fund</span> case (see para 32 above). Having determined the seriousness of the case, the court must consider whether a fine would be a sufficient penalty.

As the Court noted in <span style="font-style:italic">FCA v McKendrick</span> at [47], “it is the sentence actually imposed which must be outside the range reasonably open to the judge if an appeal is to succeed”. Thus the question is whether a sentence of 12 months was manifestly excessive for the contempts found proved.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Nevertheless, it is pertinent to consider how the judge arrived at the figure of 12 months. As noted above, he took as his starting point a sentence of 18 months. In arriving at this starting point, he took into account the following factors: (i) Mr Hussain had had no intention of honouring the undertakings when he gave them; (ii) Mr Hussain had failed to reveal crucial information concerning the source of the funds and his status as an undischarged bankrupt at the hearings on 2 and 6 January 2020; (iii) Mr Hussain had engineered the situation to achieve the end he wanted; (iv) there was an element of premeditation in Mr Hussain’s approach to the court; (v) Mr Hussain had given false evidence and thus had set out to deceive the court; (vi) Mr Hussain had been warned by the judge before giving oral evidence and before giving the first undertaking and thus could have been in no doubt as to the seriousness of the situation and the potential consequences; (vii) as a result the Vaswanis were considerably out of pocket (although the judge rightly excluded from consideration the consequences which arose after 20 February 2020 due to the stay on enforcement of the possession order which was imposed due to the Covid-19 pandemic); (viii) the sums in question remained unpaid without justification and thus the breaches remained unremedied; and (ix) Mr Hussain had not pleaded guilty to the charges, nor had he demonstrated any contrition or remorse. Overall, the judge’s assessment was that this was “a particularly egregious breach of undertakings, particularly bearing in mind the circumstances in which the undertakings were given”. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Hussain’s advocate submitted that a starting point of 18 months was plainly excessive given that only two counts of contempt were proved, the contempts simply consisted of a failure to pay money and that 18 months was close to the maximum of 24 months permitted. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">There is nothing in the point about the number of counts. The judge correctly considered each count separately and imposed the same sentence for each, to run concurrently. What matters is not the number of counts, but their gravity. It is true that the breaches comprised a failure to pay money, but as the judge explained there were considerable aggravating circumstances. As for 18 months being close to the maximum, the judge expressly acknowledged this. I agree that it is on the high side, but given all the circumstances identified by the judge I am not persuaded that it was outside the reasonable range of starting points. In any event, as I have already pointed out, it is the final sentence that matters. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">As stated above, Judge Lethem discounted the sentence to 12 months. This was partly to reflect Mr Hussain’s mitigation that he was previously of good character, the effect of incarceration upon someone in his position, the effect on his future earning ability and, in particular, the fact that Mr Hussain suffers from diabetes and high blood pressure. In addition, the judge took into account the guidance given by the Sentencing Counsel on 23 June 2020 and in <span style="font-style:italic">R v Manning</span> [2020] 4 WLR 777 on sentencing during the Covid-19 pandemic to the effect that the impact of a custodial sentence is likely to be heavier at present than it would otherwise be.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Hussain’s advocate submitted that a greater discount was required, given in particular that Mr Hussain was vulnerable to Covid-19.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It is also relevant to take into account the fact that, as I have already mentioned more than once, Judge Lethem apportioned the 12 months sentence into a punitive element of eight months and a coercive element of four months, thus enabling Mr Hussain to seek remission of the latter part if he purges his contempt. </p>
