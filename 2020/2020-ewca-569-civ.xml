Logfret’s appeal to the First Tier Tribunal was allowed, but this was reversed on HMRC’s appeal to the Upper Tribunal.  On this further appeal Logfret was represented by Mr David Bedenham and HMRC by Ms Jessica Simor QC and Ms Joanna Vicary.  I am grateful to them all for their clear and helpful submissions, both written and oral. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Excise duty is payable on tobacco and alcohol products, and on some energy products.  In principle, duty is payable when excise goods enter the European Union or when they come into existence within a Member State.  However, they may be kept in bond, without the payment of duty, until they are released for consumption.  They may be transported within or between Member States under duty suspension arrangements.  Given that rates of duty are not the same in all Member States, it matters not only when but also where liability to pay the duty arises.  For that reason a consistent scheme for the allocation of liability for the duty within the European Union is essential.  Given also that there is a high risk of fraud in relation to excise duty, the operation and regulation of the system of suspension of duty and of the movement of goods under a duty suspension arrangement requires a comprehensive regulatory and administrative system.  This came to be provided by a computerised electronic system, the Excise Management and Control System (EMCS).  The regulatory provisions were set out in Council Directive 2008/118/EC (the Directive).  This was transposed into UK law by, among other provisions, the Excise Goods (Holding, Movement and Duty Point) Regulations 2010 (the HMDP Regulations), but for most purposes it is only necessary to refer in this judgment to the Directive.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">One requirement of the system is a guarantee of “the risks inherent in the movement under suspension of excise duty”.  Logfret contracted with a consignor to carry consignments of alcohol products from a bonded warehouse in the UK to bonded warehouses in other Member States.  It did not undertake the carriage itself, however, but sub-contracted that task.  In addition, it gave the required guarantee as regards the eventual liability to excise duty in respect of the goods, wherever and whenever that liability might arise. </p>

It is not suggested that Logfret was a party to, or had any knowledge of, the circumstances in which any of the goods went astray.  The question is whether, in the given circumstances, the relevant legislation imposes liability on Logfret under its guarantee.  This depends on the correct interpretation of the European legislation governing excise duty and, in particular, the movement of excise goods under duty suspension arrangements. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Consignors and consignees of excise goods under duty suspension arrangements must have been authorised for the purpose by the relevant competent authorities, and are referred to in the Directive as “registered” consignors and consignees: see Article 4(9) and (10).  The consignor of excise goods which are to be moved under a duty suspension arrangement must complete and submit to the competent authority in the Member State of dispatch through the EMCS an Electronic Administrative Document (EAD) with details of the consignor and consignee, the goods, the transporter, the vehicle registration, expected journey time and guarantor.  The EMCS generates a unique Administrative Reference Code (ARC) for the movement.  The goods must move with the ARC which can be presented to relevant authorities during the movement.  The consignor receives the validated EAD and the authorities of the Member State of the destination also receive the EAD through the EMCS, which is then passed on to the consignee.  Authorised warehouse keepers and registered consignors and consignees have direct access to the EMCS, but a carrier or guarantor such as Logfret does not have such access.  When the goods are dispatched, they will travel with a copy of the ARC.  On arrival at the tax warehouse (the term used in the Directive for what is commonly known as a bonded warehouse) which is the specified destination, the consignee is to check the goods and confirm their arrival through the EMCS, submitting a report of receipt, which it is bound to do within 5 days of receipt.  The authorities in the destination state receive the report of receipt and validate it.  The validated report of receipt is then received directly by the consignee and by the authorities in the state of dispatch, and via those authorities also by the consignor.  Once a report of receipt has been issued and validated then the duty suspended movement has come to an end.  If the movement comes to an end in an orderly and regular manner, all the goods dispatched having been confirmed as having been received at the tax warehouse which was the specified destination, then the liability of the guarantor comes to an end. <span style="font-weight:bold">The essential facts </span></p>

They then told Logfret that these three Movements were still open on the EMCS and invited Logfret to provide information, failing which it would be assessed to the duty as guarantor.  In June 2014 Ess Key told Logfret that it had never received any deliveries from Medway and that the stamped CMRs were forgeries, and that the French authorities had found false Ess Key stamps in the possession of MT Manutention, and the signatures were forged.  Logfret gave HMRC such information as it had to prove that the goods had been properly delivered including CMR documents, but HMRC did not accept that this material was sufficient to prove that the goods had been delivered to the specified tax warehouse of destination. </p>

To add to the uncertainty surrounding the events, the Belgian authorities later told HMRC that Ess Key had carried out fictitious receipts and deliveries and its warehouse authorisation had been withdrawn in August 2014.  All of the other substituted consignees were the subjects of investigation by their own national authorities, being suspected of excise fraud.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Article 20 provides, so far as relevant, at paragraph (1) that the movement of excise goods under a duty suspension arrangement begins when the goods leave the tax warehouse of dispatch.  According to paragraph (2) such a movement ends, in the case of a movement from one tax warehouse to another (which is what was supposed to happen in all four cases now relevant), when the consignee has taken delivery of the goods.  Article 7(4) deals with the total destruction of the goods, so that does not concern us.  Under Article 7(1) the basic rule is that excise duty is chargeable at the time, and in the Member State, of release for consumption.  Release for consumption is defined in Article 7(2).  The instance relevant to the present case is Article 7(2)(a): “the departure of excise goods, including irregular departure, from a duty suspension arrangement”.  Thus, if goods move under a duty suspension arrangement and safely reach the specified tax warehouse of destination then, subject to the issue of the time taken, the movement ends on receipt by the consignee.  But they may be released for consumption by an irregular departure from the duty suspension arrangement rather than by arriving at their destination as intended, for example if they are delivered to a different destination, or if they are stolen from the transporting vehicle. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Article 10 deals with the consequences of irregularities and lays down the basic rule that the release for consumption (which gives rise to a charge to duty under Article 7) occurs in the Member State where the irregularity occurred.  Thus, if the goods travelled properly out of the United Kingdom but were diverted from their proper course and custody in France, then duty is chargeable in France.  However, it may not be possible to determine where the irregularity occurred.  That case is covered first by Article 10(2).  This deals with the case “where an irregularity has been detected during a movement of excise goods under a duty suspension arrangement”, but it is not possible to determine where the irregularity occurred.

They held that this Article does not mean that non-delivery within four months constituted an irregularity: paragraphs 133-4.  It followed, among other things, that Article 10(4) and the equivalent regulation did not apply to Movement 4: paragraphs 141 to 146.  They held that a movement continued until it came to an end in accordance with Article 20(2), so that detection of an irregularity at any time up to and including, but not after, the moment of receipt would constitute detection during a movement for the purposes of Article 10(2) and (4).  They also considered the facts as regards Movements 3 and 4 and concluded that irregularities occurred in France as regards both Movements: paragraphs 147 to 156.  They did not deal with any point arising under Article 10(5).  Their decision is at [2017] UKFTT 0484 (TC). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">On HMRC’s appeal to the Upper Tribunal, the UT (Mr Justice Morgan and Judge Jonathan Richards) held that Article 10(4) has the effect that if goods have not arrived within four months there is a deemed irregularity, such that liability arises in the Member State of dispatch unless, by the end of the four months, it can be shown where the irregularity occurred, in which case Article 10(1) applies.  They also held that the second paragraph of Article 10(4) gives the person in the position of Logfret one month in which to show that which the first paragraph refers to, that is to say that the movement had ended in accordance with Article 20(2) within the four month period, or the place where the irregularity had occurred.  As regards the nature of the evidence which can be relied on to show that the goods have arrived at their destination, for the purposes of the second paragraph of Article 10(4), the UT held that it must be evidence that has been endorsed by a relevant tax authority in a Member State.  As regards Article 10(5) the UT said that the conclusions of the FTT that irregularities occurred in France could not cause the paragraph to apply since it was reached and expressed well after the end of the three year period.  Their decision is at [2018] UKUT 0422 (TCC). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">On the appeal to this court, Mr Bedenham for Logfret (who had not appeared below) argued that the UT was wrong on all these points.  He contended that Article 10(4) cannot apply if the goods have in fact arrived at their destination, even if more than four months after dispatch, that a movement only comes to an end under Article 20(2) so that any detection of an irregularity before that date is a detection during a movement, that under the second paragraph of Article 10(4) it is sufficient to show that the goods have reached their destination by the end of the extra month, and that there is no limit to the evidence that may be used to show such arrival.  He also argued that because HMRC was in possession of evidence which showed that an irregularity occurred in France within the three years relevant under Article 10(5), then that had been ascertained within the specified time. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in">goods.  However, in a typical case of diversion of the goods (of which Movements 1, 2 and 3 seem to be examples) the goods never do reach the consignee, so the end of the movement provided for in that Article will not occur.  Can it follow that the movement continues indefinitely?  That idea seems nonsensical.  Article 7(2)(a) provides that excise goods are released for consumption when they depart from a duty suspension arrangement, including on an irregular departure.  A regular departure following a movement will occur after delivery to the consignee.  An irregular departure is likely to prevent the goods ever reaching the consignee, and will give rise to an immediate charge to excise duty under Article 7(1).  Surely, if goods have departed from a movement under a duty suspension arrangement, the movement cannot be treated as still continuing?  Article 7 does not deal only with goods that are being or have been moved under a duty suspension arrangement.  In Article 7(3) which does relate to goods moving under such an arrangement, it deals with cases of regularity not irregularity.  But it seems to me that where all the excise goods comprised in a particular movement have departed irregularly from that movement, for example by being improperly removed from the relevant means of transport, that movement cannot be treated as still continuing.  The goods will never reach the intended destination, so Article 20(2) will never be satisfied, but the movement has, and must be treated as having, come to an end, at the moment of the departure of the goods from the duty suspension arrangement, which is also the moment at which duty becomes chargeable.  I agree with paragraph 44 of the UT’s decision on this point. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">He argued that Article 20 should be taken as intended to achieve the clarity of which the paragraph speaks, and should therefore be treated as comprehensive in defining both the beginning and the end of a movement.  It should not be legitimate to look to any other provision of the Directive to identify the moment at which a movement comes to an end.  As to that, the Article does define the beginning and end of a movement if all goes as it should.  But manifestly it does not deal with the case of an irregularity, at any rate not one which results in the release of the goods for consumption.  For that one has to refer to the provisions which do deal with such a situation, and they are to be found in Article 7.  Moreover, the provisions of Article 10(6), which show what is meant by irregularity in that Article, provide for the case of a movement coming to an end otherwise than under Article 20(2).  The phrase “a situation occurring during a movement of excise goods under a duty suspension arrangement … due to which a movement, or part of a movement, of excise goods has not ended in accordance with Article 20(2)” does not refer to a case where the movement of the goods has not come to an end at all, but to one where it has come to an end otherwise than in accordance with Article 20(2). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Another important question is this: what is meant by the phrase in Article 10(2) “where an irregularity has been detected during a movement of excise goods under a duty suspension arrangement giving rise to their release for consumption”?  Such an irregularity means a departure of the goods from the duty suspension arrangement: see Article 7(2)(a).  For reasons just explained, this brings the movement to an end as regards the goods so departing.  In what circumstances could that irregularity be detected during the course of the movement?  The course of the movement does no doubt include the moment at which the movement ends, so that if the diversion of the goods were detected while it was happening this could be a detection during the course of the movement.  In any other circumstances, the detection must occur after the irregularity has occurred, and therefore after the movement has come to an end at least as regards the particular goods, but often as regards the entire consignment.  Article 10(2) itself shows that this must have been envisaged and provided for, because it speaks of an irregularity having been detected during a movement but of it being impossible to determine where the irregularity occurred.  Thus it is manifestly not concerned with the case where the irregularity is detected as it is happening, the guilty persons being caught red-handed, and it must include the case of detection after the event, by which time at least some, and in many cases all, of the goods have gone. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In my judgment the correct interpretation of this phrase, as was contended for by Miss Simor Q.C. for HMRC, is that the irregularity has to occur during the movement, which may include the case where it is the irregularity that brings the movement to an end, but the detection may occur later.  Otherwise the circumstances provided for in Article 10(2) could never occur.  The same applies to the similar words in Article 10(4).  That is supported by the wording of paragraph (11) of the Preamble, cited above (paragraph 15). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">On that basis, I turn to Article 10(4) and first to the question whether it is sufficient to show that the goods have arrived, albeit outside the four month period.  The opening words “Where excise goods moving under a duty suspension arrangement have not arrived at their destination” support the construction favoured by the FTT and argued for by Logfret.  However, as the UT pointed out, the Article also expressly contemplates that evidence may be produced, either under the first or the second paragraph, to show that the goods have in fact reached their destination so that the movement has ended as provided for by Article 20(2), having been received by the consignee within the four month period.  It must follow that it is not sufficient to show that they have arrived at the specified destination outside the four month period.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It is also relevant, though not decisive, that the consignor has to state the expected journey time when supplying the information which is to go into the EAD, and that this must not exceed a given number of days.  At the time of the Movements in issue the maximum was 92 days, i.e. three months.  The time limit has since then been reduced to between 15 and 45 days depending on the means of transport to be used for the journey.  The estimate given in each of the four cases with which we are concerned was 5 days.  The 92 day limit does not bind the consignor to achieve the delivery within that period but it does illustrate the timescale that was envisaged.  The journey could have been expected to take up to three months to complete, leaving another month within which to ensure that the delivery and receipt was properly documented on the EMCS. </p>

In the former case, by the end of the four months it will have been shown that there was in fact no relevant irregularity.  In the latter it will have been shown that there was an irregularity, what it was and where it occurred, so that Article 10(1) will apply and will determine in which Member State duty is chargeable.

He also relied on the regulation on the issue about the range of possible evidence.  On the first point, whether there is, in effect, a four month time limit for delivery, it seems to me that the same point is true of the regulation as of the Article, namely that both speak of the goods not having arrived at their destination, but they allow the person who would otherwise be liable for the duty to show, within the four month period (or within the extra month for a guarantor such as Logfret), that the goods have arrived at their destination.  That point is fatal to the contention that it is sufficient to show, in the case of Movement 4, that the goods were eventually shown as having arrived on the EMCS.  Under the regulation, just as under the Article, that fact is irrelevant, the recorded arrival being well after the end of the four month period. <span style="font-weight:bold">What evidence may be relevant under Article 10(4)? </span></p>

The other is of the place where an irregularity occurred, which would not be recorded through the EMCS and would require quite different evidence.  The relevance of this is that, when Logfret was told that the Movements had not been shown on EMCS as having been received at the destination warehouse, it gathered together and sent to HMRC such documentary material as it had, including CMR paperwork from the transport of the goods, which it said showed that the goods had been correctly carried to their destination and, together with the absence of any complaint of non-delivery by the consignee, might be taken as showing that all had been done properly as it should have been, apart from the failure of the consignee to file a report of receipt through EMCS. </p>

The equivalent passage in Regulation 81(3), dealing with the position of the person primarily liable for the duty, is even more brief and open: “satisfies the Commissioners”.  The equivalent to Article 28 is regulation 49.  Regulation 49(3) provides that a report of receipt (on the EMCS) is proof that the movement of goods referred to in the report has ended, as in Article 28(1).  Regulation 49(4) refers, without prejudice to 49(3), to an endorsement by the relevant authorities of the destination Member State to the effect that the goods have arrived as constituting proof that the movement of those goods has ended.  So this is the equivalent of Article 28(2).  These two regulations together are clearly intended to implement Articles 28 and 10(4) in UK law.

A guarantor in that position is granted a period of a month from being told, by the competent authorities of the Member State of dispatch, of the goods not having arrived.  This is to enable him to provide evidence either of the end of the movement in accordance with Article 20(2) or of the place where the irregularity occurred, that is to say of the same things as are allowed for in the first paragraph.  In the latter context the evidence has to be provided within the four months, so that the end of the movement must necessarily have occurred by the end of the four month period.  The question is whether, if the guarantor seeks to show that the movement has ended in accordance with Article 20(2), it must be shown to have happened by the end of the four month period, or can it be shown to have happened by the end of the extra month.  The question is hypothetical in the present case, on the basis of the conclusion expressed above as to the evidence by which it would have to be shown to have happened, since Logfret was not able to produce such evidence in respect of Movement 3 in any event, and although Movement 4 had ended in accordance with Article 20(2), that had occurred long after the end of the four month period. </p>

In Case C-395/00, <span style="font-style:italic">Cipriani</span> [2002] ECR I-11877, the European Court of Justice held that this violated the guarantor’s right of defence, and that accordingly the guarantor could not be made liable in such circumstances.

For Logfret Mr Bedenham submitted that this allows the guarantor hardly any scope for the exercise of a right of defence, and that it would be far more reasonable and fair to read the paragraph as allowing the guarantor a month in which not only to investigate the position but also to do something about it, and in particular to ensure that the goods did in fact arrive at the intended destination.  In practice that seems rather speculative, since if the goods have not arrived by four months after their dispatch, it is almost certain that they have already been diverted or have miscarried in such a way that they cannot realistically be recovered.  It may therefore be more likely that what the guarantor may be able to show is where the irregularity occurred, though even to do that may not be at all easy, within one month, if the irregularity is caused by fraud rather than by some accident. </p>

Absent such evidence, she argued, there is no occasion for the Article to be applied. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In the light of these provisions, if the point had been raised before the FTT it would have been relevant to consider the state of knowledge of HMRC on the point.  This might therefore have affected the evidence which HMRC chose to adduce before the FTT as the tribunal of fact and, more generally, the way in which the hearing before the FTT was conducted.  That being so, it would be wrong to allow Logfret to raise this point for the first time at this stage, on a second appeal.  It would offend against the long established principle that a new point will not be allowed to be raised on appeal if, had it been raised at the trial, the trial would or might have been conducted differently as regards the evidence adduced.  A recent example of the application of this principle is <span style="font-style:italic">Singh v Dass</span> [2019] EWCA Civ 360, where the point is stated by Haddon-Cave LJ at paragraph 17.  He drew support from a decision <span style="font-style:italic">Mullarkey v Broad</span>, [2009] EWCA Civ 2, in which I gave the principal judgment, with which Pill LJ and Moses LJ agreed.  In my judgment I observed that the grant of permission to appeal on a given ground of appeal does not, by itself, allow a new point to be taken despite this principle: paragraph 29.  I also said, at paragraph 49, that a party who seeks to advance a new case in circumstances of this kind bears a heavy burden of showing that the case could not have been conducted differently, in any material respect, as regards the evidence. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Because the point had not been raised before it, nothing that the FTT said in its decision was directed to the issues that might arise under Article 10(5), and what the UT said at paragraph 119 of their decision was, rightly and inevitably, expressed as unnecessary to their decision.  It seems to me clear that Logfret could not discharge the burden of showing that, if the point under Article 10(5) had been taken as a ground of appeal before the FTT, the case would not, or might not, have been conducted differently in any material respect as regards the evidence.  I would therefore dismiss this ground of the appeal on the basis that the point is not open to Logfret, not having been raised at the proper time on the appeal to the FTT.  That being so, it is unnecessary to express any concluded view on any point that might arise on the true construction and effect of Article 10(5) or regulation 82. </p>
