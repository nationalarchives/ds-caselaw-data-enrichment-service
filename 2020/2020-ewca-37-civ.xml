	    <p style="margin-left:0.99in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">In <span style="font-style:italic">TP (No. 1)</span> there were two grounds of challenge.  The first ground was rejected by Lewis J: see paras. 63, 71-72 and 80-81.  By that ground the challenge was to the new structure of entitlement under the Universal Credit scheme.  There is no cross-appeal in relation to that ground.  On the second ground, Lewis J found in favour of TP and AR in respect of the manner in which the scheme was implemented in the Universal Credit (Transitional Provisions) Regulations 2014 (“the Transitional Regulations”), in particular regulations 5 and 6.  He found those to be discriminatory and in breach of Article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights (“ECHR”), read with the right to peaceful enjoyment of possessions in Article 1 of the First Protocol (“A1P1”), which are among the Convention rights set out in Sch. 1 to the Human Rights Act 1998 (“HRA”).    The essential basis on which Lewis J held that the provisions were discriminatory is that they treat less favourably a person who moves to another local authority.  In those circumstances the Transitional Regulations do not permit a person to continue to claim Housing Benefit from a local authority.  Rather an application must be made to the Department for Work and Pensions (“DWP”) and not to the new local authority; and it must be for Universal Credit, which will include an element for housing costs.  The amount overall payable as an award of UC is less than what the person concerned would have received under the previous social security scheme (referred to in these proceedings as a “legacy” benefit).  Lewis J granted a declaration to the effect that the Article 14 rights of TP and AR had been breached: see para. 4 of his order dated 14 June 2018. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.99in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-style:italic">TP (No. 2)</span>, which came before Swift J, concerned new regulations which were made in January 2019.  In particular a new Regulation 4A was inserted into the Transitional Regulations by the Universal Credit (Transitional Provisions) (SDP Gateway) Amendment Regulations 2019 (“the SDP Gateway Regulations”).  The effect of these regulations was to prevent persons entitled to severe disability premium (“SDP”) at that date (or in the previous month) from making a claim to Universal Credit.  The Secretary of State also made the Universal Credit (Managed Migration Pilot and </p>

These introduced a new regulation 64 and Schedule 2 into the Transitional Regulations.  They conferred power on the Secretary of State to begin the process of what was called “managed migration” from legacy benefits to Universal Credit by way of a pilot scheme.  The Pilot Regulations permitted the Secretary of State to migrate up to 10,000 people under the pilot scheme by way of a “migration notice”.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.99in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">Amongst the measures which were introduced in this way was the introduction of a scheme of transitional payments for current claimants of Universal Credit who had been in receipt of legacy benefits and who are “severely disabled people”.  This measure was quashed by Swift J as being discriminatory and unlawful under Article 14 because it treated less favourably people who had “naturally” migrated to Universal Credit (whom Swift J called “the SDP natural migrant group”), who would receive fixed-rate transitional payments, than those who, as a result of Regulation 4A, were prevented from naturally migrating and would in due course receive transitional protection as “managed migrants” (whom Swift J referred to as “the Regulation 4A group”). </p>

This was discounted on the basis that it would in effect provide full transitional protection that would be available for managed migration claimants.  The view was taken that this would be contrary to the underlying policy of the move to UC.  It would also be unacceptably complex to deliver.  Calculating the value of any transitional protection payments would have to be performed clerically.

In early 2016, when they separated, TP was in receipt of Housing Benefit from the local authority and also the basic allowance of incomerelated support.  In October 2016, when TP became seriously ill, he moved to his parents’ home in Dorset and ceased to be in receipt of Housing Benefit but continued to receive the basic allowance.  On 13 December 2016 he also became eligible for SDP and EDP and his monthly income was £809.90.  In December 2016 TP returned to London to have access to a hospital providing specialist cancer care.  As he moved across local authority boundaries, he had to apply for Universal Credit and as a consequence he received £633.42 a month for non-housing related benefits, over £170 a month less than he would have received under the former system. </p>

The decision to pay a higher allowance to all persons with disability and not to pay additional premiums such as SDP and EDP was objectively justifiable as a decision of the legislature on a point of economic and social policy.

Lewis J held, at paras. 8991, that this was an “other status” within Article 14, relying, by way of analogy, on the approach of the Supreme Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Mathieson v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions</span> [2015] UKSC 47; [2015] 1 WLR 3250, at para. 22 (Lord Wilson JSC).

Lewis J had concluded that the distinction drawn in the Transitional Provisions Regulations constituted differential treatment based on status and was discriminatory.  On 31 July 2018 Lewis J made an Order in terms agreed by the parties, namely that back-payments would be made to TP and AR to make up the shortfall suffered since their migration to UC, and for future periodic payments also to be paid, equivalent to the difference between the legacy benefits payments and the current UC payments.  The Order stated that the periodic payments should continue “<span style="font-style:italic">… </span>until such time as the Universal Credit (Transitional Provisions) (Managed Migration) Regulations come into force ...”.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.99in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">Before this Court Mr Milford sought to argue that the suggested status in the present case was more analogous to the case of <span style="font-style:italic">Magee v United Kingdom</span> (2001) 31 EHRR 35.  That case concerned the right to a fair trial in Article 6 and, in particular, the right of access to a lawyer when a person is charged with a criminal offence.  The Court concluded that there had been a violation of Article 6: see para. 46 of its judgment.  The Court did not, however, find that there was a breach of Article 14: see para. 51.  The applicant argued that suspects arrested and detained in England and Wales under prevention of terrorism legislation could have access to a lawyer immediately and argued that that was not the position for a person like him in Northern Ireland.  At para. 50 of its judgment, the Court said: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.50in;margin-right:0.40in;text-indent:0.00in">“The Court recalls that Article 14 of the Convention protects against a discriminatory difference in treatment of persons in analogous positions in the exercise of the rights and freedoms recognised by the Convention and its Protocols.  It observes in this connection that in the constituent parts of the United Kingdom there is not always a uniform approach to legislation in particular areas.  Whether or not an individual can assert a right derived from legislation may accordingly depend on the geographical reach of the legislation at issue and the individual’s location at the time.  For the Court, in so far as there exists a difference in treatment of detained suspects under the 1988 Order and the legislation of England and Wales on the matters referred to by the applicant, that difference is not to be explained in terms of personal characteristics, such as national origin or association with a national minority, but on the geographical location where the individual is arrested and detained.  This permits legislation to take account of regional differences and characteristics of an objective and reasonable nature.  In the present case, such a difference does not amount to discriminatory treatment within the meaning of Article 14 of the Convention.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.99in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">In our view, the Court was not there saying that “geographical location” can never give rise to a “status” for the purpose of Article 14.  It was certainly not saying that residence in one part of a country rather than another cannot be a status.  Its analysis was not in terms based on the concept of status at all.  Further, and in any event, it concluded that there were objective and reasonable justifications for the difference in treatment in that case.  This, in our view, is readily explicable on the basis that there are different legal systems in the constituent parts of the UK.  There are also federal systems in the Council of Europe, such as the Federal Republic of Germany.  The Court was simply acknowledging the reality that there will be differences which exist in different legal systems within a state.  It does not follow from that simple fact that there is discrimination which is not objectively justified under Article 14. </p>

The Court concluded that there appeared to be no distinguishing criterion based on the personal status of the property owner: see para. 69.  Furthermore, at para. 70, the Court said that no discrimination was disclosed as a result of a particular date being chosen for the commencement of a new legislative regime and that differential treatment arising out of a legislative change is not discriminatory where it has a reasonable and objective justification in the interests of the good administration of justice.  The Court noted that the 1995 legislative amendments, which sought in effect to improve the situation of landowners in order to reach a balance between all the competing interests, by abolishing the regime which was in fact challenged by the applicants before the European Court, did not appear to be arbitrary or unreasonable in any way.  </p>

It is readily understandable and inevitable that legislation has to be brought into force at some point in time.  Some people will therefore not necessarily benefit or be caught by it, depending on the date when events occur in relation to them.  Without more, it is not possible to complain of such a distinction in treatment under Article 14.  Whether one analyses that as following from the fact that there is no relevant “status” or simply that there is a reasonable and objective justification for the difference in treatment created by the legislation is in the end immaterial.  The fundamental point is that the distinction in the present case is not analogous to the one in cases such as <span style="font-style:italic">Zammit</span>, which concern simply the date on which legislation is brought into force. </p>

In due course and in accordance with relevant secondary legislation at the time, the Secretary of State suspended the payment of DLA.  This was because the claimant had been an in-patient in a National Health Service hospital for more than 84 days.

They are now in receipt of cash payments which, overall, are significantly lower than the amount previously received. They are a potentially vulnerable group of persons as the Government in its own material recognises. On the material before me, there appears to have been no consideration of the desirability or justification for requiring the individual to assume the entirety of the difference between income related benefits under the former system and universal credit when their housing circumstances change and it is an appropriate moment to transfer them to universal credit. That is all the more striking given the Government’s own statements over a number of years that such persons may need assistance and that there was a need to define with precision the circumstances in which they would not receive such assistance.

Both groups comprise severely disabled persons; all of whom meet the criteria for payment of SDP (or would continue to meet those criteria but for natural migration). The simple fact of natural migration is not a satisfactory ground of distinction because the trigger conditions for natural migration are not indicative of any material change in the needs of the Claimants (or the other members of the SDP natural migration group), as severely disabled persons. The same point is sufficient to dispose of the further suggestion in Miss Young's witness statement that the Secretary of State considered the SDP natural migrants as being in materially the same position as new welfare benefits claimants (i.e. severely disabled persons presenting themselves to the welfare benefits system for the first time, after the implementation of Universal Credit). There is no logical foundation for that view; if there were a logical foundation for it, it would negate the rationale for regulation 4A of the Transitional Provisions Regulations.” </p>

We have summarised the evidence as to the policy background which was filed on behalf of the Secretary of State above.  In our view, it was not wrong in principle for the Secretary of State to consider that it would be difficult to calculate precisely the amount which needed to be given to an individual in the affected group of “natural migrants” to UC, because this would vary according to their particular circumstances.  Furthermore, it might be very difficult to trace changes of circumstances retrospectively.  That can be contrasted with the position of the “managed migrant” project, where the DWP would be operating the system prospectively and would therefore have knowledge of relevant circumstances.  For that reason it was permissible, in our view, for the Secretary of State to decide that an estimate should be made of the likely financial loss rather than to try to give complete transitional protection to each individual affected.  Accordingly, taking a fixed figure like £80 per month was not inherently unreasonable.   </p>

The reason for that significant difference was that no account was taken of the EDP element which someone would be losing.  It appears to us from the witness statement of Ms Young, at paras. 72-73, that the sole reason for that was the increased cost that would otherwise be incurred. </p>

I expect that the concern that lies behind the point at paragraph 64 of Miss Young's statement (and see also, paragraph 6.1 of the submission to Ministers, set out above, at paragraph 35), is that if something that looks like Transitional Protection is extended to the SDP natural migrant group, other natural migrants who have the benefit of no transitional provision at all, would attempt to piggy-back on that to found their own claims.

The premise for the argument would have to be that the piggy-back claims would be valid in law. I cannot see how it could be a defence to the claim of discrimination brought by the Claimants in this case, to say that it was necessary they be subjected to less favourable treatment to guard against the possibility that other, legally valid, claims might be made against the Secretary of State. <span style="font-style:italic">In any event</span>, I do not consider that any fear of piggy-back claims is realistic. Different treatment for both the SDP natural migrant group and the Regulation 4A group, as opposed to natural migrants generally, is explicable for the reasons highlighted by the House of Commons Select Committee. Those reasons are specific to the severely disabled who met the conditions for entitlement to SDP under the legacy benefits system. This was the position taken in the February 2018 Departmental presentation. <span style="font-style:italic">For the avoidance of doubt</span>, my reasoning in this judgment is directed solely to whether the distinction in treatment under the Transitional Provisions Regulations between (a) the SDP natural migrant group; and (b) the Regulation 4A group, is justified in law. No part of the reasoning in this judgment should be taken to suggest that if the Claimants’ case succeeds, the distinction that otherwise exists under the Secretary of State's policy between natural migrants and managed migrants, is legally invalid.”  (Emphasis added)</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.99in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">It will be seen from the words we have emphasised in that passage that the reasoning of Swift J was carefully structured in the alternative.  He concluded, first, that fear of piggy-back claims could not be a legally valid reason for discriminating against these Respondents.  We agree with him about that.  If others also had a legally valid claim, that would have to be considered on its own merits, but that cannot be a good reason why the legally valid claim for discrimination of these Respondents should fail.  Further and in any event, Swift J did not consider that the fear of piggy-back claims was “realistic”.  He said that the different treatment for both the SDP natural migrant group and the Regulation 4A group, as opposed to natural migrants more generally, was explicable for the reasons highlighted by the House of Commons Select Committee of 24 January 2018 (referred to at para. 30 of his judgment).  Swift J noted that those reasons were specific to the severely disabled people who met the conditions for entitlement to SDP under the previous benefits system. Finally, he made it clear, for the avoidance of doubt, that the reasoning in his judgment applied only to the difference in treatment between the two comparator groups that were before him and nothing else. </p>

The issue that has caused me most difficulty is the second ground of appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">TP (No 1)</span>, that is whether Lewis J was right to hold that the difference in treatment experienced by the Respondents was on the grounds of an ‘other status’ for the purposes of Article 14.  Lewis J stated at para. 89 that the differential treatment did not of itself arise out of disability because both the group of people who suffered the adverse financial consequences and the comparator group who did not were people who are severely disabled and meet the criteria for the SDP and EDP legacy benefits. The basis for the differential treatment was that the Respondents’ cohort had moved from one local authority area to another and the other group had either not moved house at all or had moved house within the local authority area.   </p>

A briefing note dated 25 October 2011 exhibited to Ms Young’s witness statement provided the Minister with a non-exhaustive list of changes in circumstances that could trigger a natural migration to Universal Credit.  These included moving out of work because of sickness, the birth of a first child, an out-of-work lone parent becoming a couple parent or where an out-of-work couple parent with a child under five becomes a lone parent.  In the case of the Respondents, the relevant action which resulted in a decision being made on a claim was their moving house across a local authority boundary because section 134 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 requires housing benefit to be funded and paid by the relevant local authority.   </p>

For every person who benefits from being chosen to move across early there is likely to be a corresponding person in otherwise identical circumstances who is disadvantaged by not moving early; every person who is disadvantaged by moving early will be able to point to someone in otherwise identical circumstances who benefits from not moving.  The wider question raised by the <span style="font-style:italic">TP (No 1)</span> appeal is how can the Secretary of State lawfully choose the early movers in a way that is compatible with the Article 14 rights both of those who are chosen and, in a case where the migrated person is better off, of those who have not been chosen.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.99in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">The Secretary of State has, it now appears, decided to operate two different trigger mechanisms for choosing who will migrate early from legacy benefits to Universal Credit. The first is the mechanism adopted by the Transitional Regulations which provides that people who make a new claim will move early.  The second is by the recent introduction of provisions for a managed migration pilot of 10,000 people in the Pilot Regulations.  The Pilot Regulations introduced the new Part 4 into the Transitional Regulations, empowering the Secretary of State at any time to issue a migration notice to a person who is entitled to an award of an existing benefit. The migration notice informs that person that all awards of legacy benefits to which they are entitled will terminate on a given date and that they will need to make a claim for Universal Credit by a deadline day.  Part 4 does not give any indication as to how the Secretary of State should choose which legacy benefit recipients will be the first 10,000 to receive a migration notice.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.99in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Milford argues that the fact that the Respondents have moved across a local authority boundary only has relevance here because of the choice that the Secretary of State has made that people who make a fresh claim for a benefit have to make a claim for Universal Credit and not for a legacy benefit.  Mr Milford argues that it cannot be right that simply being a person who fulfils the criterion for the conferring or withdrawing of a benefit is sufficient to confer a status for the purposes of Article 14, thereby imposing on the Secretary of State an obligation to provide an objective justification for the choice of criterion.  It cannot be the case that every time a statute imposes a disadvantage on someone who meets specified criteria, that person would have an ‘other status’ for the purposes of Article 14 thus enabling them to assert that they are disadvantaged as compared with persons who did not meet the specified criteria.  That would be inconsistent with the case law both in the Supreme Court and the Court of Human Rights which states that not every difference in treatment falls within Article 14.   </p>

In that case the criterion which determined whether Mr Clift would have a right to be released on the recommendation of the Parole Board was whether he had been sentenced to a term of less than 15 years or life imprisonment on the one hand or </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.00in">had been sentenced to some other determinate sentence on the other. Because he had been sentenced to 18 years’ imprisonment, the Secretary of State was entitled to and did reject the Parole Board’s recommendation in his case.  The question for the House of Lords was whether his status as a prisoner who had been sentenced to a term of more than 15 years but less than life was an ‘other status’ for the purposes of Article 14.  Lord Bingham of Cornhill noted that the language of Article 14 was not intended to cover differential treatment on any ground whatsoever.  He considered that the question was whether Mr Clift’s classification was a “personal characteristic”: see para. 28.  He regarded that as an elusive test and, not without hesitation, he resolved the question in favour of the Secretary of State. Lord Hope of Craighead said that the specific grounds of discrimination listed in Article 14 all exist independently of the treatment of which complaint is made. He accepted, as Lord Bingham had pointed out, that a personal characteristic cannot be defined by the differential treatment of which a person complains. He also recognised that the category of long-term prisoner into which Mr Clift’s case fell would not have been recognised as a separate category if it had not been for the challenged legislative instrument which treated prisoners in his group differently from others. But, Lord Hope continued, Mr Clift had already acquired the status which his sentence gave him before the order was made that denied prisoners in his group the right to release on the recommendation of the Parole Board. Lord Hope therefore phrased the relevant question as “whether the distinguishing feature or characteristic which enables persons or a group of persons to be singled out for separate treatment must have been identified as a personal characteristic before it is used for this purpose by the discriminator”: para 47.  He held that a generous meaning should be given to the words “or other status” in Article 14, while recognising that the proscribed grounds are not unlimited. His view was that the protection of Article 14 ought not to be denied just because the distinguishing feature which enabled the discriminator to treat persons differently had not been previously recognised.  The jurisprudence of the Court of Human Rights had, however, not yet addressed the question he posed and a measure of “self-restraint” was needed “lest we stretch our own jurisprudence beyond that which is shared by all the States parties to the Convention”: para 49.  He therefore resolved the issue in favour of the Secretary of State.  Baroness Hale of Richmond arrived at the same conclusion although for a slightly different reason. She regarded the real reason for the distinction made between different kinds of prisoners as not referable to a personal characteristic of the offender but to what the offender had done.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.99in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Clift pursued his case to the Court of Human Rights: <span style="font-style:italic">Clift v United Kingdom</span> CE:ECHR:2010:0713JUD000720507 (judgment of 22 November 2010, Fourth Section). The judgment records at para. 47 the argument relied on by the Government of the United Kingdom that, to the extent that Mr Clift sought to compare himself to prisoners serving determinate sentences of less than 15 years, that difference did not exist independently of the matter of which he complained. The length of the sentence as such had no relevance to the law that governed how a prisoner served his sentence. The Court recorded that the Government accepted that being a prisoner could constitute ‘other status’ for the purpose of Article 14.   The Court described earlier cases in which a distinction which could not be said to be innate or inherent had created a status for the purposes of Article 14. The Court went on at para. 60 to say that it was “not persuaded” by the Government’s argument that the treatment of which an applicant complains must exist independently of the ‘other status’ upon which it is based. That argument did not find any clear support in the case law.  The Court referred to <span style="font-style:italic">Paulik v Slovakia</span> (Appn 10699/05 judgment of 10 October 2006) where the distinction drawn was between a father whose paternity had been established by judicial determination and a putative father where paternity was legally presumed but not judicially determined. There was no suggestion there, the Court said in <span style="font-style:italic">Clift</span>, that the distinction relied on had any relevance outside the applicant’s complaint. That had not prevented the Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Paulik</span> from finding a violation of article 14.

He regarded it as appropriate to exercise self-restraint so as not to go further than the case law of the Court of Human Rights had by that stage gone. The Court has now indicated in its judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Clift</span> that the fact that the characteristic of the victim which gives rise to the difference in treatment does not have any significance outside the context of the differential treatment does not prevent that characteristic from amounting to an ‘other status’ for the purpose of Article 14.  The guidance from the Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Clift</span> is, therefore, that when determining whether a distinction which only has relevance because it is adopted as the criterion for conferring a benefit or imposing a burden thereby creates an ‘other status’, one must take into account all the circumstances, including whether, if it does not confer such status, it will run counter to the very purpose of the protection that the Convention article is intended to confer.  </p>

A choice of people living in a particular postcode area might also be objectionable if that area were predominantly populated by people of a particular ethnic group.  Conversely, an example that was discussed during the course of argument was whether, if the trigger for natural migration under the Transitional Regulations had been that all those living in a street beginning with a letter between A and L in the alphabet would migrate first, it is unlikely that someone living in Appleby Road who suffered a loss of income as a result of naturally migrating could complain that he was being unlawfully discriminated against as compared with someone in otherwise identical circumstances who lived in nearby Rodborough Road.  I doubt that the status of “being a person who lives in a street beginning with the letter A” is an ‘other status’ for the purpose of Article 14.  That is so even though the fact that a person lives in Appleby Road is a fact that exists “independently” of such a transitional regime and pre-exists the legislative instrument which causes adverse consequences to flow from that fact where none flowed before.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.99in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">One can see that the criterion relevant here, that the severely disabled person has moved house across a local authority boundary, falls somewhere between the two ends of that spectrum.  With some hesitation I am satisfied that, applying the guidance in <span style="font-style:italic">Clift</span>, the Respondents do have an ‘other status’ within the meaning of Article 14.  I start from the proposition that the ‘very purpose’ of A1P1 combined with Article 14 is to prevent people from being arbitrarily deprived of their possessions – in this case of their entitlement to the amount of benefit to which they were entitled under the legacy benefit regime – in a way which discriminates against them. The effect of the substantial drop in income on these severely disabled benefits recipients is particularly harsh because of their particular needs and vulnerabilities. As Ms Young acknowledged at paragraph 103 in her witness statement (quoted in para. 34 above), people with severe disabilities are less likely to move house than other people because they are less able to cope with the disruption that causes.  I would add that they are less likely to move to live a considerable distance away from the familiar amenities and support networks they will have had in place in their former home.  Their particular vulnerabilities mean that they are at a considerable disadvantage if it becomes necessary, as it became for TP and AR, for them to move to a new area. That disadvantage is exacerbated if the move is accompanied by a substantial drop in income. It is that characteristic of severely disabled people that, in my judgment, means that a severely disabled person who has moved across a local authority boundary has an ‘other status’ for the purpose of Article 14 as compared with a severely disabled person who has not.  The Secretary of State’s decision to include them in the cohort which moves first to Universal Credit without any transitional protection does therefore need to be objectively justified in order not to be unlawful.   </p>

The analogy with the status of residence in a foreign state in <span style="font-style:italic">Carson</span> is not apt in my view because the trigger here is not residence in any particular location but the action of moving from one location to another.  The analogy with the status of a child who needs to spend more than 84 days in hospital in <span style="font-style:italic">Mathieson</span> is not apt because the length of stay in hospital was regarded, by Lord Wilson JSC at least, as an indicator of a difference in the degree or nature of disability and, as Lord Wilson put it, “Why should discrimination (if such it be) between disabled persons with different needs engage article 14 any less than discrimination between a disabled person and an able-bodied person?”: para. 23.

In that case, the Court upheld the applicants’ complaint that legal restrictions on their rights as landlords to increase the rent charged for the letting of their commercial premises interfered with their rights under A1P1.  An additional point was raised by the applicants based on the fact that subsequent legislation had lifted the impugned restrictions but only in respect of leases entered into after 1995. The applicants asserted that they had been treated differently from property owners who leased out their premises after 1995 and who were not subject to the same restrictions on rent increases.  The Court of Human Rights rejected the claim under Article 14 in conjunction with A1P1, holding that no discrimination was disclosed as a result of a particular date being chosen for the commencement of a new legislative regime.  That case did not, however, raise the issue that is raised by the present appeals because of the phased introduction of Universal Credit and the choice of the criteria for determining who is included in the early phases.  </p>

I am fortified in this conclusion by the fact that the Secretary of State has conceded that the requirement for ‘other status’ is satisfied by the Respondents in <span style="font-style:italic">TP (No 2)</span> and also by the clearly discernible trend in the jurisprudence of the Court of Human Rights to extend the kinds of ‘status’ protected by Article 14.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.99in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">I agree with the Master of the Rolls’ and Lord Justice Singh’s reasons for concluding that Lewis J was right to find that there had been discriminatory treatment; that there was no objective justification for the difference in treatment; and that there was no inconsistency between Lewis J’s reasoning and the terms of his order.  The first, third and fourth grounds of appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">TP (No 1)</span> must be rejected and I would therefore dismiss the appeal against that judgment.   </p>
