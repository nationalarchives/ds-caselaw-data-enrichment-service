The first part, which was intended to be the final hearing, took place in July 2019.  The maternal aunt (“MA”) was expressly given permission to and did attend that hearing.  At that hearing the Local Authority sought a care order, the care plan providing that B would either live with foster carers or in a residential home.  The mother had sought B’s return to her care but, on the first day of the July hearing, she accepted that this could not happen.  The mother, alternatively, and the father sought B’s placement with his maternal aunt under a special guardianship order.  The Guardian supported the Local Authority’s position. </p>

She determined that the threshold criteria under s. 31 of the 1989 Act were established.  She also determined that B “would be at risk of significant harm in the care of either of his parents in the short and the longer term”.  She also accepted the, effectively unanimous, professional evidence that a special guardianship order (“SGO”) in favour of MA would not meet B’s needs and would place him at risk of further unacceptable harm.  The only “realistic option” which the judge considered would meet B’s future needs was a care order. </p>

The judge was informed that a foster placement for B, which could be either short or long term, had been identified.  B had been in a residential placement since early June 2019 following the breakdown of his then foster placement.  The judge refused the mother’s application for MA to be joined as a party.  She also informed the parties that she proposed, at the next hearing, to consider whether to make an order under s.91(14).  She asked the Guardian specifically to address the likely effect on B and the stability of his placement of further litigation. </p>

She decided that it was “not in B’s welfare interests for further investigations as to his placement and contact arrangements to be made outside the looked-after children process”.

The latter followed, to quote from the August 2019 judgment, “poor attendances (at school), increasing inappropriate and challenging behaviour from B, inconsistent care from the mother, as well as poor home conditions, the mother being unwell and depressed and struggling to manage”.  The mother and B were offered “systemic family therapy with CAMHS but this was discontinued due to sporadic engagement”.  The mother was “obstructive (and) often refused home visits”. </p>

He also considered that B “has clearly had to act both as a carer for his mother … and has had to take considerable levels of responsibility for himself”.  After referring to the mother and B having attended CAMHS and the Anna Freud Centre, the psychologist said: “B may have been acting out through anger at the time and it is clear that on a number of occasions the mother considered that B had a developmental disorder.  It would seem quite evident that the actual difficulty was (a) the mother’s instability of care; (b) her emotional and mood instability, chronic medical difficulties and probably depression at times; and (c) B having to assume a caring role with his mother and too high a level of responsibility for himself for a boy of his age”.

However, because he had assessed neither the mother nor MA, he accepted that he would have to defer on some key issues, in particular, to the ISW because she had carried out assessments of both of them.  For example, he agreed with the significant concerns expressed about MA “not being able to stop … a continuation of mother’s enmeshed relationship with B and mother’s blurring of boundaries as to who is responsible for what with regard to B’s care given … that in my opinion he needs above average care”.

The mother’s case on appeal has focused on his observation in his first report that there should be “as high a level of contact with his mother and other relevant family members as possible”.  However, at the same time, the psychologist recognised that, if B was not living with his mother, “this would be very difficult for [her] … and [she] may not be able to emotionally adjust to fully supporting B in his new placement and support him to progress and develop”.  This latter observation was reflected in his second report when he said that the issue seemed to be “to ensure that the mother acts reasonably and responsibly around B”.  In the second professionals’ meeting, he described it as “absolutely essential” that the mother did not seek to undermine B’s placement and the manner in which he was being cared for in that placement; as referred to above, in his opinion contact was “contingent” on this. </p>

The ISW’s “overriding concern” was the mother’s likely inability to accept B living with MA and MA’s ability to manage that relationship.  The mother and MA had a troubled relationship with MA having been “subject to frequent demands and unpleasantness”.

In one of the professionals’ meetings, the ISW gave a blunt assessment, namely that MA would not be able to care for B on her own; she would be too “exposed”.

In addition, B “wants to be with his aunt if he cannot return to his mother’s care”.  The Guardian then set out her assessment of the risks in such a placement.  These were that MA had “demonstrated little evidence of insight into her sister’s parenting concerns”; this included her having minimised or accepted “such parenting despite being aware of the professional worries”.  This might “not affect her care on a day to day basis” but it “questions how robustly she will protect B from any intervention by” his mother.

This has been demonstrated during the proceedings.  In addition, [the mother] may make contacts difficult by placing emotional pressure on B.  All of the above requires skilled care giving and a high level of resilience.  [MA] is likely to feel isolated from her family as they do not wish to be involved and managing these very difficult, exhausting dynamics frequently is an exceptionally high level of responsibility.

She identified a number of factors which persuaded her that an order was required.  These included the following.  B had been involved in proceedings since October 2018 and he needed “to achieve stability”.  The mother had a “history of failing to cooperate with professionals”; the prognosis for her engagement in any therapeutic work was “poor”.  She did not accept the contact plan or B’s placement in foster care.  The mother “regularly undermines boundaries; when she doesn’t get what she wants she makes it very difficult and she also seeks to undermine B’s placement”.

The ISW and, I would add, the Guardian had concluded that the mother would not.  As stated by the ISW, she “can’t see how a written agreement could be observed by [the mother] in a consistent manner” because there was no “evidence to date where she’s been able to show that she can do that”.

The court is required to consider the “permanence provisions” of the care plan, s.31(3A), and the contact arrangements, s.34(11).  The permanence provisions are defined in s.31(3B) and include the Local Authority’s long-term plan for the child’s care.   </p>

He considered, at [97], that there was a “somewhat imprecise line” with, on one side, cases in which uncertainties should be resolved, in particular if they needed to be resolved “before the court can decide whether it is in the best interests of the child to make a care order at all”, at [93], and, on the other side, those cases in which “the uncertainties involved in a care plan will have to be worked out after a care order has been made and while the plan is being implemented”.  His conclusions were as follows: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.00in;text-indent:0.00in">“99 Despite all the inevitable uncertainties, when deciding whether to make a care order the court should normally have before it a care plan which is sufficiently firm and particularised for all concerned to have a reasonably clear picture of the likely way ahead for the child for the foreseeable future.  The degree of firmness to be expected, as well as the amount of detail in the plan, will vary from case to case depending on how far the local authority can foresee what will be best for the child at that time.  This is necessarily so.  But making a care order is always a serious interference in the lives of the child and his parents.  Although article 8 contains no explicit procedural requirements, the decision-making process leading to a care order must be fair and such as to afford due respect to the interests safeguarded by article 8: see <span style="font-style:italic">TP and KM v United Kingdom</span> [2001] 2 FLR 549, 569, para 72.  If the parents and the child's guardian are to have a fair and adequate opportunity to make representations to the court on whether a care order should be made, the care plan must be appropriately specific. </p>

It would be foolish to attempt to be more precise.  One further general point may be noted.  When postponing a decision on whether to make a care order a court will need to have in mind the general statutory principle that any delay in determining issues relating to a child's upbringing is likely to prejudice the child's welfare: section 1(2) of the Children Act.” </p>

This was plainly not a case in which, to adopt what Lord Nicholls said, there was an uncertainty which needed to be resolved before the court could decide whether it was in B’s best interests to make a care order at all.  Further, the care plan was sufficiently specific as to the Local Authority’s long-term plan for B’s care that there was no uncertainty which required resolution before the court made a care order.  The judge did not need to await the formal outcome of the assessment of MA as a foster carer not only because that outcome was sufficiently clear but also because, as the judge decided, this did not justify further delaying the determination of the proceedings. </p>

The judge did not need to refer expressly to each of the factors set out in the welfare checklist.  Again as Peter Jackson LJ said in <span style="font-style:italic">Re DAM</span>, at [42(3)], the question is whether “it is evident that in substance all the relevant, significant welfare factors have been taken into account”.  In my view it is clear from the judgments that the judge took into account all the relevant welfare factors.  In particular, as it is specifically advanced by the mother, the judge expressly referred to B’s wishes and feelings and, although only brief references, they were sufficient to confirm that she did, indeed, take them into account.  I would add that, even if there had been no express reference, the overwhelming effect of the professional and other evidence, which had taken them into account, was clear and any other decision by the judge would have been difficult to explain.   </p>

A period of calm was an entirely justifiable objective as AK's welfare required that she should be able to settle into her placement with MGM in the context of the special guardianship order and, as the judge said in her conclusion, come to 'know that her home is with MGM and [her partner]'.  This case was not, in my view, a run-of-themill case but an unusual one and it was open to the judge to conclude that AK's welfare required the imposition of a s 91(14) order.  The period of the restriction was very much a matter for her discretion, knowing the parents as she did, and having formed her own assessment of the prognosis for change in the future.” </p>
