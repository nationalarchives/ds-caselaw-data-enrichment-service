	    <p style="margin-left:0.64in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Each of the three Claimants was convicted in the 1980s or 1990s of multiple offences of loitering or soliciting in a street or public place for the purpose of prostitution, contrary to section 1 of the Street Offences Act 1959 (“SOA 1959 s 1”). Those convictions, notwithstanding the passage of time, remain on their records. They contend on this appeal from the Divisional Court (Holroyde LJ and Nicola Davies J: [2018] EWHC 407 (Admin)) that the criminalisation of their actions and the recording and retention of information concerning their convictions all contravene their rights under the ECHR. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.64in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Each Claimant succeeded in removing herself from prostitution many years ago. The 50 soliciting offences of which the first claimant has been convicted were committed over a period of eight years, the last conviction being in 1998. In the second claimant's case, the 49 soliciting offences of which she has been convicted were committed over a period of three years, the last conviction being in 1988. In the third claimant's case, the 9 soliciting offences of which she has been convicted were committed over a period of four years, the last conviction being in 1992. In relation to each of them, the penalties imposed for the soliciting offences were almost always fines, with conditional discharges being ordered on a few occasions.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.64in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Although the offences were committed long ago, and the penalties imposed were comparatively minor, the convictions for soliciting offences have continuing consequences for each of the claimants. They are not statutorily barred from working with children or vulnerable adults, but the effect of the relevant statutory provisions is that, throughout their lives prior to this litigation, they had to disclose their convictions if they applied for certain types of employment, and were required to obtain a certificate verifying any such disclosure.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.64in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The principal issue before the Divisional Court was the Claimants’ challenge to what was described as the multiple convictions rule, namely the requirement of a series of statutory provisions that when applying for certain jobs anyone with more than one spent conviction has to disclose them. The Claimants succeeded in the Divisional Court on that issue. The Secretaries of State obtained permission to appeal from that decision but their prospective appeal was undermined by the judgment of the Supreme Court handed down on 30 January 2019 in the cases of <span style="font-style:italic">R (P) v Secretary of State for Justice and another, </span>reported at [2019] 2 WLR 509, holding that the multiple convictions rule was not a proportionate way of meeting its objective of disclosing to potential employers criminal records indicating a propensity to re-offend. The Defendants’ appeal in the present case was accordingly withdrawn and dismissed by consent.  </p>

Nor is doing so a current part of Government policy. Neither the Strategy nor the Review recommended it. It is a central part of the Strategy that prostitution remains both a considerable public nuisance and is something which should be reduced rather than accepted as a fact of life. It would be entirely counter to that Strategy to decriminalise prostitution and sex work itself. Instead, the aim has been to encourage both the police and the courts to explore with prostitutes and sex workers the best ways of assisting them out of prostitution and sex work, hence the inclusion of the rehabilitation orders to emphasise precisely that. </p>

Sections 113A-B of the 1997 Act have the effect that a person who applies for such employment, and who will have to answer a question about previous convictions or cautions, must apply to the Disclosure and Barring Service (“DBS”) for either a Criminal Record Certificate ("CRC") or an Enhanced Criminal Record Certificate ("ECRC").

I simply do not understand the argument that because over 98% of SOA 1959 s 1 defendants are women, that of itself shows a prima facie case of discrimination. Most criminal offences, certainly most offences of violence, are committed overwhelmingly by men, but that has never so far given rise to a successful argument that the existence of the particular offence is a breach of the defendant’s rights under Article 14 read with Article 8, or that it has a disparate adverse impact on men. It would be otherwise if the evidence tended to show that men who commit the offence of soliciting are not prosecuted. I agree with the observations of Hickinbottom LJ on this part of the case, and how it contrasts with <span style="font-style:italic">DH v Czech Republic</span> (2008) 47 EHRR </p>

It seems to me to present the simple decriminalisation argument in a slightly different form. It is a legitimate point of view that prostitution should not be a criminal offence, since so many of those who resort to it are vulnerable women who should be treated differently, but there is no consensus among ECHR Member States to this effect. In Sweden, for example, prostitution has been decriminalised but paying for the services of prostitutes is an offence. In the Netherlands neither party to the transaction commits an offence; but evidence considered by the House of Commons’ Home Affairs Select Committee in 2016-17 showed that decriminalisation there has led to an increase in prostitution which has become a cause for concern. </p>

Neither s 27(4) of PACE nor regulation 3(1) sets out a mechanism for reviewing or deleting the records. Instead, retention is carried out in accordance with guidance produced by the National Police Chiefs’ Council (“NPCC”). Its “Deletion of Records from National Police Systems Guidance” states that records should be kept on the Police National Computer (“PNC”) until an individual is 100 years old. The guidance provides no mechanism for reviewing or deleting the records before that time. </p>

The relevant comparator – a male prostitute convicted of the SOA 1959 s 1 offence – would be subject to the same treatment as a female prostitute.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.64in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Since this case was before the Divisional Court the European Court of Human Rights has given judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Catt v United Kingdom </span>(2019) 69 EHRR 7. Mr Catt, by then well into his nineties, had been a regular attender at peace movement demonstrations since 1948. In 2005 he began participating in demonstrations against the activities in this country of EDO MBN Technology Ltd, a US-owned company which manufactured weapons and weapon components and had a factory in Brighton. The demonstrations were organised by a group called Smash EDO; some of them involved serious disorder and criminality. Mr Catt had been arrested twice at Smash EDO protests but had never been convicted of an offence. A subject access request to the police under the Data Protection Act 1998 revealed numerous entries about him held on a police “extremism database”, not all of them relating to Smash EDO demonstrations. In 2010 he asked the police to delete entries which mentioned him. When they refused he issued judicial review proceedings, contending that the retention of his data was “not necessary within the meaning of Article 8(2)”.  </p>

This court unanimously held that the continued retention of his personal data constituted an unjustifiably disproportionate interference with his Article 8 rights. The UK Supreme Court held that Article 8 was engaged but, by a majority of four to one, that the interference was justified and that the invasion of privacy involved in the retention of the applicant’s data was minor. That was how Mr Catt’s case stood when the present claim was before the Divisional Court. But on 24 January 2019 the ECtHR found in Mr Catt’s favour. </p>

Ms Monaghan submits that Article 4 must be construed in the light of the Trafficking Convention, Article 26 of which “provides for <span style="font-style:italic">the possibility of not imposing penalties</span> on victims for their involvement in unlawful activities to the extent that they have been compelled to do so”; and of EU Directive 2011/36/EU on Preventing and Combatting Trafficking in Human Beings and Protecting its Victims, Article 8 of which requires EU Member States to ensure that national authorities are “<span style="font-style:italic">entitled not to prosecute or impose penalties” </span>on such victims of trafficking [emphasis added in both cases]. But, as the Court of Appeal, Criminal Division, held in  <span style="font-style:italic">R v M(L) </span>[2010] EWCA Crim 2327 (before the enactment of the Modern Slavery Act 2015) the Convention and Directive do not say that no trafficked victim should be prosecuted or subject to penalties, whatever the circumstances.  </p>

Whether absolute or conditional, this order does not constitute a penalty. If it arises, it is the end of the process. That issue, however, is not the problem to which the present appeals give rise: we are concerned with the prosecution and conviction of the Claimants rather than the sentences imposed after conviction.”” </p>

They were in <span style="font-style:italic">DH v Czech Republic</span> (2008) 47 EHRR 3, in which it was alleged that the allocation of Roma children to state-run special schools in the town of Ostrava, established after the First World War ostensibly for children with special educational needs, was discriminatory on grounds of race.  Roma represented only 2.26% of the 33,000 school-aged children in the town, but the proportion of Roma children assigned to special schools was over 50% (see [190]).  It was contended that Roma children were not properly assessed to see whether they should go to a mainstream school, and that this difference in treatment effectively amounted to racial segregation. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The European Court of Human Rights rightly noted the difficulty applicants may have in showing discriminatory treatment, such that “less strict evidential rules should apply in cases of alleged indirect discrimination” (at [186]).  The applicants sought to rely upon statistical data that, across the Czech Republic, 70% of all pupils at special schools were Roma, and the percentage was as high as 80-90% in some special schools (at [192]).  On the basis of that statistical evidence, the court was satisfied that the burden on the applicants of showing discriminatory treatment had been satisfied, and the burden of showing that the difference in impact was the result of factors unrelated to ethnic origin had shifted to the state. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">However, the situation here is entirely different.  Of course, for indirect discrimination, it is important to look at, not just the state measure on its face, but the effect of it as differentially treating individuals or groups of individuals in practice. But in this case, neither the Claimants, nor anyone else, suggest that women who solicit are treated any differently from the relevant comparator group, i.e. men who solicit.  The difference in numbers of convictions does not reflect a difference in treatment, but rather the fact that many more women than men commit this crime.  Similarly, the statistics relied upon in <span style="font-style:italic">DH</span> (that 70% of children in special schools were Roma) would not have implied discrimination if they had simply reflected the fact that 70% of children in the Czech Republic as a  whole were Roma.  As Bean LJ has said, many crimes have a substantial difference in the gender balance, e.g. most crimes of violence, including murder, are committed by men.  For the same reason, none of these is discriminatory by that reason alone either.  It would, of course, be different if the police and prosecuting authorities (e.g.) acted in such a way as to discriminate in favour of prosecuting one gender more than another – that may then fall into <span style="font-style:italic">DH</span> territory – but it is not suggested that that is the case here.   </p>
