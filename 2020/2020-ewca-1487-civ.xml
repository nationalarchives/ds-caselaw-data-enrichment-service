	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">The Claimant, Mr Craig Heskett, who is the Appellant before us, has been employed since 2006 as a probation officer in Kent.  The probation service in England and Wales was at the time material to his claim operated by the National Offender Management Service (“NOMS”), which was an executive agency under what is described as the “sponsorship” of the Ministry of Justice.  It has no separate legal personality.  For practical purposes I can refer to the Claimant as being employed by NOMS, but as a civil servant he is formally an employee of the Crown, and the Secretary of State is the appropriate respondent to these proceedings on behalf of the Crown.  NOMS was replaced in April 2017, following the start of the proceedings, by Her Majesty’s Prison and Probation Service (“HMPPS”). </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">In February 2016, when he was aged 38, the Claimant brought proceedings against the Respondent in the Employment Tribunal complaining of (indirect) age discrimination.  I give details of his complaint below, but his essential point is that the rate of pay progression for his job has drastically reduced as a result of the policy of austerity in public sector pay which was in force since 2010, and that this disadvantaged younger employees such as himself since they were inherently less likely than older colleagues to have reached the top of the applicable pay range when the policy came into force. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">The Claimant’s complaint was heard over two days in July 2017 before an Employment Tribunal at London South comprising Employment Judge Crosfill, Mrs R Serpis and Mr D Clay.  The complaint was dismissed by a Judgment and Reasons sent to the parties on 12 October 2017.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">The Claimant appealed to the Employment Appeal Tribunal.  His appeal was heard by HH Judge Barklem on 6 December 2018.  His decision dismissing the appeal was not handed down until 25 June 2019, but that is not something about which I feel able to be critical since there has been a substantial delay in this Court also, for which I express my regret.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">The annual budget of NOMS was set by the Ministry of Justice.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">Prior to the introduction of the policy of austerity in 2010 NOMS operated a pay progression system of the kind then almost universal in the public sector, in which particular jobs were placed in a “pay band”, which comprised a scale of “spinal points” corresponding to particular salary figures.  An employee was entitled to progress up the scale by three spinal points each year until they reached the top.  In addition, there was an expectation that the salary figures which each spinal point represented would be adjusted annually, so as (broadly) to keep pace with increases in the cost of living, so that progress up the scale would constitute increases in salary in real as well as nominal terms.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">The principal effect of the NNC agreement, so far as we are concerned, is that the rate of annual progression in bands 3-6 was reduced from three spinal points to one (save in the first year, when it was reduced to two); and there was to be no cost-of-living increase in the salary figures attached to the bands.  Other aspects of the agreement, including some designed to mitigate the impact on lower-paid workers, are referred to at para. 14 of the ET’s Reasons.  Some minor adjustments were made in the following years, explained at para. 15. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">The agreement as regards the rate of progression remained in effect up to the date that the Claimant brought his claim in 2016.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">It is common ground that the slowing of the rate of progression as a result of the NNC agreement had a disproportionate effect on younger employees because a higher proportion of older employees would, in the nature of things, either have reached the top of the pay band or in any event have progressed further up it than younger employees.   </p>

It is not uncommon to refer to a PCP as discriminatory if elements (a)-(c) under subsection (2) are satisfied.  That is strictly inaccurate, since the requirement at (d) that the PCP has not been shown to be justified is part of the definition of “discriminatory” in the subsection.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">It will be seen that section 19 (2) (d) requires the putative discriminator to show two things – (a) that the purpose of the PCP was to achieve a legitimate aim; and (b) that it represented a proportionate means of achieving that aim.  The distinction between the two is in principle important since the aim, so long as “legitimate”, must be a matter for the choice of the employer whereas the proportionality of the means chosen must be assessed by the tribunal.  A recent example of that distinction being applied was the decision of this Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Harrod v Chief Constable of West Midlands Police</span> [2017] EWCA Civ 191, [2017] ICR 869 (per Bean LJ at para. 30, myself at para. 41 and Elias LJ at para. 48); but see also <span style="font-style:italic">Blackburn v West Midlands Police</span> [2008] EWCA Civ 1208, [2009] IRLR 135.  Having said that, it has to be recognised that the case-law sometimes slurs over the distinction between aim and means, perhaps because it is not always easy, or necessary, to draw it: as to this see paras. 32-33 of my judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">HM Land Registry v Benson</span> [2011] UKEAT 0197/11, [2012] ICR 627.  </p>

The Claimant’s original ET1 (see para. 18 above) had only complained of the reduction in the rate of progression from 2011; and although the broader ground was subsequently added its consequences do not seem to have been thought through, since the “particular disadvantage” identified at para. 5 of the agreed statement consists entirely of the effects of the 2011 changes.   </p>

As it put it, “<span style="color:#222222">the link between skill and pay has been broken by the introduction of the new pay progression policy”.  Thus </span>the only element in the Respondent’s pleaded justification which is capable of justifying the actual PCP, namely the reduction in the rate of pay progression, is “the significant reduction in public money available … in light of the significant downturn in the economic climate from 2010”. </p>

The new pay policy was crafted to distribute that pain in as fair and equitable a way as possible given the constraints the Respondent was subject to. The employees at the top of the pay bands were given no increase in pay whatsoever until the 2015 pay settlement. As we say above this would have been a significant hardship. For a number of years more favourable pay progression was used to boost the pay of the lowest paid workers in bands 1 and 2.

It was not unreasonable to take that view as it could reasonably be thought that years of below inflation pay settlements are politically unsustainable. In our view, whilst the situation has persisted for over 6 years, it could still be thought to be temporary or transient in nature and that provides justification for not immediately radically changing the pay policy.

The claimants were Irish female civil servants who worked for the Revenue Commissioners.  Pay for civil servants was determined partly by reference to length of service.  Both claimants had been working on a job-sharing basis, under which they worked one week on and one week off; but later moved to full-time employment.  For the purpose of computing their full-time pay they were treated as only having had half their actual service in respect of the period for which they were job-sharing.  They complained that this constituted indirect sex discrimination: almost all job-sharers were women.  One aspect of the justification advanced by the employer was that the practice of pro-rating years of service worked “ensures that the incremental cost of job-sharing staff is the same as that of full-time staff” (see n. 20 in the Opinion of the Advocate General).  As to that the Court said, at para. 40 of its judgment: </p>

As noted at para. 17 above, the distinction between the two is not always clear-cut.

Since pensionable age was 60 for women and 65 for men the scheme had an indirectly discriminatory effect.  The city ceased to pay the claimant at the enhanced rate after she reached 60.  She brought proceedings against both the government and the city, no doubt on the basis that both were in different ways responsible for the detriment of which she complained.

As Elias J observed in the <span style="font-style:italic">Redcar &amp; Cleveland </span>case, [2007] IRLR 91, at paragraph 91, ‘Almost every decision taken by an employer is going to have regard to costs.’ [The relevant provision of the regulations then governing age discrimination], however, says nothing of the extent to which considerations of cost may feature in the justification exercise. It provides merely that what would otherwise be discriminatory treatment may be justified if it was ‘a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim’. The relevant question must therefore be whether the treatment complained of was such a means. Accepting, as I make clear I do, that the guidance of the Court of Justice is that an employer cannot justify discriminatory treatment ‘solely’ because the elimination of such treatment would involve increased costs, that guidance cannot mean more than that the saving or avoidance of costs will not, without more, amount to the achieving of a ‘legitimate aim’. That is entirely unsurprising. To adopt a simple example given by [counsel for the employer], it is hardly open to an employer to claim to be entitled to justify the discriminatory payment to A of less than B simply because it would cost more to pay A the same as B. Such treatment of A could not, without more, be a 'legitimate aim'. </p>

The claim arose out of the denial of pension rights to Recorders (and other part-time judges), which was said to be contrary to the PartTime Workers (Prevention of Less Favourable Treatment) Regulations 2000, which implements the EU Part-Time Workers Directive.  The primary issue before the Court was whether Recorders were “workers” within the meaning of the Regulations (and the Directive).  Following a reference to the CJEU, it concluded that they were.  It followed that the denial of pension rights constituted direct discrimination.  Under the Regulations direct discrimination may be justified.

That argument would not avail a private employer and it should not avail the State in its capacity as an employer. Even supposing that direct sex discrimination were justifiable, it would not be legitimate to pay women judges less than men judges on the basis that this would cost less, that more money would then be available to attract the best male candidates, or even on the basis that most women need less than most men.” </p>

The Tribunal had not rejected that submission on the basis that this was a “cost plus” case.  Instead it had drawn a distinction between cases where the aim was “cost-cutting” and cases where an “absence of means” forces the employer to do the act complained of: see para. 57 of the Reasons.

The Land Registry is a public body financed by the fees which it charges.  It is required to break even year-on-year.  At the time with which the case was concerned it had reserves but it could only draw on them with Treasury approval.  A slump in its revenues meant that in order to break even it needed to reduce its workforce.  It received Treasury approval to spend £50m from its reserves to finance voluntary redundancy or early retirement schemes, of which £12m was allocated to a particular “merging offices” scheme.  The terms under which employees were selected for redundancy under that scheme had an age-discriminatory effect.   There was some debate about how the relevant aim should be characterised for the purpose of the justification issue, given that it could be said to include several elements.  At para. 34 of my judgment I said: </p>

In an attempt to reduce staff costs it introduced new terms and conditions which resulted in loss of some benefits which were particularly advantageous to a group of older employees.  They brought age discrimination claims.  At para. 57 of his judgment Lewis J quoted the ET’s characterisation of the employers’ aim as being “to reduce staff costs to ensure its future viability and to have in place market competitive, non-discriminatory terms and conditions”.

The retirements were required in order to enable police forces to achieve a 20% reduction in their budgets as part of the austerity measures imposed by the coalition government in 2010.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">More importantly, however, I think that that proposition is correct in principle.  There is nothing to suggest that the CJEU in <span style="font-style:italic">Hill and Stapleton</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">Kutz-Bauer</span> or <span style="font-style:italic">Steinicke</span> had in mind a case of the present kind, where an employer is having to make choices about how best to allocate a limited budget: the justification advanced in those cases was purely that avoiding discrimination would cost more.  I can see no principled basis for ignoring the constraints under which an employer is in fact having to operate.  It is never a good thing when tribunals or courts are required to make judgements on an artificial basis.  As Burton P in <span style="font-style:italic">Cross</span>, Elias J in <span style="font-style:italic">Bainbridge</span>, and myself and Rimer LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Woodcock</span> have all observed, almost any decision taken by an employer will inevitably have regard to costs to a greater or lesser extent; and it is unreal to leave that factor out of account.  That is particularly so where the action complained of is taken in response to real financial pressures, as was very clearly the case in all three of the authorities relied on by Ms Darwin and as is the case, on the Tribunal’s findings, in the present case.  It is also necessary to bear in mind that because age, unlike other protected factors, is not binary it is difficult, to put it no higher, for an employer to make decisions affecting employees that will have a precisely equal impact on every age group, however defined.  This makes it particularly important for them to be able to justify such disparate impacts as may occur by reference to the real world financial pressures which they face. </p>

If it is permissible for an employer to rely, as a legitimate aim, on a real need to reduce or constrain staffing costs, it still has to show that the measures complained of represent a proportionate means of achieving that aim, having regard to their disparate impact on the group in question.  It is in my view entirely appropriate that a proportionality exercise of that kind should be the focus of the justification enquiry.  Such an exercise will enable the tribunal to examine carefully the nature and extent of the financial pressures on which the employer relies as well as the possibility that they could have been addressed in a way which did not have the discriminatory effect complained of.  That kind of exercise was carried out by the tribunals in <span style="font-style:italic">Benson</span> and in <span style="font-style:italic">Edie</span> – and indeed by the Tribunal in the present case. </p>

But tribunals often have to make judgements of that kind and there is nothing uniquely difficult about this one.  The judgement that would be required if Mr Menzies’ submission were correct – that is, to assess the justification on the basis that any consideration of the employer’s financial position should be excluded – would be at least equally difficult, indeed more so.  </p>

The Court was concerned with a case of (overt and deliberate) direct discrimination against part-time workers.  At the end of para. 74 it expressly equates it with a case of direct pay discrimination against women.  As it says, such treatment contravened “the fundamental principles of equal treatment”.  In that context it is hardly surprising that it should make it clear that neither a private employer nor the state in its capacity as employer could seek to justify such discrimination (where, untypically, justification is an available defence) on the basis that times were hard and it could not afford to treat part-timers, or women, equally.  But the present case does not involve direct discrimination.  We are concerned with indirect discrimination – more specifically with a situation where the employer has altered its pay arrangements in a way which has had a disparate impact on employees of different ages (as such changes are very liable to do).  I see no sign that the Supreme Court had in mind a case of this kind.  What “the fundamental principles of equal treatment” require in such a case is that the disparate impact of the measures in question should be justified.  Mr Menzies pointed out that the test of justification was expressed in identical terms in the case of indirect discrimination under section 19 of the 2010 Act and in the case of direct age discrimination: see section 13 (2).  That is no doubt correct, but it does not follow that the question of the legitimacy of a particular aim requires the same answer in both contexts.    </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">In the course of Ms Darwin’s submissions there was some exploration, arising out of questions from the Court, of whether it was appropriate to take the constrained budget allocated to NOMS as a given or whether it was necessary to consider the Ministry’s, or the Treasury’s, justification for constraining the budget in the first place.  The Court asked for a note from the Respondent explaining the relevant relationships more fully than appeared in the Tribunal’s Reasons.  Ms Darwin and Mr Roberts submitted such a note following the hearing and Mr Menzies provided a response.  In the event, however, I do not think that this is an area which can be explored in this appeal.  No issue of this kind arose in the ET or the EAT or is raised in the grounds of appeal, and Mr Menzies did not in his skeleton argument or opening submissions argue that the ET should have looked beyond the justification advanced by NOMS.  In those circumstances I do not think I should express any concluded view.  However, leaving aside the kind of case which the Supreme Court was discussing at para. 74 of its judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">O’Brien</span>, I would take some convincing that it was illegitimate for a government department or agency to seek to keep its pay budget within the limits imposed by the Treasury or a parent department.

An employer may sometimes feel obliged to take urgent measures which have an indirectly discriminatory effect on a group of its employees.  Perhaps the disparate impact is something which is or should be appreciated from the start; perhaps it is something which only becomes apparent after a time.  In either case I see no reason in principle why it should not be open to the employer to seek to justify those measures on the basis that they represented a proportionate short-term means of responding to the problem in question albeit that they could not be justified in the longer term.  It is inherent in such a justification that the employer intends within a reasonable time to discontinue the measures in question, or modify them so that they no longer have the impact complained of; but the essence of the justification does not depend on that intention.  Of course in other circumstances it is not open to an employer to defend a discriminatory state of affairs by saying “I know I am discriminating but I will do something about it soon”.  But that is not the case which the Tribunal was accepting here.  The essential premise was that the reduction in the rate of progression was justifiable on a temporary basis.  I note also that an essential part of the justification for the <span style="font-style:italic">prima facie</span> discriminatory pay protection payments in <span style="font-style:italic">Bainbridge</span> was that they were being made only for a limited time.  </p>

On ordinary principles such an inference should not be drawn except on the basis of appropriate findings of primary fact which need to be properly spelt out: he relies on the well-known statements to that effect in the judgments of Balcombe LJ and Peter Gibson LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Chapman v Simon</span> [1994] IRLR 124: see paras. 33 (3) and 43. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">I do not see anything in this ground.  In the first place, although the Tribunal used the word “infer” at the start of para. 69, I am not convinced that it was drawing an inference in the sense that this Court was concerned with in <span style="font-style:italic">Chapman v Simon</span>: which was a case where a tribunal had made a finding of unconscious racial motivation against a respondent.  The findings in that paragraph are more in the nature of the Tribunal’s overall conclusions.  But I accept that that may not go to the heart of the point because it would still be necessary that there be an evidential basis for those conclusions.  In my view the short answer to the submission is that the Tribunal explains the basis for its conclusion in para. 69 itself, namely that it was in the nature of a pay freeze of the kind imposed in 2010 that it was likely to be a temporary measure because, as it says, it would reasonably be assumed that “years of below inflation pay settlements are politically unsustainable”.  In my view that is a sufficient basis for the Tribunal’s conclusion that NOMS regarded the reduction in the rate of progression as a temporary, or stopgap, measure.  I see nothing in its conclusion inconsistent with the use of the phrase “going forwards” in the ET3. </p>

Generally, an employee would be appointed at the bottom of the pay scale although exceptionally appointment would be at some higher point.

It is open to employees regardless of grade or position on the pay scale to seek promotion to a higher band.  The Claimant had commenced working the Kent Probation Board in 2006.  He was then a trainee probation officer and was equivalent to a band 3 employee.  After 2 years he successfully completed his training and was appointed as a probation officer initially temporarily but then permanently.  His salary was set by reference to the newly agreed band 4 and he started at the bottom of the pay scale.

Those documents included a description of the job evaluation scheme described above and the various pay scales.  At section 4 of that document under the title “Pay Progression” there is an explanation of how it was intended that an employee placed on a particular band would progress up to the top of the pay scale.  From 1 April 2007 it had been agreed that an employee would progress by four pay points per annum up to a certain point on the pay scale which was described as a “development point”.  Having reached the development point the employee would then progress by two points per annum but thereafter would only progress by one point per annum subject to a nationally agreed development and review process.  As such it was intended that some system of performance related pay would be introduced in the spinal points at the top of any particular pay band.  As a matter of fact no agreement has ever been reached in respect of the development and review process and instead up till 1 April 2010 employees progressed automatically by three spinal points per annum until they reached the top of the pay scale.  From 1 April 2010 that was reduced to two points and from 1 April 2011 to just one.  Once an employee has reached the top of the pay scale there was no further automatic progression. </p>

In NOMS this gave rise to pay negotiations which resulted in a decrease in the rate of pay progression from 3 points per annum to 2.  There was a further round of pay negotiations for the financial year commencing 1 April 2011.  It seems that those negotiations were not complete until 1 February 2012.  We were told and accept that the Respondent took the view that there was a contractual obligation to maintain pay progression but none to award annual pay rises and, crucially in this case, that the number of spinal points each employee would progress by each year were not contractual matters but were matters for negotiation on an annual basis. </p>
