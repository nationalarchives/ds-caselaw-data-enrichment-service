In the vast majority of cases, this rule gives adequate protection against misuse of disclosure documents.  It is not uncommon in intellectual property and other types of litigation, however, for highly confidential documents to be subject to more restrictive measures designed to prevent the documents from entering the public domain or being used for collateral purposes.  These appeals are concerned with the treatment of commercially confidential materials in the context of litigation about standard essential patents (“SEPs”). </p>

Proprietors of SEPs will, however, have given an undertaking to the standards-setting organisation to grant licences under their SEPs to implementers of the relevant standards under fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory (“FRAND”) terms.  Consistently with this, the respondents’ position is that, if they succeed in their infringement claim, they are willing to grant licences to the appellants on their standard terms.  They contend that they have already granted 23 such licences to implementers, (“the MCP Pool Licences”), and that from this fact alone it can be demonstrated that the terms on offer to the appellants are FRAND.   </p>

In particular, they say that the counterparties to the 23 MCP Pool Licences are much smaller enterprises than they are: they call them “minnows”.  They are therefore not good comparables.  They do not reflect the terms which would be FRAND for much larger organisations, which would have the financial wherewithal to negotiate more advantageous terms.  They further contend that licences to portfolios other than the MCP Pool may be relevant in principle to setting the correct rate.  That will be so, they contend, if the respondents or other members of the Pool have licensed sub-sets of the Pool.  They hope that it will be possible to build a more reliable picture from those sub-set licences of the value of the patents in the Pool.  They propose to unpack those sub-set licences which appear to be most relevant, and then re-synthesise the proper terms for a FRAND licence to fit their circumstances.   </p>

In such a case a court might well be justified in directing disclosure of allegedly secret material only to expert or professional agents of the party seeking discovery on terms they should not, without further order, pass on any information so obtained to the party himself or anyone else, but should merely advise him in the light of the information so obtained. Even so, if the action were to go to trial, it would seem that sooner or later the party would be bound to learn the facts, unintelligible though they might be to him, unless the very exceptional course were taken of excluding him from part of the hearing.

The object to be achieved is that the applicant should have as full a degree of disclosure as will be consistent with adequate protection of the secret. In so doing, the court will be careful not to expose a party to any unnecessary risk of its trade secrets leaking to or being used by competitors. What is necessary or unnecessary will depend upon the nature of the secret, the position of the parties and the extent of the disclosure ordered. However, it would be exceptional to prevent a party from access to information which would play a substantial part in the case as such would mean that the party would be unable to hear a substantial part of the case, would be unable to understand the reasons for the advice given to him and, in some cases, the reasons for the judgment. Thus what disclosure is necessary entails not only practical matters arising in the conduct of a case but also the general position that a party should know the case he has to meet, should hear matters given in evidence and understand the reasons for the judgment.” </p>

Aldous J authorised disclosure to one person with sufficient technical expertise in the claimant’s organisation “to appreciate the strengths and weaknesses of the case”.  The documents in question “were at the heart of an important part of the case”.  Nevertheless he imposed stringent precautions “to safeguard the defendants against any unnecessary risk of dissemination of their process”.  He therefore limited the disclosure (1) to one person within the claimant’s organisation, and (2) ordered that that person should not be involved in the corresponding French litigation.  One reason for the latter condition was the difficulty of obtaining satisfactory compensation if there was misuse abroad. He also required an undertaking from the plaintiffs that they would pay the defendants any sum which the court decided was due as a result of wrongful disclosure of the secret process: see pages 51-2. </p>

This problem occurs in intellectual property proceedings. It is commonplace to deal with the issue of disclosure by establishing 'confidentiality rings' of persons who may see certain confidential material which is withheld from one or more of the parties to the litigation at least in its initial stages. Such claims by their very nature raise special problems which require exceptional solutions. I am not aware of a case in which a court has approved a trial of such a case proceeding in circumstances where one party was denied access to evidence which was being relied on at the trial by the other party." </p>

Under such an approach the first step would inevitably have to be that some limited form of disclosure be afforded to the opposing party.  The court would then have to decide on the basis of submissions and evidence from each side whether the document justified AEO or required more liberal disclosure.  There is no difference in substance between that approach, and the approach where the disclosing party can initially designate documents AEO, subject to the receiving party’s ability to challenge the designation, provided that the disclosing party does not unfairly seek to take advantage of the opportunity. To the extent that Henry Carr J was outlawing the approach adopted in this case, I respectfully disagree. There was in any event, as I have said, no appeal from Mann J’s order. </p>

This explained that the considerations included (i) whether there were contractual obligations to disclose the material only on an AEO basis; (ii) whether the counterparty had requested the designation AEO; (iii) whether it had not been possible to discover whether the counterparty required disclosure on an AEO basis; (iv) bearing in mind that documents containing cross-licences and those that are outright assignments of patents will be of lesser direct relevance; (v) bearing in mind that the risk of inadvertent disclosure or leaking of highly confidential documents to those negotiating with the respondents, or with counterparties to agreements with the respondents, created informational asymmetry; and (vi) recognising that the data are interpreted by experts with limited input from clients. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Against this the judge had evidence from the solicitor for Xiaomi which the judge evaluated.  The judge reminded himself before doing so, at paragraph 31 of his judgment, that it was ultimately for the respondents to justify their use of the AEO designation.  First, Xiaomi had warned against the danger of unjustified and excessive claims to AEO designation.  The judge considered this risk to be met by the principles which he had applied.  Secondly, the point was made that there was no apparent difference between the documents in the AEO category and those in the HCM category. The judge was not impressed by this point.  He considered that, rather than adopt a blanket approach, the validation of the categorisation needed to be considered on a document by document basis.  The disclosure net cast by Mann J’s order had been wide, and the documents would necessarily include some which were of no or only peripheral relevance.  He considered that the respondents were “entitled to make an initial judgment about that, and to decide what (in their view) should be kept as AEO material and subject to legal and expert analysis and what can be disclosed to Xiaomi employees”, all subject to the right of Xiaomi to challenge that initial judgment. Thirdly, Xiaomi pointed out that some of the documents designated as AEO had been disclosed in Dutch proceedings, so that there was no legitimate basis for maintaining the AEO designation.  The judge considered that the terms of the relevant order made it impossible to know the true extent of disclosure in the Dutch proceedings.  Moreover, he should decide the matter according to English rules of procedure, not by reference to what had occurred in the Dutch case. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.00in;text-indent:0.00in">“40. This is, I think, the Xiaomi Defendants’ best point. But I am not convinced that it warrants wholesale redesignation of AEO documents. The content of the SEP licences is of immense commercial sensitivity, particularly as regards those counterparties who (i) might well themselves be negotiating with the Xiaomi Defendants over licences of those or related patents (ii) are competitors of the Xiaomi Defendants implementing the same patents (and whose IP costings are exposed to scrutiny by a competitor).  There are risks in disclosing such material on an AEO basis: but the move from disclosing to external professionals to disclosing to Xiaomi employees (and so transferring the information to the Xiaomi organisation itself) introduces risks of a different order. I express this view without casting doubt upon the integrity of Ms V Wang or Ms X Wang, and simply recognising that once information is inside an organisation there is a substantial risk of a leak whatever internal measures are put in place, with really serious consequences. With third party confidential information (the leakage of which may affect a global market) there is a strong case for holding that information externally and subject to filtering by independent professional lawyers and experts to assess its true materiality to the case in hand, before disclosing it to employees of the party opponent.  </p>

But the right of a party to shape and present its case is not entirely unfettered. As part of its case management powers the Court can exclude an issue from consideration, give directions as to the issues upon which it requires evidence or exclude evidence if the attainment of the overriding objective so requires. Restraints upon disclosure (although grounded in practice rather than directly upon the CPR) are another such tool.”    </p>

The correct test for such a designation was to ask whether nothing short of an AEO designation would sufficiently protect the confidentiality of the document, and the AEO documents did not meet that test.  The matters relied on by the respondents were either irrelevant to the question, or were incapable of supporting an AEO designation.  Ground 2 is that the judge reversed the burden of proof, putting the burden on Xiaomi to demonstrate that the AEO designation was not justified. Ground 3 is that the judge erred in allowing an AEO designation to be maintained over licences which it had either disclosed or been ordered to disclose in the Netherlands. Finally, ground 4 is that the judge fell into error in imposing a condition that Xiaomi could have access to the 6 confidential documents which were re-designated as HCM so long as they gave the undertaking not to be involved in licensing negotiations with counterparties.   </p>

First, the 6 documents which they wished to show to their designated HCM representatives were all one-way licences of patents owned by the claimants or members of the Pool.  None were cross-licences or assignments.  They were not likely, therefore, to disclose information about the value which the counterparties placed on their (the counterparties’) patents.  Secondly, although there were 35 AEO documents, the 6 documents they wished to share involved only 4 counterparties.

In the light of the correspondence shortly before the appeal, however, the respondents had realised that this was not the case, and that Oppo were only asking for the re-designated documents and one HCM document to be seen by their representatives. This enabled the respondents to offer the draft order which had been sent to Oppo’s solicitors, which permitted Oppo’s designated representatives to see that limited class of documents, subject to undertakings to the counterparties.</p>

They drew the line, however, at allowing the individuals in question to see the documents and then go off to negotiate licence agreements with the counterparties. This was for two reasons.  First, Oppo had not put in evidence as to who else was available to see the licences or to negotiate with the counterparties.  If it was important for the existing nominees to continue to be involved in the present proceedings and see the 7 documents, the respondents were prepared to accept that.  The price to be paid, however, was that alternative employees must be found to negotiate with counterparties. Secondly, there existed a further option.  It was not obvious why the nominees needed to see the terms of the licence as opposed to simply the identity of the counterparty.  If the nominees declined to see the licences, they could remain involved in the proceedings and also negotiate with counterparties.   </p>

In imposing the restrictions which he did in paragraph 4.b. of his order the judge was requiring that members of the HCM Club who had access to the “exceptionally wide” class of disclosed HCM documents should not be involved in FRAND litigation and licensing.  Once the membership of the Club was restricted in that way, the judge imposed the additional requirement in relation to the AEO documents of a direct undertaking to the counterparty.  Given the membership of the Club, that additional requirement was not a particularly onerous one: the individuals were not to be involved in licensing anyway.    </p>

Only then would it be possible to contend that the documents are all one-way licences and therefore would not contain information about the counterparty’s portfolio, or are not assignments and so on.  No application on that basis was before the judge, and he cannot be criticised for dealing with it on the footing that the entire content of the HCM category was in play.  That is the short answer to Oppo’s appeal. </p>

The respondents’ position has altered in consequence.  This does not, however, undermine the judge’s judgment as Mr Piccinin at times suggested, throwing the burden on this court to reevaluate it.  It raises a new set of questions about the extent to which the confidentiality of the narrow set of documents justifies the requirement for the direct undertaking to the third parties, the scope and duration of any such undertaking, all in the light of the fact that Oppo’s nominees are engaged, to some extent, in licensing negotiations. </p>

This had the consequence that the court was, in effect, settling what was to be paid by the industry as a whole for the rights in issue, not just what was to be paid by the implementers involved in the particular litigation before it.

In any event, where the agreements had a provision that required an AEO designation, that was usually subject to being overridden by a court order.  It followed that what had been created was a higher tier of confidentiality than that which the parties to the agreements had themselves recognised as appropriate.  That this was so was reinforced by what had happened in the Dutch proceedings.  Even the claimant’s request to the Dutch court did not seek the level of protection which was sought for the AEO documents in the present case.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It seems to me, however, that this principle was recognised by the judge in this case.  The information conveyed by the documents was, by its very nature, of the kind which, once learned, could not be unlearned.  It could be inadvertently disclosed and inadvertently used.  Unless disclosure was confined to professionals, independent from the parties, then a danger of significant collateral damage to third parties was created.  The risk of disclosure is increased where the individuals who received the documents were themselves directly involved in licensing. The judge’s findings at paragraph 14 seem to me amply to satisfy Xiaomi’s test for AEO designation.  Nothing short of AEO designation would sufficiently protect the information. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Nevertheless, as the judge recognised at various points in his judgment, the AEO designation would have to give way to considerations of fairness and the need to do justice in the individual case.  The risk of uncompensatable damage to third parties would be reduced where possible by controlling the constitution and obligations of the HCM Club.  I can see nothing erroneous in this approach. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Xiaomi’s point that an AEO tier had been created when the parties had failed to specify that in their agreements is a somewhat forensic one.   Ultimately the agreements are either entitled to protection because of the information they contain, or they are not.  The judge’s overall conclusion as to the confidentiality of the documents was based on evidence from a number of sources.  It was one that he was entitled to reach. </p>

By allowing lawyers and experts to have access to the documents in the AEO category, an initial filtering exercise was made possible so that the parties themselves could gain access to the documents on suitable terms as required.  Such a staged approach to disclosure is, in my judgment, entirely appropriate and in accordance with principle.   </p>

The focus of this argument is a sentence in paragraph 34 of the judgment where the judge is dealing with an argument by Xiaomi that there was no apparent difference between the type of document in the AEO category and that in the HCM category. The judge explains that the documents as a whole contained documents where the prejudice to third parties was outweighed by the advantage to the Xiaomi defendants’ case, and documents where the opposite was the case.

There was no reason why highly valuable confidential information belonging to third parties should be released more widely in circumstances where it was unlikely to be of importance to Xiaomi’s case.  Unlike Oppo, Xiaomi had not explained what documents it actually needed to see as a result of any initial filtering by its lawyers and experts.  The judge was therefore faced with doing significant, unnecessary and lasting damage to the interests of third parties, without assisting the objective of doing justice at proportionate cost.   </p>

Xiaomi’s application involves re-designating the AEO documents into a private confidentiality club to which only their nominated representatives have access.  It is not concerned with “transparency” in the sense contended for by Xiaomi, namely helping third parties to understand the reasons for arriving at a particular set of licensing terms.   </p>

The importance of a sub-set of the documents does not justify wholesale re-designation. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">There are other points which emphasise why wholesale re-designation is not appropriate.  First, it must be remembered that the 30 documents which remain in the AEO category (after the 6 re-designated at Oppo’s request are removed) are ones which Oppo has confidently discarded as not assisting its case.  It is not suggested to us that Xiaomi’s case is significantly different to Oppo’s.  Secondly, not all the counterparties to the documents are substantial undertakings.  That makes them necessarily less relevant to Xiaomi’s case, which is based on the premise that the 23 MCP Pool Licences are not a good comparable because the counterparties are too small.  Thirdly, 19 of the 30 documents in the AEO are patent assignments, not licences.  Whilst I would not go so far as to say assignments cannot be relevant to the exercise, the process of comparing the terms of an outright assignment with a proposed FRAND per unit licence is likely to be fraught with technical difficulty.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Xiaomi’s third ground of appeal relates to the Dutch proceedings.  Ms Abram submitted that as none of the AEO documents were disclosed in the Dutch proceedings, there is not much that can be deduced from the fact that the respondents did not ask for AEO protection there.  In line with the judge, I do not think there is anything of importance to be drawn from the Dutch case. </p>

I think that if the representatives are free to be involved in FRAND litigation it makes little sense to exclude them from settlement negotiations as a result of litigation.  I would therefore allow Xiaomi’s appeal to the limited extent of substituting for paragraph 5 of the judge’s order an order in the terms attached to the respondents’ solicitors letter of 4 November 2020 with the further clarification I have referred to. </p>

First, the defendants have been required to plead in considerable detail, at a relatively early stage and before issues of liability have been decided, any positive case they propose to run at trial as to what would be FRAND terms. Second, in order to enable them to do so, very extensive disclosure of licences and patent assignments to which the claimants are parties have been disclosed, even though it appears to be common ground that much of this disclosure will ultimately prove to be irrelevant. It may be that there were good reasons for taking this course in the present case, the appropriateness of which is not before us. I do not wish to suggest otherwise. </p>
