He was a black man whose death occurred shortly after he had been in police custody. A neutral summary as to the circumstances of his death is set out in [2] to [6] of the judge’s judgment and can be summarised as follows.  </p>

He had taken prescription medication and consumed some alcohol. When paramedics attended, he was unresponsive and was taken to A &amp; E where he received medication and his condition improved. However he became agitated and was alleged to have slapped a nurse. The first respondent said in a witness statement that this occurred because he was disorientated, frustrated and panicking.  </p>

At 8.35 am, he was taken to a custody area and his handcuffs were removed. He indicated he was feeling unwell and was going to be sick. He was taken to a cell where he could vomit. He was assessed by a nurse and then, at 10.10 am, taken back to the cell by three officers. Whilst this was happening, he freed one of his arms and took hold of a barred gate. The officers forcibly moved him and then restrained him. During this struggle it appears one or more of the officers struck Mr Hall multiple times. He may have struck back. By 10.18 am the officers had restrained him and taken him back to his cell. The nurse observed the later stages of what happened and formed the view he needed to be taken back to hospital.  </p>

A similar application was then made by the Police Federation on behalf of 12 further officers. The application for anonymity was not contested by Mr </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The applications for evidence to be given from behind screens was resisted by the family. The applications were heard by the coroner on 6 June 2019. He had two statements from Inspector Rotchell with his risk assessment, open statements from Officers B, C and E and closed statements from various of the officers. The basis for the application was to ensure the anonymity of the officers on the basis that if they were seen they might be identified and if so, they might be identified by or to Qassim Hall. He is Andrew Hall’s brother but not one of the family members involved in the applications before the coroner or the subsequent judicial review. He has a lengthy criminal record and is well known to the police in Huddersfield. He has a history of making threats.  </p>

He then noted that Mr Hugh Davies QC, counsel for the Chief Constable, submitted that the coroner could determine that giving evidence from behind a screen would be likely to improve the quality of the evidence of the officers he represented because they had a genuine and well-founded fear for the safety of themselves and their families should their identities become known to Qassim Hall. The coroner recorded that Qassim Hall had 76 convictions dating back to 1997 and was the subject of extensive police intelligence in relation to a number of matters which resulted in arrests but no charges being brought. These included an arson attack on an ex-partner’s home, an injunction to keep him away from a vulnerable 16 year old girl, a threat to harm a police officer who had arrested him (and his family) and threats of violence including threats to kill and shoot social workers and a healthcare charity worker, to assault a doctor and to burn down a surgery. He had publicly blamed the police for Andrew Hall’s death and stated that the police “shoot blacks and Asians”.  </p>

She said that to consider these grounds it was first necessary to address the legal framework. She said at [15] that there was no dispute that the principle of open justice is a fundamental principle of common law as applicable in a coroner’s court as in any other court, citing, inter alia, <span style="font-style:italic">R (T) v West Yorkshire Senior Coroner </span>[2017] EWCA Civ 318; [2018] 2 WLR 211. The judge then set out at [16] the different facets of the principle, including the ability of those present in court to see and hear the evidence being given. She stated that she did not consider it particularly helpful to frame any incursion into the principle as only allowed in exceptional circumstances. Her analysis was that: “where there is a balancing exercise to be undertaken, particular weight is to be attached to this fundamental principle and one of the consequences of attaching particular weight to that consideration is that the incursion into openness should be no more than necessary.”  </p>

She said that nonetheless screening was common in criminal trials because the courts had recognised both the needs of vulnerable witnesses and innocent bystanders giving evidence in difficult circumstances and the benefit to the quality of their evidence from being made comfortable. This was not seen as undermining public confidence in the system of justice or the openness of the process. However, she went on to say at [19] that the position here was significantly different. In the case of an inquest such as this the public interest in seeing the police officers, however they were involved, was of a different nature and measure from the public interest in seeing a vulnerable complainant or witness give evidence and the risk of undermining public confidence all the more obvious.  </p>

She said that the coroner must be taken to have in mind the arguments before him even if he did not set out each of them in detail. If he took account of the relevant factors, he could not be said to have misdirected himself in law even if he did not articulate the legal principles in the way the claimant would have formulated them.  </p>

That is the only paragraph in which the coroner makes specific reference to balancing the competing interests of the officers and the family. The exercise which he then undertakes is a binary one in which he weighs the purpose of his decision "as per Rule 18(2)" and the provisions of Rule 18(3)(c). By the purpose of his decision as per Rule 18(2), he appears to mean that the quality of the evidence is likely to be improved by the use of screens (which is itself in the interests of justice) and he weighs against it simply whether the effectiveness of questioning will be impeded by the presence of a screen. That, in my judgment, is too limited a balancing exercise. If those were the only factors to be taken into account, it would have the almost invariable consequence that if a witness genuinely expressed fear but the family of the deceased were able to cross examine, screens would be directed. That would not, and in the present case does not, take into account the interest that the public and the family has in seeing those who may be implicated in the death give evidence - an interest the coroner had already recognised – and it takes no account of the fundamental importance of public confidence in the process of the inquest particularly where the death involved raises issues of more general public concern. </p>

Even if they are able to identify any of the officers, there is no obvious reason why they would identify the officers to Qassim Hall knowing the concern that there is about him.

The judge’s assessment at [64] of the judgment that, if the public were able to see the officers give evidence, there was a real risk of  identification by or to Qassim Hall, but that the family were in a different position, would not stand scrutiny. He had a background of mental instability and there was a real risk that if the family could see the officers give evidence, Qassim Hall would learn that the family had seen the witnesses and seek to obtain information about them, with an increased risk to them of his putting pressure on them to extract that information. Contrary to the judge’s conclusion at [64] and [67] that this was “pure speculation” it was a real risk.

Such an excursion would only be necessary if the tribunal found that, viewed objectively, a risk to the witness's life would be created or materially increased if they gave evidence without anonymity. If so, it should decide whether that increased risk would amount to a real and immediate risk to life. If it would, then the tribunal would ordinarily have little difficulty in determining that it would be reasonable in all the circumstances to give the witnesses a degree of anonymity. That would then conclude the exercise, for that anonymity would be required by article 2 and it would be unnecessary for the tribunal to give further consideration to the matter. If there would not be a real and immediate threat to the witness's life, then article 2 would drop out of consideration and the tribunal would continue to decide the matter as one governed by the common law principles. In coming to that decision the existence of subjective fears can be taken into account, on the basis which I earlier discussed (see paragraph 22). For the same reasons as those which I have set out in paragraph 20, however, I would not regard it as essential in every case to commence consideration of the issue by seeking to identify such subjective fears.” </p>

He said that whilst the judge had recognised that the ruling should not be subjected to minute dissection, that was the outcome which the judgment had produced. The judge had adopted a narrow contextual analysis of the ruling. Whilst it was accepted that the coroner had arguably not gone through a “preflight check list” in relation to the competing interests of open justice on the one hand and the concerns of the officers on the other, Mr Davies QC submitted that the coroner had dealt with the competing interests adequately and the judge had been wrong to substitute her own decision.  </p>

This concerned the balance to be struck between the state’s obligation to protect the officers and the state’s obligation to ensure that the family have access to the extent that that is possible. She submitted that, contrary to the judge’s conclusion, the coroner had engaged in an appropriate balancing exercise and had given important weight to the principle of open justice in particular at [35]-[36] of his ruling, where the reference to “natural justice” was clearly intended to be to “open justice”.

The second is that, although the judge accepted the coroner’s findings on the evidence as to genuine fear and concern of the officers, she then minimised the risks and apostrophised the professional risk assessment of Inspector Rotchell as “wholly speculative” or “pure speculation”.

In answer to the challenge from Mr Thomas QC that there was no evidence addressing that risk, Ms Malcolm QC submitted that this did not mean that the Court was precluded from considering that risk.

She submitted that, in an inquisitorial process such as an inquest, getting the best evidence was of particular significance. It was in the public interest for the best evidence to be available to the fact-finder and that public interest was actively served by making life comfortable for the officers giving evidence. If there was no blame on them, then it was right and proper to protect them. If there was blame, the correct forum for that issue to be resolved was a criminal trial, not the inquest. She submitted that the coroner had to have an eye to the future. If the officers were identified and then threatened or harmed, it was less likely that there would be a full and proper criminal trial. The officers would be less able or willing to give evidence.  </p>

Ms Malcolm QC sought to address that concern in a number of ways.

Any orders for screens were made under inherent common law case management powers. Before the Rules were made, in March 2013 the Ministry of Justice issued a consultation on coroners’ rules and regulations which attached draft Rules. The draft Rule 18 was similar to the current version, except that (i) sub-rule (2) only referred to improving the quality of the witness’s evidence as a basis for a screening determination; and (ii) sub-rule (3) did not make reference to national security interests as a factor in the determination. Following the consultation, the Ministry issued a response paper in which it explained: “We have amended rule 18 to allow the coroner to permit screened evidence only where this would be [i] likely to improve the quality of the evidence, or [ii] is in the interests of justice or [iii] national security.”  The Rules were then laid before Parliament and passed in their current form. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Hough QC submitted that the use of the word “may” in sub-rule (1) indicates that this is a discretionary power. Sub-rule (2) provides for a threshold condition that the discretion can only be exercised if the coroner determines that either giving evidence from behind screens would be likely to improve the quality of the witness’s evidence or “allow the inquest to proceed more expediently”. The “determination” referred to in sub-rule (3) is that determination made under (2) but it requires the coroner to have regard to all the circumstances of the case including the interests of justice and national security. He submitted that, contrary to the judge’s view, “expediently” should be given a relatively broad meaning of “appropriately” and not limited to convenience or practicality. This made internal sense of the Rule and meant that a determination that the giving of evidence from behind screens would allow the inquest to proceed more appropriately was a threshold condition. The consideration of what was most appropriate brings in the wider issues of what is in the interests of justice or national security. </p>

This wider meaning was consistent with the use of the word expedient in other statutory contexts. Thus, the now repealed Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act 1921 permitted the public to be excluded from a hearing if “it is in the public interest expedient so to do for reasons connected with the subject matter of the inquiry or the nature of the evidence to be given.” Section 9A(2)(a) of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 (a section added by amendment after the making of the Rules) provides that a coroner may require a juror to surrender an electronic communications device if the order “is necessary or expedient in the interests of justice”. Mr Hough QC submitted that if “expedient” bore only the narrow meaning of “practical”, it would be an oxymoron in each case.  </p>

On the basis of that evidence and evidence that he blamed the police for his brother’s death, the anonymity orders were made; (iii) the other members of the family had no criminal history and there was no evidence that they posed a threat to the officers; (iv) there was evidence that the officers were fearful of giving evidence if they were identified; and (v) it was common ground that the coroner, the jury and the legal representatives will see the witnesses but that if the general public saw the witnesses there is a real risk of their being identified to Qassim Hall, as the judge found in [64] of her judgment.  </p>

It is to enable the public to understand how the justice system works and why decisions are taken. For this they have to be in a position to understand the issues and the evidence adduced in support of the parties’ cases. In the olden days, as has often been said, the general practice was that all the argument and the evidence was placed before the court orally. Documents would be read out. The modern practice is quite different. Much more of the argument and evidence is reduced into writing before the hearing takes place. Often, documents are not read out. It is difficult, if not impossible, in many cases, especially complicated civil cases, to know what is going on unless you have access to the written material.” </p>

Whilst he accepted that the family was not the decision-maker in the inquest, they play an important part. They could not grieve properly until they were able to look into the eyes of the person who took their relative’s life, as their solicitor Ms Stevens made clear in her witness statement. He emphasised that because this case concerned the death of a black man in custody, there was a belief that the system was weighted against them and there could be a cover-up. There was no good reason why they should not see the witnesses and if they did not, far from being at the heart of the coronial system as the Explanatory Memorandum said, they would feel side-lined.  </p>

Ms Dyer says that she has known for four years who two of the officers are, but she has never identified them to Qassim Hall. The family has made clear that they will not disclose the identity of the officers to him and has provided undertakings to the court.

Rule 18(1) confers a discretion and Rule 18(2) then provides that one of two threshold conditions must be met before the discretion can be exercised: that the coroner determines that giving evidence behind screens would be likely to improve the quality of the evidence or that it would be likely to allow the inquest to proceed more expediently, that is more appropriately.  </p>

On the other hand, if expediency is equated with allowing the inquest to proceed in the most appropriate manner, the coroner can give the proper consideration which (3)(b) requires him to give to the interests of justice and of national security. </p>

The judge repeated this point at [36] where she noted that [44] of the ruling, where he considered all the circumstances of the case, may well be read as having inherent in it a balancing exercise in which the principle of open justice played a part. She concluded at [37] that the difficulty with that reading is [48] of the ruling where she says that having referred to the competing interests of the officers and the family he then engages in a binary exercise considering only (i) the purpose of his decision under Rule 18(2), evidently a reference to his decision that the use of screens would improve the quality of the evidence and (ii) the provisions of Rule 18(3)(c) which provided protection for the family (because Mr Thomas QC will see the witnesses and be able to cross-examine them effectively).

That is not a reference to what follows in [48], which does not consider those competing interests, but to what he has already said elsewhere in the Decision section from [33] onwards about those competing interests. In particular, at [35] the coroner identifies his instinctive concern that the proposition that the family of the deceased who died in circumstances calling into question the discharge by the state of its Article 2 obligations should not see the agents of the state implicated in his death whilst giving evidence offends the principle of “natural justice” (by which he clearly means open justice) and procedural fairness. He goes on at [36] to say the instinct is all the stronger where the application for the use of screens is not based on evidence or intelligence reflecting adversely on the family members most likely to be affected by it.  </p>

It must consider first whether the coroner has misdirected himself in law or has reached a decision not reasonably open to him.

This was itself an important derogation from open justice which was necessary because Qassim Hall, the deceased’s brother, was found to represent a credible threat to the safety of the witnesses and their families if their names were known to him, and because the officers were genuinely fearful for the safety of themselves and their families and, in some cases, that fear was affecting their health. The need for anonymity was not challenged before the coroner and has been accepted by the family. The issue before the coroner was whether those concerns justified a further derogation from open justice, namely the use of screens. Before the coroner the family challenged the need for the use of screens at all, and their submission that witnesses should not be screened from family members (other than Qassim Hall) was merely a fallback position. It is therefore understandable, perhaps, that the principal focus of the coroner’s decision was on whether screens were necessary at all.  </p>

That was because of the risk that if the witnesses were seen by the public, their identity would be disclosed to Qassim Hall. For my part I do not see any want of logic in saying that the witnesses should be screened from the public, but not from the family. If Qassim Hall is indeed anxious to discover the witnesses’ identity, it would not be difficult for him to ask an associate who is familiar with police officers in the Huddersfield area to attend on his behalf. </p>

We have not seen that footage, but we are told that it shows a struggle between Andrew Hall and a number of police officers extending over several minutes, in the course of which officers struck Mr Hall a number of times and there is some evidence of him striking back.

The jury will see a further version of the footage in which there is no pixelation but officers’ names remain “bleeped out”. It follows that the family’s legal representatives will not be hampered in any way in conducting cross examination of the police witnesses by the existence of screens. Moreover, if it were to turn out that there is anything relevant to the cross examination which has been removed in the editing process, the family’s legal representatives will be in a position to cross examine about it, albeit that care will need to be exercised to ensure that what is said does not identify the officers concerned.  </p>

Families consistently express their need to uncover the truth of the circumstances of death and for those involved to be held accountable through the inquest process. Securing the trust of the family, and of the public, is particularly difficult when lethal force has been used by the state. Open justice is vital to assuage both family and public concerns about cover-ups and to ensure confidence in the investigation. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.01in;text-indent:0.50in">There are a number of benefits to families of seeing important witnesses give evidence, especially those state agents who may be responsible for the death in some way. The first is to secure trust in the investigation. Families often feel, when someone is killed by the police or in state custody, that the authorities try to conceal the circumstances of the death. This is partly because the state is powerful and well-resourced, and it often holds all of the relevant evidence. That includes written evidence: most or all of the eye-witnesses in this type of death are often state agents –colleagues of those responsible. This makes it all the more important that the investigation is fully open. If witnesses give evidence behind screens, this will often make families lose trust and confidence in the investigation. They can suspect a cover-up. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.01in;text-indent:0.50in">The second benefit is that families often place a great deal of weight on the demeanour and body language of the witnesses. For example, families at times decide they did not believe a witness because he or she looked ‘shifty’, evasive or arrogant. They form a view of the credibility of the evidence from seeing as well as hearing the witness. This is especially important when the honest belief of the officer or officers who used force determines whether the killing was lawful or not. When families are prevented from seeing a witness because of screens, they can complain they feel unable to tell, from the voice alone, whether the witness was telling the truth. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.01in;text-indent:0.50in">The third benefit is to secure accountability. For a family, seeing the officers who were responsible for a death stand up in the witness box and have to answer questions, is often one of the most powerful ways of holding the state to account. Families are much less likely to feel an officer is being held to account if he or she is merely an anonymous voice hidden behind a screen. </p>

If families feel excluded from the investigation, or have unanswered questions, or are inhibited, because they cannot see the witness, from judging whether the witness acted wrongly, this can make it more difficult for them to come to terms with the death and move on. Deaths in state custody are normally extremely traumatic for families, and the inquest is often a central part of the grieving process.” </p>

As to demeanour, however, it is not the family’s role to determine whether the witnesses are telling the truth, that being the function of the jury, while in any event it has increasingly come to be recognised that demeanour and body language are an unreliable guide to truthfulness </p>

Accordingly the public interest in open justice, including the need to hold state agents to account, is no different in the case of a black man than in any other case.

But I would accept that the death of a black man in police custody gives rise to particularly acute concerns. That is because of the perception which Mr Thomas described. It would be idle to deny that this perception exists. There is no doubt that black communities have in general less confidence in the police than other sections of the community, and that on occasion distrust and lack of confidence have led to racial tensions and conflicts.

It is necessary to consider what difference the use of screens is likely to make, for example whether any improvement in a witness’s evidence is likely to be significant or only marginal and to balance this against the need for open justice. In general, for example, police officers can be expected to have some degree of resilience when giving evidence. In the present case it should not be too difficult for the officers, assisted as they will be by the CCTV footage, to explain what they did and why they did it – as indeed they have already done to the IOPC investigation which cleared them of any wrongdoing. In the case of an important witness, such as a police officer who has used force on a person in custody, the fact that screens would be likely to improve his evidence only marginally (if that were the position) would be unlikely to carry much weight.  </p>

In this case, I consider the best evidence will be given if the officers who are the subject of this application give their evidence from behind screens. Witnesses who are fearful of the consequences of being identified will give more reliable evidence if they know they will not be identified. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.67in;margin-right:0.00in">First, as already noted, the coroner did not treat the need for open justice as a factor to which substantial weight had to be given as a matter of law, in particular in a case concerned with the death of a black man in police custody, so that a powerful justification was needed to override this.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.67in;margin-right:0.00in">Second, the coroner appears to have lost sight of what had previously been his stated starting point, namely his instinctive view that the family should see the witnesses give evidence as a matter of natural justice “in the sense of the fair and impartial application of law and procedure”. Instead, by the time he came to make his decision, his new starting point was that the interests of justice generally were best served by allowing the use of screens when that would enable the witnesses’ best evidence to be given. That was an error in my judgment. The fact that the use of screens would be likely to improve the quality of the witnesses’ evidence was a necessary threshold but in itself was not a sufficient justification for their use. Nor did it establish a rebuttable presumption that screens should be allowed. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.67in;margin-right:0.00in">Third, it is clear that the coroner proceeded on the basis that there was an objectively well-founded risk of harm to the officers or their families from Qassim Hall when, for the reasons which I have explained, he was not entitled to do so. It is to be expected that this is a factor that would have carried considerable weight with him as no judge would wish to expose witnesses or their families to such a risk. Subjective fears, however genuine and even when having consequences on a witness’s health, carry rather less weight.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.67in;margin-right:0.00in">Fourth, while it is obviously desirable that a witness should be able to give his best evidence, there is a distinction between providing for the comfort and allaying the fears of a witness on the one hand and enabling the inquest to obtain the most reliable evidence on the other. So far as obtaining best evidence is concerned, the coroner did not consider whether or to what extent the concerns of the officers which would or might prevent them from giving their best evidence would have a material impact on the ability of the inquest to arrive at reliable conclusions. In the present case what the officers did will be apparent from the CCTV footage. Whether the force which they used was reasonable and proportionate on the one hand or excessive on the other is an objective question, which will likewise depend primarily on the CCTV footage. Their evidence will go mainly to the question whether they had an honest belief in the need to use the force which they used. The coroner did not consider how much difference the presence or absence of screens would make to their ability to give evidence on that issue, which would not necessarily be the same in all cases. The coroner has found that it would make some difference but it is hard to think, at least in some cases, that the difference will be significant. There can be no doubt that the officers will say, as no doubt they have already said to the IOPC investigation, that they honestly believed that their use of force was reasonable, necessary and proportionate in the circumstances as they perceived them to be. Accordingly, while the coroner was entitled to say that obtaining best evidence from the police witnesses was a factor in favour of the use of screens, and while in general the weight to be given to each factor was a matter for him, his decision contained no analysis of what difference the use of screens was likely to make to the ability of the inquest to arrive at the truth. Without such analysis, he was not in a position to decide how much weight to give this factor. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.67in;margin-right:0.00in">Accordingly the balancing exercise which the coroner ought to have carried out would have taken account of the following factors. Militating strongly against the use of screens was the principle of open justice for all the reasons which I have explained. Factors in favour of their use were (1) the subjective fears of the witnesses (which had not been shown to be objectively well-founded), (2) the fact that, in some cases, the witnesses’ health had been affected, (3) the fact that the use of screens was likely to improve the quality of the witnesses’ evidence, but the weight to be given to this factor would require some analysis, as above, and (4) the fact that the use of screens would not impede the effective testing of the witnesses’ evidence. It would also have been sensible to recognise that the order for anonymity and the fact that the officers would be screened from the public would go some way to alleviating any concern.  </p>

For my part, I can see no reason why representatives of responsible media organisations, who can be relied upon not to disclose information to Qassim Hall and to report the unlikely event of any threat being made to them by him, should not be permitted to see the police officers give evidence. That would go some way to promote the objectives served by the principle of open justice. However, I agree that it should be left to the coroner to deal with any application which may be made, or if appropriate to consider the matter on his own initiative. </p>
