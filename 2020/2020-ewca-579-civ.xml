The substantive issues concern the relationship between the statutory provisions concerning the taxation of profits made by partnerships and the taxation of a company’s business where that business includes owning interests in partnerships.  Generally speaking, where a partnership is carried on by persons at least one of which is a company, it is not treated as a separate entity for tax purposes.  According to sections 111 and 114 of the Income and Corporation Tax Act 1988 (‘ICTA’), the profits of the partnership are first calculated for the purposes of corporation tax as if the partnership were a company but then those profits are taxed in the hands of the corporate partners according to their proportionate interests in the partnership.  Where those partners are companies rather than individuals, those companies are also liable for corporation tax on their own business profits under section 42 of the Finance Act 1998.   </p>

Should the profits made by the partnership that have already been taxed in the hands of the partners pursuant to section 114 be left out of account when calculating the profits of the partners’ own businesses so as to ensure compliance with the principle that the same profits should not be taxed as income twice?  If so, how does that principle apply in the instant cases? </p>

They incurred costs referred to as the “Disputed Expenditure”, disputed because one of the main issues in these proceedings is whether all or some of these costs are deductible when computing the profits of IAF and IBP for corporation tax purposes. The Disputed Expenditure was of two kinds. The first kind was the price that the Appellants paid to acquire the interests they bought in the Leasing Partnerships (‘the Acquisition Costs’).  Acquisition Costs were incurred by both IAF and IBP in respect of all seven of the Leasing Partnerships. The second kind of cost was Capital Contributions. This kind of cost was incurred by IAF and IBP only in respect of LAGP and Garrard. Both those partnerships received very substantial capital contributions from IAF and IBP once IAF and IBP had acquired their partnership interests.  There was no capital contribution made to HKP; all the Disputed Expenditure in relation to HKP comprised Acquisition Costs. Shortly after the Appellants acquired their interests in the Leasing Partnerships, the Leasing Partnerships sold off their assets or otherwise terminated or disposed of the leases they held.  As a result, the Leasing Partnerships all received large sums of money which generated profits in their hands. They paid over much of that money to the Appellants.   </p>

The relevant “trading purposes” here are the purposes of the solo financial trades of IAF and IBP rather than the purposes of the 114(2) trades.  The Appellants argued that they were all incurred wholly and exclusively for the purposes of the solo financial trades; HMRC argued that they were incurred in part for the purposes of the 114(2) trades. The FTT held that both the Acquisition Costs and the Capital Contributions were wholly and exclusively incurred for the purposes of the solo financial trades of the Appellants. They therefore decided this issue wholly in favour of the Appellants and against HMRC.  The UT held that the Acquisition Costs were expenses incurred wholly and exclusively for the purposes of the solo financial trades of IAF and IBP but that the Capital Contributions made to Garrard and LAGP were made at least partly for the purposes of the Appellants’ 114(2) trades. Before the UT therefore, HMRC were partially successful on Issue 2. The same did not apply to HKP because for HKP, the Disputed Expenditure comprised only Acquisition Costs and on that HMRC were unsuccessful on Issue 2 when the UT upheld the FTT’s conclusion that all the Acquisition Costs were wholly and exclusively incurred for the purposes of the solo financial trades.

This is the procedural issue about the scope of an appeal in respect of a closure notice issued by HMRC.  As I mentioned earlier, when HMRC issued the closure notices which are the subject of this appeal, they sent a covering letter which set out an alternative analysis of IAF’s and IBP’s tax affairs which would in fact lead to more tax being due than was asserted by the adjustment to the figures in the tax returns.

At issue here is whether HMRC can put forward alternative adjustments to the figures; one adjustment which is included in the closure notice but then also alerting the taxpayer to HMRC’s possible future reliance on an alternative construction of the law which would lead to a figure being included in the taxpayer’s return which is different both from the figure that the taxpayer included when it lodged the tax return and from the adjustment figure that HMRC included in the closure notice.  The Appellants accept that they were given adequate notice of the alternative analysis and that there was no procedural unfairness to them in letting HMRC rely on the alternative point.  But they say on the proper construction of the statutory provisions governing the issue of closure notices and the jurisdiction of the FTT on an appeal challenging a closure notice, it is not open to HMRC to argue for a different adjustment from the one made by the closure notice.   </p>

This is the alternative “Scenario 1” analysis that was set out by HMRC in the covering letter. It can be summarised as whether HMRC were right to suggest in the covering letter that, assuming that all the income and expenditure to be included in the solo financial trades and deriving from the 114(2) trades is revenue in nature, are the tax computations of the two trades to be entirely separate or does there need to be some adjustment to prevent the corporate partner effectively being taxed twice on the same income?  HMRC initially disputed that the no double taxation principle had any application here.  They argued (as they had explained in the covering letter) that if there were two trades, each had to be taxed separately and the no double taxation principle was not engaged by the fact that the profits on which IAF and IBP were taxed in their capacity as partners in the Leasing Partnerships also made their way into the solo financial trades as income and so needed to be included in computing the taxable profits of those solo financial trades. The FTT and the UT both held in favour of the Appellants that the no double taxation principle did apply here. Putting it neutrally they held that the principle operated to leave some or all of the money that the solo financial trades derived from the Leasing Partnership trades out of account when the profits of the solo financial trades were being computed for tax purposes.   </p>

The double negative means that only sums which <span style="font-weight:bold">are</span> wholly and exclusively incurred for the purposes of the trade can be deducted.  The parties agree that the test as to whether an item of expenditure is wholly and exclusively incurred for the purpose of a particular taxpayer is that set out by the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Vodafone Cellular Ltd v Shaw </span>[1997] STC 734 (‘<span style="font-style:italic">Vodafone</span>’). That case concerned the deductibility of a payment made by the taxpayer in order to bring to an end an onerous fee agreement to which it was a party and which was likely to generate a heavy drain on the taxpayer’s annual income.  On the question of whether the payment was made wholly and exclusively for the purposes of the taxpayer’s trade, Millett LJ (with whom Hirst LJ and Sir John Balcombe agreed) said that the question whether a payment was wholly and exclusively incurred for the purposes of the taxpayer’s trade was a question of fact for the Commissioners and the court could only interfere with that finding if the Commissioners made an error of law in reaching their conclusion.  At p. 742, Millett LJ derived the following principles from the leading modern cases, in particular <span style="font-style:italic">Mallalieu v Drummond</span> [1983] AC 861:  </p>

They do not mean for the purposes of the taxpayer but for the purposes of the trade, which is a different concept. A fortiori they do not mean for the benefit of the taxpayer.  (2) To ascertain whether the payment was made for the purposes of the taxpayer's trade it is necessary to discover his object in making the payment. Save in obvious cases which speak for themselves, this involves an inquiry into the taxpayer's subjective intentions at the time of the payment. (3) The object of the taxpayer in making the payment must be distinguished from the effect of the payment. A payment may be made exclusively for the purposes of the trade even though it also secures a private benefit. This will be the case if the securing of the private benefit was not the object of the payment but merely a consequential and incidental effect of the payment. (4) Although the taxpayer's subjective intentions are determinative, these are not limited to the conscious motives which were in his mind at the time of the payment. Some consequences are so inevitably and inextricably involved in the payment that unless merely incidental they must be taken to be a purpose for which the payment was made.” </p>

The Commissioners had found that the evidence showed that the directors of the taxpayer did not distinguish in their own minds between the business of the taxpayer and the business of its subsidiary companies.  The directors thought of the group as a single trading entity.  Further, the burden of paying the fees under the onerous agreement would more likely fall on the subsidiary companies than on the taxpayer because the taxpayer was entitled under the arrangements between the taxpayer and its subsidiaries to be reimbursed by its subsidiaries for any payments made under the fee agreement. Those factors meant that the payment made by the taxpayer to the third party to terminate the fee agreement was incurred not only for the purposes of the taxpayer’s trade but also for the purposes of the trades of the other companies in the group. </p>

One must still distinguish between the purpose of the trade of the parent company and that of the subsidiaries because they are different taxable persons. Millett LJ held first that there was no evidential basis for the Commissioners’ finding of fact that the subsidiaries were liable to reimburse the taxpayer for the fees that the taxpayer paid to the third party. That was an error that could be corrected applying the <span style="font-style:italic">Edwards v Bairstow </span>test.  That finding had not been critical to the determination of the Commissioners.  It was the oral and documentary evidence before the Commissioners that the directors of the taxpayer company regarded it and its two subsidiaries as one functioning trading entity that had been critical to the Commissioners’ conclusion that the purpose of the directors of the taxpayer company in agreeing to make the cancellation payment was to benefit the trading position of the whole group.  </p>

The object the directors were seeking to achieve was the cancellation of the fee agreement. It was only the taxpayer company that was liable under that fee agreement to the third party; “ergo, the directors’ intention, whether articulated or not, was exclusively to serve the purposes of the taxpayer company’s trade”. The true and only reasonable conclusion from the facts found by the Commissioners contradicted their determination and the appeal was therefore allowed.  Hirst LJ in a short concurring judgment also emphasised that the Commissioners are the judges of fact and that the scope for interfering with their decision was strictly circumscribed. However, he was also satisfied that the court could and should intervene in that case. The correct approach was to examine the findings of primary fact to see whether they were sufficient to support the conclusion which they eventually reached. For the reasons given by Millett LJ, he agreed that they were not. </p>

The FTT thought that the conclusion they arrived at followed inevitably from the earlier findings that the Appellants had never intended that the Leasing Partnership trades would be conducted for any stand-alone benefit.  The FTT summarised the evidence of the witnesses (para. 60).  The evidence was that the Appellants were only interested in short-term roles in complex and novel transactions. For those in the banking department within the Appellants, the way in which the receivables might be held was irrelevant.  They saw themselves as buying receivables at a discount and making a trading profit. At para. 64 the FTT recognised that it was unrealistic to regard the acquisition of the partnership interests (as opposed to acquiring the lease assets directly) as being irrelevant; on the contrary it was a crucial part of the tax planning designed to avoid IAF and IBP being paid the various receivables directly.  At para. 65, however, the FTT accepted the evidence from the Appellants’ witnesses as “fundamentally realistic”. Their sole aim in all the transactions was to effect the pre-planned and pre-contracted steps by which the value of the partnership assets would be realised and distributed to them.

They noted that it was common ground that this is an issue of fact and therefore the FTT’s decision could only be overturned on <span style="font-style:italic">Edwards v Bairstow</span> grounds.  Before the UT, HMRC were challenging the FTT’s decision in respect of both the Acquisition Costs and the Capital Contributions arguing that none of this money was wholly and exclusively incurred for the benefit of the solo financial trades of IAF and IBP.  The UT held that as regards the sums paid to acquire the partnership interests, there was no flaw in the FTT’s reasoning: para 56. But the position was different for the sums paid by way of Capital Contributions. The Capital Contributions made by IAF and IBP as partners of Garrard were made to enable the <span style="font-style:italic">partnerships</span> to purchase assets which were either already leased or leased subsequently or to pay off loans. The UT accepted that the FTT was entitled to find as a fact that the Appellants’ ultimate objective in making the Capital Contributions was that IAF and IBP would profit in their solo financial trades once the leasing businesses were all brought to an end.

This was not an incidental consequence, it was central to the way in which the Garrard and LAGP transactions were carried out. In the case of Garrard, it was the capital contributions by the partners which enabled the partnership to acquire assets which enable distributions and profits to be made in the case of LAGP, it was the capital contributions by the partners which enable the partnership to acquire the leasing business. The FTT held (at [98]) that these contributions were “effectively part of the purchase price of the partnership interests”, but the leasing business was acquired subsequently effectively using the capital provided by IAF and IBP. In both cases, therefore, the FTT erred in law, because its conclusion was contrary to its own findings of fact.” </p>

The attitude of the banking staff as found by the FTT here has the same relevance or lack of it as the Vodafone directors’ attitude regarding the corporate group as a single trading entity.

For some reason that the Appellants were not able to explain, the vendor of the partnership interests stipulated in the contract for sale that the debt owed by LAGP be paid off by the new owner.  These costs should therefore be regarded as Acquisition Costs. The same does not apply to the Capital Contributions to Garrard since there was no such contractual requirement. I do not consider that the fallback position in relation to the LAGP contributions assists the Appellants.  The contractual obligation to make the Capital Contribution to pay off LAGP’s debts may or may not explain why it was made but it does not assist in determining the purpose of the payment when it was made.   </p>

Para. 3 empowers HMRC to require a company to deliver a company tax return which must include a declaration by the person making the return that the return is correct and complete to the best of his knowledge. The company tax return must include a selfassessment of the amount of tax payable taking into account any relief or allowance for which a claim is included in the return (para. 7 of Sch 18).  HMRC may enquire into a company tax return by giving notice to the company of their intention to do so. A return which has been the subject of a notice of enquiry may not be the subject of another such notice, unless that second enquiry is prompted by an amendment of the return made by the company (para. 24). An enquiry into a company tax return extends to anything contained in the return or required to be contained in the return, including any claim included in the return or any amount that affects or may affect the tax payable (para. 25). After notice of enquiry has been given, HMRC may amend the self-assessment before the enquiry is completed if they form the opinion that the amount of tax payable according to the company’s self-assessment is insufficient and that delay may lead to a loss of tax to the Crown. An appeal may be brought against an amendment of a company’s self-assessment in those circumstances (para. 30). When an enquiry is ongoing, any question arising in connection with the subject matter of the enquiry may be referred to the tribunal for determination; this can happen more than once during the course of an enquiry (para. 31A).   </p>

The case concerned a closure notice issued under section 28A TMA which deals with the closure of an enquiry into a selfassessment tax return filed by an individual rather than a company. Section 31(1)(b) TMA provides that an appeal may be brought against any conclusion stated or amendment made by such a closure notice. This wording is different from that in para. 34(3) of Schedule 18 which refers only to an appeal being brought against the amendment of the company’s return.

Before the Special Commissioner, HMRC abandoned that position and sought to argue that the relief was allowable but that a similar amount was taxable under the accrued income scheme in section 713 of ICTA. The taxpayer contended that the Revenue could not change the basis of their conclusion as stated in the closure notice.

Under the previous regime, appeals against assessments could raise any new issue subsequent to the assessment, subject only to the constraints of proper case management. Self-assessment was different. He also noted at para. 10 that the stipulation in section 31(1)(b) that an appeal may be brought against the conclusion or amendment in the closure notice and the wording of section 50(6) and (7) requiring the appeal commissioner to determine whether the taxpayer is over or undercharged did not appear to fit well together. That did not, however, mean that the Commissioners should consider the overall tax result arising from the whole of the return. The logical end of that contention would be that if the Revenue came to a conclusion about a trading profit which the taxpayer appealed, there was nothing to prevent the Revenue from contending that the taxpayer was liable to more tax on something quite different, such as rent. That was not the correct reading of the provisions. Parliament had enacted a system under which the Revenue had to state a conclusion and make an amendment against which an appeal could be brought, necessarily limited to that conclusion or amendment: </p>

He described the conclusion in the closure notice before him as having been very specific, so that the scope of the appeal concerned the particular transactions in gilts “and nothing else” (para. 11). As to the law, he considered that it was inherent in the appeal system that the Commissioners must form their own view of the law without being restricted to what the Revenue stated in their conclusion or the taxpayer stated in the notice of appeal. Either party could change their legal arguments subject to the Commissioners using their case management powers to prevent an ambush. He decided therefore that although he took a narrower view than that contended for by the Revenue, the Revenue were permitted to raise a new argument of law “related to the facts identified by the closure notice” (para.15).  </p>

In that case HMRC had rejected a claim for a capital allowance in respect of the taxpayer’s purchases of software pursuant to section 45 of the Capital Allowances Act 2001. The allowance applied to expenditure incurred by a small enterprise on IT software.  Subsection 45(4) precluded such an allowance if the expenditure was incurred with a view to granting another person the right to use the software. During the course of an enquiry, HMRC argued that the allowance was disallowed by subsection 45(4). The taxpayer pressed HMRC to close the enquiry. The subsequent closure notice stated simply that the claim for relief under section 45 CAA was excessive and amended the partnership return substituting a nil capital allowance and a nil allowable loss. The covering letter sent with the closure notice stated that the allowance was disallowed by section 45(4).  </p>

Like Dr Avery Jones in <span style="font-style:italic">D’Arcy</span>, Moses LJ contrasted the current system with the earlier system before selfassessment when everything covered by an assessment was within the scope of an appeal and the assessment could be increased on account of something not in contemplation at the time it was made. By contrast, a self-assessment constitutes the final determination of liability to tax except for limited circumstances such as where the taxpayer amends his return or the Revenue opens an enquiry and amends the return in accordance with the closure notice.  The new regime of self-assessment greatly limited the Revenue’s power to impose additional tax liabilities or recover excessive reliefs. Moses LJ noted the rejection in <span style="font-style:italic">D’Arcy </span>of a submission from HMRC that once there is an appeal, the Commissioners’ jurisdiction is unconfined. It is implicit in the statutory scheme, he held, that an appeal is confined to the subject matter of the conclusions and any amendments stated in the closure notice. These provisions underlined the finality of the self-assessment.  </p>

The public interest in determining the amount on which the taxpayer ought to be taxed had, he said, in no way been altered by the introduction of self-assessment. However, section 50 must be read in the context of the new provisions - it all depends on what one means by the “subject matter”.

In those circumstances, I think it would be wrong for the court to attempt to do so. Any statement of principle is likely to condemn both taxpayer and the Revenue to too rigid a straitjacket.

He concluded that the statute looks to the FTT to identify the subject matter of the enquiry. The appeal is confined to the subject matter of the enquiry and of the conclusions but the jurisdiction on appeal is not limited to the issue of whether the reason for the conclusion is correct. Having described the correspondence and the closure notice issued to the taxpayer, Moses LJ concluded that although the issue that had arisen under section 45(4) was the issue that had prompted the inspector to issue his closure notice, that issue was not the subject matter of the enquiry nor the conclusion stated in the closure notice. Accordingly the closure notice did not have the effect of limiting the appeal to that single issue: para. 53. The subject matter of the appeal as identified by the Special Commissioner was whether the claim under section 45 was excessive.  Scott Baker LJ agreed with Moses LJ, stating that his analysis met the point that in principle the taxpayer ought to be taxed to pay the correct amount of tax. A narrower construction of what is in play in an appeal against a closure notice is likely to create some situations in which the taxpayer is either unfairly penalised or is not taxed as the legislation intended. Arden LJ came to a different conclusion and would have dismissed the appeal on this point.  </p>

This should not be taken as an encouragement to officers of HMRC to draft every closure notice that they issue in wide and uninformative terms. In issuing a closure notice an officer is performing an important public function in which fairness to the taxpayer must be matched by a proper regard for the public interest in the recovery of the full amount of tax payable. In a case in which it is clear that only a single, specific point is in issue, that point should be identified in the closure notice. But if, as in the present case, the facts are complicated and have not been fully investigated, and if their analysis is controversial, the public interest may require the notice to be expressed in more general terms.

At para. 115 the FTT noted that the scope of the subject matter of the adjustments in the closure notice was implicitly a “somewhat broader topic” than the adjustments themselves. The present case was a good example of the significance of that distinction. The Appellants argued for a narrow ambit of matters that may be disputed. The FTT went on: </p>

I would also go part of the way with the Appellants in accepting that the FTT does not have an unlimited discretion when determining what is “the matter to which an appeal relates” for the purposes of section 49I(1)(a) TMA or “the matter in question” for the purposes of section 49G(4) TMA.  In their covering letter HMRC could have indicated that they might open up entirely different areas of the Appellants’ tax returns if the closure notice were appealed to the tribunal. The fact that the Appellants had been warned about those potential challenges being raised would not, in my view, empower the FTT to treat those issues as within the scope of the appeal.  According to para, 34(3) of Schedule 18 FA 1998, an appeal may be brought against an amendment of a company’s return. It seems to me that “the matter to which the appeal relates” for the purposes of section 49I(1)(a) must be that amendment and the amendment is therefore the “matter in question” which the tribunal is required to determine by section 49G(4) TMA.  That then restricts the ambit of the appeal at the conclusion of which the tribunal may decide that there has been an overcharge or an undercharge and so make a reduction or an increase in the assessment pursuant to section 50(6) or (7) as appropriate.  There is a limit on the jurisdiction of the FTT which is not simply a matter of ensuring procedural fairness. Any purported exercise by the FTT of a broader power to consider matters beyond that would be an error of law. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">The authorities do not support a narrow construction of those key phrases in sections 49I and 49G and they establish that the FTT is the appropriate stage at which the scope of the matter in question in the appeal is to be determined. The FTT is a specialist tribunal and an appellate court should not interfere with that decision unless it is clearly outside the scope of the statutory provisions.  There are, as Moses LJ recognised, likely to be boundary issues whatever the test to be applied.  Those issues are much more likely to be problematic and time-consuming if a narrow view is adopted. This became apparent during argument when trying to establish the limits of any appeal in this case.  Mr Peacock had to accept that legal arguments can be deployed which were not referred to in the closure notice. He also had to accept that the outcome of any particular appeal may be that the tax liability is something different from the figure for which either side was contending if, as in the present case, the tribunal accepts some but not all of one party’s arguments.  He insisted however that the taxpayer should be able to challenge a closure notice without taking the risk that he would end up paying more tax than the adjustment made by the closure notice. That cannot be right, not least because as Mr Peacock was pushed to submit, it might lead to a situation where HMRC considered there were two possible constructions of the relevant legislation and were forced to adopt a closure notice based on the construction that resulted in the most tax being payable, even if they thought the arguments in support of that construction were far weaker than the arguments in favour of the construction leading to a lower adjustment.  Such a construction of the provisions would simply multiply the number of appeals. </p>

There are other checks and balances in the scheme here designed to protect the taxpayer. Those protections are the time limit imposed on HMRC in opening an enquiry, the fact that only one enquiry can be opened into any one tax return and the ability of the taxpayer to seek a direction for the issue of a closure notice. A narrow confinement of the subject matter of the appeal is not intended to be one of the protections conferred on the taxpayer. The “venerable principle” is also an important underlying factor in any tax matter. I accept HMRC’s submission that proceedings before the FTT are not simply a dispute between two private parties and the venerable principle has a role to play here as the courts have found in the three cases which were cited to us.  </p>

It is for the First-tier Tribunal to decide what the subject matter of the closure notice is within the bounds I have described.  They are best placed to determine whether the context of the closure notice and the surrounding circumstances demonstrate that the subject matter is broader than the particular conclusion and adjustments addressed in the closure notice. If that is the case, it should be open to HMRC to put forward arguments in any appeal even if they result in a larger amount of tax being due, provided that the different arguments all deal with the same matters in question identified in the closure notice.  Although it is accepted that this case goes beyond the point decided in <span style="font-style:italic">Tower MCashback </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">Fidex</span>, I do not regard those cases as requiring a bright line to be drawn.

The taxpayer in that case, F S Securities, carried on the trade of a finance company buying and selling shares.  It bought the entire share capital of three companies whose assets consisted almost entirely of cash resources.  It caused the companies to transfer those assets to it by way of dividend from the accumulated profits which had borne tax and then, since the shares fell in value as a result of that transfer, FS Securities sold the shares at a loss. In drawing up the profit and loss account for income tax purposes for its own business, F S Securities left out of account the dividends received.  The Commissioners allowed the deduction of the loss but then issued a direction that the income of the taxpayer could be deemed, in the particular circumstances of the company, to be the income of its members and apportioned to them accordingly.  Whether the Commissioners were entitled to do that turned on whether F S Securities was indeed an investment company; that turned on whether the dividends received by F S Securities were investment income or were trading receipts of its business to be charged to tax under Schedule D Case 1.  Before the House of Lords therefore it was HM Revenue arguing that the dividends should be left out of the trading receipts of F S Securities when computing its Schedule D liability because if they were not trading receipts, they had to be investment income and if they were investment income then F S Securities must be an investment company and could be made the subject of an apportionment direction.  </p>

The issue before the Appellate Committee was whether the same rule must apply to dividends that had been paid under deduction of tax. Lord Reid recognised that if the words of the Income Tax Act were applied literally the result would be double taxation of the same income, but, he observed, “it has been said again and again that the Act cannot be so read as to authorise that” (p. 644E).  He held that the dividends did not enter into the computation of F S Securities profits for the purposes of Schedule D; they were not charged to tax under Schedule D and must therefore be investment income. </p>

If there was little if any income in the solo financial trades apart from the profits of the 114(2) trades, and if those profits were to be left out of account, the deduction of the Disputed Expenditure in the solo financial trades would result in a substantial loss for those trades.

They described the issue as “whether the partnership profits should be subjected to tax assessments?”: see the heading to para. 76.  The UT noted that it was accepted by HMRC that all of the relevant accounts were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting practice. A complicating factor when trying to understand the accounts and the tax computations was that the accounting treatment of LAGP and HKP differed from that of Garrard.  In the case of LAGP and HKP the appropriate shares of the partnership profits were brought into account in the solo financial trades on a “look through” basis whereas in the case of Garrard the distributions were brought into account on a “nonlook through” basis.

In their skeleton argument HMRC had noted that some of the moneys paid by Garrard to IBP were by way of repayment of the Capital Contributions and these were of a different character and quality from the trading receipts. As I read that paragraph, HMRC were not at that stage arguing that the outcome of the appeal on this point might be different for the two kinds of payment.

Again, that common ground was recorded by the UT but not explained further.  It was also accepted by HMRC at the second hearing that the repayment/distribution distinction was only an ‘academic’ point as regards Garrard and LAGP. This was because Issue 4 had only been presented by HMRC as a fall back argument if they failed on Issue 2 but they had succeeded in part on Issue 2 when the UT held that the Capital Contributions were not deductible. Considering the ‘academic’ matter briefly, the UT decided that there was a distinction. They referred to the Capital Contribution of £62.7 million made to IBP by Garrard and concluded at para 13: </p>

In our view it does not. It may help to illustrate the point by two examples. First, suppose Garrard had used the £62.7 million to buy assets from IBP which cost IBP £60 million. IBP’s accounts would show a profit of £2.7 million. But on Investec’s argument IBP would be treated as making a loss of £60 million for tax purposes because its receipt of £62.7 million would be disregarded. Secondly, suppose that IBP had previously lent Garrard £62.7 million and Garrard used the £62.7 million in question to repay that loan to IBP. On Investec’s argument IBP’s receipt of £62.7 million would again have to be disregarded. What these examples show, we think, is that it is not sufficient that the money received by IBP derived from money received by Garrard which contributed to Garrard’s taxable profits.” </p>

There being no other accounting entry for the solus trade, section 42 would then have the effect that, for that trade, the taxable profit was nil; and since the profits or income of the partnerships had not been brought into account in arriving at that figure of nil, there would be no requirement to deduct any amount on the basis that it was profit which had already been taxed.” </p>

They invited the parties to restore the appeal for further argument. In the Second Decision, in relation to the difference of accounting treatment, the UT identified what appeared to be a discrepancy between the description of the accounting treatment for LAGP in the SOAF and the FTT’s conclusions at para. 144 of the FTT Decision. The FTT appeared to have thought that ‘the very profits’ that had been brought into account for the 114(2) trades were, by reason of the look through method, also brought into account in the solo financial trades.  This seemed to be at odds with the description of the look through method in the SOAF which referred to the profit earned by each company being ‘the excess of the fair value of the lease receivables over the aggregate of the cost of its partnership interest and the cost of its capital contributions”. The UT recognised that the apparent mismatch might have arisen because the issue of precisely what was recorded in the accounts had not been raised either before the FTT or the UT. The issue could not be resolved because it required a factual determination which the FTT had not made.  The matter would have to be remitted to the FTT if it needed to be resolved.  However, because HMRC had been partially successful on Issue 2 in relation to LAGP, the UT considered that HMRC was precluded from relying on Issue 4 as regards LAGP.  As regards HKP, the discrepancy between the SOAF and the FTT’s findings arose in relation to HKP as they arose in relation to LAGP and could not be resolved by the UT.  HMRC had been wholly unsuccessful on Issue 2 in relation to HKP so were entitled to rely on Issue 4.  The outcome of the Second Decision was therefore that:  </p>

The UT had recognised that the second matter at least require further evidence and fact-finding and so, the Appellants say, it was wrong for the UT to raise them.  On the substance, the Appellants also argue that the UT was wrong in para. 13 of the Second Decision to hold that the no double taxation principle was not engaged in respect of the capital repayments made by Garrard.  The UT was also wrong, they say, to conclude that the method of drawing up the statutory accounts for the solo financial trades had any relevance to the proper tax computations.  Mr Peacock described the point remitted to the FTT as a non-question because the accounting concepts adopted in the drawing up of the companies’ accounts as required by the Companies Act are entirely different from the tax computations.  The statutory accounts did not for example distinguish between the solo financial trades and the 114(2) trades at all.

Under the heading “HMRC’s Primary Contentions” the speaking note focuses entirely on the accounting treatment adopted by the Appellants in respect of LAGP and HKP. HMRC contend that their analysis of the “look through” accounting method adopted by the Appellants shows that the income derived in the solo financial trades “did not consist of the same income as the actual rental income realised by them qua partners”, that is to say the income included in their 114(2) trades tax computation.  Turning to Garrard, HMRC say that they agree with the conclusion in the Second Decision that the solo financial trade accounts accurately record the only real profit arising on the Garrard transaction, that is the receipts of the sale of assets by Garrard to Lombard. The receipt by IBP of the repayment of capital from Garrard was, HMRC say, a completely discrete transaction from the receipt of cash by Garrard from Lombard on the sale of the assets.  </p>

First, as I have explained in my discussion of Issue 2,<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>applying the test in <span style="font-style:italic">Vodafone</span>, it is clear to me that the Capital Contributions were not incurred wholly and exclusively for the purposes of the Appellants’ solo financial trades.  I do not see how one can arrive at a different answer to that question simply by adopting what is now HMRC’s primary contention. HMRC have not explained why the consequence of that primary contention is that the appeal on Issue 2 must be allowed in relation to all the Leasing Partnerships. I am concerned that the speaking note does not truly set out a defensible approach but is designed to justify HMRC jettisoning their success on Issue 2 because they have now decided that they prefer their primary contention. It appears that HMRC accept, for the purposes of these appeals at least, that the statutory accounts drawn up by the Appellants properly treated all the Disputed Expenditure as deductible revenue expenses.  That must always have been the case and yet HMRC have, thus far, asserted that the Capital Contributions were not deductible for the purposes of the tax computation.   </p>

They argue that these principles combine to brush aside any procedural problems arising from them changing their case. I agree those principles are important - that is why I would dismiss the Appellants’ appeal on Issue 3. But those principles cannot be pushed too far.  They do not entitle HMRC to change their case at will and resile from concessions that were common ground before the UT.  It was clear at the hearing that Mr Peacock had had no warning of the significant shift of position contained in the HMRC speaking note and his submissions on the first day of the hearing were directed at the agreed list of issues.  Mr Tallon then argued a different case leaving Mr Peacock to respond as best he could in the short time left for his reply at the end of the hearing.  It would not be fair on the Appellants for HMRC to be allowed to re-focus the case in this way.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">Finally, HMRC argue that they should be allowed to change tack because the proceedings so far have only been deciding issues of principle.  The FTT was only invited to make a decision in principle that the no double taxation principle applied.  It did not determine the application of that principle in the present case.  Since the FTT is still seized with the appeals and will need to consider the detail of the application on the facts, there is no harm in allowing the case to be reargued in a different manner on remittal. I do not accept that argument.  It is true that the FTT stated at para. 8 of their decision that they were deciding issues of principle rather than seeking to decide the amounts of assessable profits. But they recorded at para. 159 that what remained was for the parties to agree the detailed figures.  If the parties were unable to agree the detailed calculations, then a further hearing might be needed. That does not indicate to me that the FTT thought it was leaving open significant issues of contention.  One cannot decide whether the no double taxation principle operates entirely in a vacuum; the FTT’s decision was that it did apply on the basis of the facts and arguments presented to them as pertaining to these particular partnerships.  It is not open to HMRC now to argue that the application of the principle, which they now accept, has no practical effect here because of arguments that they did not put forward at those earlier stages of the proceedings.  </p>

There is force in the argument made by the Appellants that the two examples given in para. 13 are not proper analogies.  If the money had been paid by Garrard to IBP not as repayment of capital but either as the purchase price for an asset sold by IBP to Garrard or as the repayment of a loan previously made by IBP to Garrard then the treatment of that money both in the tax calculations in respect of Garrard’s trade under section 114 and in respect of IBP’s solo financial trade would have been different.  It might then have been argued that the money was not coming from a taxed fund in the hands of Garrard so that the no double taxation principle explained in <span style="font-style:italic">F S Securities </span>did not apply.

They say that the main income in the statutory accounts of Garrard was the receipt of £63.3 million from the sale to Lombard of the bulk of Garrard’s lease receivables.  That was income in Garrard’s hands but thereafter, they say, “its nature as income is spent and it simply represents a receipt of cash by Garrard”.

The dividends that were in dispute in that case derived from income of the three companies in which the taxpayer had bought shares (one of which appears to have been a wool merchant). Those three companies earned that income presumably in the course of a myriad of transactions with third parties.  It fed into the calculation of their profit which was then taxed in their hands and the franked dividends were then paid to the taxpayer. The payment of the dividends was a completely different transaction between different parties from the transactions by which the income had been earned but the House of Lords still held that the no double taxation principle applied and the dividends were not taxable as income in the hands of the taxpayer shareholder.  </p>

There is no basis for remitting the Garrard transactions to the FTT.  The outcome of these proceedings so far as the tax treatment of Garrard is concerned is that the no double taxation principle applies to exclude from the computation of the income of the Appellants’ solo financial trades the amount of the profit that is already taxed in their 114(2) trades.  In computing the profit of the solo financial trades the Capital Contributions made by IAF and IBP to Garrard are not deductible from any other income in the solo financial trades for the purposes of the section 42 tax computations but the Acquisition Costs are deductible. </p>

HMRC argue now that the effect of the “look through” basis of statutory accounts was this.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">That profit was not a distribution or other payment made by the partnership but rather the difference between the fair value of the assets in the partnerships (presumably determined by an appropriate valuation exercise) and the (lower) price paid for those interests by IAF and IBP to the previous retiring partners.  That fair value of the receivables was then taken to the balance sheet. When actual distributions were made, their value was also taken to the balance sheet to set against the fair value. That reflected the fact that the fair value had now been converted into cash.  HMRC wish to argue that the “look through” method therefore records a different item in IAF’s and IBP’s statutory accounts; it is the value of the underlying receivables rather than the profits made by the partnerships when they receive the rental income under the leases. There is nothing in the solo financial trades accounts therefore that reflects the profit made in partnership.  </p>

Mr Tallon suggested in his submissions that the UT had been describing the correct position in paras. 21 and 22 of the Second Decision but I do not accept that.  Neither the FTT nor the UT explained what they understand the “look through” method to require. They appear to have assumed that the result of the “look through” method was that the Appellants’ accounts would reflect the receipts of the partnership businesses in precisely the same way as the partnership’s own accounts did.  On this point, therefore I agree with the Appellants that it was wrong of the UT to raise this point and that it would be wrong for this court to allow HMRC to rely on the primary contention put forward for the first time in the speaking note and post-hearing note.   </p>

There was no expert evidence either agreed or contested about the statutory accounts and their relationship with the tax computations under sections 114 and 42.

They also pointed to some brief descriptions of the accounting process in the Appellants’ written material, drafted before this became a significant issue.  An appellate court would be very rash to rely on such a rapid and piecemeal walk through the documents. Even so, there are indications in HMRC’s speaking note of unanswered questions about the formulation of the statutory accounts.  For example, HMRC say they do not understand why the loss of £304,000 recorded in the statutory accounts for Garrard was entirely allocated to IBP rather than split between IBP and IAF: para 4. HMRC note that the information they have about statutory accounts entries for LAGP is less detailed than that given for HKP. HMRC submit that this court should “assume” that the LAGP accounting treatment mirrors that of HKP and say that “it is reasonable to suppose” that the distributions to LAGP will have been taken to its balance sheet in the same way as those for HKP.  I do not see that we can make that assumption given that HKP raised other issues about foreign tax credits that we have not had to consider (former Issue 6).  Moreover, the tax computations made by IAF and IBP were drawn up on the basis that they were correct in their original contention before the FTT that they carried on one trade rather than two.  Although the Appellants did not appeal against that part of the FTT’s Decision, there has been no proper examination of how those computations would need to be unpicked if one were now going to compare them with the statutory accounts, which Mr Peacock told us were drawn up on a two trade basis so that they could elect to set the loss in their solo financial trades against the 114(2) trade profit.   </p>

What the primary contention put forward by HMRC amounts to is that if they were now starting from scratch in deciding how to tax the Appellants, they would adopt a completely different approach; different both from the approach they adopted in the closure notices and from the case they presented to the FTT, to the UT and in their written submissions prior to the appeal before us.  This approach generates a series of new and contentious issues about (i) the nature of “look through” accounting and the relationship between the 114(2) trades and section 42 tax computations; (ii) the treatment of the partnerships in the statutory accounts and the relevance of that; and (iii) the purport of the correspondence between the parties in September 2009.  </p>

Where the UT went wrong in my judgment was in holding that the proper response to that state of affairs was to remit the matter to the FTT. The proper response was to proceed on the basis of the case that had been presented to the FTT and to the UT which was that the difference in treatment of the different partnerships in the statutory accounts did not affect the outcome of the case.  </p>
