Examples of failure to co-operate would include a refusal to complete application forms, a failure to attend an interview without good reason and disruptive behaviour but would not include mounting a legal challenge to an immigration decision. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The Secretary of State made a policy decision to adopt a standard rate of pay for a number of reasons. It was thought that variable or locally agreed rates of pay at different IRCs or within an individual IRC could favour or discriminate against detainees on an arbitrary basis depending on their place of detention. It was also thought that distinguishing between detainees might cause resentment, particularly if work at higher rates was not available, and might present a risk of non-compliance with transfers between IRCs (that is to say, from an IRC with a higher rate of pay to one with a lower one) or demands to be transferred from an IRC with a lower rate of pay to an IRC with a higher rate. The strategy was intended to standardise pay rates and cap the amount of work that could be undertaken by an individual detainee, to maximise opportunities for the greatest number of detainees. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The standard rate was fixed at £1.00 because the position of prisoners, who were generally paid around 20p per hour for work, could be distinguished; and, although an hourly rate of 75p was preferred, it was rejected because work was already being paid at £1.00 per hour or higher, and setting the rate at a lower level would result in pay cuts for many detainees which would present operational risks. </p>

The claimant in those proceedings, who was also represented by Duncan Lewis solicitors, had issued his claim form on 28 March 2018 for judicial review of the decision of the £1.00 per hour flat rate in the 2013 DSO.  Following the publication of the Review Report and the 2018 Review Decision to maintain the flat rate of £1.00 and £1.25, Mr Morita amended his Detailed Statement of Facts and Grounds to challenge that decision and the review which led to it. On 14 September 2018 Mr Morita had filed an application seeking to have the appellants added to his claim but that application was dismissed by Cockerill J on 21 September 2018.

A number complained about how relatively expensive items were in the shop in the IRC, and set out various reasons why they needed money, including to send to family members. The Judge said that another common theme in the witness statements was that the detainee undertook paid activity because he or she needed the money, rather than simply as a way of passing the time. Exhibited to the witness statements provided by each of the appellants was his account showing recent credits for his paid work and his allowance and debits for his purchases in the shop. </p>

The rate per hour was in general terms considerably less than £1.00 per hour, but was variable according to a number of factors, in particular to encourage and reward a prisoner’s constructive participation in the regime. The Governors of individual prisons had the power to set rates of pay for their particular prisons to reflect regime priorities. The Judge said that, in addition, he had been provided with Prison Service Order Number 4460 on Prisoner’s Pay, two reports by the Howard League on Penal Reform on prison work published in 2010 and 2011, and a findings paper by HM Inspectorate of Prisons entitled “Life in prison: Earning and spending money” (January 2016). <span style="font-style:italic">Delay </span></p>

The purpose of the prison regime is to punish offenders and to address their offending, for example, with rehabilitative activities, training and counselling. The prison work regime is compulsory, and the prisoner pay regime is designed, against that background, to encourage and reward positive behaviour from prisoners. The purpose of the removal centre regime is to provide immigration detainees secure and humane accommodation pending their removal from the UK. The removal centre paid activity regime is voluntary, and the pay regime rewards detainees for work undertaken, but against the background that the principal purpose of the paid activity regime is to provide meaningful activity and to alleviate boredom. I note in passing that neither regime has as its purpose the provision of an income to the person undertaking the work, although that is a benefit of each regime for the relevant person. </p>

In 2005 Alfa loaned Cukurova a sum of US $1.352 billion, the collateral for which was an equitable mortgage over Cukorova’s shares. The equitable mortgage included a right to appropriate which depended for its validity on the validity of the 2003 Regulations. On 16 April 2007, in reliance on alleged events of default, Alfa demanded repayment and purported to appropriate the shares. In proceedings by Alfa for repayment in the BVI, on a trial of preliminary issues, the BVI court ruled that it was not open to that court to question the validity of the 2003 Regulations.

Time, therefore, began to run, he contended, when the 2013 DSO came into force and, on our analysis of the ambit of the challenge in these proceedings, when the 2018 Review Decision was made. </p>

It is that a judicial review applicant must move against the substantive act or decision which is the real basis of his complaint. If, after that act has been done, he takes no steps but merely waits until something consequential and dependent upon it takes place and then challenges that, he runs the risk of being put out of court for being too late. Mr Pleming did not seek to deny that there exists a discretion to refuse leave, or relief, in such a case whether or not it falls within the terms of Order 53, r. 4(1) or section 31(6). This is an inevitable function of the fact that the judicial review court, being primarily concerned with the maintenance of the rule of law by the imposition of objective legal standards upon the conduct of public bodies, has to adapt a flexible but principled approach to its own jurisdiction. Its decisions will constrain the actions of elected government, sometimes bringing potential uncertainty and added cost to good administration. And from time to time its judgments may impose heavy burdens on third parties. This is a price which often has to be paid for the rule of law to be vindicated. But because of these deep consequences which touch the public interest, the court in its discretion—whether so directed by rules of court or not—will impose a strict discipline in proceedings before it. It is marked by an insistence that applicants identify the real substance of their complaint and then act promptly, so as to ensure that the proper business of government and the reasonable interests of third parties are not overborne or unjustly prejudiced by litigation brought in circumstances where the point in question could have been exposed and adjudicated without unacceptable damage. The rule of law is not threatened, but strengthened, by such a discipline. It invokes public confidence and engages the law in the practical world. And it is administered, of course, case by case; where there is bad faith, or a real instance of Wednesbury perversity, a respondent's argument based on delay is likely to get a little shrift. But there is nothing of that here.”  </p>

Precisely when a person first becomes affected for this purpose will depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case. In the present case, the appellants were not affected by the £1.00 flat rate rule until they were detained in an IRC in which that rule applied.

She did not receive notices from the authority relating to her appeal as these had been sent to an address from which she had moved without informing the authority. The special adjudicator dismissed her appeal on 11 July 1997 without her appearing. A copy of the special adjudicator’s determination was sent to her old address and her solicitors informed her that she had a right to apply for leave to appeal to the Immigration Appeal Tribunal but warned her that, in accordance with rules 13(2) and 42(1)(a) of the Asylum Appeals (Procedure) Rules 1996, her application had to be made within five working days of the deemed receipt date, 28 July 1997. On her application for judicial review of the Tribunal’s decision, the Court of Appeal, affirming the decision of the judge, held, among other things, that rule 42(1)(a) was outside the rule-making power in section 22 of the Immigration Act 1971 as it went beyond regulating the exercise of the rights of appeal conferred by section 20(1) in that it might deny the chance to appeal to a party who through no fault of their own had failed to comply with the five-day rule. As in the other cases cited above, notification to the applicant in <span style="font-style:italic">Saleem</span>, in accordance with the rules, that she had to apply for leave to appeal to the Tribunal within five working days of the deemed receipt date, was well established standard practice which did not involve any conscious decision to apply rules 13(2) and 42(1)(a) with her specifically in mind. </p>

In the context of the present case he emphasised that the £1.00 flat rate has been applied over many years to large numbers of detainees. It is in that context that he cited the passage in the judgment of Laws J in <span style="font-style:italic">Greenpeace</span>. Leaving aside that the rigour of what Laws J said there was qualified in an important respect in <span style="font-style:italic">R (Burkett) v Hammersmith and Fulham London Borough Council</span> [2002] UK HL 23, [2002] 1 WLR 93 at [44] ff, the fact is that Laws J was not concerned with our task of identifying a principle for distinguishing between the person specific category of cases and other cases, nor does mere resort to accepted considerations of the adverse impact of delay on good administration identify any such principle. All the cases cited in <span style="font-style:italic">DSD</span> at [167] as falling within the person specific category, as well as <span style="font-style:italic">DSD</span> itself and <span style="font-style:italic">TN</span>, were ones where there was a considerable lapse of time before the rules were challenged by judicial review and many people had been subjected to the same rules in the interim.

The evidence shows that a wide range of work is undertaken by detainees. Paragraph 17 of the Pay Review Report, set out in [13] above, summarises the types of paid activity available. In the case of an activity like cleaning, the evidence shows that detainees can spend literally tens of thousands of hours undertaking the work over the course of the year. In the case of Harmondsworth IRC, for example, nearly 55,000 hours of cleaning is recorded as having been undertaken by detainees during 2016. The Judge found (at [36]) that a person undertaking the activities described in paragraph 17 of the Pay Review Report outside an IRC would be unlikely to undertake such work without payment, unless it was being done for personal, family or charitable purposes.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The appellants contend that a flat rate payment of £1.00, which has remained unchanged for more than ten years, is, in those circumstances, exploitative of detainees and an affront to their dignity. The Judge summarised the evidence on that issue, to which we have referred at [32]-[33] above. An important point in the evidence is that many detainees considered that they had to undertake the work, even if it was unpleasant, in order to be able to make various payments, including purchasing relatively expensive items in the shop in the IRC, making telephone calls and caring for family members. The Judge said (at [78]) that he accepted that some detainees may feel “compelled” by their circumstances to undertake paid activity. The inadequacy of the flat rate payment to meet the increasingly high cost of items in the shop is something borne out by at least one operator’s questionnaire response we were shown.  </p>

That suggestion is wholly answered by paragraph 18 of Ms Hardy’s witness statement, which makes clear that, although the operator is required to offer paid activities to detainees, subject to various conditions, the operator is not relieved of its obligations if no or insufficient detainees are willing to undertake the relevant work or the quality of the work is below the standard required under the contract. The respondent, for her part, makes no financial gain of any kind from the work carried out by detainees as the operator is entitled to be paid at the contractual rate whether or not detainees undertake work and complete it to any particular standard.  Nor is there any evidence that paid work increases the profits of the operators. In paragraph 6.145 of the 2016 Shaw Report Mr Shaw said that nothing he had seen supported the view that paid work was used by contractors to increase their profits. Furthermore, the questionnaires completed by the IRC operators as part of the 2018 Review suggest that the paid activity scheme is operated, by at least some of the operators, on no more than a self-funding basis.   </p>

Rule 17(4) confers on the Secretary of State the discretion and right to choose whether there should be one general rate or different rates in relation to particular cases. We agree with the Judge (at [84]) that rule 17(2) cannot fairly be read as imposing a legal obligation on the Secretary of State to have more than one rate merely because that would enable greater flexibility and innovation. The introductory words – “Whenever reasonably possible” - simply cannot bear the weight of that interpretation. That is also consistent with the qualified terms of rule 17(3) that detained persons are only entitled to undertake paid activity “to the extent that the opportunity to do so is provided by the manager”. </p>

In prisons, as stated in Prison Service Order 4460, it is to encourage and reward the constructive participation of prisoners in the regime of the establishment. In IRCs, it is to encourage and assist detained persons to make the most productive use of their time (in accordance with rule 3(1)) and the provision of opportunities to participate in activities to meet the recreational and intellectual needs of detainees and relief of boredom (in accordance with rule 17(1)). Employable but unemployed prisoners receive a minimum unemployment payment of £2.50 per week based on a five-day week if there is no suitable work available. </p>

Variable or locally agreed rates of pay at different IRCs or within an individual IRC could favour or discriminate against detainees on an arbitrary basis depending on their place of detention. Distinguishing between detainees may also cause resentment, particularly if work at higher rates is not available, and might present a risk of non-compliance with transfers between IRCs (i.e. from an IRC with a higher rate of pay to one with a lower one) or demands to be transferred from an IRC with a lower rate of pay to one IRC with a higher rate. The strategy was intended to standardise pay rates and cap the amount of work that could be undertaken by an individual detainee, to maximise opportunities for the greatest number of detainees. The ability to work was to be linked to compliance. </p>

In the present case that is the lack of flexibility in the flat payment regime, and the alleged consequences for innovation in the IRCs.

Again, for the reasons we have given, there is no relevant comparison and the difference in treatment is in any event objectively and reasonably justified so the attack plainly fails. </p>
