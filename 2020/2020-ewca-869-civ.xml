	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">At the stage of the first judgment, the appellant, Safeway Limited, which is the principal employer under the Scheme, contended that the equalisation of NPAs had occurred on 1 December 1991, that being the date notified to Scheme members for that purpose by a written announcement, and the date by reference to which a subsequent formal amendment to the Scheme was effected by a deed (“the 1996 Deed”) which was said to be effective retrospectively.  The position of the first respondent, Mr Andrew Newton, who acted and continues to act in a representative capacity for those members of the Scheme with an interest in doing so, was that the judge had been correct to hold that NPA equalisation did not occur until 2 May 1996, the date of the formal amendment to the Scheme by deed.  In the meantime, it followed that the NPA for both men and women had to be treated as 60 and not 65. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The first of the three issues was whether the power to amend the terms of the Scheme could be exercised by the principal employer, with the agreement of the Scheme Trustee, otherwise than by deed.  Safeway contended that it could be so exercised and, in particular, that it could be exercised by means of a written announcement to members. This court concluded, in agreement with Warren J, that the power could only be exercised by deed, although the deed would have effect retrospectively to the date of the announcement.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The second issue was whether the power to effect amendments to the Scheme retrospectively for the purpose of equalisation of NPAs to the NPA of the previously disadvantaged class was prohibited by the directly applicable EU law principle of equal treatment then enshrined in Article 119 of the Treaty of Rome (“Article 119”, now Article 157 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union).  Warren J held that Article 119 did have this prohibitory effect and, moreover, that this was, as a matter of EU law, <span style="font-style:italic">acte clair</span>.  This court differed from the judge on the question of whether the prohibitory effect was <span style="font-style:italic">acte clair</span>, principally because the rights covered by the retrospective exercise of the power of amendment were defeasible rights.  The court considered that it was necessary to refer a question to the CJEU in order to decide the appeal.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">On 7 October 2019 the Grand Chamber of the CJEU handed down its judgment: Case C-171/18 <span style="font-style:italic">Safeway Limited v Andrew Newton and Safeway Pension Trustees Limited</span> [2020] 1 CMLR 1321 (“<span style="font-style:italic">Safeway CJEU</span>”<span style="font-style:italic">)</span>.  The CJEU held that, in the absence of objective justification, a pension scheme was prohibited from adopting, in order to end discrimination resulting from the fixing of an NPA differentiated by gender, a measure which equalises, with retrospective effect, the NPA of members to that of the previously disadvantaged class for the period between the announcement of that measure and its adoption, even where such a measure is authorised under national law and under the Trust Deed.  It is now common ground that the fact that the affected rights were defeasible is irrelevant to that question.  Safeway no longer contends that the amendment to the Scheme validly equalised the NPAs to 65 from the date of the announcement in 1991. </p>

But the Court of Justice held that (because of the absence of any sufficiently clear prior jurisprudence) the direct effect of Article 119 could not be relied upon to claim a pension entitlement by reason of that discrimination with effect prior to the publication of that decision on 17 May 1990. Subject to that restraint upon retroactivity, imposed in part because of concerns expressed by the United Kingdom as to the large financial consequences for pension schemes which commonly discriminated between men and women in that way, the Court held that it was for national courts to apply Article 119 so as to safeguard the equal treatment right in relation to pensions thereby conferred.” </p>

This is because section 62 introduced into every UK occupational pension scheme an equal treatment rule conferring enforceable rights on members of such schemes to equalised levelled up benefits. Although in relation to the period before 1 January 1996 Article 119 precludes levelling down, from that date forward the level of members benefits is purely a matter of domestic law.  As a matter of domestic law, so Safeway contends, the 1996 Deed was effective to level down the NPAs of men and women with effect from 1 December 1991.  This domestic law effect of the 1996 Deed was nullified by Art 119 only insofar as it related to the period between 1 December 1991 and 31 December 1995.  It remained effective to level down the NPAs with effect from 1 January 1996.  </p>

To accept such an approach would relieve those authorities of the obligation, after the finding of discrimination, to eliminate it immediately and in full. Moreover, it would fail to comply with the obligation to grant the persons within the previously disadvantaged category enjoyment of the NPA of the persons within the previously favoured category so far as concerns the pension rights relating to the periods of service between the date of delivery of <span style="font-style:italic">Barber</span> [1990] 2 C.M.L.R. 513 and the date of the adoption of the measures achieving equal treatment, and with the prohibition on removing, with retroactive effect, the advantages of the latter persons. Lastly it would, until the adoption of such measures, create doubts, contrary to the principle of legal certainty, as regards the scope of the rights of the members.” </p>

The only measure taken by the Scheme itself was the 1996 Deed.    Legislation which seeks to implement Article 119 is insufficient.  That was clear from the fact that legislation outlawing discrimination had been in place from 1 December 1991 (the date of the announcement) to 1 May 1996.  Prior to 1 May 1996 discriminatory provisions were overridden by Article 119, and after that date by section 62.   Yet Article 119 cannot have been a relevant measure (otherwise the <span style="font-style:italic">Barber </span>window would have closed as soon as it opened).

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I cannot see any purpose in a rule which requires the Scheme to be modified by incorporating textual amendments, when those modifications are required by statute to be read into the Scheme in any event.  Thus even if EU law requires the Scheme itself to be modified, section 62 has this effect. It cannot make a difference that the modifications are initiated by Parliament rather than the administrators of the Scheme. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Short sought to obtain some support from the absence of references to domestic equality legislation in either the two German collective agreement cases (<span style="font-style:italic">Kowalska </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">Nimz</span>) or in the English cases, <span style="font-style:italic">Coloroll </span>(a reference from the High Court) and <span style="font-style:italic">Avdel </span>(a reference from the industrial tribunal at Bedford)<span style="font-style:italic">. </span> As regards the former, we do not know whether there was any applicable German equal pay legislation to which reference could have been made.  As regards the latter, we know that occupational pension schemes were expressly excluded from the operation of the Equal Pay Act 1970, a situation which was not rectified until the Pensions Act 1995.  Both English cases related to periods before the Pensions Act 1995 came into force. It follows that there is no support for Mr Short’s argument in the failure of these cases to mention equality legislation. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Next, I take the argument that section 62 is merely Article 119 in domestic law clothing, and does no more to close the <span style="font-style:italic">Barber </span>window than did Article 119 itself.  I do not accept the premise of this argument.    First, as the Court said in <span style="font-style:italic">Safeway (CJEU)</span> at [18], Article 119 only provides that men and women receive the same pay for the same work without imposing any specific level of pay.  Section 62 goes further and says that discriminatory terms are to be modified so that terms which treat one gender less favourably are modified so that they do not treat that gender less favourably.  In other words, it requires levelling up.  That is to do more than Article 119.  Secondly, the closure of the <span style="font-style:italic">Barber </span>window is defined by the point at which domestic law provides legally enforceable and certain rights for members to enforce.  Section 62 provides such rights, which may be enforced by recourse to the domestic courts.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It is true that, in one respect, section 62 does not provide the precise equivalent of an amendment of the Scheme to equalise the NPAs of men and women at 60.  That is because section 62(3)(a) requires the woman (or man) to show that that they are employed on like work with a man (or woman) in the same employment.  The CJEU jurisprudence requires the implementation of Article 119 to be full, immediate and unconditional.  In my judgment, however, section 62 does give a full, immediate and unconditional right to enforce the terms of the equal treatment rule, which is a full implementation of the Article 119 right.  The requirement to establish employment on like work in the same employment is not a relevant “condition” on the implementation of Article 119, because it is no more than Article 119 itself requires.  To treat this as an inadequate implementation of Article 119 would be to require domestic law to enhance the Article 119 right, not to implement it. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Short is obviously right that section 62 cannot be allowed to circumvent the principles of EU law which are designed to protect the rights of members during the <span style="font-style:italic">Barber</span> window.  In my judgment, however, it does not do so.  The effect of section 62 was to level up the rights of men to those of women in accordance with Article 119.  That does not involve any undermining of Article 119 rights.  Once that has happened, one moves into Period 3, when it is permitted to reduce the level of benefits by levelling down.  That does not undermine Article 119 either, because the level of benefits is not controlled by Article 119 in Period 3, as the Court has made clear. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I do not think that the amendment power contained in section 65(3) of the Pensions Act 1995 assists the first respondent.  The purpose of that provision is to allow the Scheme to be amended easily so as to bring its paperwork into conformity with equal treatment.  It is not an indication that the members have no sufficiently enforceable rights before those amendments take place. Likewise, I am not persuaded by Mr Short’s policy point.  If the Scheme has effectively been modified by statutory intervention, no purpose is served by incentivising textual modification as well. </p>
