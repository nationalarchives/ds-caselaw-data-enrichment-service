	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This is an appeal by the Appellant, Fairlight Art Ventures LLP ("Fairlight"), against the judgment and order of Robin Knowles J CBE ("the Judge") dated 11 December 2019 following an eight-day trial in April 2019.  It relates to a painting entitled "Portrait of a Gentleman" (oil on oak panel 13 ½ by 10 ½ inches) ("the Painting"), considered by some (at least formerly) to be the work of Frans Hals, the famous Dutch Golden Age painter (1582/3-1666).  Whilst the correctness of that attribution is now very much under scrutiny, that is not an issue that arises for consideration on this appeal. </p>

The Second Respondent, Mark Weiss Limited ("MWL"), is a fine art dealership.  The Third Defendant, Mr Mark Weiss ("Mr Weiss”), is a director and the sole shareholder of MWL.  Fairlight is the special purpose vehicle of Mr David Kowitz ("Mr Kowitz"), who is its designated member and ultimate beneficial owner. He is an investor in fine art.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In 2010 the Painting was purchased by Fairlight on behalf of itself and MWL.  In 2011 the co-owners agreed to sell the Painting onwards. Sotheby's, pursuant to a consignment agreement, was involved in its sale in June 2011 by private treaty for US$10,750,000 to EPC Nevada LLC ("Nevada"), controlled and beneficially owned by Mr Richard Hedreen, also a fine art collector and investor.  The sale contract was subject to provisions allowing for rescission and return of the Painting and the purchase price.  In 2016 Nevada sought to rescind the sale contract following expert opinion on the authenticity of the Painting.  Sotheby's returned the purchase price to Nevada and Nevada returned the Painting. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The appeal is resisted by Sotheby's.  MWL is party to the appeal since, if Fairlight succeeds, Fairlight seeks consequential orders (in the event that it succeeds on the third and/or fourth grounds of appeal) quashing all provisions directing it to make contributions to MWL in respect of the sums ordered to be paid by MWL to Sotheby's. MWL supports Sotheby's position.  Mr Weiss is not a party to the appeal.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.98in">In finding that there was privity of contract between Fairlight and Sotheby's in Contract A such that Fairlight was liable under it, the Judge relied on the evidence at trial demonstrating that Mr Weiss asked Mr Kowitz for Fairlight's consent to enter into the sale of the Painting.  Mr Kowitz accepted in crossexamination that he gave his agreement on behalf of Fairlight to Mr Weiss to deal on the basis of consigning the Painting to Sotheby's for sale to a Sotheby's client at US$10,750,000.  The Judge was "fully satisfied" that this episode </p>

Taking into account the evidence of Mr Kowitz and Mr Weiss, the engagement of Sotheby's and the structure of the relationship between MWL, Fairlight and Sotheby's, Fairlight's "construct" that Fairlight was simply giving MWL authority to enter into an agreement between MWL and Sotheby's was "unrealistically narrow".  In his judgment, the authorities cited on sub-agency were not engaged.  The facts did not support the idea that Sotheby's was a subagent to which MWL delegated functions within its agency with Fairlight.  It was by Contract A that the owners of the Painting (ie MWL and Fairlight) bound themselves as principals to the sale.  An internal Sotheby's email referring to an agreement to sell the Painting privately "for Mark Weiss" (with no mention of Fairlight) was not persuasive on the issue.  Nor did it matter that Mr Kowitz did not ask to see the text of Contract A at an early point.  Nor did the words under Mr Weiss' signature advance Fairlight's position very far, since it was common ground that MWL was acting as agent for Fairlight and on its own behalf;   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.98in">Had a conclusion on the question been necessary, the Judge would have found that the essential relationship between MWL and Fairlight was one of partnership.  The interest in the Painting was indivisible.  The written and oral evidence showed a broad agreement or an understanding to divide profit 50/50, albeit with the possibility for some adjustment.  The Judge bore in mind that s. 2 of the Partnership Act 1890 provides that joint property does not of itself create a partnership.  He laid little weight on the fact that Fairlight used its interest in the Painting to provide security.  Nor did a draft agreement prepared by Mr Kowitz's solicitors in 2010 contra-indicate a partnership, not least since it had not been executed (and the evidence at trial did not make good any suggestion that its terms had been agreed).  Mr Weiss and Mr Kowitz had used the language of "partner"; he accepted Mr Weiss' evidence as to his understanding that MWL and Fairlight would purchase as partners, deduct any expenses and split the remaining profit, something which they had agreed "at the outset";   </p>

Thus, very shortly after he sent the email on 17 May 2011, Mr Kowitz indicated that he wanted time to consider again whether in fact he did not want to sell the Painting.  Matters moved on again when in early June 2011 Sotheby's indicated that it had a potential client buyer.  Negotiations followed, to Mr Kowitz's knowledge, culminating in the eventual offer on 21 June 2011 that MWL and Fairlight accepted.  That offer was discussed specifically by Mr Kowitz and Mr Weiss on 21 June 2011 and both agreed to accept it.  Contract A was not the product of (or entered into under the auspices of) the (limited) authorisation given by Mr Kowitz in the email of 17 May 2011, but rather the product of the agreement reached between Fairlight and MWL on 21 June 2011.  It differed from the authorisation given in Mr Kowitz's email of 17 May 2011 in two material respects: first, the sale price agreed was significantly lower, and secondly, the consignment of the Painting to Sotheby's was agreed.   </p>

He stated in terms that he considered the evidence at trial, including the oral and written evidence of Mr Kowitz.  The Judge addressed the fact that Mr Weiss had only signed as "[d]uly authorised for and on behalf of [MWL]".  The question was whether MWL was acting only on its own behalf or on behalf of both owners.  He addressed expressly Mr Macdonald's internal email of 22 June 2011 in which he stated that Sotheby's had reached an agreement to sell the Painting for Mr Weiss (and why it did not advance Fairlight's case).  (It is also to be noted that it is clear that Sotheby's in fact knew that another party was involved as seller).  He addressed the fact that Mr Kowitz was not sent and had not asked to see Contract A at an early point.   </p>

The fact that Fairlight was not named in Contract A is in no way inconsistent with this conclusion; it may often be the case, particularly in the art world, that parties are keen to remain anonymous.  The parties were themselves familiar with such an arrangement, not least because it was adopted when they purchased the Painting in June 2010 (when only Fairlight was named as buyer but the agreement was entered into for both Fairlight and MWL).   </p>

As for the Judge’s reference to Mr Weiss’ evidence that his understanding was that "…in line with our previous practice, we would purchase the Painting as partners, deduct any expenses and split the remaining profit", that was a highly selective quotation and, again when read in full context, not a reference to a statutory partnership.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Judge held that the words “generally accepted views of scholars and experts” were to be given their ordinary meaning in context.  I agree.  The rather poor drafting invites argument, but the ordinary meaning of the words, read together, shows that the question is whether the description of the Painting is one that would be generally accepted by scholars and experts at the time.  That is what the Judge rightly found.  As was said for Sotheby's, what is required is for "views" plural to have coalesced into a "generally accepted view" singular.  Another way of putting it, which avoids the use of the word "view's", would be to say that the question is whether there was a consensus (ie a generally held view not requiring unanimity) among scholars and experts at the time.  There may be an absence of consensus either because of a divergence of views or because there has been insufficient time for a generally accepted view to have formed.  </p>

As the Judge said, in a literal sense, the words do not require a "weighting" between scholars and experts.  However, when deciding whether there is a generally accepted view, it will be necessary to identify who the scholars and experts are in the field, and to survey their views in the light of their numbers, eminence and the degree of consideration that each has given to the question.   </p>

It does not reflect the exercise to be carried out, which is to look at the whole field of scholarly and expert opinion expressed and reach a judgment on whether or not i) there is a generally accepted view and, if so, ii) what that view is.  This is an exercise of judgment that cannot be reduced to a mechanical process of the type contended for by Fairlight.   </p>

As it was put by Lord Justice Henderson during the course of the hearing, this was a "newly discovered painting which ha[d] no proper provenance, ha[d] not been published [except by Dr Biesboer] and had never been in an exhibition".

All that could firmly be proved was that Professor Slive had written (in a private letter in 2008 and based on a black and white photograph) that the Painting "could very well be by Frans Hals".  The Judge was entitled to conclude that the fact that the Painting appeared in a second edition of a catalogue, the first edition of which was prepared by Professor Slive in 1974, did not advance matters (in circumstances where the second edition was published after Professor Slive’s death and in the absence of any evidence as to the basis for the Painting’s inclusion).

Authenticity Guarantee A was for the personal benefit of the party first purchasing the Painting, here Nevada, which was then fully entitled to rely on it.  It conferred a (limited) personal (non-assignable) right on Nevada.  What the "subsequent owner" provision seeks to do is to prevent a third party to whom the original buyer has sold the Painting from subsequently invoking the guarantee against Sotheby's.  That is not the case on the facts here.  There is no superfluity of wording on this construction, as Fairlight suggests, not least since Authenticity Guarantee A prohibited only assignment (and not, for example, transmissibility upon insolvency or death).  Nor can it be said that there is anything commercially objectionable about the result.  By contrast, Fairlight's construction could lead to very odd results: thus for example, were Nevada to sell the Painting on for profit, the onwards purchaser might require an authenticity guarantee from Nevada.  On Fairlight's case, were the guarantee to be invoked, Nevada would be left with no remedy against Sotheby's, something which, objectively, the parties are unlikely to have intended.   </p>
