The matters which fell to be dealt with at the hearing were of some urgency, as the appeal itself was listed to commence on 1 April 2020, less than two weeks away from the hearing.

I allowed the Chief Executive Officer of Regen, Mr Antoine Turzi, and its Head of Legal Affairs, Mr Andreas Pigni, to speak on behalf of Regen.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Regen commenced patent infringement proceedings against Estar in the Patents Court in respect of the UK designation of European Patent 2 073 862 (“the 862 patent”).  Estar counterclaimed for revocation on, amongst other grounds, lack of novelty by reason of prior use.  By a judgment delivered on 18 January 2019 HHJ Hacon dismissed the action and revoked the UK designation of the 862 patent.  Thereafter, on 11 April 2019, the Opposition Division (“OD”) of the European Patent Office issued a decision in opposition proceedings pronouncing the 862 patent invalid as a whole.  On 10 June 2019 I granted Regen permission to appeal to this court from HHJ Hacon’s judgment.  There is also a cross-appeal by Estar, for which the judge gave permission in the event that Regen obtained permission to appeal.  Regen has also filed an appeal against the decision of the Opposition Division to the Technical Board of Appeal (“TBA”) of the EPO.  It has not (as it could have done) asked for expedition of that appeal.  In those circumstances, it is estimated that the appeal to the TBA could take in excess of two years to reach a hearing.  </p>

In addition to all these applications, in accordance with this court’s usual procedure, Regen was asked by the court to show cause why its appeal should not be dismissed for failure to comply with the directions to lodge the appeal bundles by the due date (“<span style="font-weight:bold">the own-motion application</span>”).  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">At the hearing I explained that I would refuse Regen’s stay application. I then turned to consider whether the appeal should be struck out for failure to lodge the appeal bundles on the own-motion application.  I decided that it should be.  In those circumstances, I did not think that any of the other applications required determination. I indicated that I would assess the costs of the various applications compendiously by making an order that Regen pay to Estar the sum of £10,000, approximately 50% of their bill for the applications.  I explained that I would give my reasons at a later date in writing.  These are my reasons.     </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">I need to set out the background and procedural history in a little more detail.  In consequence of its failure in the patent infringement and revocation proceedings before HHJ Hacon, Regen was ordered by the judge’s order of 13 March 2019 to pay to Estar the sum of £225,000 as an interim payment on account of costs (“the March costs order).  The judge gave Regen an unusually long period to comply with the March costs order, to 30 June 2019.  There was evidence before him (from Regen) that Regen was experiencing short-term financial difficulties, but would have no problem in making a significant cash outlay or obtaining funding within that generously extended period. Shortly before the time for payment, however, Collyer Bristow (Regen’s then solicitors) wrote on behalf of Regen stating that Regen would not be in position to pay the outstanding sum by 30 June, and announcing an intention to apply for a stay.  The basis for the stay was that Regen’s appeal would be stifled if Regen was obliged to pay the outstanding sums. Collyer Bristow stated that it was intended to serve evidence in support of these contentions, and also conveyed an offer from Regen to arrange a bank guarantee in support of its application for a stay and relief from sanctions. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Regen did not, in the end, provide any evidence in support of its application or arrange a bank guarantee.  Instead, it ignored the deadlines which it had itself proposed for the filing of evidence on its own stay application, and sought to defer the hearing of that application on the basis that Regen had initiated criminal proceedings in Switzerland against an employee of Regen alleged to have misappropriated confidential documents and to have provided them to Estar (an allegation which we shall see re-surfacing at a later point in the narrative).  The hearing nevertheless went ahead.  Regen, although the applicant on this application, was neither present at the hearing nor represented.  The judge was therefore obliged to hear Regen’s application without the benefit of any evidence or submissions from Regen.   </p>

On 30 January 2019, some 12 days after HHJ Hacon handed down the main judgment in the action, Regen decided to increase hostilities by commencing further patent proceedings against Estar under a US patent corresponding to the 862 patent before the United States International Trade Commission (“ITC”).  There was evidence that such proceedings could incur sums in costs in the order of USD 2 million.  In the same period Regen was estimated to have spent some USD 1 million on marketing at trade shows. </p>

No such applications were filed by 14 February.  On 12 February CMS wrote to the court with a copy to Regen setting out the remaining steps in the procedural timetable, including the fact that the bundles were due to be filed at court and served on all parties by 19 February.  On 27 February Master Bancroft-Rimmer directed that Estar’s security application would be considered on the papers on 2 March 2020.  If Regen had not filed submissions by 28 February it would be considered on the basis of Estar’s submissions alone.  Likewise, the security application would be considered in the absence of any other applications Regen intended to make if these other applications were not filed by 28 February. The Master also pointed out, confirming what Regen had been told on 12 February by CMS, that the appeal bundles should have been filed by 19 February.  (They were by now more than a week out of time, without any request for an extension of explanation of the breach.)  The Master said that unless they were filed by 4 March the appeal would be placed in the dismissal list to show cause why the appeal should not be dismissed for failure to lodge the bundles. </p>

The UK designation of the EP has been revoked and has therefore provided the respondents with certainty for the UK, subject only to the outcome of this appeal.  It is true that if the TBA holds the patent to be invalid that will be the end of the matter, and it would not be necessary for the appeal to be heard.  But if the TBA holds the patent valid, or valid in amended form, as Regen no doubt wish, Regen has made it absolutely clear that it wants to proceed with the appeal in order to be able pursue its policy of seeking to remove Estar from the market.  For that purpose Regen will need to revive the appeal for it to be heard in two to three years’ time.  This is a very long period for uncertainty as to the validity of the UK patent to be hanging over Estar’s head, and over the heads of other operators in this market in the UK.    </p>

However, I am  aware that the national procedural law of some member states of the EPC provides for automatic stays where EPO proceedings in relation to the validity of a patent are pending.

I can see no reason why the application for a stay was not made in the Notice of Appeal. Instead, although Regen made it clear that they wanted a stay, no formal application was made until the appeal was a matter of a few weeks from a final hearing. By that stage it had ensured that the prejudice to Estar would be extreme.  Not only would Estar lose their date for the hearing of the appeal, but Regen had banked a period of uncertainty at least until the appeal could be re-fixed. </p>

It was Regen who chose to pursue Estar to judgment in this country before the proceedings in the EPO were resolved, no doubt hoping for a success by utilising this jurisdiction.   Now it has met with failure at first instance it wants to halt the proceedings whilst they attempt to restore the validity of the patent in the EPO.  If the approach to this litigation was to be that validity should first be tested in the EPO, that approach should have applied from the outset, so that the heavy costs of a full trial of infringement and validity could have been avoided.  By comparison, the additional costs of an appeal to this court are likely to be less onerous. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The stay is also sought on the grounds of an allegation of criminal conduct by Regen’s own employee in Switzerland, which is supposed, in some way, to have infected the trial judge’s conclusion that the patent was invalid.  Mr Pigni and Mr Turzi were not able to explain to me with any precision how these allegations about the conduct of its employee are related to the issues in the action.  They made a vague suggestion that the facts upon which the prior use was based were “staged”.  I simply do not understand how a prior use could be “staged” given the need for it to have occurred before the priority date, and before the allegations of misconduct were made.  There are, in any event, fundamental difficulties with taking account of these allegations.  First, there is at present no ground of appeal which even remotely raises such issues.  Secondly, there is no application to adduce further evidence in the appeal.  Thirdly, Regen has persistently sought to withhold from Estar the documents in which these allegations are set out, except on an “Attorney’s eyes only” basis which would prevent Estar from taking instructions. Minutes before the telephone hearing a quantity of further material was sent on the “Attorney’s eyes only basis” to Estar’s solicitors and the court.  It would be unthinkable for this court to grant a stay or postponement of the appeal based on allegations which Estar have not been able to learn about, let alone respond to.  It is not open to me in accordance with common law principles of natural justice to take steps based on material which one side has not been able to deal with: see<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span><span style="font-style:italic">Al Rawi and others v The Security Service and others</span> [2011] UKSC 34.  If Regen seriously considered that it had uncovered material which was relevant to the outcome of the appeal, it is all the more astonishing that it did not launch any application based on it until the last minute before the appeal, and even then has taken none of the appropriate steps (such as an application to adduce fresh evidence and amend the grounds of appeal) to make that material relevant to the outcome of the appeal. </p>

It has not helped itself by changing solicitors twice and then deciding to proceed without any legal representation at all, in circumstances where it plainly could pay for representation on its own evidence.

In the present case this was particularly important as Regen had a history of procedural wrongdoing, one is tempted to say procedural vandalism.  To recapitulate, it had breached the March and July costs orders.  It had launched an application for relief from sanctions in respect of those costs orders which it then failed to support either with evidence or with attendance or representation at the hearing.  It had ignored successive directions in the appeal as to the service of its response to Estar’s strike out and security applications.  Against that background there was an obvious inference that continued breaches would be treated as intentional, and not warrant any further indulgence being offered by the court. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">I was particularly concerned at the hearing to learn what explanation if any Regen had for the failure to progress the appeal in a timely manner.  Messrs Turzi and Pigni attempted to place blame on their solicitors, and on the fact that they were unrepresented.  They complained about the sums in costs which their solicitors had asked to be placed on account before taking the necessary steps, and they said that, as unrepresented litigants, Regen did not know what steps it was necessary to take.  I asked Messrs Turzi and Pigni whether it was inability to pay which had led to a situation in which they had no solicitors and to the failure to take the necessary procedural steps, but they made clear in an emphatic way that this was not the case. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">I am wholly unable to accept that this amounts to a good explanation for the failure to comply.  Ultimately, I believe that Regen has taken a deliberate decision not to pay any outstanding sums to Estar, or expend further money on this appeal by instructing solicitors and putting them in funds, because of their belief that their commercial interests are better served by pursuing Estar in other tribunals, such as the EPO and the ITC.  I am not prepared to assume in Regen’s favour that they are unable to pay.  To do so would be inconsistent with Mr Turzi’s evidence to the ITC, with their preparedness to embark on expensive ITC litigation, with their litigation against Estar in France, Germany and Poland, with the extravagant sums spent on marketing, and the submissions made by Mr Pigni and Mr Turzi at the hearing<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="1">
		<p class="footnotedescription"><span> </span>It is true that at one stage it was being asserted that Regen had temporary financial difficulties, and that payment of the March and July costs orders would stifle its appeal, but those assertions were never supported by evidence, and more recently Regen has been saying that it is in good financial shape.  </p>
	      </authorialNote>.  The failure to progress the appeal is plainly part of a deliberate strategy on the part of Regen aimed at de-railing it.   It believed that by dragging its feet it could achieve derailment of the appeal without the need to obtain a stay.   </p>

	    <p style="text-align:right;margin-left:0.00in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.00in">March  2020, quoted above, stated that immediate filing of the bundles was not possible, and that Regen itself would not be able to prepare adequately for the hearing on 1 April  2020.  Quite apart from the absence of any consideration for the ability of Estar to prepare for the appeal, the letter assumes that the lodging of the bundles was something that could occur at some point in the future after the appeal date had been vacated.  Regen did not come to the hearing (a hearing, amongst other things, to show why the appeal should not be dismissed) with any concrete proposal as to how the appeal could be progressed.   Mr Turzi and Mr Pigni did did not suggest that any steps were in hand to obtain representation, or that they planned to argue the appeal themselves.  Instead they fell back on their view that it was better for the appeal to await the outcome of the EPO proceedings.  I have already explained why that proposed course of action is not available to them. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Against all this, Regen may properly contend that there is a valuable property right at stake, albeit one that has been declared a nullity by the High Court and the OD of the EPO.  It may also be said that I have granted permission to appeal on the basis that there is a real prospect of persuading this court that the patent is valid.   I am also prepared to assume that Regen’s behaviour is motivated by a genuine belief that it would be in their own interests for the appeal to be delayed. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">These points have, whether individually or together, very little weight.  The fact that a valuable property right is at stake is a reason for pursuing an appeal with diligence and vigour, not for declining to instruct solicitors and deliberately allowing procedural deadlines to be missed.  The test for the grant of permission to appeal is, what is more, a notoriously low threshold and has to be set against the fact that a highly experienced patent judge, and a specialist tribunal of the EPO have both held the patent to be bad.  A genuine desire to avoid a hearing of the appeal in one’s own interest cuts little ice, when the observance of procedural rules is required for the benefit of all users of the court system, not just an individual litigant. </p>

I have, of course, thought about whether I should give Regen one last chance to comply.  I do not think that is a course I can properly take.  First, the timescale is now so short that it is effectively common ground that the appeal cannot be put in order in time for it to be heard as listed.  If the appeal date is vacated, it will be 9 to 15 months before it can be relisted. The vacation of the appeal hearing gives rise to exactly the same sort of prejudice to Estar as I have already mentioned.   It also prejudices the efficient administration of justice by wasting valuable court resources.   Secondly, this is not something which Regen specifically asked for.  Rather Regen have put their case based on their commercial preference for a stay.     </p>

Others, such as the suggestion that this court could stay the execution of the March and July costs orders were equally hopeless, given the fate of the application to stay the March order before the judge, from which </p>
