At the time of the second Upper Tribunal hearing in December 2018, he had not seen him since April 2016. The second son D was born on 31 March 2011. On 30 November 2012 the appellant married the child’s mother S. Aside from his time on active service and whilst in custody, they lived together as a family. When he was released from custody in February 2018, he resumed cohabitation with S and had daily contact with D. However the appellant and S separated after a few months, since when the appellant’s contact with D has been occasional.  </p>

The judge held that the effect of his deportation on his children would be “unduly harsh” within the meaning of section 117C(5) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 and that his deportation would be a disproportionate interference with his family life.  </p>

The Upper Tribunal set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal and directed that the case be decided again in the Upper Tribunal. </p>

In his Decision and Reasons promulgated on 6 February 2019, the judge said that he considered the evidence given to be truthful. He made findings of fact as summarised at [2] and [5] above. In relation to S’s evidence the judge recorded that she said that D did not want to see his father but wishes to be kept in touch.

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The judge noted at [14] that the difficulty he faced was that Parliament had decided that the public interest lies in deporting people who are foreign criminals and the claimant was a foreign criminal. He considered first the position under section 117C saying the only relevant consideration was whether it would be unduly harsh on the sons for their father to be deported. So far as R was concerned, the position was straightforward. He had no contact with his father and had not had for some time. The deportation would bring to an end the prospect of anything being re-established except possible long-distance contact, but that was more than exists at present. There was no basis for saying the effect on R would be unduly harsh. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">D was in a different position. He had suffered the uncertainties of being a military child and having his father come back into his life then go away again after a short time. The judge considered it would be in his best interests to continue to have a relationship with his father, which would settle down into fruitful occasional contact. Removal would mean little prospect for a meaningful close relationship. However, there was no basis for saying removal would have unduly harsh consequences for the child. The judge said disruption of close relationships is the natural consequence of deportation and there was nothing here which aggravated the harm or made it particularly difficult.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The judge then considered the Military Covenant, upon which Mr Karnik, who appeared for the appellant as he did before this Court, placed particular reliance, noting that it extends to the families of those who serve. The judge said that he inclined to the view that the gambling habit which lay behind the appellant’s criminal behaviour was connected in some way with his unpleasant experiences whilst serving in the Armed Forces. However, Parliament had not made any statutory exception for members or former members of the Armed Forces involved in deportation and nothing in the statute that said their families were entitled to special consideration. He made the point that the respect everyone has for the Armed Forces is diminished if someone commits a serious offence like the appellant had.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The judge took account of the favourable probation report and favourable military material which showed that the criminal behaviour was by no means the extent of his personality and character. However, the judge could not agree that the military connections amount to compelling compassionate circumstances. He was confident that the Crown Court judge would have thought very carefully before sentencing the appellant about his military service and possible reasons for offending, as he referred </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The judge repeated again the family circumstances and how the appellant could not show that the effect of his deportation was unduly harsh on his close relatives. The other factors in the case did not save the day. The judge looked at all matters in the round and said that whilst it was difficult to say that anything was <span style="font-style:italic">irrelevant </span>for the purposes of the Article 8 balancing exercise, the statutory criteria dominated his analysis, leading him to dismiss the appeal. </p>

Although the language is perhaps less precise than that of exception 1, there is nothing to suggest that the word “unduly” is intended as a reference back to the issue of relative seriousness introduced by subsection (2).

Further the word “unduly” implies an element of comparison. It assumes that there is a “due” level of “harshness”, that is a level which may be acceptable or justifiable in the relevant context. “Unduly” implies something going beyond that level. The relevant context is that set by section 117C(1), that is the public interest in the deportation of foreign criminals. One is looking for a degree of harshness going beyond what would necessarily be involved for any child faced with the deportation of a parent. What it does not require in my view (and subject to the discussion of the cases in the next section) is a balancing of relative levels of severity of the parent’s offence, other than is inherent in the distinction drawn by the section itself by reference to length of sentence.

Similarly, in the case of a medium offender, if all he could advance in support of his Article 8 claim was a "near miss" case in which he fell short of bringing himself within either Exception 1 or Exception 2, it would not be possible to say that he had shown that there were "very compelling circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions 1 and 2". He would need to have a far stronger case than that by reference to the interests protected by Article 8 to bring himself within that fall back protection. But again, in principle there may be cases in which such an offender can say that features of his case of a kind described in Exceptions 1 and 2 have such great force for Article 8 purposes that they do constitute such very compelling circumstances, whether taken by themselves or in conjunction with other factors relevant to Article 8 but not falling within the factors described in Exceptions 1 and 2.

In particular, if in working through the structured approach one gets to section 117C(6), the proper application of that provision produces a final result compatible with Article 8 in all cases to which it applies. The provision contains more than a statement of policy to which regard must be had as a relevant consideration. Parliament's assessment that “the public interest requires deportation unless there are very compelling circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions 1 and 2” is one to which the tribunal is bound by law to give effect.  </p>

Of course, the provision to that effect in section 117C(6) must not be applied as if it contained some abstract statutory formula.

Provided that a tribunal has that context in mind, however, a finding that “very compelling circumstances” do not exist in a case to which section 117C(6) applies will produce a final result, compatible with Article 8, that the public interest requires deportation.

First, the right of appeal to the UT is "on any point of law arising from a decision made by the [FTT] other than an excluded decision": Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 ("the 2007 Act"), section 11(1) and (2). If the UT finds an error of law, the UT may set aside the decision of the FTT and remake the decision: section 12(1) and (2) of the 2007 Act. If there is no error of law in the FTT's decision, the decision will stand. Secondly, although "error of law" is widely defined, it is not the case that the UT is entitled to remake the decision of the FTT simply because it does not agree with it, or because it thinks it can produce a better one. Thus, the reasons given for considering there to be an error of law really matter.

He also submitted that, at [23] to [26] of the Decision, the First-tier tribunal conducted a conventional balancing exercise under Article 8, holding that the appellant’s deportation would “not be proportionate” and would be “unjust and unfair”, in other words, contrary to <span style="font-style:italic">NE-A (Nigeria)</span>, the judge conducted an assessment outside the statutory provisions and did not direct himself to the correct test under section 117C(6), namely whether there were “very compelling circumstances” over and above Exceptions 1 and 2. </p>

On this evidence, the conclusion that deportation of the appellant would not be unduly harsh for the children was inevitable. Furthermore, contrary to Mr Karnik’s submission, the Upper Tribunal judge did take account of the Covenant and the submissions about it. The question of what weight to give it was a matter for the Upper Tribunal as the finder of fact. It could not be said that the judge had failed to take account of something relevant or that he had taken account of something irrelevant. He had reached a decision which was open to him, with which this Court should not interfere. </p>

The First-tier Tribunal simply failed to have proper regard to the expression “unduly harsh” and to recognise that it requires a degree of harshness beyond the inevitable disruption to family life and upset that deportation of a parent necessarily involves for any child. It is a very high bar, as Irwin LJ said, but the First-tier Tribunal failed to recognise that and apply the right test. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The First-tier Tribunal also erred in conducting what appears to have been a conventional balancing exercise under Article 8 and failing to focus on the language and purpose of section 117C. Expressions such as that the deportation decision was not “proportionate” and “unjust and unfair” are wide of the mark and fail to focus on the requirement that the appellant must show “very compelling circumstances” to outweigh the public interest in the deportation of foreign criminals. That is a stringent test and, as all the authorities recognise, cases where the circumstances are sufficiently compelling will be comparatively rare. In the circumstances, the First-tier Tribunal clearly erred in law.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">So far as the second ground is concerned, it simply cannot be said that Upper Tribunal Judge Perkins failed to have regard to the Covenant. He expressly referred to it and to Mr Karnik’s submissions about it and said that he had considered them carefully. The real complaint is that he failed to give it sufficient weight. Part of the problem which the appellant faces is that the Covenant is silent about the status of non-UK service personnel who commit criminal offences and there is nothing in section 117C or the Immigration Rules which provides for any sort of exception or special treatment for foreign criminals who have served in the Armed Forces. Mr Karnik rightly did not go so far as to submit that military service would always amount to “very compelling circumstances”, from which it necessarily follows that the assessment of whether there are very compelling circumstances arising from a particular individual’s military service is an evaluative one for the tribunal with which this Court would be reluctant to interfere. </p>

Had he not committed a criminal offence, upon leaving the Royal Marines he would have been eligible to apply for indefinite leave to remain pursuant to the Immigration Rules Appendix Armed Forces, which replaced the Armed Forces Concession: see the discussion of this by Blake J in the Gurkha veterans case <span style="font-style:italic">R (On the application of Limbu and others) v Secretary of State for the Home Department </span>[2008] EWHC 2261 (Admin) at [29]-[31]. As King LJ pointed out during the course of argument, if he had not committed the offence, he would have benefited from indefinite leave to remain and that in turn would have benefited his children, which would have been an example of the Covenant working in practice.   </p>

There was simply no evidence that because they were the children of a father who had served in the Armed Forces, the effect of his deportation would involve a degree of harshness beyond that inevitably suffered by any child whose father is deported.

Even in circumstances in which they can remain in the United Kingdom with their other parent, they will inevitably be distressed. However, in section 117C(5) of the 2002 Act, Parliament has made clear its will that, for foreign offenders who are sentenced to one to four years, only where the consequences for the children are "unduly harsh" will deportation be constrained. That is entirely consistent with article 8 of the ECHR. It is important that decision-makers and, when their decisions are challenged, tribunals and courts honour that expression of Parliamentary will.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Similarly, whatever one’s own opinion as to the fairness or appropriateness of deporting a man who endured danger serving in this country’s Armed Forces for fourteen years, the statutory regime is clear. Unless one or other of the Exceptions can be satisfied, the public interest in deporting foreign criminals will only be outweighed if the appellant can show “very compelling circumstances”. Once it is accepted, as it rightly is by Mr Karnik, that military service without more will not always amount to such circumstances, one has to look at the circumstances of this appellant, his military service and family and personal life to determine whether they are very compelling. However regrettable it is for the appellant, in my judgment nothing in his particular life or military service amounts to such very compelling circumstances. That conclusion is not altered by the existence of the Covenant. Whilst it recognises the stresses imposed on family life by military service, it is silent about non-UK exservice personnel who have committed criminal offences. Parliament has not created any statutory exception for foreign criminals who have served in the Armed Forces and the clear wording of the statute cannot be overridden by any general duty to ex-</p>
