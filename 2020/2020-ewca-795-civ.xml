Under the leases of the apartments the landlord is obliged to provide certain services and is entitled to receive a contribution towards its expenditure through an annual service charge payable by the leaseholders. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The service charge is calculated in accordance with the Fifth Schedule to each lease. Paragraph 1 (1) (a) (ii) of that schedule provides that if the landlord fulfils the duties normally carried out by a managing agent it is entitled to include a management fee in the total estate expenditure “not in excess of the sum reasonably and properly payable to an independent managing agent”. Paragraph 1 (1) (c) of the same schedule entitles the landlord to include an annual sum equivalent to the market rent of any accommodation owned by it and provided rent free to its own staff. These two items are clearly notional costs rather than actual costs that the landlord has paid. For the accounting periods in dispute this provision has been taken by the landlord to allow it to recoup a notional rent for its own premises in the Building which it uses as an estate manager's office (rather than as domestic accommodation for porters or other employees). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Until 4 July 2014 the head lessee of the complex was Point West London Ltd (“the old landlord”). As a result of a dispute with one of the lessees, the old landlord entered administration on 22 June 2012. Point West GR Ltd (“the new landlord”) acquired the head lease from the old landlord on 4 July 2014. Shortly afterwards the old landlord went into creditors’ voluntary liquidation. The disputed service charges relate to the period between the old landlord’s entry into administration and the acquisition of the head lease by the new landlord. The amount of the charge itself arose in the context of another dispute: this time over the administrators’ fees and disbursements. The allegation was that the leases did not allow the administrators to charge a management fee because all day to day management of the Building was carried out on-site by staff employed by the old landlord and paid separately through the service charge. </p>

On 18 January 2016 the same leaseholders issued a second application in respect of service charges payable on account for 2016. The relevant areas of dispute were that the leaseholders considered staff wages (including the wages of an employed manager) to be excessive; and the addition of management fees and a notional office rental on top of those wages to be additional costs which would not be charged by an external managing agent. </p>

That enables an application to be made for a determination “whether a service charge is payable” and, if it is “the amount which is payable”. The amount of a service charge payable is governed, in the first place, by the lease under which it is levied. If there is no contractual liability, then the charge is not payable. But the 1985 Act overlays the lessee’s contractual liability by the imposition of a cap. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The hearing before the FTT occupied three days in July 2016. It heard evidence from a number of witnesses. In its decision of 15 August 2016 (“the original decision”) the FTT dealt with the disbursements in a number of places. It considered a redundancy payment made to a staff member and found at [36] that it was reasonable and payable. It then considered the fees charged by a Mr Nicholson, which the leaseholders said should have been included in the management fee. The FTT found at [39] that those fees were not covered by the management charge; and at [41] that they were reasonable and payable. At [65] the FTT recorded that the disbursements had not been challenged and allowed them in full. As the UT pointed out at [53] the FTT did not explicitly identify which “disbursements” had not been challenged. It seems, however, that in so far as disbursements had not already been dealt with in previous parts of the decision, they related to additional accountancy and surveying fees. </p>

The landlord’s argument, recorded by the FTT at [42], was not that it had actually paid the amount claimed; but that the management charges were “reasonable and value for money”. The FTT referred to the RICS Service Charge Residential Management Code and said that it was not mandatory to charge a fixed fee. It concluded at [49] that, having regard to the complexity of managing Point West, the management fees claimed were “within a reasonable range” and that “they were payable”. In the light of the way that the landlord put its case and the terms of the lease, it seems to me to be clear that the FTT understood that this was a charge as opposed to a cost. </p>

It recorded the leaseholders' acceptance that, in principle, the service charge could include a charge for office space. The debate had concerned whether the occupation of office space by the company managing the building on behalf of the landlord (“PWMS”) was occupation by "staff" in the sense intended by clause 6(4)(f) of the lease. This entitled the landlord "… to employ … one or more caretakers porters [etc] … and in particular to provide accommodation either in the Building or elsewhere … and any other services (including the provision of uniforms and telephones) considered necessary by the Landlord for them whilst in the employ of the Landlord". The FTT considered that the office used by PWMS fell within the meaning of this covenant and that the notional cost of providing it was a recoverable expense (the Fifth Schedule allowed the recovery of "an annual sum equivalent to the market rent" of accommodation provided rent free to those mentioned in clause 6(4)(f)). The evidence relating to the rental value of the office space had not been challenged so the FTT found that the notional rent was reasonable and payable. </p>

In considering what time the administrators had spent on managing Point West (rather than dealing with insolvency process of the old landlord) the FTT said that it had taken into account the matters covered by the management fee (which it had already decided was reasonable). </p>

It is important to note, however, that a decision of the FTT that costs have been reasonably incurred does not necessarily mean that they are actually recoverable by the landlord. A decision of the FTT creates no liability to pay. The liability to pay is created by the lease. All that a decision of the FTT does is to remove a potential statutory cap on the liability created by the lease. It follows, therefore, that if the landlords had actually sued the leaseholders for unpaid service charge, the latter’s liability would not have exceeded the amount that the landlord had actually demanded.  </p>

The FTT thus issued a case management decision on 10 April 2017. In that decision, the FTT suggested that the full nature of the dispute concerning administrators' fees had not been brought to its attention, and acknowledged that it had not appreciated that it had been the landlord’s case that the fees were not charged in addition to the management fee, office rent and disbursements. It was concerned that it had heard insufficient evidence and argument during the course of the first hearing to enable it to make a just and fair determination on the review. It therefore directed that the review was to be conducted by way of a further oral hearing on the basis of the submissions which had already been exchanged (including since its original decision) which were to be incorporated into new statements of case. There was no appeal against that ruling. But as Mr Morshead pointed out, this case management decision did not, at least expressly, widen the scope of the review to encompass parts of the original decision other than that contained in paragraphs 51 to 65.  </p>

That issue is also live on this appeal. The landlord contended that the scope of the review having been triggered by the leaseholders’ application for permission to appeal, the scope of the review was necessarily limited to what was covered by the grounds of appeal. Since it had not intended to make a charge for administrators’ fees over and above the sums that the FTT had already determined were reasonably incurred and payable, the leaseholders could not challenge the recoverability of those sums. The leaseholders, on the other hand, argued that the FTT’s case management decision had broadened the scope of the issues to be considered on review. The FTT quoted at length from its case management decision. It concluded that the effect of that decision was that the scope of the review was to be determined by the submissions made by each party which had been incorporated into single statements of case. </p>

In this context a point of law is widely defined. In <span style="font-style:italic">Railtrack plc v Guinness Ltd</span> [2003] EWCA Civ 188, [2003] 1 EGLR 124 at [51] Carnwath LJ said: </p>

The Court can correct "all kinds of error of law, including errors which might otherwise be the subject of judicial review proceedings…. Thus, for example, a material breach of the rules of natural justice will be treated as an error of law. Furthermore, judicial review (and therefore an appeal on law) may in appropriate cases be available where the decision is reached "upon an incorrect basis of fact", due to misunderstanding or ignorance … A failure of reasoning may not in itself establish an error of law, but it may "indicate that the tribunal had never properly considered the matter…and that the proper thought processes have not been gone through.” </p>

An application was made to vary an estate management scheme. The LVT decided, on the basis of a previous decision of the LVT, that it had no jurisdiction to do so. It did not, therefore, consider the merits of the application. Unknown to the LVT, however, the decision on which it relied had been successfully appealed to the Lands Tribunal. So the LVT’s decision on the question of jurisdiction was wrong in law. In the UT, the Deputy President said that that would have been a clear case for a review, which would have resulted in the original decision to be set aside, thus clearing the way for the determination of the application on its merits.

The principle which we find in the Act of 1858 is the same principle as that which requires judgments in the courts to be binding, and that which prohibits litigation after the expiry of limitation periods. Any determination of disputable fact may, the law recognises, be imperfect: the law aims at providing the best and safest solution compatible with human fallibility and having reached that solution it closes the book. The law knows, and we all know, that sometimes fresh material may be found, which perhaps might lead to a different result, but, in the interest of peace, certainty and security it prevents further inquiry. It is said that in doing this, the law is preferring justice to truth. That may be so: these values cannot always coincide. The law does its best to reduce the gap. But there are cases where the certainty of justice prevails over the possibility of truth (I do not say that this is such a case), and these are cases where the law insists on finality. For a policy of closure to be compatible with justice, it must be attended with safeguards: so the law allows appeals: so the law, exceptionally, allows appeals out of time: so the law still more exceptionally allows judgments to be attacked on the ground of fraud: so limitation periods may, exceptionally, be extended. But these are exceptions to a general rule of high public importance, and as all the cases show, they are reserved for rare and limited cases, where the facts justifying them can be strictly proved.” </p>

In my judgment, this was a procedural irregularity. Despite Mr Dovar’s strenuous submissions to the contrary, I do not consider that the question of quantum, item by item, formed part of the leaseholders’ cross-appeal. The FTT had based its assessment, at least in part, on the oral evidence that it heard at the original hearing. That evidence does not appear to have been before the UT, and the UT did not give the landlord the opportunity to call evidence again. Instead the UT took the view that the question of reasonableness could, in effect, be decided on the papers. But that assessment, in my judgment, was a conclusion that could only have been properly reached if, having heard the evidence that the landlord wished to call, the UT decided that it was of no value.  </p>

But that question had already been determined by the FTT in its original decision, back in August 2016. The applicability of section 20B did not form part of the leaseholders’ statement of case on the review. The FTT recorded at [74] of its review decision that the leaseholders had asked for permission to raise the point. But the FTT did not grant that permission. If it had done so it would have had to set aside its original decision on that point. But it could only have done that if it considered that an appeal against that decision was likely to succeed; and there was no formulated ground of appeal before it. To seek to rely on section 20B as an additional reason for upholding the review decision necessarily involves an attack on the FTT’s conclusion on section 20B in its original decision. I therefore agree with Mr Morshead that the question whether section 20B precluded recovery of service charges that would otherwise have been due was not a question that could properly have been raised before the UT, except by an appeal long out of time against the FTT’s original decision. I consider, therefore, that the UT was also wrong to embark upon a consideration of that issue. It follows that the substantive answer to that question forms no part of this appeal. Accordingly, I express no view on it, one way or the other. </p>
