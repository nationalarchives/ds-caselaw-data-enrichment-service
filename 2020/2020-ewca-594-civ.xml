	    <p style="margin-left:0.29in;margin-right:0.00in">This case came before us as an appeal against the refusal of an application by a school for an interim injunction to prevent the publication of an inspection report prepared by the Office for Standards in Education, Children’s Services and Skills (“Ofsted”) until the determination of judicial review proceedings challenging that report. At the hearing, it was agreed at our suggestion that we should not only decide that appeal but also, sitting as the Divisional Court, the application for permission to apply for judicial review, which had not been determined in the court below. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.29in;margin-right:0.00in">The appeal is against an order made by Julian Knowles J. on 23 January 2020, refusing an application for interim relief in the form of an injunction. The school is a state-funded secondary school in the north of England. The appellant is its governing body. The first respondent is Ofsted, which is a non-ministerial department of the Government, responsible for inspecting various educational institutions, including state-funded secondary schools. The second respondent is the Department for Education. On 10 December 2019, the school made a claim for judicial review of a report prepared by Ofsted under section 5 of the Education Act 2005, following an inspection of the school in October 2019. The report, which was sent to the school in final form on 5 December 2019, graded the school as “Inadequate”. The school strongly disagrees with that assessment. In its claim it seeks an order to quash the report, on the grounds of irrationality and procedural unfairness. It also applied for an interim injunction under section 37 of the Senior Courts Act 1981 and CPR r.25(1)(a) to restrain Ofsted from publishing the report, or any similar report, before the determination of the claim. This was the application that Julian Knowles J. refused.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.29in;margin-right:0.00in">With the “overriding objective” in mind, it seemed sensible that we should not merely decide the appeal against the refusal of interim relief, but also re-constitute this court as the Divisional Court, under sections 9 and 66 of the 1981 Act, to determine the application for permission to apply for judicial review. This avoids the possibility of the school being denied an appeal to the Court of Appeal against a refusal of permission (see <span style="font-style:italic">R. (on the application of MD (Afghanistan)) v Secretary of State for the Home Department </span>[2012] EWCA Civ 194; [2012] 1 W.L.R. 2422, at paragraph 20). If we sit as the Divisional Court on the application for permission, the school can seek to appeal a decision to refuse permission to the Court of Appeal in the usual way (section 16(1) of the 1981 Act, and CPR r.52.8). Nor do we then have to resolve whether a decision to grant or refuse permission to apply for judicial review can properly be said to be either “incidental to” an appeal against the refusal of interim relief (section 15(3) of the 1981 Act) or “[in] relation to” that appeal (CPR r.52.20(1)). </p>

On 3 December 2019, having considered those comments, Ofsted wrote to the school, saying it was exhibiting serious weaknesses, and adhering to the grade of “Inadequate”.

He pointed to the grading of “Personal development” as “[requiring] improvement”, despite the finding that pupils “access a wide range of opportunities outside their lessons”. He pointed to the grading of “Leadership and management” as “Inadequate”, submitting that the finding that leaders’ attitude to “site safety” was “complacent” could not be justified in the absence of any prescribed “specific steps with regard to site security” in the inspection handbook (paragraph 47). </p>

The reliance placed on those views was not rational. The lead inspector treated them as incapable of belief where they concerned pupils’ conduct in class, but not as being unreliable more generally. Other relevant evidence – which the inspection team should have considered under the guidance in the inspection handbook, but did not – was firmly to the contrary. The views of this minority of pupils put into the inspectors’ minds a state of affairs that they subconsciously sought to justify – effectively, confirmation bias. In any event, the resulting conclusions were irrational.  </p>

It had done this after the school had complained that the wording in the draft report did not reflect the evidence, and despite the lead inspector’s written response to the complaint, in which he had said that the original wording did “accurately reflect the evidence”. This, submitted Mr Cawson, shows how the evidence on which Ofsted had relied could be used to support two entirely contrasting conclusions.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.29in;margin-right:0.00in">Two general points can be made at the outset. First, an allegation of irrationality is never easy to establish. In the context of a school inspection, undertaken within a statutory framework by inspectors familiar with the task, and involving issues on which the exercise of evaluative judgment is an essential part of the process, it is likely to be particularly difficult. Secondly, as was recently held by this court in <span style="font-style:italic">R. (on the application of Durand Academy Trust) v Office for Standards in Education, Children’s Services and Skills</span> [2018] EWCA Civ 2813; [2019] E.L.R. 100, Ofsted’s inspection, evaluation and reporting process, and its procedure for handling complaints, are inherently procedurally fair (see the judgment of Hamblen L.J., as he then was, at paragraph 63). The contrary was not argued before us. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.29in;margin-right:0.00in">To amplify the first of those two points: dissatisfaction with the findings and conclusions of the inspection report does not, of itself, amount to a demonstration of irrationality. A central theme in these proceedings, reiterated in different forms with different examples, is the grievance that the inspectors placed too much or too little weight on certain evidence. That grievance, without more, has no traction in a claim for judicial review. The weight attached to a particular document – if available and relevant – was a matter for the inspectors, subject only to the traditional principles of public law. Disagreement on the appropriate weight is never, on its own, a proper basis for a public law challenge. And it must be remembered here that the inspectors who conduct a school inspection for Ofsted are entrusted with the task of assessing the evidence before them with the benefit of their own experience and expertise, and judging what weight should be given to evidence of a particular kind or from a particular source. The court will not second guess the judgments they make. As the lead inspector said in his response of 26 November 2019 to the complaint made by the school after it received the draft report on 4 November 2019: </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.29in;margin-right:0.00in">I reject the submissions made by Mr Cawson to the effect that the inspection report is, in various respects, internally inconsistent to the point of being perverse. That argument is unrealistic. To describe the school as exhibiting “contrasts”, as the inspectors did, is only to recognize that it was by no means failing against all the measures of adequate performance. The reality here is that the inspection report is not universally disapproving or censorious of the school’s performance, but sets out a number of specific conclusions across the range of relevant issues in the inspection. Such differences are, in this case at least, merely the expression of different judgments on different questions. They do not involve selfcontradiction, or even inconsistency. In my opinion, they do not come close to irrationality. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.29in;margin-right:0.00in">Before it was put in final form, the inspection report was the subject of a “moderation” and “quality assurance” process, in which its conclusions were verified against the available evidence. I do not accept Mr Cawson’s suggestion that this process took place at a stage of the whole exercise when irrationality in the emerging conclusions was likely to survive into the final report. As Sir James pointed out, the school’s complaint was submitted during the “moderation” process, on 23 October 2019. It is therefore impossible to suggest that Ofsted was unaware of the school’s concerns at a time when the report could still have been changed. Indeed, it is confirmed by Emma Ing, Ofsted’s Regional Director for the region, in her witness statement dated 17 December 2019 (at paragraph 19), that the school’s complaint was considered in the “moderation” process. The complaint and also the school’s comments on the draft report were then, on 26 November 2019, considered by the lead inspector, who provided a detailed response, in which he referred to evidence that he saw as supporting his conclusions, and also by Claire Brown, a Senior Inspector, who independently reviewed the lead inspector’s response. </p>

The complaint here, once again, goes no further than a disagreement on weight. As Sir James told us, the “Growing up in [the county]” report was taken into account in the “moderation” process. But in any case it lends no support to the proposition that the inspectors were not entitled to rely on the concerns about inadequate “safeguarding” and bullying that were expressed to them during the inspection. The Pivotal Education report was produced after the inspection had been carried out. The inspectors cannot realistically be criticized for not having considered it. The inspection report refers (on p.7) to the consideration given to “Ofsted’s online questionnaires”, including a “pupil survey”, a “staff survey”, a survey called “Parent View”, and “free-text responses to Parent </p>

The inspectors had to balance the various relevant material, and, in the light of their experience, attribute appropriate weight to each piece of evidence in coming to a sensible conclusion. They were entitled to give significant weight to the views and concerns of the pupils they met. And they evidently did. </p>

When I raised the matter again in a third meeting, my record states that ‘Leaders’ response is that they’ve never had any problem so assume there won’t be any problems in the future’. More widely, when I gave the HT and DHT the evidence which had led to the decision to convert [from a section 8 to a section 5 inspection], including worries about feeling safe, the HT said that I had based the decision on the views of ‘a gaggle of girls’.

The specified circumstances include   pupils having little confidence in “the school’s ability to tackle harassment, bullying, violence and/or discriminatory behaviour successfully”. It seems to me that the inspectors’ finding that the school had failed to tackle racist and homophobic language effectively, underpinned by the survey evidence and what pupils had told them about bullying, was enough, within the bounds of rationality, to substantiate the conclusion that a finding of </p>

This reflects the relevant guidance in the inspection handbook, which cites, as an example of what ineffective safeguarding might include, that “[children], pupils and students or particular groups of<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>children, pupils and students do not feel safe in school …”. Though a safeguarding review was subsequently undertaken by the local authority in November and December 2019, which found that “safeguarding arrangements” at the school were by then “effective”, that pupils felt safe “most of the time”, and that many recommended “improvements” were “already underway”, this took place about two months after Ofsted’s inspection. It is possible that this was enough time for the safeguarding arrangements in the school to have been improved following the inspection. Encouraging as it may be that the local authority’s report concluded as it did, the conclusions it reached do not render the inspection report, whose findings were based on the evidence available to the inspection team at the time, irrational. As Sir James said, if the Ofsted report is published, the school could seek permission to publish the local authority’s report alongside it, with a view to showing that improvements had been made to “safeguarding” since the inspection. </p>

In this context, particular stress should be placed upon the importance of upholding the law of the land, in the public interest, bearing in mind the need for stability in our society, and the duty placed upon certain authorities to enforce the law in the public interest. This is of itself an important factor to be weighed in the balance when assessing the balance of convenience. So if a public authority seeks to enforce what is on its face the law of the land, and the person against whom such action is taken challenges the validity of that law, matters of considerable weight have to be put into the balance to outweigh the desirability of enforcing, in the public interest, what is on its face the law, and so to justify the refusal of an interim injunction in favour of the authority, or to render it just or convenient to restrain the authority for the time being enforcing the law. … .”   </p>

It is impossible to foresee what cases may yet come before the courts; I cannot dismiss from my mind the possibility (no doubt remote) that such a party may suffer such serious and irreparable harm in the event of the law being enforced against him that it may be just or convenient to restrain its enforcement by an interim injunction even though so heavy a burden has not been discharged by him. In the end, the matter is one for the discretion of the court, taking into account all the circumstances of the case. Even so, the court should not restrain a public authority by interim injunction from enforcing an apparently authentic law unless it is satisfied, having regard to all the circumstances, that the challenge to the validity of the law is, prima facie, so firmly based as to justify so exceptional a course being taken.” </p>

(on the application of the Interim Executive Board of X) v Ofsted </span>[2016] EWHC 2004 (Admin); [2017] E.M.L.R. 5, where an injunction was granted to restrain publication of an Ofsted report on a school whose teaching arrangements were said to give rise to unlawful sex discrimination. Between that report and others recently prepared by Ofsted there was a discrepancy described by Stuart-Smith J. as “extraordinary”. The challenged report was “frankly inconsistent” with the previous ones (paragraph 40 of the judgment). There was also “clear evidence of antagonistic behaviour” by inspectors during the inspection, about which complaints had been made at the time (paragraph 41). The judge saw an arguable case that the process from which the report had emerged was “infected by a pre-determined mindset or prejudice that would be quite alien to the proper and independent inspection process upon which the education system and the public at large rightly depends” (paragraph 45). There was “compelling evidence” that the effect of publication could be “extremely adverse and irreparable”. The “immediately foreseeable effect” of publishing the report “would be to raise the spectre that the [school] will be placed back into special measures”. But the “adverse effects” went “much wider”. It was “entirely plausible that, at the present time and in the febrile atmosphere that has prevailed since the Trojan Horse school problem arose, publication of the report has the capacity to affect social and community cohesion”, and also “the capacity to be seen as an unwarranted attack on aspects of the [school’s] Islamic religious ethos which have in the very recent past been acceptable to Ofsted, because the nature and effect of the [school’s] segregation policy have not changed since the previous reports” (paragraph 46 ). The school could not effectively mitigate the damage by communicating the fact that the report was being challenged – because the report was due to be published on the last day before the summer holiday (paragraph 49).  </p>

(on the application of the Governors of St Stephen’s Church of England First School) v Ofsted</span> 16 February 2018 (unreported), Dove J. refused an injunction to restrain publication of an Ofsted report, where the claimant was concerned “about the impact of the report on the reputation of [its] school and staff who are employed there”; that “there is a risk staff [may] leave the school and … there may be an impact on staff morale as a consequence of the report being published”; that “parents may remove children from the school”, which would have “an impact on the financial wellbeing of the school …”; that “children may lose respect for the staff at the school as a consequence of the report being placed in the public domain”; that there would be “an impact on admissions to the school were the public to become aware of the report [when] published …”; and that there would be “a forced academisation of the school …” (paragraph 26). Dove J. was not persuaded that those considerations amounted to “the kind of exceptional circumstances that are required in a case of this kind so as to enable the court to grant relief in the form which effectively overrides the statutory responsibilities of [Ofsted] to not only undertake these inspections but also provide the fruits of those inspections to the public at large” (paragraph 28).

Farbey J. said she “[did] not understand these principles to be in dispute” (paragraph 25). She emphasized that “[public] confidence in the inspection regime is an important public interest, such that parents should be informed promptly of Ofsted’s concerns even if those concerns may later fall away through further inspections or by a successful claim for judicial review”. She added that “[the] orderly and rigorous regulation of schools is an important public interest”. Both “the welfare of the children in [the] school and the public’s confidence in the regulator [meant] that the report should be published without awaiting the outcome of [the] proceedings” (paragraph 26). She “weighed in the balance the potentially serious consequences for the head teacher … who [had] an established reputation and who [stood] … to lose a business that she has evidently worked so hard to build up”, but the school “must be taken to have assumed the risks of regulation and to have been willing to submit to the scheme of [the Education and Skills Act 2008] …” (paragraph 29). She “also weighed the prospects that the school will be forced to close because parents may remove their children so that [it] becomes unviable”.

Like Nicklin J, I consider that I am bound to follow the line of authority summarised by him in the passage I have set out from [95] of his judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Taveta</span>. Unlike him, I have no reservations in doing so. The position adopted by the common law authorities seems to me to be fully in conformity with the analysis required by the ECHR. In <span style="font-style:italic">In re S (A Child)</span>, Lord Steyn made clear at [17] that ‘neither article [10 or 8] has as such precedence over the other’ (emphasis in original). But, as he went on to explain, this meant only that ‘where the two articles are in conflict, an intense focus on the comparative importance of the specific rights being claimed in the individual case is necessary’. Furthermore, ‘the justifications for interfering with or restricting each right must be taken into account’. Where a public authority has the function of publishing a report, that function will often be conferred for the benefit of a specific section of the public. Ofsted’s reporting powers are conferred primarily for the benefit of pupils and parents (existing and prospective) of the inspected schools. The Advertising Standards Authority’s powers are conferred primarily for the benefit of consumers (existing and potential) of the products or services advertised. In each case there is a specific section of the public with an interest in receiving the information in question. This interest is protected by Article 10 ECHR, which confers the right not only to express but also to receive information. The right of a section of the public to receive information which a public authority wishes to communicate to them in what it regards as their interest must carry very substantial weight in the balancing exercise.  </p>

It is important to recognize the scope of Ofsted’s functions under sections 5, 13 and 14 of the 2005 Act, including their powers and duties to secure the timely publication and dissemination of their inspection reports. The inherent purpose of this part of the statutory regime is to promote the public interest in parents, pupils and local communities knowing, without delay, the results of school inspections, and to uphold the rights of those entitled to receive that information. The considerations that would warrant impeding these functions would have to be very powerful.   </p>

Only if the lower court’s conclusions are irrational or otherwise plainly incorrect in law will its decision be reversed. As Sir James rightly reminded us, the grant of interim relief is discretionary and the exercise of discretion by a judge should be afforded appropriate deference by the appellate court.  </p>

He readily accepted that publication of the inspection report would cause the school “reputational damage”, which could have knock-on effects upon recruitment of staff and parents sending their children to the school; and that the findings of toleration of homophobic and racist language were “serious” and would likely attract “considerable publicity” (paragraph 89). But he concluded that “taken separately or together, none of these factors amounts to the sort of compelling reasons that are capable of justifying [restraining] publication in the present context” (paragraph 90). This case was, in his view, similar to <span style="font-style:italic">St Stephen’s Church of England First School</span> (ibid.), and he agreed with the approach of Dove J. in that case (paragraph 92). He refused the application for interim relief essentially because, “[whatever] the strength of [the school’s] case, taking a step back and looking at matters in the round, there are not here any sufficiently compelling reasons to restrain publication by Ofsted of the [report]” (ibid.). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.29in;margin-right:0.00in">Ultimately, Mr Cawson argued, the judge was wrong to conclude that the “balance of convenience” lay in favour of the report being published. In cases of this kind the “threshold” for interim relief should not be set too high. Nicklin J. was right in <span style="font-style:italic">Taveta Investments Ltd.</span> to entertain reservations about “presumptive priority” being given to article 10 of the Convention over article 8. The public interest in the publication of Ofsted reports was only one factor in the balance. Also relevant were the merits of the claim, and the damage likely to result if an interim injunction were not granted. The judge had accepted that the report, if published, would cause the school “reputational damage” (paragraph 89 of the judgment). He should have found that this case fell into the category identified by Laws J. in <span style="font-style:italic">ex parte</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">Vernons </span>(at p.1294) – cases where the effects of publication “are damaging to the applicant in a manner which would be so irreparable, so past recall as to amount to a pressing ground”. This was particularly so, Mr Cawson submitted, because of the serious, and unfounded, comments in the report about a failure to confront the “widespread” and “endemic” use of “racist and homophobic language”, and because the findings of the inspection report on “safeguarding” were not replicated in the subsequent local authority report. Publication of a flawed inspection report could weaken confidence in the Ofsted inspection process if the claim for judicial review claim were to succeed. This would not be in the public interest.  </p>

This is plain from his statement (in paragraph 87 of his judgment) that he had not been persuaded that “the merits of [the school’s] case” were “sufficiently strong to weigh in favour of granting the relief sought”. His conclusion overall was clearly one of balance. In his view, however strong the school’s case might be, there were “not … any sufficiently compelling reasons to restrain publication” of the report (paragraph 92).

But looking at the inspection as a whole, including the “moderation” and “quality assurance” process, he did not regard them as sufficiently cogent, taken with the other factors relied on by the school, to outweigh the considerations telling against the granting of an interim injunction. He was, I think, entitled to take that view. Indeed, I would say he was undoubtedly right to do so. </p>

In that case, despite it being argued that the report would damage the school’s reputation, cause a loss of pupils and staff, diminish staff morale, harm the school financially, and possibly lead to its becoming an academy, the court was not satisfied that any of those factors, or all of them, amounted to the kind of circumstances that would justify granting an interim injunction. Equally, he was right to regard <span style="font-style:italic">Interim Executive Board of X </span>as materially different from this case on its facts, noting that in that case there was clear evidence of a “febrile” media atmosphere, the prospect of damage to “social and community cohesion”, and a risk of the report being seen as an “unwarranted attack on … the [school’s] Islamic religious ethos” (paragraphs 46 and 47 of the judgment).  </p>

As Farbey J. rightly observed in <span style="font-style:italic">Remus White Ltd.</span> (at paragraph 26), public confidence in the statutory regime for school inspections is important in the public interest, and this requires Ofsted’s concerns about a school’s performance to be brought into the public domain promptly.  </p>
