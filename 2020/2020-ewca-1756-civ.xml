Gluck, contends that he has planning permission to carry out two developments because the respondent local planning authority, Crawley Borough Council (“the Council”), refused applications for prior approval in respect of them only after the 56-day period specified in paragraph W(11) of part 3 of schedule 2 to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (“the GPDO”) had already expired. Holgate J (“the Judge”), upholding an inspector, decided otherwise on the basis that the period could be extended by agreement pursuant to article 7(c) of the GPDO and, on the facts, had been. Mr Gluck appeals against that decision. </p>

Instead, the Council received on 7 May 2018 a letter of that date from Asserson, Mr Gluck’s solicitors. Asserson stated in their letter that the Council had failed to notify Mr Gluck of its decisions on his applications within the 56-day period required by the GPDO and that therefore prior approval was “deemed to be granted by virtue of paragraph W11(c) of Part 3 to Schedule 2 of the Order, and … the Council is now no longer lawfully able to issue decision notices refusing the Applications”.

This is quite clearly not in any way an expression of agreement to an extension of time by the Council (though in any event it is not clear that an implied agreement would suffice), but instead is an affirmation that the Council was intending to determine the Applications in accordance with its own (albeit erroneous) calculation of the 56-day timescales. There was therefore no written agreement to extend time, and the 56-day timescales to determine the Applications remained.” </p>

The specification of a time period in Schedule 2 (such as 56 days) for a decision on whether prior approval is required, linked to a restriction on commencement of development, is not incompatible with the possibility of extending time under limb (c). Limb (b) lays down a finite period of 8 weeks for decision-making, but that is to be read together with, and subject to, any extension under limb (c). The language of limb (a) does not preclude an extension of time under limb (c) simply because the time period is specified in Schedule 2 rather than in Article 7. Nor is any such extension precluded because the time period is used to control when development may lawfully commence. A provision such as paragraph W in Part 3 of Schedule 2 is capable of being read together with Article 7. Permitted development rights granted under schedule 2 are expressly subject to other provisions of GPDO 2015 including Article 7 (Article 3(1)). I accept [counsel for the Secretary of State’s] submission that limb (a) refers to a period specified in Schedule 2 but (like limb (b)) that is subject to any extension agreed under limb (c), and the time period stated in, for example, paragraph W(11) must be read and understood accordingly.” </p>

Three types of prior approval procedure can be discerned in schedule 2, she said. In some cases, such as class O of part 3, the schedule sets a single period within which the local planning authority must determine both whether prior approval is required and whether approval should be given. At the other end of the spectrum, parts 17 and 18 just make planning permission conditional on prior approval having been granted, without providing for any determination as to whether prior approval is needed, and no time limit is prescribed by schedule 2.

Class A of part 6 provides an example. There, paragraph A2 stipulates that “the developer must, before beginning the development, apply to the local planning authority for a determination as to whether the prior approval of the authority will be required as to the siting, design and external appearance of the building, the siting and means of construction of the private way, the siting of the excavation or deposit or the siting and appearance of the tank, as the case may be” and a 28-day period for that determination is set by paragraph A2(iii), which states: </p>

While time can otherwise be extended, it has not been thought appropriate for the periods within which decisions involving a determination as to whether prior approval is required to be susceptible to extension. That, moreover, makes sense since such decisions should be capable of being made relatively quickly and fixed deadlines are apt to deter local planning authorities from sitting on their hands. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">With regard to the GPDO’s antecedents, Miss Jackson explained that article 21 of the Town and Country Planning (General Development Procedure) Order 1995 (“the 1995 GPDO”) and, subsequently, article 30 of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2010 (which replaced article 21 of the 1995 GPDO) required a local planning authority to give its decision on a prior approval application within eight weeks but expressly referred to the possibility of the period being extended by agreement. In contrast, neither the 56-day period specified in paragraph A3(7) of part 24 of schedule 2 to the 1995 GPDO nor the 42day period applied to home extensions following the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Amendment) (England) Order 2013 could be extended and, in a “hybrid” case, there was no scope for extending the deadline within which a local planning authority had to determine whether prior approval was required (see in this respect <span style="font-style:italic">Murrell v Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government </span>[2010] EWCA Civ 1367, [2011] 1 P&amp;CR 6). If, Miss Jackson submitted, Parliament had intended to alter the way in which time limits in respect of prior approval applications operated, there would surely have been some reference to that in the explanatory materials, but there was none.

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The key point is that the Judge’s conclusions are supported by the language of article 7 of the GPDO. Were Miss Jackson’s interpretation of article 7 correct, article 7(c) would not have warranted a separate sub-article: since sub-article (c) would merely represent a qualification to sub-article (b), the two could (and surely would) have been combined. Miss Jackson’s construction of article 7 is also hard to reconcile with the existence of article 7(a): the periods specified in schedule 2 to which article 7(a) refers are of course anyway so specified so it is difficult to see the need for article 7(a) unless article 7(c) was meant to apply to it. Miss Jackson sought to explain article 7(a)’s inclusion on the basis that article 7 is directed at the local planning authority’s duties, but that would not seem to add anything useful. The Judge’s approach derives support, too, from the principle that “Where a provision consists of several numbered paragraphs with the word ‘and’ or ‘or’ at the end of the penultimate paragraph, there is a strong implication that each of the preceding paragraphs is separated by the same conjunction” (see Bennion, Bailey and Norbury on Statutory Interpretation, 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> ed., at s 16.6). I agree with Mr Charles Streeten, who appeared for the Secretary of State, that, read naturally, article 7 means that time may be extended pursuant to article 7(c) either where a period is specified in schedule 2 or where the default 8-week period for which article 7(b) provides is applicable. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">There are further reasons for thinking that to be the correct interpretation of article 7 of the GPDO. First, the definition of “deemed prior approval provision” given in article 7ZA (“a provision in Schedule 2 in reliance on which, after the expiry of a time period for decision under article 7 where the application has not been determined, development may begin”) underlines the primary role of article 7: it is treated as governing when development may begin, albeit that it cross-refers to schedule 2. As the Judge put it in paragraph 64 of his judgment, “Article 7ZA(9) makes it clear that the time periods for decision-making referred to in Article 7 are integral to the conditions in schedule 2 which control when development may lawfully begin in reliance upon the prior approval deeming provision”. Secondly, it makes sense that periods specified in schedule 2 should be capable of extension under article 7(c). Were Miss Jackson’s approach correct, it would be impossible to extend such a period even where both a developer and the local planning authority wanted to do so, for example to allow the developer to supply further information or to hold discussions with the local planning authority or consultees. Take paragraph W of part 3 of schedule 2. That states that a local planning authority may refuse an application where the developer has provided insufficient information on certain matters (paragraph W(3)), authorises a local planning authority to require a developer to submit information (paragraph W(9)) and allows a local planning authority to grant prior approval subject to conditions (paragraph W(13)). Since, moreover, paragraph O2 provides for a local planning authority to determine whether prior approval will be required as to “transport and highways impacts”, “contamination risks”, “flooding risks”, “impacts of noise” and “the provision of adequate natural light”, an application may raise technical issues calling for expert reports. In the circumstances, it is easy to envisage circumstances in which a developer and the local planning authority might both think it desirable that the 56-day period specified in paragraph W(11)(c) should be extended. Miss Jackson’s construction of article 7(c) could result in a local planning authority having to refuse an application because the 56-day period was running out and a further application needing to be made with additional information. In contrast, the interpretation of article 7(c) which I favour allows the scheme to work efficiently and sensibly for the mutual benefit of developer and local planning authority. It is significant in this context that the possibility of extension under article 7(c) should not prejudice developers as time could not be extended without their agreement. As the Judge noted in paragraph 72 of his judgment, “The protection provided to applicants by the so-called ‘deemed approval’ provisions in Schedule 2 is not removed by treating limb (c) in Article 7 as applying to limb (a) as well as limb (b)”. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Nor is the Judge’s construction of article 7 undermined by Miss Jackson’s analysis of the GPDO’s structure and antecedents. With regard to the former, it is hard to see why it should have been thought appropriate to preclude extensions in respect of decisions involving a determination as to whether prior approval is required while permitting them with other decisions. Moreover, the prior approval provisions do not create as neat a picture as Miss Jackson’s three-part division would suggest. There are hardly any instances of planning permission simply being conditional on prior approval having been granted without a determination as to whether prior approval is needed: parts 17 and 18 of schedule 2 are encountered only rarely. Again, on occasions schedule 2 specifies time limits for both stages of a “hybrid” case. For example, paragraph A3(8) of part 16 sets the period within which approval must be given or refused in circumstances where it has already been determined that prior approval is required. Turning to the GPDO’s antecedents, predecessor provisions cannot be taken as a reliable guide to the present law when the GPDO did more than merely consolidate and article 7 had no precise equivalent in the earlier legislation.

In other words, there has to be something in writing by or on behalf of each party to comply with article 7(c). It is, I suppose, possible to conceive of a case in which an individual was authorised by both applicant and local planning authority to record an agreement. That (presumably rare) situation apart, however, documentation will have to have been subscribed to by or on behalf of the applicant and, separately, the local planning authority.

However, article 7(c) is applicable only where a longer period has been “agreed by the applicant and the authority in writing”. Read naturally, that seems to me to signify that – as in fact article 7(c) says in terms – a longer period must have been agreed by the applicant and the authority (i.e. both of them) in writing. That can be achieved, as I see it, either by a written agreement between the applicant and the authority or by written evidence emanating from each. As I understand it, the approach preferred by Henderson and Hickinbottom LJJ involves construing article 7(c) as if it spoke of a longer period having been “agreed by the applicant and the authority <span style="font-style:italic">and </span>in writing”, uncoupling the “by the applicant and the authority” from “in writing”. I am not myself convinced by this. First, article 7(c) does not include either “and” or anything to similar effect; on the face of it, it simply refers to the applicant and the authority having agreed in writing. Secondly, if the “in writing” is divorced from the preceding words, article 7(c) imposes no limit on the source of the writing: it need not come from either the applicant or the authority. Thirdly, article 7(c)’s insistence on writing appears to me to make it inherently unlikely that it was intended to have the breadth that Henderson and Hickinbottom LJJ’s approach implies. Article 7(c) could presumably be satisfied even by, say, an assertion of an oral agreement advanced for the first time in a letter </p>

In this regard, Mr Streeten relied on a statutory declaration made by Mr Walke on 14 February 2019 in which he referred to agreement having been reached on 27 April 2018 “on extending the time period for determination of both Applications to 12 May 2018 by telephone with Mr Gluck and subsequent email from Tony Allen”. However, it is not clear from this passage whether Mr Walke considered an extension <span style="font-style:italic">to 12 May </span>to have been agreed in advance of Mr Allen’s email, and the terms of that email themselves suggest that Mr Allen was <span style="font-style:italic">proposing </span>that date.

Mr Streeten stressed in particular the first paragraph of Mr Walke’s email, “Thanks for your email”. In the context, Mr Streeten said, Mr Walke should be understood as agreeing what Mr Allen had proposed. In the light of his earlier conversation with Mr Gluck, Mr Walke was expecting to receive an email from Mr Allen allowing an extension of time and, when he did so, he “put a tick in the box”. The second paragraph of Mr Walke’s email, Mr Streeten submitted, did not relate to the extension but to the noise issue. </p>

On the other hand, it once again has to be remembered that we are not concerned with whether a contract was made but rather with the operation of the planning system and the Courts must there be wary of “the dangers of excessive legalism”. On the facts, it is apparent both from the email correspondence and from Mr Walke’s statutory declaration that in advance of receiving Mr Allen’s 1.20 pm email Mr Walke had orally agreed with Mr Gluck that time should be extended but was waiting for an email from Mr Allen to confirm that the latter was “allowing the decision to be extended” (to quote Mr Gluck’s 12.52 pm email to Mr Allen). The 1.20 pm email was what Mr Walke had been waiting for and provided the requisite confirmation. In the very particular circumstances, it is fair to read Mr Walke’s reply, with its “Thanks for your email” and absence of dissent, as agreement. Mr Walke had been waiting for a box to be ticked (to adopt Mr Streeten’s words) and, finding that it had been, he needed to do no more than acknowledge Mr Allen’s email with thanks to indicate his agreement on the Council’s behalf. Plainly, it would in the context have been appropriate, not to say important, for Mr Walke to tell Mr Allen if he was not prepared to go along with what was proposed, and he did not do so. True it is that in the second paragraph of his email Mr Walke said that he would “discuss this” with his manager, but this is sensibly to be read as relating to “the potential issue around noise disturbance” to which Mr Allen had referred. Mr Walke did not voice the slightest objection to an extension to 12 May in line with what he had already agreed with Mr Gluck and it appears to have been common ground that Mr Walke had authority to agree an extension without reference to his manager. </p>

However, whilst the issue does not arise for determination in this appeal – because, as I have also indicated, I agree with Newey LJ that in this case the agreement for an extension was duly acknowledged in writing by or on behalf of both Mr Gluck and the Council – in my view, on a natural reading of these words, “in writing” does not refer to “the applicant and the authority” but to “agreed”; so that the relevant phrase is properly construed as “agreed (i) by the applicant and the authority (ii) in writing”.  Thus, article 7(c) requires no more than for the agreement to be evidenced in writing, and I would not be minded to put a gloss on it to require, as a matter of law, that that evidence must be in the particular form of writing emanating from or on behalf of each of the applicant and the authority.  Consequently, if (for example) an applicant and an authority orally agree to an extension, and that agreement is acknowledged in writing by the applicant, the applicant could not then, in the absence of something in writing from the authority, say that deemed planning permission had been granted under the GPDO by the effluxion of the unextended period, which would be the result of Newey LJ’s construction.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">However, as I have indicated, that difference between Newey LJ and me is not material to the outcome of this appeal.  Save for that single point, I agree with his analysis; and, on the basis of that analysis, I agree with his conclusion that this appeal should be dismissed.       </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Subject to one reservation, I agree that the appeal should be dismissed for the reasons so clearly given by Newey LJ. In particular, I too agree with his conclusions of law that (a) the relevant 56-day period can be extended by agreement between the applicant and the local planning authority, and (b) the wording of article 7(1) of the GPDO, on its true construction, requires only that an agreement to extend should be evidenced, and not necessarily made, in writing. On the facts, as Newey LJ has explained, an agreement was reached between Mr Gluck and the Council on both the principle and the duration of an extension, each ingredient being necessary in order to satisfy the words “<span style="font-style:italic">such longer period</span> as may be agreed” (my emphasis). Although the principle of an extension had been agreed between Mr Gluck and Mr Walke in the telephone conversation referred to by Mr Gluck in his 12.52 pm email to Mr Allen on 27 April 2018, it seems probable that the duration (until 12 May 2018) was not agreed until it had been proposed by Mr Allen in his 1.20 pm email to Mr Walke and implicitly accepted by the latter in his reply at 2.27 pm.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In those circumstances, the agreement was in my opinion clearly evidenced in writing by or on behalf of both Mr Gluck and the Council. That makes it unnecessary for us to decide the one point of law on which differing views have been expressed by my Lords, Newey LJ and Hickinbottom LJ, namely whether (as Newey LJ considers) it is necessary for written evidence of an oral agreement extending time under article 7(c) to be forthcoming from each of the applicant and the local authority: see [38] above. On that one point, however, I do respectfully disagree with Newey LJ, as he has indicated, and I agree with the construction of the phrase “agreed by the applicant and the authority in writing” put forward by Hickinbottom LJ in [51] above.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In common with Hickinbottom LJ, I would prefer not to put a gloss on the words “in writing”, nor would I wish to be prescriptive about the form which the necessary writing must take, or from what sources it may emanate. I would, however, emphasise that the question should always be approached in the spirit of practical good sense and avoidance of legalism which it is appropriate to adopt in interpreting the planning system and the process of decision making within it: see the authorities referred to by Newey LJ at [36]. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I would also associate myself with the encouragement given by Hickinbottom LJ, at [53], for both sides to take prompt steps to record or otherwise acknowledge in writing any agreement to extend time to which they may have come.  </p>
