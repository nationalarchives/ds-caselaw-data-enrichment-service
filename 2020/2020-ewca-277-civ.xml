Each parent sought the court’s permission to take the children respectively to Qatar and Dubai for temporary visits.  Each objected to the other having permission because of what they each said was the risk that the children would not be returned to England.  This required the court, when making its welfare determination, to assess the risk of abduction, the consequence for the children if they were abducted, the benefits to the children of visiting each state and the efficacy of any available safeguards.   </p>

The benefits for children and families when these Conventions apply are well established.  As referred to above, this case provides a clear example of the additional complications and potential obstacles which arise when parents disagree about whether their children should be permitted to travel between states which do not have reciprocal legal arrangements in force. </p>

Since then the mother and children have lived in England.  This was agreed between the parents because they considered that the children’s needs meant that it was in their best interests to live here.  I express this in general terms; one of the children has special needs.  The father remained living in Dubai, where he has extensive business interests, but travelled to England frequently.  </p>

The first was in December 2017 when she and the children went to Qatar with the father’s agreement.  The second was in March 2018 when, pursuant to a consent order made in the English proceedings, the mother and the children again travelled to Qatar, principally for the purposes of applying for UK residence visas for the children as the applications had to be made when the children were not in the UK.  The third was, again to Qatar, in May/June 2018 following another consent order made in May 2018.  The mother and children have also travelled to other countries. </p>

The position was the same in respect of “[a]ssurances and undertakings” which would not be applied or enforced.  There is also “nothing … that is the equivalent to a ‘mirror procedure’”.  The only mechanism available is “for foreign parties to submit an agreement to a court … which could be confirmed by that court so as to be enforceable locally as a judgment”.  This would be available in both Dubai and Qatar.  Mr Edge was aware of this procedure having been used in “many cases involving children split between the UK and Middle East jurisdictions since [1998] including the UAE”.

Following divorce, in what Mr Edge describes as “a normal situation”, the father will continue to act as guardian until marriage (in the case of a daughter) and until majority (in the case of a son).  A guardian has a number of rights including that a child cannot travel outside the UAE without his written consent.  Relocation out of the UAE would also require the express consent of the guardian and “a court would only overrule a guardian’s refusal to permit relocation in the most exceptional circumstances”. </p>

If one of the parents later sought to challenge the order “it is not entirely certain how a Middle East court would react” although he also said that if an agreement had been “confirmed by a local court judgment then it should prove difficult for either party to undo the provisions”.

The mother is “highly distrustful of the father” and “genuinely utterly terrified of the possibility that the children may be taken from her”.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.40in;margin-right:0.00in">In respect of Dubai, Mr Geekie submitted that the judge’s reasons for deciding that a consent order in Dubai would provide a sufficient safeguard in this case were inadequate.  During the hearing, in response to a question from Lewison LJ, Mr Geekie made clear that he was not submitting that the judge had misunderstood Mr Edge’s evidence but was submitting that the judge’s reasoning was insufficient in that it did not explain why he had decided that a consent order was a sufficient safeguard against the risk of the father abducting the children.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.40in;margin-right:0.00in">Although this was his stated position, it seemed to me that his submissions came very close to the former because he argued that the judge should have set out the “different formulations” in Mr Edge’s evidence as to the likely efficacy of a consent order because the “preponderance of his evidence” was of “uncertainty” as to its efficacy rather than that it “should be enforceable and binding”, as set out by the judge in paragraph 52 of his judgment (see paragraph 50 above). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.40in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Geekie took us through both the written and the oral evidence of Mr Edge in detail in support of this submission.  He highlighted references, for example, to the need for “continuing consent and cooperation”, to “[y]ou are relying on cooperation and goodwill between both parties at all times”, and that if “goodwill dissolves we enter territory of some uncertainty”; to the need to evaluate whether the parties are “likely to adhere to the agreement”; to it being “difficult to decide what exactly will happen” if the order were subsequently challenged; and to his evidence that the mother would be “in a severely compromised position in defending a case in the court” if she was unable to enter Dubai.  He also relied on the judge having misstated part of Mr Edge’s evidence as being that he could not “think of a single case where such an order has not been enforced”.  As referred to above, Mr Edge’s evidence had, in fact, been that he was not aware of any challenge ever having been made to a consent order in any similar circumstances. </p>

Although Mr Geekie sought to challenge this assessment, he accepted during the course of the hearing that the risk was “not zero”.  In my view, once it is accepted that the judge was entitled to find that there was <span style="font-style:italic">a</span> risk, it is difficult to challenge his quantification of that risk as “low”.  In this respect, I am not persuaded that the judge failed to take relevant material into account, as submitted by Mr Geekie.  Of the factors identified by Mr Geekie as being insufficiently analysed by the judge, many are expressly referred to in the course of the judgment.  For example, he referred to the mother as having “committed herself to the United Kingdom, financially and for the sake of the children”; adding that he “had no reason to doubt the evidence that she gave about that”.  The judge was also plainly aware of the history of the mother’s visits to Qatar and of the litigation between the parties as he referred to both of these in his judgment.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.40in;margin-right:0.00in">The judge went on to explain why he, nevertheless, considered that there was a risk that the children would not return from Qatar.  He referred to the influence of the mother’s family as leading him to conclude that, although he had “no reason to doubt what she says about her wishes for the children remaining in the United Kingdom”, there was “still a risk”.  In my view the judge was entitled to come to this conclusion and has sufficiently explained why he did.  In particular, I do not consider that he had to refer, again, to the matters previously set out in his judgment as part of an “overall review” as submitted by Mr Geekie. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.40in;margin-right:0.00in">In respect of the father, Mr Geekie is entitled to submit that the judge’s assessment of the magnitude of the risk is not as clear as it might have been.  However, in stating that he “poses a greater risk” and “more of a risk” than the mother, the judge clearly had in mind that he had to evaluate the level of the risk when deciding whether the proposed safeguard of an agreement and order sufficiently ameliorated that risk to support an order permitting the father to take the children to Dubai.  Although Mr Geekie criticises the judge appearing to treat the risk of retention by the mother and the father as equivalent, the judge does describe the risk of retention as “significant”.  It is also right to point out that the judge identified factors which reduced the risk that the father would not return the children from Dubai. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.40in;margin-right:0.00in">Further, as with Mr Geekie’s case in respect of the mother, I am not persuaded that the judge failed to take any relevant material into account.  In her written submissions, Ms Eaton set out where the judge had referred to the matters relied on by Mr Geekie.  These included the nature and quality of the father’s connections with England and Dubai; the threats made by the father; the influence of the father’s family; and the risk of both travel bans and arrest warrants.  I also do not consider that the judge had to refer, again, to these matters as part of an “overall review”.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.40in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Geekie also questioned whether the judge’s analysis was undermined because he approached the issue of whether travel should be permitted from a flawed perspective.  I acknowledge that the judge did say that it was “necessary for ways to be found to enable” the children to travel to Qatar and Dubai.  However, he said this because he did not consider it “in accordance with their welfare if they are never able to travel” there.  I also consider that Mr Geekie’s criticism of the use of the word “necessary” and of the judge’s reference to “the best possible safeguards” is descending into too detailed a forensic dissection of the judgment.  In stating his conclusion that the proposed consent orders were “a reasonable safeguarding process” the judge was clearly balancing the risk of retention with his conclusions in respect of the need for and the effectiveness of the consent orders in ameliorating that risk.  In my view, the judge’s decision that this was a “proportionate response to the risk posed on both sides” shows that, contrary to Mr Geekie’s submission, the judge was determining whether the proposed safeguards were required and were “sufficient” and concluded that, in respect of both Qatar and Dubai, they were. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.40in;margin-right:0.00in">The aspect of the appeal which has caused me the most concern is whether the judge was entitled to conclude that an order in Dubai was a sufficient safeguard.  It has caused me the most concern because, in my view, Mr Geekie is entitled to question whether the judge’s succinct summary, namely that “such orders should be enforceable and binding”, accurately reflected the effect of Mr Edge’s evidence.  However, having spent some time considering the detail of Mr Edge’s evidence, I have concluded that the judge was entitled to reach this conclusion.  There are, clearly, elements within Mr Edge’s evidence which would support a different conclusion.  But this is not the question.  The question is whether the judge’s conclusion was open to him of the evidence.  It was for him to consider all of Mr Edge’s evidence, which the judge clearly did, and determine its effect.  </p>

On balance, therefore, I am not persuaded that this conclusion was not open to the judge.   </p>
