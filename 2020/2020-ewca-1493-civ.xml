	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">On 18 September 2019 His Honour Judge Eyre QC, sitting as a judge of the High Court (“the Judge”), determined that Iran, rather than England, was the natural and appropriate forum for those of the appellant’s claims in these proceedings that passed the merits threshold and would otherwise have passed through a jurisdictional gateway. The Judge further decided that there was no real risk that the appellant would not obtain substantial justice in Iran. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Accordingly, by an order dated 26 September 2019, the Judge set aside the grant of permission to serve the (amended) claim form on the respondents out of the jurisdiction in Iran, dismissed the claim and set aside an order freezing the first respondent’s assets worldwide (“the WFO”). The appellant was ordered to pay the respondents’ costs of the claim (and to pay those in relation to the WFO on the indemnity basis) and to make an interim payment of £325,000 on account of those costs. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The appellant now appeals against the Judge’s decision and the order made. The central issue raised by the appeal is whether, in the light of travel advice issued by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (“the FCO”) on 17 May 2019<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="1">
		<p class="footnotedescription"> The appellant applied for permission to amend his Grounds of Appeal to rely also on travel advice issued by the FCO on 14 March 2020, some months after the judgment under appeal. The respondents opposed that application.   </p>
	      </authorialNote>, the Judge erred as a matter of fact in finding that there was no real risk that the appellant, a British/Iranian dual national, would not obtain substantial justice in Iran (the natural and appropriate forum), the alleged risk being that he would decide not to travel there to litigate for well-founded reasons (“the Jurisdiction Appeal”).  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The respondents resist the appeal, contending that the Judge’s finding was properly open to him on the evidence (and was, in any event, correct). The respondents further assert, by way of a respondents’ notice, that the Judge should in any event have made the same order based on his finding that the appellant had failed to disclose material facts when obtaining permission to serve out of the jurisdiction, including that the appellant has a wife of 12 years living in their marital home in Iran, where the appellant also lives when in that country.        </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The appellant also has permission to argue a free-standing ground of appeal against the Judge’s order that he pay £325,000 on account of the respondents’ costs of the proceedings (“the Costs Appeal”). He contends that the Judge thereby ordered payment of too high a percentage of the sum (£450,000) that the Judge had identified as the most that he could conceive the respondents would recover following a detailed assessment and which the Judge thought “might well be a generous figure”. The respondents’ answer is that such an order was within the generous ambit of the Judge’s discretion as to costs. </p>

In August 2006 Nokia purported to terminate the joint venture agreements (a termination which the second respondent did not accept) and the contract with MCCI was never transferred to a joint venture company. The second respondent therefore remained contractually bound to proceed with the MCCI Project, and was forced to manage it without the involvement of Nokia.

Thus, in paragraph 36 of his judgment, the Judge focused on the risk the appellant would be detained in Iran, not the risk that he would be unwilling to travel there to litigate in the first place: he failed to appreciate that the reason the appellant could not obtain justice in Iran was that he would not travel there, a stance which was fully justified in view of the unequivocal FCO advice that dual nationals should not travel there.  </p>

The appellant further submitted that the Judge was wrong to put weight on the subsequent  reference to avoiding “all but essential travel to Iran” because that was obviously in a “boilerplate” section which had mistakenly been carried over from earlier advice. The Judge was therefore wrong, the appellant contended, to put so much weight on his travel to Iran prior to the 17 May 2019 advice.  </p>

Nowhere in his affidavit or in his first witness statement does the appellant state that he would (or even might) not travel to Iran to litigate his claims. The appellant expressly states in paragraph 47 of his witness statement (without providing particulars) that his witnesses would not be willing to travel, but does not state that he would not be willing to do so. Indeed, the implication is to the opposite effect.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">It follows that the Judge did not expressly address the issue of whether the appellant would travel to Iran to litigate because the appellant did not present that as an issue for determination. His case was presented on the basis that he would face a risk of arbitrary detention if he went to Iran, and that was the point the Judge addressed. The finding (which was correct in my judgment) was that such a risk was not such as to deprive the appellant of substantial justice in Iran. There is no basis for interfering with that evaluation. </p>

Whether or not the appellant is technically resident in England, it is clear from the evidence that he has spent as much (and probably far more) time in Iran than England since his divorce from his British wife in 2001 and that, from 2007, he has had a wife and family home in Iran, as well as substantial investments and business interests. In particular, between 2016 and 2019 he plainly spent most of his time in Iran. In that context, and particularly given the caution the Judge rightly adopted as regards the appellant’s assertions, any claim that he would not travel to Iran (to litigate, or for any purpose) would have been roundly rejected.         </p>

His summary of its effect was accurate and it is plain that he was aware that the update was to advise dual nationals, for the first time, against all travel to Iran. It is true that he did not refer to the warning that commercial litigants might be prevented from leaving the country, but it is difficult to see how that gives rise to a risk of not obtaining substantial justice in Iran, particularly when the appellant has a wife and home there and had lived there for most of the preceding three years. Further, as Newey LJ pointed out in the course of argument, the power to prevent a litigant from leaving the country during proceedings appears to be available against Iranian citizens as well as foreign or dual nationals, as evidenced by the fact that the first respondent was so restrained in 2010.   </p>

The only real change is that the risk is now described as “significantly higher” than for others, rather than just “higher”. The appellant’s assertion in his most recent statement that he will not travel to Iran as it is unsafe to do so is self-serving, belated and unconvincing. I would therefore decline to admit this further evidence on the grounds that it would not have an important influence on the outcome of the case and, in respect of the appellant’s assertion, is not credible.      </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The appellant contended that, in taking the figure of £450,000 as an estimate of the costs the respondents were likely to recover, the Judge did indeed stray outside the bounds of reasonable disagreement. Mr Goodfellow, on the appellant’s behalf, argued that that was an “astonishing” sum, divorced from the reality of the sum the respondent might ultimately be awarded. He suggested that £200,000 would be a very good recovery.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgment the level of the respondents’ total costs, whilst perhaps on the high side, is not particularly surprising in the context of proceedings in the Business &amp; Property Courts which involved a worldwide freezing injunction and a two-day hearing on jurisdiction and discharge, with both leading and junior counsel instructed. That remains my view even though the sums at stake were relatively small in Business and Property Court terms: the appellant chose to apply for draconian relief, did so without making full and frank disclosure and raised a panoply of issues and arguments throughout the proceedings. The costs of defending such proceedings with vigour will necessarily have been very substantial, regardless of the sums claimed.      </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In that context, the Judge cannot be criticised for taking a starting point of  £450,000, particularly as the costs relating to the WFO were awarded on an indemnity basis. Further, his application of a 28% discount (in arriving at a figure of £325,000) appears entirely reasonable. Whilst I might have ordered payment of a slightly lower sum, the sum chosen by the Judge was well within the ambit of his discretion. </p>
