	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">This appeal arises from a mother’s application for contact to her three children, who are in interim local authority care.  The children are aged 7, 3 and 1½.  They were taken into care in September 2019 after the youngest child was found to have a leg fracture that is considered likely to have been inflicted.  The mother, with whom the children were living, is one of the adults who may have caused the injury.  The question of who was in fact responsible cannot now be decided until a hearing in November 2020.  In the meantime, the children have been living with their maternal grandmother under interim care orders. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.89in;margin-right:0.00in">Until the lockdown in March 2020, the children had contact meetings with their mother three times a week for two hours.  These meetings were supervised by a local authority employee rather than the grandmother herself, because she had expressed doubt about whether the mother was capable of causing the injury.  Thereafter, the local authority’s two contact centres closed.  The children then only had indirect contact by telephone and video call, arranged between the grandmother and the mother without supervision.  For the children, particularly the younger two, this was of course not a very satisfactory form of contact.  </p>

The court ordered the local authority to serve a position statement explaining the consideration it had given to the matter and setting out any plan that it had.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In these unprecedented times it is difficult to set out  precisely what level of contact is “reasonable”. Regard must be paid to Government guidance around issues such as social distancing and the use of PPE. Such guidance is not always consistent from one day to the next. A local authority is entitled to have regard to its own resources in terms of the number of staff available to it to facilitate face to face contact with staff numbers inevitably reduced because of individual decisions taken to self-isolate and the need to deploy social workers to areas of highest priority when issues of safeguarding arise. To create exceptions to the current situation where all contact between parents and children in the care of NCC is restricted to indirect contact produces an equality of unfairness in that there is nothing particularly exceptional about the position of the  mother here.  </p>

The impact of restrictions  imposed by reason of the Covid l9 pandemic has been severe.  Those ill or dying in hospital have been denied visits from  friends and family. Children have been denied education. Many  grandparents have not been able to hug their grandchildren.  Funerals have been restricted so that many mourners have been  unable to attend. The issue I have to determine is whether the  arrangements currently being made for the mother to have contact with her children are reasonable in the current  circumstances. If they are there is no basis upon which I should make an order under s.34(3) to compel the local authority to  make arrangements for face to face contact.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">For the mother, Ms Helen Knott acknowledged that with the resumption of direct contact the appeal had become academic as far as her client was concerned at this moment.  However, she invited us to hear the appeal as she argued that the judge’s approach was wrong and the issue of the local authority’s approach to contact may resurface if circumstances change.  The thrust of her argument was that the judge approached s.34 Children Act 1989 (‘CA 1989’) incorrectly and that he fettered himself by deferring to the local authority.  As a result, he did not make the individualised welfare decision that was required.  He did not give consideration to the mother’s proposals or address the inadequacy of the local authority’s response.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">On behalf of the local authority, Mr Stephen Abberley accepted that an individualised assessment of what contact was appropriate was required and he conceded that the social work statement did not deal with the matters that had been ordered.  He nevertheless sought to uphold the judge’s reasoning and conclusion.  Even though the judge did not make an explicit welfare assessment, he will inevitably have viewed the issue before him through the prism of the children’s welfare.  He was asked to consider whether the local authority’s position was reasonable and he was entitled to consider that the local authority was best placed to make a decision about contact.  The court could not be required to enquire into management decisions.  As to the statute, there is no real difference between the concepts of “reasonable” and “appropriate” contact.  The judge was right to say that in practice, the issue is whether the arrangements are reasonable and that, if they are, there is no basis for the court to intervene.  Even if the court’s conclusion was somewhat different to that of the local authority, it might apply the ‘no order’ principle and decline to make a contact order.  Mr Abberley accepted that his submission amounted to the court affording the local authority a margin of appreciation or, colloquially, giving it the benefit of the doubt. </p>

That outcome is possible because there is happily now agreement about contact.   We have nonetheless heard the appeal as the issue is of wider importance.  These are my reasons for concurring in our decision. </p>

For many children in care and for their families, the loss of contact will have been particularly difficult.  Where it is unavoidable, it is an occasion for sympathy, but where it can to some extent be remedied, that should be attempted where possible.  This is underscored by the prevailing guidance from the Department of Education, entitled <span style="font-style:italic">Coronavirus (Covid19): Guidance For Children’s Social Care Services</span>:   </p>

In these circumstances, we would encourage social workers and other professionals to reassure children that this position is temporary. We would also expect foster parents and other carers to be consulted on how best to meet the needs of the children in their care and to be supported to facilitate that contact, particularly if those carers are shielding or medically vulnerable. </p>

The fact that there will be mutual respect between the authority and the court cannot mask this distinction.  A parent applying for contact is entitled to expect that the court will form its own view of what contact is appropriate in all the circumstances, however influential the professional view of the local authority may turn out to be.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I therefore would not accept Mr Abberley’s argument in support of the judge’s analysis.  The question for the court was not whether the local authority’s position was reasonable, but what contact was appropriate, giving paramount consideration to the children’s best interests and taking account of all the circumstances, including the reality of the pressures on services at the present time. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In this case, as in others like it, there is no doubt that face to face contact would be in the children’s interests if it could be achieved.  In order to form a view about that, the court needed basic information about the children’s situation, the local authority’s resources and the current Government guidance.  Unfortunately, the decision in this case did not grapple with these matters except at a general level.  The judge was of course right to say that regard must be had to fluctuating Government guidance, including as to social distancing, but at the time he came to make his decision, social distancing was not an absolute obstacle to contact.  He was also obviously bound to acknowledge the finite resources of the authority and its need to prioritise, but he had been given no evidence about that either.  Clearly, the practical challenges might mean that less contact was appropriate than before – as the outcome of this case shows – but the evidence before the court did not support the conclusion that no face to face contact at all was possible.  Accordingly, if the judge did not feel able to approve the proposal made by the mother, he should have adjourned for a short time for the local authority to provide better evidence.  What he was not in my view right to do was to dismiss her application for the reasons he gave.  </p>
