In such a case, the normal right of an applicant for PTA to an appeal court other than the Court of Appeal to request the decision to be reconsidered at an oral hearing is disapplied by CPR rule </p>

The question which we have to consider is whether the Court of Appeal nevertheless has jurisdiction to entertain an <span style="font-style:italic">appeal</span> against the paragraph (3) order, subject to the applicant being able to satisfy the stringent test for the grant of PTA on a second appeal: see CPR rule 52.7(2).  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It is worth observing at the outset that, if this court did have jurisdiction to entertain such an appeal, the potential ambit of the appeal would inevitably be very circumscribed. There are two reasons for this. The first is that, by statute, no appeal may be made against a decision of the High Court to give or refuse PTA: see section 54(4) of the Access to Justice Act 1999. The second is that the Court of Appeal lacks jurisdiction to hear an appeal against the certification by a HCJ that an application is TWM. The jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal is conferred by statute alone, and under section 16(1) of the Senior Courts Act 1981 “the Court of Appeal shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine appeals <span style="font-style:italic">from any</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">judgment or order of the High Court</span>” (my emphasis). But the certification by a HCJ of an application as TWM (or, more accurately, the recording by the court, pursuant to CPR rule 23.12(a), of the fact that it considers an application to be TWM) is neither a judgment nor an order of the High Court, so it falls outside the scope of the jurisdiction conferred by section 16(1) of the 1981 Act: see <span style="text-decoration:underline">R (Wasif) v Home Secretary</span> [2016] EWCA Civ 82, [2016] 1 WLR 2793, at [25] to [26] of the judgment of the court delivered by Underhill LJ (sitting with Lord Dyson MR and Floyd LJ). </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In the light of those twin constraints, it is hard to see what practical purpose would be served by the existence of an independent right of appeal to this court against an order under CPR rule 52.4(3) which prevents an applicant for PTA, whose application has been refused and certified as TWM, from seeking an oral renewal hearing. The most that the applicant could hope to achieve on such an appeal, in the unlikely event that it crossed the threshold of permission for a second appeal, is that the judge’s refusal of PTA would be reconsidered at an oral hearing, even though the judge had certified the application as TWM, and the TWM certification could not itself be appealed.  </p>

This was necessary, because different provisions were made with effect from 3 October 2016 in relation to applications for PTA to the Court of Appeal. Those provisions are contained in rule 52.5, and as is well known they remove the automatic right to a renewal hearing after an application to the Court of Appeal for PTA has been determined on paper, although the judge who considers the application on paper may direct that the application be determined at an oral hearing, and must do so if of the opinion that the application cannot be fairly determined on paper without an oral hearing: see rule 52.5(1) and (2). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In courts below the Court of Appeal, the right to an oral renewal hearing under rule 52.4(2) is expressly made subject to paragraph (3), which applies where in the appeal court a HCJ, or other judge of designated seniority, refuses PTA without an oral hearing and considers the application is TWM. It is important at this point to note the provisions of CPR rule 52.20(5) and (6), which in such circumstances require the court’s order to “record the fact that it considers the application [<span style="font-style:italic">for PTA</span>]… to be totally without merit”, and direct that “the court must at the same time consider whether it is appropriate to make a civil restraint order.” It follows that where a HCJ, or other judge of specified seniority, refuses an application for PTA without an oral hearing and considers the application to be TWM, this must be certified in the court’s order, and the judge must also go on to consider the making of a civil restraint order. It is in that context that the judge is also authorised by paragraph (3) of rule 52.4 to “make an order that the person seeking permission may not request the decision to be reconsidered at an oral hearing.” If the judge does decide to make a further order in those terms, the effect of paragraph (5) is that the applicant for PTA may not request that further order to be reconsidered at an oral hearing, even though the order was made of the court’s own initiative. </p>

By the Civil Procedure (Amendment No 2) Rules 2012 (SI 2012/2208) the powers exercisable by the Court of Appeal in this respect were extended to judges sitting at other levels in the appellate  hierarchy and dealing with applications for permission to appeal.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It is clear from the language of paragraph (3) of rule 52.4 that an order removing the right to an oral renewal hearing is not an automatic consequence of the TWM certification. The judge has a discretion to exercise, and although there are probably few cases in which the judge will consider it helpful to have an oral hearing after certifying the application as TWM, the wording of the rule requires him to direct his mind to the question before making an order under the paragraph. In this respect, the rule differs from the rules relating to permission to apply for judicial review which were considered by this court in the <span style="text-decoration:underline">Wasif</span> case: see the judgment of Underhill LJ at [8]. </p>

The grounds of appeal, settled by Mr Holborn, contended that his order was in fact appealable, despite the judge’s statement that his decision was final and not subject to review or appeal. However, the grounds also said that the appeal “must be… against the refusal of permission to appeal”. Given the clear terms of section 54(4) of the 1999 Act, this was an ambitious contention, and it is unsurprising that the papers were returned unissued on 15 February 2020 under cover of a letter stating that the papers had been referred to a master of the Court of Appeal who drew attention to section 54(4) and ruled that the Court of Appeal lacked jurisdiction to hear the application for PTA. </p>

The amended grounds asked the court to reconsider whether it had jurisdiction to hear the appeal, on the footing that the appeal would be against the decision of Griffiths J under rule 52.4(3) to refuse to permit an oral renewal hearing. The papers were again referred to a master, who again ruled that the court lacked jurisdiction to entertain the appeal. The reason given, however, was that the court had no jurisdiction to entertain an appeal from a TWM certification made by the High Court when refusing an application for PTA. It is fair to say that this reasoning did not engage with the argument that the intended appeal was now against the judge’s refusal of an oral renewal hearing, and this was duly pointed out in a letter to the court from Mr Hornsby on 16 April. He emphasised that the proposed appeal was against the order made under paragraph (3), not the TWM declaration.

Moreover, even in relation to such unrelated matters, the court was at pains to observe that, although an appeal would in theory lie to this court, with permission, the grant of such permission was likely to be “very rare”. The court was also not concerned with cases certified as TWM. At that date, the rules provided a general right to an oral renewal hearing if PTA was refused on the papers, and this right was expressly preserved by the words in brackets at the end of section 54(4). It was only in 2006 that the rules were amended so as to give the Court of Appeal the power to order that an application for PTA should not be reconsidered as an oral hearing where it was TWM, and it was only in 2012 that the power to refuse an oral hearing in such cases was extended to orders refusing PTA made by HCJs or specialist circuit judges.  </p>

He further submitted that, if Parliament had intended an order made under rule 52.4(3) to be unappealable, it would have said so expressly, in the same way as paragraph (5) of the rule expressly provides that such an order may not be reconsidered at an oral hearing. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">More generally, Mr Holborn submitted that, even in TWM cases, the right to an oral hearing provides an important safety valve for the rare cases where the judge is wrong to certify an application for PTA as TWM. The certification cannot itself be appealed to the Court of Appeal for the reasons given in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Wasif</span>, but that makes it all the more important that the right to an oral renewal hearing should not be unfairly removed, and that an appeal should lie to this court against an order removing that right under paragraph (3). Any concerns that this might lead to a flood of unmeritorious applications for PTA against refusals of oral renewal hearings in TWM cases should be remedied, if appropriate, by further amendments to the rules, and not by adopting a strained construction of rule 52.4(3) in its present form. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">On behalf of LMA, Mr Sinnatt submits that this court lacks jurisdiction to hear the proposed appeal. The position is governed by section 54(4) of the 1999 Act, which expressly removes the right of appeal to this court which an appellant would otherwise have, under section 16(1) of the 1981 Act, against an order made by a HCJ refusing PTA to the High Court. The fallacy in the argument for Mr Gibbeson, says Mr Sinnatt, is that it seeks to separate the order refusing an oral renewal hearing from the refusal of PTA where the application is certified as TWM pursuant to rule 52.4(3). In such cases, the refusal of an oral hearing is an integral part of, and arises directly from, the substantive refusal of PTA. It is therefore caught by the prohibition in section 54(4) of the 1999 Act, and cannot generate a freestanding right of appeal to this court. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Sinnatt distinguishes <span style="text-decoration:underline">Clark v Perks</span> on the basis that the kind of further orders contemplated in that case, against which an appeal would at least in theory lie to this court, were orders made on separate applications for different relief which require consideration of factors other than the merits of the proposed appeal. By contrast, he submits, an order under rule 52.4(3) removing the right to an oral renewal hearing is ancillary to, and reinforces, the refusal of PTA in a case which the judge, ex hypothesi, has certified as TWM. The order is therefore properly to be regarded as part and parcel of the refusal of PTA itself, and is reserved for cases where the judge considers the lack of merit so obvious that the time and resources of the court should not be wasted by permitting an oral renewal hearing. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In cases of this extreme character, which in his brief oral submissions he suggested might be dubbed “TWM plus”, Mr Sinnatt says it is entirely right and appropriate that the only possibility of further recourse for the appellant should be an application to reopen his application for PTA under the truly exceptional jurisdiction conferred by CPR 52.30. Mr Gibbeson has already instructed his lawyers to make such an application, and it should now be left to proceed in the usual way. Soole J was wrong to consider that there was an alternative effective remedy, because any appeal to this court against the refusal of an oral renewal hearing is conclusively barred by section 54(4). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">As I indicated in the first part of this judgment, I would accept the submissions of Mr Sinnatt. It seems clear to me that Parliament could not have intended to confer a freestanding right of appeal to this court from an order refusing an oral renewal hearing under CPR 52.4(3), in circumstances where such an order can only be made if the judge refuses an application for PTA and certifies it as TWM. As I have explained, neither the refusal of PTA nor the TWM certification could ground an appeal to this court, so it would be paradoxical if the addition of an order refusing the right to an oral renewal hearing were to unlock the door to an onward appeal. Such a result would be wholly at odds with the obvious purpose of TWM certification, which is to prevent cases which are wholly unmeritorious from occupying further judicial time and scarce court resources.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It is true that rule 52.4(3) itself expressly envisages that the judge may permit an oral renewal hearing, in the exercise of his discretion, even where he considers the application for PTA to be TWM on the papers. The cases where a judge will consider it appropriate to permit a renewal hearing, having certified an application for PTA as TWM, will probably be few in number, but the need to give consideration to the possibility is a valuable discipline, and it is possible to envisage circumstances where such an order will be appropriate. One example could be where the judge feels some doubt about the TWM certification, or where he may wish there to be a fuller exploration of the history of former applications by the appellant which have been so certified. The possibility of an oral renewal hearing therefore provides a valuable safeguard for the appellant, in addition to his “long-stop” right to make an application under CPR rule 52.30 if PTA is refused. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">None of this, however, leads to the conclusion that, if the judge decides to exercise his discretion in favour of making an order under CPR 52.4(3), a right of appeal should lie against the refusal. On the contrary, the refusal of the right to a renewal hearing operates to reinforce the refusal of PTA and the TWM certification, and is in my view rightly regarded as an integral part of the refusal of PTA itself. If that is the correct analysis, Mr Holborn was constrained to accept, in his oral submissions, that any further appeal to this court (otherwise than pursuant to a successful application made under CPR 52.30) would be prohibited by section 54(4) of the 1999 Act.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I find further support for this conclusion in the elaborate care taken by the draftsman of what are now paragraphs (3) to (5) of CPR rule 52.4 to exclude any right to request an oral reconsideration of an order made under paragraph (3). In my judgment it would make no sense for such an order to be appealable where there is no prior right to request an oral reconsideration of it, and where the scope of any such appeal, were it possible to bring one, would be so severely circumscribed as to make it virtually meaningless: see my introductory observations at [3] and [4] above. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Against this background, I see no difficulty in adopting a purposive construction of paragraph (3) whereby an order refusing permission for an oral renewal hearing is to be treated as part of the order refusing PTA, and not as an independent order of the kind exemplified in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Clark v Perks</span>.  In my respectful opinion, Soole J’s provisional view to the contrary was mistaken, and the Civil Appeals Office was right to decline to accept Mr Gibbeson’s proposed appeal papers on the ground that jurisdiction to entertain the appeal is precluded by section 54(4) of the 1999 Act. </p>
