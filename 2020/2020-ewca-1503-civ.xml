The first, given on 29 March 2019, was a fact-finding judgment.  The second, given on 10 August 2020, contains further findings of fact and the welfare decision.  The appeal is directed towards the welfare decision.  The facts found by the Judge, which I shall briefly summarise, are not challenged. </p>

She and the father married in 2016.  They have no addictions or criminal convictions.  Both parents work and the mother’s job involves international travel.

The mother called the police, complaining that this had occurred during an assault on her by the father.  R was taken to hospital and kept under observation.  On discharge the next day, R returned to his mother’s care under an agreement with the local authority that she would live separately to the father.  R remained within the family until he was 18 months old. </p>

In July 2017, the police found the father hiding in the family home.  From October 2017, the local authority was repeatedly unable to make contact with the family and on 22 December 2017 it issued an application for a care order in respect of R.  Papers relating to the proceedings had been posted through the letterbox of the family home and on 21 December the mother and R left the jurisdiction. </p>

In the 2½ years that followed he conducted no fewer than 30 hearings.  The mother returned to the jurisdiction, apparently without R.  Orders were made that she should not leave the jurisdiction and that R should be returned.  Despite this, both parents left the jurisdiction.  At the time, unknown to the authorities, the mother was pregnant with J.  Further orders were made and publicity was given to the return order relating to R.   </p>

The boys were placed in the same foster home under interim care orders.  The parents participated in a parenting capacity assessment over the course of several months.  Their relationship with the children, seen at contact, was positive and R was noted to be a healthy child who had been well cared-for.  They had suitable accommodation.  Concerns remained about the initial incident in May 2017, about which the mother had changed her story, and about the events surrounding J’s birth.  Nonetheless, in January 2019, the local authority concluded that the two boys could be returned to their parents under a supervision order.  The Children’s Guardian did not agree.  She expressed scepticism about the genuineness of the parents’ co-operation and about the risks arising from domestic abuse and instability of care arrangements.  She was concerned at the parents’ stated intention to take the children to Ghana, where their welfare could not be monitored.  More information was needed before a return to the parents could be supported and a plan for adoption also needed to be considered.  </p>

He found that the mother had lied about her statements against the father, and about what she had said to a doctor, a police officer, her former solicitor and her counsel.  The father had also lied about a number of matters.  Directions were given for a welfare hearing to determine the children’s future. </p>

He accepted solemn assurances from the father and imposed strict conditions that he was to have no contact whatsoever with the mother.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Ms Fottrell describes the judge’s analysis of the mother’s parenting as reductive, in focusing unduly on her lies at the expense of her general parenting.  She had been responsible for R for 18 months and Q for 5 months without them coming to harm, aside from the injury to R, whose presentation when he was removed over a year later was thought to reflect good care.  The Judge did not adequately identify the harm that the children would be likely to suffer if returned to their parents.  His willingness to entertain a return of the boys to the father alone at the end of last year, despite his being a possible perpetrator of the injury to R and being complicit in the removal of R and the attempted concealment of J, was not carried through to the decision about returning the three children to the parents together.  At the same time the Judge’s statement that there might be “no choice” but adoption if the father did not keep his promises contributed to a factual matrix that was all about the parents’ lies.  This flawed approach to risk fed into an overall welfare balancing exercise that was superficial in respect of other welfare factors and in its consideration of the proportionality of adoption.

His analysis was not unduly focused on the parents’ lying, as seen from the attempt to implement a rehabilitation plan despite their known levels of dishonesty.  Special consideration was given to the cultural background through appointing a Ghanaian social worker to assess any cultural reasons for the parents not engaging with professionals; there were none.

The social workers and the court were fully justified in feeling anxious for the children’s welfare as the parents brought about a breakdown of trust by their repeated deceptions and concealments and, when they were exposed, by their brazen lying.  The impact of this behaviour on the process of assessment and decision-making across this lengthy litigation, involving huge expenditure of time and money, is easy to understand.

In my judgement the decision to make care and placement orders for these children cannot be sustained on the basis of Judge’s reasoning.  His findings of fact cannot be criticised and the threshold for making care orders was plainly crossed.  However, in a case in which the risk of harm was the central issue in the proceedings, there is substance in the argument that he did not sufficiently examine the reality of the risks to these children if placed with their parents.  Nor, in a case where the other welfare factors tended to point away from adoption, does the judgment explain why those risks were so bad that it outweighed them.  Instead, the parents’ reprehensible behaviour came to eclipse other welfare considerations.  In the end, the stark choice was between an unmonitored placement with the parents or a search for adopters.  Each option had difficulties, not least in the short term, but the judgment treated the risks presented by the parents as self-evidently unacceptable.  That conclusion needed further explanation.  The crux of the matter is found at paragraphs 112 and 113 where the analysis is, as has been submitted, circular.  The real question is whether the findings at paragraph 107 justified adoption. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Although it did not feature as a ground of appeal, I also consider that there was a gap in the evidence about the likely availability of a single adoptive placement for these three children.  That gap finds its reflection in paragraph 123, where the Judge contemplates a change of direction of some kind if a single placement could not be found.  The children have very particular needs as a sibling group, recognised by the Judge when he approved “<span style="font-style:italic">adoption, but all placed together</span>”.  They also have very particular identity needs.  In a case of this difficulty the court needed the best available evidence about whether an appropriate adoptive placement might be available for the children before reaching a final decision.  Otherwise the choice would be between long term foster care and placement with the parents, both being options that the Judge appeared to rule out.  </p>

The care and placement orders will be set aside and the interim care orders will revive.  I would only add that the parents’ undeserved success on this appeal should not lead them to assume that their children will not be adopted.  The decision remains a difficult one and it will be made on the basis of the court’s existing findings of fact together with its conclusions on any further evidence that may be put before it.  There will be an urgent case management hearing before a judge of the Family Division so that directions can be given for an early final hearing. <span style="font-weight:bold">Lady Justice Simler </span></p>
