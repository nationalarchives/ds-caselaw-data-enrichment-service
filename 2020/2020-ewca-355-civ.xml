	    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.00in">I am writing to clarify the Department of Health and Social Care’s interpretation of the legal time limit for termination of pregnancy performed under Grounds C or D of the Abortion Act 1967, which sets out that an abortion can legally be performed under these Grounds where ‘the pregnancy has not exceeded its twenty-fourth week’.  The Department’s legal advice is that the time limit for abortion performed under Grounds C or D equates to a pregnancy not exceeding 23 weeks and 6 days.  The taking of the second abortion drug or surgical evacuation forms part of the treatment for termination of pregnancy and therefore all elements of treatment must be completed by 23 weeks and 6 days.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.00in">This advice is based on the fact that, clinically, a pregnancy is dated from the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> day of the woman’s last menstrual period (LMP).  As you will be aware, this day is counted as day 0 of her pregnancy.   Therefore, when the woman reaches 23 weeks + 0 days she will have entered her 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> week of pregnancy, which will run from 23 weeks + 0 days to 23 weeks + 6 days (7 completed days of pregnancy in total).  Using this method of calculation, a woman will have exceeded her twenty-fourth week of pregnancy once she is 24 weeks + 0 days pregnant, or in other words, from midnight on the expiration of her 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> week of pregnancy.  On the expiration of her 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> week of pregnancy, she will have been pregnant for a total of 168 days; an abortion on the 169<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> day (24 weeks + 0) would, in the view of DHSC’s legal services, be unlawful.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In proceedings for judicial review the appellant sought to challenge the interpretation of the phrase “the pregnancy has not exceeded its twenty-fourth week” in section 1(1)(a) of the 1967 Act.  It is the appellant’s case that the phrase should be given what it says is its natural meaning, thus a pregnancy reaches its 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> week on week 24 + 0 days and does not exceed the 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> week until week 24 + 1 day.  Such a reading accords with the Secretary of State’s long-standing interpretation of section 1(1)(a).  The effect of the CMO’s July 2018 interpretation is to remove a day from the upper time limit for lawful abortions.  The implications, in the context of this penal statute, are said to be considerable both for women undergoing a termination of pregnancy and for the registered medical practitioners who are involved in the process.  </p>

Section 1(2) provides that “… evidence that a woman had at any material time been pregnant for a period of twenty-eight weeks or more shall be prima facie proof that she was at that time pregnant of a child capable of being born alive”.

This supersedes previous advice and guidance you reference (now considered to be incorrect), including direct correspondence with BPAS, that the limit was 24 weeks + 0 days.  When the Department became aware that a small number of doctors were performing abortions under grounds C at 24 weeks + 0 days it was important that this clarification was communicated to all doctors performing termination of pregnancy to ensure that they keep clinical practice within the law.

Parliament chose not to use this wording in section 1(1)(a), it introduced the time limit prefaced by the words “has not exceeded”.  Where two statutes dealing with the same subject matter use different language, it is an acknowledged rule of construction that one may be looked at as a guide to the construction of the other (<span style="font-style:italic">Dickenson v Fletcher</span> [1873] LR 9 CP1 at 8).  The wording of section 1(1)(a) suggests that Parliament intended to permit abortions on the day that the 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> week of pregnancy is completed but not thereafter.  The judge erred in his approach in that he conflated the completion of 24 weeks with exceeding that period of weeks.   </p>

If there is any doubt about the construction, such doubts should be resolved in favour of the woman or medical practitioner facing a potential sentence of life imprisonment for breach of section 58 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861.  The small number of women affected by this provision are those seeking late stage pregnancies, as such they are particularly vulnerable.  An extra day can make a real difference to those women and the treating doctors.  In construing the words of section 1(1)(a) the purpose of the statute is relevant.  In <span style="font-style:italic">Royal College of Nursing v DHSS</span> [1981] AC 800 Lord Diplock at 827D-E identified the first purpose of the statute as being to broaden the grounds upon which abortions may be lawfully obtained.   </p>

Pregnancy is dated by complete days.  To treat day 0 as a full day (when it is not) is neither the natural nor the ordinary meaning.  The first day of a woman’s LMP is often uncertain.  She is not pregnant on that day and it will not be until approximately two weeks later that she becomes pregnant.  The completion of a notional day 0 does not mean that one full day of pregnancy has been completed.  Thus, the logical approach is to treat a woman as having reached day 1 of her pregnancy on day 1, not day 0, and as having exceeded day 1 of her pregnancy on day 2.   </p>

To avoid this, the Secretary of State’s approach of 23 weeks + 6 days is the workable construct and gives value to day 0.  The calculation from the first day of the LMP reflects the approach of modern science and clinical practice, which is important because of foetal viability.   </p>

Plain English words are used.  The words are not ambiguous but their meaning is debatable and has been the subject of conflicting advice from the Department.  At the time of the passing of the 1967 Act and the 1990 amendment there was no body of expert evidence which pertained to assist the construction of the words in section 1(1)(a).  The debate has ensued, not least because there has been no authoritative legal opinion nor a judgment of a court upon the interpretation of the phrase in section 1(1)(a).  Once examined however, this meaning is clear.  </p>

That being so, there is no reason to go outside the statutory language in order to construe the same.  Prior to the implementation of the 1990 Act, the Select Committee’s report did not recommend wording for a clause that Parliament chose not to accept; the recommendations went to the substance of the clauses, precise wording would be a matter for the drafter.  The language of the 1929 Act is different but the meaning is the same in that “exceeds” is once a week has been completed.  The two forms of words (the 1929 Act and the 1990 amendment) have the same meaning; if anything, the 1990 amendment is more precise.   </p>

I accept the Secretary of State’s interpretation of Table 7.1 of the 2011 publication from the RCOG ([56] above).

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">A further point made by Professor Regan is that this approach to calculating the gestational age of pregnancy forms part of the approach taken by clinicians when calculating the time limits under Births and Deaths Registration Act 1953, which defines a stillborn child as “A child which is issued forth from its mother after the 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> week of pregnancy and which did not at any time breathe or show any other signs of life.”  She states that “‘After the twenty-fourth week’, i.e. the twenty-fifth week, starts at 24 weeks + 0 days.”  I accept the relevance and force of this point.  The definition of a stillborn child is also a matter of particular sensitivity.  If the 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> week of pregnancy was to include week 24 + 0 days then a number of pregnancy losses each year would fall to be reclassified as miscarriages rather than stillbirths.  This could mean that the women affected would no longer be able to register their loss as a stillbirth, potentially causing distress.  It could also affect their entitlement to statutory maternity leave and statutory maternity pay or maternity allowance, which in the case of pregnancy loss requires that the baby is stillborn after the 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> week of pregnancy.   </p>
