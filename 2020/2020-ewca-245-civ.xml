	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The appellant, Mr Frédéric Marino, was at the material times a director and Chief Executive Officer of the respondent, FM Capital Partners Ltd (“FMCP”). He appeals from the orders of Cockerill J following a trial in which she held that he and others are liable to FMCP for breach of fiduciary duty, dishonest assistance, and in respect of secret commissions and bribes. Claims by FMCP in conspiracy and knowing receipt failed. Mr Marino was ordered to pay FMCP US$ 17.35 million. One of his codefendants, Mr Yoshiki Ohmura, whose role is described at [10] below, was ordered to pay FMCP US$15.75 million. Mr Ohmura also appealed, but his appeal, on the only grounds for which permission was granted, was made conditional upon him complying with conditions which he failed to do, and his appeal was dismissed: see [35] below.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Mr Aurélien Bessot, at the material time also a director of FMCP and its Chief Investment Officer, was another of Mr Marino’s co-defendants, but before trial he entered into a global but confidential settlement with FMCP. Mr Bessot settled all FMCP’s claims against him by a payment of some US$2.8 million, and those claims were stayed by an order dated 23 February 2016. The single issue in this appeal is whether, and if so how much, credit should be given by FMCP to Mr Marino for the sums FMCP received from Mr Bessot, “the recoveries issue”. FMCP has given credit for some 17% of the recoveries from Mr Bessot. Mr Marino’s case is that it should have given credit to 100% or alternatively 80% of those recoveries. </p>

The first is a careful and detailed 602 paragraph “main judgment”, [2018] EWHC 1768 (Comm), handed down on 11 July 2018 after a nine day trial, hereafter “MJ”. The second is a 141 paragraph judgment on consequential matters including the recoveries issue, [2018] EWHC 2905 (Comm), hereafter “CJ”. It was handed down on 1 November 2018, following a hearing on 25 July and subsequent written submissions. The judge’s orders that are material were made on 30 July (corrected under the slip rule on 15 August and 3 September) and 12 December (corrected under the slip rule on 17 December) 2018. </p>

It was submitted that the judge erred in accepting the proposition that a claimant has a choice as to how recoveries are to be appropriated provided that choice is not obviously unsustainable, which she held they were not in this case.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">FMCP’s case is that, for both principled and practical reasons, the authorities relied on by Mr Marino, which pre-date the Civil Procedure Rules, do not apply to this case. First, the judgment entered was for restitution of the bribes and accounts of Mr Marino’s profits rather than for compensatory damages. Secondly, in this case, see [15] – [16] below, case management directions were made for the claims to be tried in two separate trials, the second of which has yet to take place.  Moreover, it is argued that the appeal is “moot” or “academic” because Mr Marino’s bankruptcy means that his remaining liability will not be satisfied. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">FMCP is a UK company originally envisaged in a report prepared by Mr Marino (then at JP Morgan) in February 2009. The report recommended a restructuring of the investment portfolios of the Libya Africa Investment Portfolio (“LAP”), a Libyan sovereign wealth fund, the total assets of which were approximately US$ 5 billion.<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller"> </span>FMCP was incorporated on 3 July 2009 as a joint venture between the LAP, Mr Marino and Mr Bessot. The judge found that the plan was for Mr Marino and Mr Bessot to arrange structured product trades for part of the LAP’s assets. By the beginning of 2014, FMCP was managing more than US$ 500 million of those assets. Before January 2014 when Mr Bessot left, LAP’s share in FMCP was 55% and Messrs Marino and Bessot’s shares were respectively 33% and 12%.  </p>

In turn, on 16 October 2009 Ironfly paid $625,000 to Conquest Cayman, the Cayman Islands company owned by Mr Ohmura. In that period FMCP entered into some 14 short term trades with banking counterparties. The banks which were counterparties to the trades in the structured products also paid introductory commissions totalling some $7.5 million to Conquest FP. In turn, out of the payments to it by Bank Baer/GAM and the counterparty banks, Conquest FP paid $4.8 million commission to Leopard Technology Ltd. (“Leopard”), a Seychelles company owned by Mr Marino and $3.39 million to Ironfly: MJ §§45-47. The judge found that the bribes paid by JB/GAM and later Conquest FP were received by or for the benefit of Mr Marino personally, despite having been routed (at his direction) through the Ironfly or Leopard bank accounts: CJ §60, referring to her findings in the main judgment. </p>

Andrew Baker J stated that the case management considerations meant that there was “a very clear and strong case for splitting the overall trial of the substantive claims”. One of those was that, unless it was discovered that Mr Marino had significant undisclosed assets, the sums involved meant that in this case a second trial was “the least likely outcome”. He was also satisfied that careful consideration had been given to the degree to which the practicalities of trying the issues allowed “for a clean enough split to make it workable”. The “Phase 2” trial has not occurred, and at the hearing before us the court was told that no procedural steps have been taken for it since the pleadings. </p>

The question arose at the end of a trial in relation to which one defendant had made a payment before trial. The judge had heard 67 days of evidence and delivered two judgments. He was therefore admirably placed to conduct a fairly detailed apportionment exercise. </p>

Here what I face is an information imbalance, in that I know a good deal about the Phase 1 issues but next to nothing about the Phase 2 issues. It seems to me that there are two possibilities open to me: to accept the Claimant’s apportionment of the monies it has already received (subject to any necessary oversight) or to make a broad brush assessment of my own.” </p>

Mr West submitted that it was not open to FMCP to advance this point. It had not been made before the judge and there is no Respondent’s Notice. As to substance, he argued that where a bribe is paid jointly to two people they are both liable to return it and where there has been a disgorgement by a defendant who has settled the claimant must take account of that in its claim against a defendant who has not settled. He also maintained that FMCP’s submission is inconsistent with the fact that its allocations for its recoveries gave credit to Mr Marino’s Phase 1 liability for recoveries it had made from third parties where the remedy was restitution rather than compensation. Mr West submitted that Mr Humphrey’s evidence (see [28] above) showed this to be the case for the recoveries from Mr Haggiagi in respect of the bribes Mr Marino paid him and the recoveries from Ms Sjøvaag in respect of FMCP’s claims for the part of the GAIN I commission he had transferred to her. The judgments entered on 30 July ordering restitution of the bribes and on 12 December 2018 ordering restitution and an account of profits were for sums that took into account “relevant recoveries”, that is sums that reflected the allocations made by FMCP.   </p>

It would, he maintained, be remarkable to require a claimant who settles with one defendant in order to avoid the cost of a trial to be required to prove the merits of its case as part of the trial of its claim against another defendant before it can allocate any of the sum paid under the settlement to its free-standing claims against the defendant who settled rather than to concurrent claims against that defendant and the defendant who has not settled. Moreover, the appellant’s position would produce an almost inconsistent dissonance between the position where a settlement apportions recoveries between the different claims and where, as in this case, it does not. This is because it is accepted (see Oliver LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Townsend’s </span>case at 41) such an apportionment is conclusive unless it is collusive or not made <span style="font-style:italic">bona fide</span>,<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>and that beyond that there is no need to investigate the merits of the settled claims.

In the words of Purchas LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Townsend v Stone Toms &amp; Partners </span>(1984) 27 BLR 26 at 52, it “must depend very much upon the context and the conduct of each individual case.

There was no suggestion by or on Mr Marino’s behalf at the Phase 1 trial that Mr Bessot paid FMCP more under the settlement than the proceeds of the bribes which Mr Bessot had received through Ironfly.

But the claimant’s recoupment in that case was not from another defendant and Saville LJ’s statement was made in the context of a different type of obligation to make restitution to that which arises in this case in respect of the bribes. Absent any defence based on “recoupment” by “passing on” the risk by entering into a hedging contract, the council’s enrichment in the <span style="font-style:italic">Kleinwort Benson </span>case was “at the expense” of the bank in the sense that it was “by subtraction” from the bank which had made the payments to the council.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The categorisation of a case as one where the cause of action is unjust enrichment or one where the cause of action is a civil wrong, whether a tort or an equitable wrong, may have practical consequences. For example, where the cause of action is unjust enrichment, there is a ceiling to the enrichment because as a general rule only direct transfers of value from the claimant’s assets or labour to the defendant qualify. Where the cause of action is a civil wrong, there is no such limit. For example, in cases of bribery, the defendant’s wrongful gains will often (but not always, see [50] - [51] below) have been conferred by one or several third parties and not by the claimant. Here the gains were conferred in the payments by Bank Baer/GAM and the counterparty banks. Secondly, in autonomous unjust enrichment the defence of change of position will be available, but, as noted above, it will not be where the civil wrong is the cause of action and restitution the remedy to strip away the wrongful gain. Where a defendant has committed a civil wrong from which he or she has made a gain, in this case by receiving a bribe, a restitutionary remedy, whether repayment of a bribe or an account of profits, would ordinarily lie against that defendant only in respect of sums he or she received. So, in this case it would lie against Mr Bessot only in respect of sums he received and not in respect of sums Mr Marino received, and vice versa.  </p>

That accords with the view of Goff and Jones. The editors state at §4-54 that where a benefit is received by more than one defendant, for example where a payment is made into a joint bank account, “the law generally holds that all the defendants are jointly and severally enriched, with a result that a claim for the whole amount of the enrichment may lie against any or all of them”. In their chapter on contribution and recoupment (at §2769) they state that in cases where the defendants are jointly and severally enriched, “the principle against double recovery prevents the claimant from recovering against every defendant in full”.  </p>

Goff and Jones, moreover, deal only with unjust enrichment “by subtraction” from the claimant and not with restitution for wrongs. On its facts, <span style="font-style:italic">Daraydan Holdings Ltd </span>was also a case of unjust enrichment by subtraction because the judge found that the price of the services the Solland defendants and their companies charged the claimant was actually increased by the amount of the bribe to the intermediary, Mr Khalid: see [87] and [89] – [90]. Lawrence Collins J stated at [87] that the bribe derived directly from the claimant: it “was paid out of the money paid by the claimants for what they thought was the price”.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The approach of Burrows, who does consider the position in the case of restitution for wrongs, is illuminating. He states (at 630) that in the case of a wrong by several defendants, who gain by different amounts “in terms of principle, several liability ought to be applied” so that each defendant is liable to pay restitution for the amount that that particular defendant has gained by the wrong. Accordingly, in his example of a case in which three defendants assault the claimant in a single attack or defame him or her in a single publication, where the first was paid £10,000, the second £2,000, and the third was not paid, he states that the first two ought to be liable for respectively £10,000 and £2,000, and the third ought not to be liable in restitution at all. He does not expressly deal with the position where the first defendant settles the claim against him by repaying the £10,000 but it follows from his analysis that the second defendant is not entitled to any credit as a result of that payment.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">This approach accords with principle. Mr West’s submission that where a bribe is paid to two people a claimant must take account of a payment by a defendant who settles its claim against a defendant who does not, would mean that the non-settling defendant’s enrichment would either not be stripped away at all or would only be stripped away in part. Taking an example of bribes totalling £1,000 paid to D<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">1 </span>and D<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">2</span>, each receiving £500, where D<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">2 </span>settles and pays the claimant £500, if the claimant has to give credit for that in its claim against D<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">1</span> none of D<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">1</span>’s actual enrichment is stripped away. The position is similar where D<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">2</span> settles and pays the claimant £750. If the claimant has to give credit for £750 in its claim against D<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">1</span>, again none of D<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">1</span>’s actual enrichment is stripped away. If the claimant has to give credit for the £250 which exceeds D<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">2</span>’s actual enrichment, only £250 of D<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">1</span>’s enrichment will be stripped away.  </p>

Since the liability of the defendant who has not settled is for his wrongful gain to be stripped away, it would be contrary to principle to credit him with the surplus paid by the settling defendant even where the settling defendant paid more than the amount he actually received.

That conclusion suffices to distinguish the authorities relied on to support Mr Marino’s appeal, but since much of the argument revolved around them, I will deal with the submissions based on them.  </p>

Additionally, despite what Purchas LJ said about investigating the claims which gave rise to the settlement and the recoveries, he left open (see 53) the possibility that pro-rating might be acceptable in the absence of any proof of gross inflation of the claims. In <span style="font-style:italic">Oak Tree Leisure </span>the claim against the first defendant settled shortly before the trial and after the claimant had prepared its evidence against the settling party.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Accordingly, the question is what, less than a full trial, will suffice. In considering this, it is important, as Mr Pillow submitted, to remember the inconsistency between the position for which Mr Marino argues and the position where an apportionment is made in the settlement agreement. As Oliver LJ stated in <span style="font-style:italic">Townsend’s </span>case, where the settlement agreement contains an apportionment, absent grounds for asserting that the settlement was “collusive or not made <span style="font-style:italic">bona fide</span>”, the settlement terms would conclusively determine the question. Andrew Smith J’s formulation in the <span style="font-style:italic">Fiona Trust </span>case at [1547], after referring to <span style="font-style:italic">Townsend, Banque Keyser Ullman, </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">Barings, </span>suggests that this is also the case even where the apportionment is not made in the settlement agreement. A qualification that there should not be grounds for asserting that the settlement was “collusive or not made <span style="font-style:italic">bona fide</span>” is consistent with the “not obviously unsustainable” threshold identified by Evans-Lombe J and applied by Eder J. Nugee J in <span style="font-style:italic">Glenn v Watson</span>, who did not refer to this aspect of Andrew Smith J’s judgment in the <span style="font-style:italic">Fiona Trust </span>case,<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>was inclined (see [63] above) to favour a threshold of a sustainable claim which would have been “likely to succeed at a trial”<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>which is higher than the not “obviously unsustainable” threshold.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">It is also important to remember the policy considerations favouring the encouragement of compromise even where the claim is unfounded and worthless: see <span style="font-style:italic">Callisher v Bischoffsheim </span>(1870) 5 QB 449, 452. Those policy considerations would be undermined if a claimant who makes a settlement with one of the defendants, in part to save the cost of proving the case against that defendant, has to give credit to the other defendant for the sum paid under the settlement, unless he or she is able to prove the nature of the case against the defendant who settled. I accept Mr Pillow’s submission that that would be a significant disincentive to settlement, and also that it would also be inconsistent with the way settlements are dealt with in relation to contributions between co-defendants by section 1(4) of the Civil Liability (Contribution) Act 1978. </p>

I accept Mr Pillow’s submission that the ethos of active and strong case management introduced by the Civil Procedure Rules in 1999 would be undermined, were a court-sanctioned phased approach such as that directed by Andrew Baker J in this case to be evaded by requiring the claimant to address and deal with the nature and merits of the Phase 2 claims as part of the Phase 1 proceedings. The effect of that order was to exclude the Phase 2 issues, and thus the evidence concerning them, from the Phase 1 trial. Unlike the position in <span style="font-style:italic">Oak Tree Leisure, </span>the evidence in relation to those issues has not been disclosed let alone prepared for trial.
