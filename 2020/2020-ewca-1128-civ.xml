Irish Bank Resolution Corporation Limited (“IBRC”) was formerly Anglo Irish Bank Corporation plc. It opened an office in the UK in 1988 and in 1991 was granted branch status by the Bank of England which enabled it to undertake regulated financial services including the taking of deposits.  Irish Nationwide Building Society (“INBS”) opened a retail branch in the UK (in Belfast) in 1994 and provided loans for the purchase of domestic property.  Most of its business became the provision of sterling-based finance to the developers of residential property operating in the UK market.  The finance was raised from a </p>

INBS is now a shell company and IBRC is in liquidation.  But in the years with which this appeal is concerned they operated profitable businesses through their UK branches which rendered them liable to UK corporation tax. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">This appeal is primarily concerned with s.11AA(3)(b).  In reliance on these provisions, HMRC have disallowed as part of the Appellants’ calculation of profits the deduction of some of the interest which is shown in the accounts of the UK branches as an expense of the borrowings made by the branches in order to finance their lending business.  HMRC have done so using what is described as a Capital Attribution Tax Adjustment (“CATA”) which includes attributing to the PE notional additional free capital in cases where it is said that a PE operating as a distinct and separate enterprise in the manner contemplated by s.11AA(2) would have had a higher amount of free capital and therefore a correspondingly lower amount of borrowed capital.  The result of applying the CATA to the accounts of the two branches in this case has been to disallow interest which was actually paid to third parties in the market as part of their cost of borrowing.  But s.11AA(3)(b) can obviously be engaged in a wide variety of cases involving many different types of companies including those where a PE may have very little free capital or even third party borrowings and may depend for its capital on internal financing arrangements within the company which have little or no correspondence to the arm’s length market conditions contemplated by s.11AA(2).   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The ability of the UK to tax the profits of a non-resident company brings with it the obvious possibility of double taxation.  The provisions of s.11 TA 1988 are by no means unique to the UK and can be found replicated in one form or another in the tax regimes of a significant number of other countries.  To alleviate this problem, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“the OECD”) has since 1963 published a series of model double taxation conventions with accompanying commentaries in order to provide a suggested basis for the allocation of profits to a PE.  In 1976 the UK and Ireland entered into such a convention (“the 1976 Convention”) which came into force domestically with the making of the Double Taxation Relief (Taxes on Income) (Republic of Ireland) Order 1976.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The essence of the taxpayers’ argument is that the reference in Article 8(2) to the PE being treated as a distinct and separate enterprise “engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions” requires an assumption to be made not only that the PE is engaged in the same or similar type of business to the one it actually carried on but also that it should be taken to have traded with the same ratio of free to borrowed capital as it actually employed during the relevant accounting period.  On this basis, it is said the UK is precluded by s.788(3) from relying on s.11AA(3)(b) in so far as that would lead to an adjustment in the amount of free capital it was taken to have employed in that period and a consequent disallowance of some of the interest charges on borrowed capital which it actually incurred.  Mr Baker QC, for the Appellants, did, of course, recognise that if this construction of Article 8(2) is right, it must follow that the same outcome would apply to a PE which employed no free capital at all in the relevant accounting period.  </p>

Article 8(3) is concerned with an allowance being made against the profits of the PE in respect of general administrative and other expenses incurred by the company itself in relation to the PE.  In relation to administrative expenses, this seems to be a different exercise from the calculation of the profits attributable to the PE from its own activities and it is not clear how, if at all, it could be impacted by the operation of the CATA.  The deduction of expenses incurred by the company might, however, be affected if they took the form of expenses on borrowings incurred by the bank on monies that were then used to capitalise the PE.  It is however clear, and I think accepted by Mr Baker, that Article 8(3) cannot be construed so as to create an obstacle to the implementation of the CATA if, on the proper construction of Article 8(2), capital attribution is permissible.  The two must be read consistently with each other.  For this reason, Article 8(3) has not really featured in the argument either here or before the Upper Tribunal and the First-tier Tribunal.   </p>

These, he says, were intended to give effect to an OECD review project that commenced in the late 1990s and included a recognition that in a significant number of Member States the calculation of the profits attributable to the PE of a non-resident company was considered to be best achieved by a process of notionally capitalising the PE at the level at which it could reasonably be expected to have operated had it conducted its business as an independent enterprise of the kind contemplated by Article 8(2).  The Appellants’ case is that the implementation of this approach required a substantive change to the terms of what was then Article 7 of the model convention and that this was achieved by the 2010 re-draft.  Mr Milne QC, for HMRC, relies, however, on the amended OECD commentary on the model convention published in 2008 which he says confirms that the approach based on an attribution of capital had long been used by Member States to implement the provisions of Article 7 and was recognised by the OECD as permissible under the terms of Article 7 of the model convention in its unamended form.  </p>

It is also stated in that work (p 366) that references to the primary necessity of giving effect to 'the plain terms' of a treaty or construing words according to their 'general and ordinary meaning' or their 'natural signification' are to be a starting point or prima facie guide and 'cannot be allowed to obstruct the essential quest in the application of treaties, namely the search for the real intention of the contracting parties in using the language employed by them'. </p>

The Inland Revenue adopted what became known as the PW Formula named after the accountants Price Waterhouse who had agreed it with the Inland Revenue in the 1950s.

One of the questions which they considered was what basis should be used for calculating the profits of a branch on the hypothesis contained in Article III(2) of the UK/USA Double Tax Convention (which used very similar wording to Article 8(2) of the 1976 Convention).  They expressed the view that Article III(2): </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.01in">“gives no authority to write into the branch accounts a level of capital which the branch does not have. To do this is to go against the scheme of Article III and the requirements of the paragraph (2) hypothesis that the United Kingdom branch is trading under ‘…the same or similar conditions…’. This directs that the actual conditions under which the United Kingdom branch trades are taken into account. It is those conditions which dictate the expenses in question. </p>

Mr Baker submitted that Article 31 of the Vienna Convention should not be treated as an exhaustive and immutable code and I think that may be correct.  As with any other set of legal principles, the norms of international law are capable of development and change.  But what the UT said in [30] of its decision (which is derived from Article 31(3)(b) of the Vienna Convention) is an established norm of international law.  By contrast with that, the Appellants have been unable to identify any established principle of international law which recognises the unilateral practice of a contracting state as an aid to the construction of a treaty.  In that respect, there is no divergence between international law and the English private law system which has never received evidence of what a party to a contract believed that the language of the agreement meant except in relation to a claim for rectification.  The legal meaning of the words used is an abstract question of law to be determined on an objective basis.   </p>

In summary, therefore, the language of Article 7 of the model convention remained essentially unchanged between 1963 and 2010 and, as the evidence about the PW Formula illustrates, was in use in double taxation treaties as far back as the 1950s.  This is consistent with the findings of the FtT (see [61] of its decision) that the UK practice since at least the 1950s was that it was necessary to determine the amount of free capital properly to be ascribed to a PE in order to assess the profits attributable to it for corporation tax purposes.  The use for a time of the PW Formula forms part of this history.  </p>

The paragraph incorporates the view, which is generally contained in bilateral Conventions that have been concluded since the war, that the profits to be attributed to a permanent establishment are those which that permanent establishment would have made if, instead of dealing with its head office, it had been dealing with an entirely separate enterprise under conditions and at prices prevailing in the ordinary market. Normally, this would be the same profit that one would expect to be reached by the ordinary processes of good business accountancy. In the great majority of cases, therefore, trading accounts of the permanent establishment – which are commonly available if only because a well-run business organisation is normally concerned to know what is the profitability of its various branches – will be used by the taxation authorities concerned to ascertain the profit properly attributable to that establishment. Exceptionally, there may be no separate accounts…But where there are such accounts they will naturally form the starting point for any processes of adjustment in case adjustment is required to produce the amount of properly attributable profits. It should perhaps be emphasized that the directive contained in paragraph 2 is no justification for tax administrations to construct hypothetical profit figures in vacuo; it is always necessary to start with the real facts of the situation as they appear from the business records of the permanent establishment and to adjust as may be shown to be necessary the profit figures which those facts produce. </p>

It is valuable to include paragraph 3, if only for the sake of removing doubts. The paragraph specifically recognizes that in calculating the profits of a permanent establishment allowance is to be made for expenses, wherever incurred, that were incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment. Clearly in some cases it will be necessary to estimate or to calculate by conventional means the amount of expenses to be taken into account. In the case, for example, of general administrative expenses incurred at the head office of the enterprise it may be appropriate to take into account a proportionate part based on the ratio that the permanent establishment’s turnover (or perhaps gross profits) bears to that of the enterprise as a whole. Subject to this, it is considered that the amount of expenses to be taken into account as incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment should be the actual amount so incurred. </p>

The next five paragraphs discuss three specific cases of this kind and give solutions for them.

In such a case, it is considered that the payments should not be allowed as deductions in computing the permanent establishment’s taxable profits. (Equally, such payments made to a permanent establishment by the head office should be excluded from the computation of the permanent establishment’s taxable profits.) It is, however, recognised that special considerations apply to payments of interest made by different parts of a financial enterprise (e.g. a bank) to each other on advances, etc (as distinct from capital allotted to them), in view of the fact that making and receiving advances is narrowly related to the ordinary business of such enterprises. Furthermore, if an enterprise makes payments of interest, etc, to a third party and these payments in part relate to the activities of the permanent establishment, then a proportionate part of them should naturally be taken into account in calculating the permanent establishment’s profits insofar as they can properly be regarded as expenses incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment.” </p>

The authorised OECD approach does not dictate the specifics or mechanics of domestic law, but only sets a limit on the amount of attributable profit that may be taxed in the host country of the PE. Accordingly, the profits to be attributed to a PE are the profits that the PE would have earned at arm's length if it were a legally distinct and separate enterprise performing the same or similar functions under the same or similar conditions and dealing wholly independently with the enterprise of which it is a PE, determined by applying the Guidelines by analogy. This is in line with one of the fundamental rationales behind the PE concept, which is to allow, within certain limits, the taxation of non-resident enterprises in respect of their activities (having regards to assets used and risks assumed) in the source jurisdiction. In addition, the authorised OECD approach is not designed to prevent the application of any domestic legislation aimed at preventing abuse of tax losses or tax credits by shifting the location of assets or risks. Finally, where their domestic law does not recognise loss transactions in certain circumstances between associated enterprises, countries may consider that the authorised OECD approach would not require the recognition of a loss on an analogous dealing in determining the profits of a PE. </p>

The starting point for the attribution of capital is that under the arm's length principle a PE should have sufficient capital to support the functions it undertakes, the assets it economically owns and the risks it assumes. In the financial sector regulations stipulate minimum levels of regulatory capital to provide a cushion in the event that some of the risks inherent in the business crystallise into financial loss. Capital provides a similar cushion against crystallisation of risk in non-financial sectors. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.00in;text-indent:0.5in">A key distinction between a separate legal enterprise and a PE is that one legal enterprise can enter into a legally binding agreement to guarantee all the risks assumed as a result of the functions performed by another legal enterprise. For such a guarantee to have substance, the "free" capital needed to support the risks assumed would reside in a different legal enterprise from that in which the transactions giving rise to the risks are booked. In contrast one of the key factual conditions of an enterprise trading through a PE is that the "free" capital and risks are not segregated from each other within a single legal enterprise. To attempt to do so for tax purposes (i.e. to treat one part of an enterprise as able to guarantee a risk assumed by another part of the enterprise) would contradict the factual situation and would not be consistent with the authorised OECD approach. Capital needed to support risks must be regarded as following the risks. In other words, capital needed to support risks is to be attributed to a PE by reference to the risks attributed to it and not the other way round. </p>

The purpose of the attribution is to inform the attribution of profits to the PE under Article 7(2). The Report describes a number of different possible approaches for applying that principle in practice, recognising that the attribution of "free" capital to a PE is not an exact science, and that any particular facts and circumstances are likely to give rise to a range of arm's length results for the "free" capital attributable to a PE, not a single figure. There is a common premise to the authorised approaches to attributing "free" capital, that an internal condition of the PE is that the creditworthiness of the PE is generally the same as the enterprise of which it is a part. </p>

The Committee considers that the guidance included in the Report represents a better approach to attributing profits to permanent establishments than has previously been available. It does recognise, however, that there are differences between some of the conclusions of the Report and the interpretation of the Article previously given in this Commentary. For that reason, this Commentary has been amended to incorporate a number of conclusions of the Report that did not conflict with the previous version of this Commentary, which prescribed specific approaches in some areas and left considerable leeway in others.

Such debts may relate in whole or in part to the activities of the permanent establishment; indeed, loans contracted by an enterprise will serve either the head office, the permanent establishment or both. The question that arises in relation to these debts is how to determine the part of the interest that should be deducted in computing the profits attributable to the permanent establishment. </p>

Also, it is well known that the indirect apportionment of total interest payment charges, or of the part of interest that remains after certain direct allocations, comes up against practical difficulties. It is also well known that direct apportionment of total interest expense may not accurately reflect the cost of financing the permanent establishment because the taxpayer may be able to control where loans are booked and adjustments may need to be made to reflect economic reality, in particular the fact that an independent enterprise would normally be expected to have a certain level of “free” capital. </p>

This appropriate capital structure will take account of the fact that in order to carry out its activities, the permanent establishment requires a certain amount of funding made up of “free” capital and interest bearing debt. The objective is therefore to attribute an arm’s length amount of interest to the permanent establishment after attributing an appropriate amount of “free” capital in order to support the functions, assets and risks of the permanent establishment. Under the arm’s length principle a permanent establishment should have sufficient capital to support the functions it undertakes, the assets it economically owns and the risks it assumes. In the financial sector regulations stipulate minimum levels of regulatory capital to provide a cushion in the event that some of the risks inherent in the business crystallise into financial loss. Capital provides a similar cushion against crystallisation of risk in non-financial sectors. </p>

As explained in [3] and [7], the format of Articles 7 and 9 of the model convention has never been prescriptive as to how profits should be attributed to a PE in accordance with the model described in Article 7(2) and the way in which the application of those criteria has been implemented has varied from state to state.  But to succeed on this appeal Mr Baker’s clients must establish that any attribution of capital which results in the disallowance of interest paid by the PE on the money it has borrowed is simply impermissible under Article 8(2) of the 1976 Convention.  This is, of course, ultimately a question of construction but HMRC place considerable reliance on the 2008 Commentary as confirmation that Article 7(2) has always permitted a considerable degree of flexibility in the methods for attributing profits to a PE and that these can include various forms of capital attribution.  On that basis, the 2008 Commentary, although new, would be admissible as an aid to the construction of Article 8(2) of the 1976 Convention which, as I have explained, adopted the wording of Article 7(2).  It would only be inadmissible if the new material made substantive changes which are inconsistent with the commentaries in existence at the time of the 1976 Convention.   </p>

The addition of the words “in particular in its dealings with other parts of the enterprise” emphasise that its status as an independent enterprise should be applied to any funding or supply arrangements with the overseas company and it is common ground that the concluding words of Article 7(2) use the language of transfer pricing which has been a concern of the OECD from the 1980s.  None of that wording does more than to emphasise that the comparator created by Article 7(2) has to be considered both in relation to the external transactions and in relation to the PE’s operation as part of the overseas company.

The evidence which the FtT accepted was that some form of capital attribution had been UK revenue practice since the 1950s as the adoption of the PW Formula illustrates.  The problem faced by the OECD was that the methods of doing this varied across different countries and in some cases involved the adoption of a formulaic approach which did not adequately recognise the scope and nature of the business actually carried on by the branch and the costs which that generated.  The purpose of the review which culminated in the 2008 report and the new commentary was to identify preferred methods of calculating the attribution of capital and expenses to the PE which, if adopted generally, would reduce the risk of different tax treatments being adopted in each contracting state with double taxation or no taxation as the consequences.  </p>

That is not, I think, disputed by Mr Baker.  He accepted that in cases where there are no accounts or the accounts are defective in some way it would be legitimate for HMRC to make a capital attribution which differed from that recorded in the branch accounts. But in my view the powers conferred by the 1976 Convention are not limited to these circumstances.  In order to operate the hypothesis of a distinct and separate enterprise dealing at arm’s length including with the overseas company of which it is part, it seems to me that it is necessary to compare the way in which the PE financed and accounted for its business with what it would have done had the PE operated as a separate enterprise.  Otherwise the comparator provisions of Article 8(2) cannot work.  To construe the phrase “same or similar conditions” as requiring the PE’s actual ratio of free to borrowed capital to be applied would be self-defeating.  It would rob Article 8(2) of any real ability to depart from the accounting treatment of the PE which the overseas company might choose to adopt and it would make the application of a uniform test of attribution impossible.  </p>

There is nothing in the language of Article 7 to suggest that the government is allowed to impose capital requirements on a branch that are the same as those imposed on separately-incorporated banks in order to give meaning to the phrase "separate and distinct." The phrase "separate and distinct" does not mean the branch should be treated as if it were "separately-incorporated," but instead "separate and distinct," means separate and distinct from the rest of the bank of which it is a part. Thus, Article 7 of the Treaty simply allows the taxing authorities to adjust the books and records of the branch to ensure that transactions between the branch and other portions of the foreign bank are properly identified and characterized for tax purposes. For example, if equity capital infusions are in fact made to the branch and are not properly identified as equity infusions, the taxing authority cannot allow interest payments on those amounts. Similarly, Article 7 allows the books and records of the branch to be adjusted to ensure that interest payments between the branch and other parts of the entity reflect an armslength [sic] relationship. There is nothing in the plain words of the Treaty that allows the government to adjust the books and records of the branch to reflect "hypothetical" infusions of capital based upon banking and market requirements that do not apply to the branch. In short, the government's reading of Article 7 goes too far. Moreover, as discussed below, the government's reading does not reflect the shared expectations of the parties, as evidenced by the legislative history surrounding the Treaty.” </p>

The Court of Appeals upheld all of the first instance decisions.

Conversely, the Government's reliance on "dealing wholly independently with" is at odds with a proper reading of the "same or similar" clauses. To conclude that ''wholly independently" requires that the U.S. Branch be taxed as if it were subject to regulatory and market capital requirements is to ignore the fact that the U.S. Branch does not operate under conditions in which it is subject to these requirements. In essence, the Government would read the "same or similar conditions" language out of the 1975 Trea<span style="color:#0D0D0D">ty. </span></p>

Therefore, because the corporate yardstick would essentially recharacterize loans that bear an interest expense as equity capital infusions based on regulatory and domestic market requirements that do not apply to the U.S. Branch, the corporate yardstick ignores the real facts of the U.S. Branch's situation and violates the 1975 Treaty as informed by the 1963 Draft Convention.

The Court did not therefore have to consider a more nuanced approach to this question such as that embodied in s.11AA(3)(b) and its denial of the IRS notion for reconsideration means that we do not know what its reaction would have been to some other form of CATA.  There is nothing in the decision to the effect that any form of capital attribution is precluded by the phrase “same or similar conditions” which is the argument we have to consider.  Nor, of course, did the Court have the benefit of the later OECD publications which have illuminated much of the thinking behind the provisions of Article 7 of the model convention.  </p>

The branches obtained loans from their parent banks at very high rates of interest and sought to deduct the interest as an expense.  This was disallowed up to the level of capital that the branches would have required had they been subsidiary banks registered in France.  The Conseil d'État held that this tax treatment contravened Article 4 of the France/Germany Double Taxation Convention which is in similar terms to Article 8(2) of the 1976 Convention: </p>

In the version applicable to the facts in this case, these provisions must be understood as authorising the state of the branch to attribute to the latter the profits that would have been realised if, instead of dealing with the other parts of the enterprise, it had been dealing with separate enterprises under normal conditions and at market prices. On the contrary, these provisions do not have as their object nor, consequently, their effect of permitting that state to attribute to the branch the profits which would have been earned if the taxpayer had been provided with its own funds in an amount different from that which, being inscribed in the written accounts produced by the taxpayer, accurately reflects the charges and capital-provisions made between the different parts of the enterprise. In particular, the tax administration may not substitute for the latter amount the capital which the branch would have had to be granted, by virtue of the applicable regulations and having regard, specifically, to the risks to which it is exposed, if it had been a separate legal person<span style="color:#565656">.  </span></p>

The Spanish tax authorities attributed free capital to the PE in proportion to the transactions it carried out and made an adjustment to its tax return which they said complied with the 1971 Spain/Netherlands Double Taxation Treaty.  As in the other foreign cases, they did so on the basis of treating the branch as an independent company.  Article 7 of the 1971 Treaty was in the same form as Article 7 of the model conventions up to 2010.  The Spanish court held that it could not construe Article 7 with the assistance of what was said in the 2008 Commentary because in their view that and indeed some of the earlier commentaries in articulating the development of the principles of attribution had made substantive changes to the framework of the model conventions which could not be applied retrospectively.  </p>

That is primary legislation.  It has nothing to do with acts of HMRC, which is not the legislature; it is part of the executive.  This is not an application for judicial review of the acts of HMRC or any other part of the executive.  For this reason alone, I regard reference on behalf of the Appellants to the alleged past practices of HMRC to be completely irrelevant to the issues which we have to decide.  They might be relevant if this were an application for judicial review and what was said, by way of example, was that HMRC had acted in a way which was unfair because it breached a legitimate expectation: see the classic exposition by Bingham LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">R v Inland Revenue Commissioners, ex p. MFK Underwriting Agents Ltd </span>[1990] 1 WLR 1545, at 15691570.  But in the present context HMRC was acting to give effect to primary legislation, section 11AA.  That was enacted by Parliament.  Even if there is a legitimate expectation created by the past practice of HMRC it cannot prevent HMRC giving effect to the will of Parliament; indeed, it is the duty of HMRC to give effect to </p>

This would be so whatever might be said in an international treaty.  Nor could it make any difference that the treaty is incorporated into domestic law by an Order such as here, since secondary legislation must give way to primary legislation. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It would also ordinarily be the case that it would be immaterial that Parliament itself has provided, in section 788(3) of the TA, that a provision in a double taxation treaty is to override a contrary provision in primary legislation.  This is because the FA 2003, which inserted section 11AA into the TA, came after section 788 was enacted and the doctrine of implied repeal would have the effect that this Court would have to give effect to the later Act of Parliament, which would supersede an earlier Act to the extent of their inconsistency.  However, it is clear that, in the context of double taxation treaties, the doctrine of implied repeal does not operate.  The legal position can be compared to the position as it has been until recently (before the UK’s withdrawal from the European Union) under section 2 of the European Communities Act 1972, which applied to Acts of Parliament which came after that Act just as much as it did to earlier Acts.  It is now well established that in the constitution of the UK there can be “constitutional” statutes, which are not “ordinary” statutes.  In particular, the doctrine of implied repeal will not apply to them: see <span style="font-style:italic">Thoburn v Sunderland City Council </span>[2002] EWHC 195 (Admin); [2003] QB 151, at [62]-[63] (Laws LJ) and <span style="font-style:italic">R (Miller) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union</span> [2017] UKSC 5; [2018] AC 61, at [67]. </p>
