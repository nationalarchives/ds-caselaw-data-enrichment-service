Four days later, the Court of Appeal disagreed concluding that the letters were disclosable, and overturned his judgment.  Since then, the subject has not become any more straightforward.  Indeed, given the more complex arrangements that now exist for commercial transactions and the obtaining of legal advice, including new modes of communication between those involved in such activities, the difficulties have been compounded. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in">The issues arise in the context of judicial review proceedings issued on 12 April 2018, brought by the Respondent (“Jet2”), a company operating flights to and from the United Kingdom, against the Appellant (“the CAA”), the UK aviation industry regulator, challenging the lawfulness of the CAA’s decisions (i) to issue a press release in December 2017 and (ii) subsequently to publish correspondence between the CAA and Jet2 in February 2018 including the provision of such correspondence to the Daily Mail.  Both the press release and the CAA correspondence criticised Jet2’s refusal to participate in an alternative dispute resolution scheme for the resolution of consumer complaints which the CAA had promoted and in which almost all other large domestic airlines, and a substantial number of non-domestic airlines flying into the UK, had chosen to participate (“the ADR Scheme”).  The grounds of challenge to those decisions relevant to this appeal are that the CAA had no power to make the publications or alternatively, if it had such power, it exercised the power for unauthorised and improper purposes namely to damage Jet2’s trading interests, to </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in">On 16 January 2018, before the publication of the correspondence (and, of course, well before the issue of proceedings), Jet2 wrote to the CAA complaining about the press release (“the 16 January 2018 letter”); to which the CAA responded on 1 February 2018 (“the 1 February 2018 letter”).  Given the grounds of challenge, Jet2 made an application in the judicial review claim for disclosure of several categories of document, including (e) all drafts of the 1 February 2018 letter and (f) all records of any discussions of those drafts.  Morris J concluded that all of those documents should be disclosed.  Following a further hearing, he held that, even if he had found that those documents were privileged, that privilege was waived by the CAA in respect of all of those documents by the disclosure of an email dated 24 January 2018 from </p>

In the UK, that Directive is enforced through the Alternative Dispute Resolution for Consumer Disputes (Competent Authorities and Information) Regulations 2015 (SI 2015 No 542) (“the 2015 Regulations”), which provide for an ADR scheme which is bilaterally voluntary, i.e. trader and consumer are each able to elect whether or not to adopt it.   </p>

However, under the 2015 Regulations, the CAA is the designated competent authority; and it is a vigorous proponent of the new ADR Scheme, expressing support for primary legislation to make participation in the scheme mandatory for the air passenger industry.  In the meantime, it has the express objective of obtaining full participation in the scheme, and closing down the PACT Scheme.  But, at present, the ADR Scheme is still voluntary; and Jet2 has chosen not to participate in it.  Jet2 continues to rely on the PACT scheme.  </p>

On 16 January 2018, its Executive Chairman, Philip Meeson, wrote to Mr Haines, complaining about the tone and content of the Press Release and giving reasons why Jet2 had not signed up for the ADR Scheme: it considered ADR untried and untested in this context, and unsuited to the resolution of delay and cancellation claims which formed over 90% of the complaints made and which could, in Jet2’s view, better be resolved by other means.

The CAA does not and should not make negative personal comments about individuals within businesses, and in fact, no comment about Mr Meeson personally was made externally by the CAA.

(In the event, at the 4 February 2019 hearing, on the basis of proportionality and pragmatism, without conceding that the documents were in fact not privileged, the CAA indicated that it would treat these documents as disclosable under the December 2018 judgment.)  </p>

They recognise that in the complex world in which we live there are a multitude of reasons why individuals, whether humble or powerful, or corporations, whether large or small, may need to seek the advice or assistance of lawyers in connection with their affairs; they recognise that the seeking and giving of this advice so that the clients may achieve an orderly arrangement of their affairs is strongly in the public interest; they recognise that in order for the advice to bring about that desirable result it is essential that the full and complete facts are placed before the lawyers who are to give it; and they recognise that unless the clients can be assured that what they tell their lawyers will not be disclosed by the lawyers without their (the clients’) consent, there will be cases in which the requisite candour will be absent.  It is obviously true that in very many cases clients would have no inhibitions in providing their lawyers with all the facts and information the lawyers might need whether or not there were the absolute assurance of non-disclosure that the present law of privilege provides.  But the <span style="font-style:italic">dicta</span> to which I have referred all have in common the idea that it is necessary in our society, a society in which the restraining and controlling framework is built upon a belief in the rule of law, that communications between clients and lawyers, whereby the clients are hoping for the assistance of the lawyers’ legal skills in the management of their (the clients’) affairs, should be secure against the possibility of any scrutiny from others, whether the police, the executive, business competitors, inquisitive busybodies or anyone else (see also paragraphs 15.8-15.10 of Zuckerman’s Civil Procedure<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>(2003) where the author refers to the rationale underlying legal advice privilege as ‘the rule of law rationale’).

If the representative is a person employed as an agent on the part of the client to obtain the legal advice of the solicitor, of course he stands in exactly the same position as the client as regards protection, and his communications with the solicitor stand in the same position as the communications of his principal with the solicitor.  But these persons were not representatives in that sense.  They were representatives in this sense, that they were employed on behalf of the clients, the defendants, to do certain work, but that work was not the communicating with the solicitor to obtain legal advice.  So their communications cannot be protected on the ground that they are communications between the client by his representatives and the solicitor.  In fact, the contention of the Respondents comes to this, that all communications between a solicitor and a third person in the course of his advising his client are to be protected.  It was conceded there was no case that went that length, and the question is whether, in order fully to develop the principle with all its reasonable consequences, we ought to protect such documents.  Hitherto such communications have only been protected when they have been in contemplation of some litigation, or for the purpose of giving advice or obtaining evidence with reference to it.  And that is reasonable, because then the solicitor is preparing for the defence or for bringing the action, and all communications he makes for that purpose, and the communications made to him for the purpose of giving him the information, are, in fact, the brief in the action, and ought to be protected.  But here we are asked to extend the principle to a very different class of cases, and it is not necessary, in order to enable persons freely to communicate with their solicitors and obtain their legal advice, that any privilege should be extended to communications such as these.” </p>

If legal advice privilege is confined to communications passing between the lawyer and the ‘client’ (in the sense of the instructing individual or those employees of a company authorised to seek and receive legal advice on its behalf), this presents no problem for individuals and many small businesses, since the information about the case will normally be obtained by the lawyer from the individual or board members of the small corporation.  That was the position in most of the 19th century cases.  In the modern world, however, we have to cater for legal advice sought by large national corporations and indeed multinational ones.  In such cases, the information upon which legal advice is sought is unlikely to be in the hands of the main board or those it appoints to seek and receive legal advice.  If a multi-national corporation cannot ask its lawyers to obtain the information it needs to advise that corporation from the corporation’s employees with relevant first-hand knowledge under the protection of [LAP], that corporation will be in a less advantageous position than a smaller entity seeking such advice. In our view, at least, whatever the rule is, it should be equally applicable to all clients, whatever their size or reach. Moreover, it is not always an answer to say that the relevant subsidiary can seek the necessary legal advice and, therefore, ask its own lawyers to secure the necessary information with the protection of legal advice privilege.  In a case such as the present, there may be issues between group companies that make it desirable for the parent company to be able to procure the information necessary to obtain its own legal advice.” </p>

In that case, the relevant lawyers (Freshfields) were external; and the issue was whether, in advising on the presentation of evidence to the Bingham Inquiry, they were involved <span style="font-style:italic">qua</span> lawyers; and therefore whether the communications concerning that advice could be in respect of “legal advice” so that they were covered by LAP.  The relevant lawyers in this case were in-house; and Morris J found that the in-house lawyers were involved in the internal correspondence <span style="font-style:italic">qua</span> lawyers rather than merely as executives providing commercial advice (see paragraph 22 above).  The relevant non-lawyers were all relatively senior executives.  There appears to be no evidence suggesting that any of those involved in the relevant internal correspondence did not have the ability to seek legal advice from those lawyers, or that, for these purposes, they were not “an emanation of the client”.  It seems to me that, on the evidence, in this case each of the non-lawyers involved fell within the scope of “client” so far as the lawyers involved were concerned.  Therefore, leaving aside for the moment the question of whether the purpose has to be “dominant”, LAP will attach to any confidential communication between a lawyer and a non-lawyer in this case, made for the purpose of giving or obtaining legal advice.   As I understood his submissions, Mr Béar did not suggest the contrary.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.00in;text-indent:0.00in">“Although originally confined to advice regarding litigation, the privilege was extended to non-litigious business.  Nevertheless, despite that extension, the purpose and scope of the privilege is still to enable legal advice to be sought and given in confidence.  In my judgment, therefore, the test is whether the communication or other document was made confidentially for the purposes of legal advice.  Those purposes have to be construed broadly.  Privilege obviously attaches to a document conveying legal advice from solicitor to client and to a specific request from the client for such advice.  But it does not follow that all other communications between them lack privilege.  In most solicitor and client relationships, especially where a transaction involves protracted dealings, advice may be required or appropriate on matters great or small at various stages.  There will be a continuum of communication and meetings between the solicitor and client.  The negotiations for a lease such as occurred in the present case are only one example.  Where information is passed by the solicitor or client to the other as part of the continuum aimed at keeping both informed so that advice may be sought and given as required, privilege will attach.  A letter from the client containing information may end with such words as ‘please advise me what I should do’.  But, even if it does not, there will usually be implied in the relationship an overall expectation that the solicitor will at each stage, whether asked specifically or not, tender appropriate advice.  Moreover, legal advice is not confined to telling the client the law; it must include advice as to what should prudently and sensibly be done in the relevant legal context.  </p>

But to be disclosable such documents must be not only privilege-free but also material and relevant.  Usually a letter which does no more than acknowledge receipt of a document or suggest a date for a meeting will be irrelevant and so non-disclosable.  In effect, therefore, the ‘purpose of legal advice’ test will result in most communications between solicitor and client in, for example, a conveyancing transaction being exempt from disclosure, either because they are privileged or because they are immaterial or irrelevant.” </p>

In <span style="text-decoration:underline">The Sagheera</span> (at page 168), Rix J suggested that in practice it might, so that, if the dominant purpose of the retainer is the obtaining and giving of legal advice, “although it is in theory possible that individual documents may fall outside that purpose, in practice it is unlikely”, whereas, if the dominant purpose of the retainer is some business purpose, the documents will not be privileged unless specific legal advice is given and/or sought.  <span style="text-decoration:underline">Property Alliance Group Limited v</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">Royal Bank of Scotland plc</span> [2015] EWHC 3187 (Ch); [2016] 1 WLR 992, to which we were referred, is an example of a case in which the scope of the retainer of (in that case, external) lawyers, coupled with a properly broad (rather than nit-picking) approach to the continuum of communications, resulted in all of the memoranda for and minutes of meetings prepared by the lawyers in the context of a regulatory investigation being covered by LAP.   </p>

However, it is not determinative of the different question as to whether a specific document passing between them is subject to LAP.

First, it includes advice on the application of the law or, as Taylor LJ put it, “legal advice is not confined to telling the client the law; it must include advice as to what should prudently and sensibly be done in the relevant legal context”.  That was endorsed in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Three Rivers (No 6)</span> (see [62] per Lord Rodger, expressing the agreed view of the Judicial Committee).  Second, once a legal context is established, LAP applies, not just to those communications which expressly seek or give legal advice, but also to the “continuum of communications” between a lawyer and client aimed at “keeping both informed so that advice may be sought and given as required”.  That again was endorsed in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Three Rivers (No 6)</span> (see, e.g., [111] per Lord Carswell, quoted at paragraph 63 above, with whom Lord Rodger, Baroness Hale and Lord Brown agreed).

However, by the time the application came before the Court of Appeal, it seems that that issue was not further contested (see the record of argument, especially at page 1559F-G, where the Bank appears to accept that the dominant purpose test does apply), the core issue being, as I have described, whether that test applied to documents emanating from employees of the Bank.  But the judgment at least assumed that that is the test.  Notably, there are references throughout the judgment to “dominant purpose” without adverse comment; and there is a lengthy passage (at [32]-[37]) on the issue of whether, had the resolution of the earlier issues required it, “the internal documentation of the Bank, which came into existence after the setting up of the Bingham Inquiry, was indeed prepared with the dominant purpose of obtaining [legal] advice”.  Mr Grodzinski could not explain why the court embarked on such an exercise if, as a matter of principle, the dominant purpose test could not even contingently be applicable.   </p>

However, the Judicial Committee did not expressly consider the dominant purpose point in that case: their Lordships did not have to deal with it in the context of that appeal, and clearly declined so to do.  However, the Court of Appeal (the constitution of which included both the Master of the Rolls and Longmore LJ, who had also sat on <span style="text-decoration:underline">Three Rivers (No 5)</span>) again at least appears to have assumed that the dominant purpose test applied.  The issue was not whether that test applied, but whether it had been satisfied (see, e.g., [6]).

However, legal professional privilege is an important but, as I have indicated (paragraph 39 above), not an absolute principle.  As I have indicated, where the material over which privilege is claimed is crucial to an issue in proceedings, it potentially undermines the fairness of a trial.  The common law is not bound to acknowledge a right to withhold evidence that would otherwise be disclosable simply because the relevant material has, as simply one, minor purpose, the obtaining of legal advice, without consideration of the respective weight of purpose.  It is entitled to balance the public interest in these respective principles, and draw a line between them.  Otherwise, as Mr Béar submitted, swathes of internal and external material could be excluded from disclosure simply because a lawyer had been copied in and asked for his legal advice as and when he considered it appropriate to give it.   </p>

Properly, he submitted, all such communications should be regarded as part of the “continuum of communication” between client and lawyers, and so be covered by LAP.  However, for the reasons I set out under Ground 2, I do not consider this point to have any real force.  In particular, it is to be noted that, in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Three Rivers (No 6)</span> at [111], Lord Carswell was especially addressing the issue of the ambit of “legal advice”; and, as Lord Carswell himself observed (at [110]), in construing judicial pronouncements, context is vital.  In particular, he clearly did not have in mind the possibility of (e.g.) simultaneous communications by a single email to lawyers and non-lawyers.  I was unimpressed by the submission that the result I favour will make life difficult for those who wish to obtain legal and non-legal advice simultaneously, because (a) there is no indication that that causes a problem in other Commonwealth countries, such as Australia and Singapore, which have adopted the dominant purpose test for LAP, and (b) LAP is a privilege, and those who wish to take advantage of it should be expected to take proper care when they do so.    </p>

My preferred view is that they should be considered as separate communications between the sender and each recipient.  LAP essentially attaches to communications.  Where the purpose of the sender is simultaneously to obtain from various individuals both legal advice and nonlegal advice/input, it is difficult to see why the form of the request (in a single, multi-addressee email on the one hand, or in separate emails on the other) in itself should be relevant as to whether the communications to the non-lawyers should be privileged.  That is not to say, of course, that the form may not in some cases reveal the true purpose of the communication, e.g. it may appear from the form of the email that the dominant purpose of the email is to settle the instructions to the lawyer who has merely been copied in by way of information, or to the contrary that the dominant purpose of sending the email to the non-lawyers is to obtain their substantive (non-lawyer) input in any event. </p>

If no, then the question of whether any of the other emails are privileged hardly arises.  If yes, then the question arises as to whether any of the emails to the non-lawyers are privileged, because (e.g.) its dominant purpose is to obtain instructions or disseminate legal advice.   </p>

The whole of what transpires at such a meeting, he submitted, should be the subject of  LAP.  However, I disagree; and consider the same principles set out above as applying to documents and other communications are applicable.  Legal advice requested and given at such a meeting would, of course, be privileged; but the mere presence of a lawyer, perhaps only on the off-chance that his or her legal input might be required, is insufficient to render the whole meeting the subject of LAP so that none of its contents (including any notes, minutes or record of the meeting) are disclosable.  If the dominant purpose of the meeting is to obtain legal advice (or, subject to the principle set out in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Three Rivers (No 5)</span> (see paragraphs 47 and following above), to settle instructions to a lawyer), unless anything is said outside that legal context, the contents of the meeting will be privileged.  If the dominant purpose of the discussions is commercial or otherwise non-legal, then the meeting and its contents will not generally be privileged; although any legal advice sought or given within the meeting may be.  It is likely that, where not inextricably intermingled, the non-privileged part will be severable (and, on disclosure, redactable) (see paragraph 69 above).   </p>

First of all, there is the actual transaction or act in respect of which disclosure is made.   In order to identify the transaction, one has to look first at what it is in essence that the waiving party is seeking to disclose.   It may be apparent from that alone that what is to be disclosed is obviously a single and complete ‘transaction’ – for example, the advice given by a lawyer on a given occasion….   [O]ne is in my view entitled to look to see the purpose for which the material is disclosed, or the point in the action to which it is said to go….  Mr Croxford [Counsel for the claimant, which sought to rely on LAP] submitted that the purpose of the disclosure played no part in a determination of how far the waiver went.   I do not agree with that; in some cases it may provide a realistic, objectively determinable definition of the ‘transaction’ in question.   Once the transaction has been identified, then those cases show that the whole of the material relevant to that transaction must be disclosed.   In my view it is not open to a waiving party to say that the transaction is simply what that party has chosen to disclose (again contrary to the substance of a submission made by Mr Croxford).   The court will determine objectively what the real transaction is so that the scope of the waiver can be determined.  If only part of the material involved in that transaction has been disclosed then further disclosure will be ordered and it can no longer be resisted on the basis of privilege. </p>

Mr Moriarty explained (at paragraph 27 of his statement) that the purpose of that disclosure was to show that the language used by Mr Haines in his email of 18 January 2018 was “not reflective of any part of the approach taken by the CAA”.

Having regard to the purpose of the voluntary disclosure (which did not involve disclosing any legal advice, or anything to do with the request or provision of legal advice), the relevant transaction should have been limited to the 24 January 2018 email itself; nor did fairness require any wider disclosure. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in">On this issue, I prefer the submissions of Mr Grodzinski.   In my view, the purpose and nature of the voluntary disclosure are crucial; and, in this case, I consider Morris J unfortunately failed properly to take these matters into account.  As the judge accepted, the disclosure was not in respect of any legal advice; and so it could not be said that there was any risk of the email presenting a partial or selective disclosure of legal advice and thus there was no risk of unfairness that might have been caused by such partial disclosure.  The purpose of the email was modest: it was intended to show that (in Mr Moriarty’s words) the language used by Mr Haines in his email of 18 January 2018 was “not reflective of any part of the approach taken by the CAA”; or, perhaps more accurately, that not all of the executives at CAA shared the approach suggested by Mr Haines’ earlier email.  It cannot be right that such a modest voluntary disclosure could result in the collateral waiver (and thus the forced disclosure by the CAA) in respect of all the internal communications relating to the drafting of the 1 February 2018 letter, including those that expressly reveal legal advice from the CAA’s lawyers; nor is that what the law (or fairness) requires.   </p>
