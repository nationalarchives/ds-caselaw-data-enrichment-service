The third, T, was born in November 2019 and is the subject of these proceedings.  T has lived with her mother since birth in a mother and baby foster placement under an interim care order.  Following assessments, the local authority’s care plan is for separation and adoption.  The mother opposes this and wishes to care for her daughter in the community with support from professionals and her family and friends.  The final hearing will take place between 6 and 8 July before Her Honour Judge Caroline Wright, who has had conduct of the proceedings throughout.  There will be a further case management hearing on 25 June to settle the practical arrangements for the hearing. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The professionals met last week and have reached a consensus view that it will be impossible for the Mother to care for T safely. This is due to a combination of her cognitive functioning, her background and lack of insight. The  professionals agree that the Mother could not care for a child safely, the child would need another person to have parental responsibility, and the Mother  would need to be in a secondary role. There is no one who can provide that  primary carer role for T in the Mother's family.  </p>

True it is that the judge went against the advice of Dr Hale, but that advice was not particularised and it did not relate to a matter that was distinctively within the specialist province of the expert.  I accept that the judge was not on strong ground in diluting the strength of Dr Hales advice by referring to the fact that he had not recommended an intermediary earlier, but the real complaint in this case is that her reasons for refusing the application were insufficient, and it is to that matter that I now turn. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It is central to my consideration of this appeal that there is to be a hybrid hearing in this case.  The hearing will involve quite complex information being considered through more than one medium of communication.  Professionals who are having to adapt to these demands have the advantage of repeated exposure to a range of possible formats.  Lay parties do not generally have that advantage, but it is to their needs that the court must adapt.  Where a party or a witness has a learning disability, the adaptation needs to be sufficient to ensure that they are genuinely able to participate effectively in the hearing, both in and out of the witness box.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">A particular issue may arise where a witness with a learning disability is being questioned by an advocate who is not physically present.  Even assuming that the technology works in an optimal way, the process removes many of the visual cues that are so valuable to individuals with a cognitive impairment.  On 22 April 2020, the Equality and Human Rights Commission published an interim report into video hearings in the criminal justice system and their impact on effective participation by defendants who have a cognitive impairment or a mental illness.  Such defendants may have difficulty retaining information, have a short attention span, be reluctant to speak up and have extreme anxiety:  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">There is of course no direct read-across between a defendant in prison and a party or witness attending court as part of a hybrid hearing.  I mention the EHRC interim report only to underpin the fact that the use of remote technology has additional implications for parties and witnesses with a learning disability.  Being questioned by someone whose face appears on a screen is not the same as face-to-face conversation and the demands of following a hearing in more than one medium inevitably adds to any existing difficulties in understanding what is being said. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In the present case, the mother is someone who was rightly recognised by the court to be vulnerable.  She shares a number of characteristics of the subjects of the EHRC report.  The judge’s conclusion that participation measures did not require the involvement of an intermediary is one that might or might not have been sustainable ahead of a conventional face-to-face hearing, but I do not consider that she sufficiently addressed the additional factors to which a hybrid hearing will give rise.  Her decision does not take any account of this factor and on that basis I consider she fell into error.  It was, I think, necessary to step back from the detail of the rules and look carefully at the likely experience of this vulnerable parent, attending a hearing in what is for her a complex format with the prospect of the removal of her baby hanging over her.  An intermediary can help her to negotiate the process of being questioned remotely and to participate in the hearing to the fullest possible extent.  This is support with communication, and not just emotional support, but if it also gives emotional support, all well and good.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">We are unfortunately disagreeing with a careful and conscientious case management decision, but it seems to me that the difficulty arose because the application for the intermediary was not considered in the context of the arrangements for the hearing, which are not to be finally settled until 25 June.  By refusing the application for an intermediary assessment, the judge deprived herself of the advice of the intermediary about any issues that may need to be addressed.  She might have deferred a decision about the intermediary’s attendance at the trial until she had seen the assessment, but she was I think wrong to have refused to allow the assessment in the light of all the circumstances, including the advice of Dr Hale.  I would therefore set aside her decision. </p>
