	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">There are two appeals before the court, both from a decision of Mr Recorder Douglas Campbell QC (sitting as a Judge of the Patents Court) given on 11 March 2020. The appeals are concerned with a Supplementary Protection Certificate (SPC) designated SPC/GB07/012 (“the SPC”) in the name of Genentech Inc. (“Genentech”), the appellant in the first appeal.  The appellant in the second appeal is Master Data Center, Inc (“MDC”).  MDC’s interest in its appeal is that it acted as Genentech’s agent in connection with the payment of fees for the SPC.  Both appeals are concerned with the fact that, contrary to instructions given by Genentech to MDC to apply for an SPC for the maximum duration (which would have expired on 23 January 2022), MDC only applied for a two-year SPC, with the consequence that the SPC will lapse in a few days’ time, on 2 April 2020. </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Recorder Campbell’s order was made on appeals by Genentech and MDC from a combined decision of Mr B. Micklewright, a Hearing Officer acting for the respondent, The Comptroller General of Patents (“the Comptroller”).  By various procedural applications to which I shall come, the Comptroller had been asked to grant a remedy which would have the effect of allowing the SPC to continue in force until its maximum duration.  In a decision arrived at on the papers alone dated 21 February 2020 Mr Micklewright refused the several applications before him. The Recorder dismissed both appeals from that decision after an expedited hearing on 4 March 2020 at which all parties were represented by leading counsel.  On 20 March 2020 I granted permission to appeal to this court.  A remote hearing of the appeals was held by video conferencing on 26 March 2020 pursuant to Practice Direction 51Y- Video or Audio Hearings during Coronavirus Pandemic, signed by the Lord Chancellor and the Master of the Rolls on 24 March 2020.  This avoided the need for any member of the court, party or legal representative to attend court.  A media representative was able to access the proceedings remotely, by joining the video conference, and accordingly the proceedings were held in public, pursuant to paragraph 3 of that Practice Direction.    </p>

SPCs have the effect of extending the life of a patent for a medicinal product which has been granted a marketing authorisation for a period of up to five years beyond its normal expiry date, under the conditions laid down in the SPC Regulation. Their purpose is to compensate a patentee for the delay in bringing a medicinal product to market consequent on the need to obtain regulatory clearance in the form of a marketing authorisation.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">There are three things to bring out at this point.  First, it is MDC’s case that, contrary to what is offered by this notice, it was not open to the Comptroller to operate a system which allows the applicant to select a shorter period of duration than the one laid down by Article 13 of the SPC Regulation.  MDC’s contention is that the notice was in error in suggesting that fees could be paid for part only of that period.  Secondly, Genentech relies on the notice for what is said in the first of the emboldened paragraphs cited at [18] above.  It contends that that paragraph is consistent with its own construction of the Rules, under which it is possible for an applicant to select a duration shorter than the maximum for its SPC, but then to extend it to the maximum term of the SPC by paying the fees for extra years for the SPC as well as the fee for the paediatric extension.  Thirdly, the emboldened and capitalised paragraph at the end draws attention to the fact that the UK system for the payment of fees differs from that of other member states in that the UK fees are not permitted to be paid annually, that is to say on a year-by-year basis as they fall due.  That is not to say that they are not “annual fees” as permitted by Article 12 of the SPC Regulation, as we shall see.   </p>

She explained that MDC was contracted to make annuity payments on behalf of the Roche group of companies, which includes Genentech.  She said that MDC had standing instructions to pay the full annuity fees for all relevant rights which had payments due.  Although there were some exceptions to these instructions, none of these exceptions applied to this SPC.  Genentech’s instructions to MDC were thus that the annual fee should be paid for the maximum available term of the SPC.  MDC was also specifically instructed that the expiry date of the SPC was 23 January 2022. </p>

At the same time, it enclosed a further Form SP2 in respect of the annual fees payable for the remainder of the duration of the SPC so as to extend the SPC to the maximum duration.  Finally, in the array of applications made, on 20 December 2019 Genentech sought the correction of the original Form SP2 and the associated fee sheet FS2 to be corrected under section 117 of the Act. </p>

There was only one prescribed fee, namely the fee for the maximum duration of the SPC, which in the present case would have been £3000.  Secondly, that notice and the Form SP2 wrongly indicated that the applicant could select a period of protection which was shorter than the duration prescribed by Article 13 of the SPC Regulation.

Rule 6(3) is also drafted in terms of the fee being calculated from the duration rather than the other way around. The different fee levels set out in rule 6(2) of the Fees Rules, are no more than prescribing the fee that is appropriate to the SPC’s actual maximum duration.  They do not allow an applicant to select a fee, and thereby choose an SPC with a term less than the Article 13 term.

In considering the crucial issue whether they impose a regime for the payment of annual fees, I think it important to have in mind that, for the reasons I have explained, an SPC may be granted some time before it is due to take effect. Further, the maximum term of each SPC will vary from certificate to certificate and depend upon the date on which the application for the basic patent was filed and the date of the first authorisation to place the product on the market in the EU, subject to the requirement that the duration of the certificate may not exceed five years from the date on which it takes effect. </p>

Further and importantly, an applicant is not required to take a certificate for the whole period permitted by the Regulation. He may elect to take the certificate for a shorter period and, if he does so, he will only pay a fee in respect of those years for which he has elected. Thus far, as it seems to me, the prescribed fee may properly be described as an annual fee. It is calculated by reference to the number of years for which a certificate is to have effect. </p>

Here I believe that Mr Johnson’s submissions confuse the nature of the fee and the date upon which the liability to pay it arises. I do not believe that the fee ceases to be an annual fee because the rules impose an obligation to pay it in advance. Nor does the fee cease to be an annual fee because the rules impose an obligation to pay it all at once. Further, I do not consider that these rules are in conflict with Article 13. Provided the fee is paid within the prescribed period, the certificate will automatically take effect on the day after expiry of the basic patent.” </p>

The issue in that case was whether the applicant was residing with a close relative and thus not entitled to housing benefit under the applicable housing legislation.  The judge had held himself bound by a previous decision of the Court of Appeal to the effect that sharing accommodation in addition to a bathroom, lavatory and communal area provided a complete test of residence. Buxton LJ (with whom Schiemann LJ and Jacob J agreed) concluded that this proposition formed part of the <span style="font-style:italic">ratio decidendi </span>of the previous case.

She submitted that it was simply assumed to be correct. I accept, of course, what she tells us.  As Buxton LJ pointed out, however, the absence of argument does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that the point has not been considered and decided by the court.  In my judgment it is clear beyond doubt that, in the passage of his reasoning in <span style="font-style:italic">Tulane </span>which is in question in this case, Kitchin LJ was deciding what, as a matter of interpretation, rule 6 permitted.  If it were the case that an applicant was not entitled to elect for a shorter period of SPC than the maximum, so as to cause the SPC to lapse at some intermediate date, that would have been highly relevant to the applicant’s argument that the prescribed fees were not annual fees.

That rule provides that, once the certificate has taken effect, no further fee may be paid to extend the term of the certificate (except in certain circumstances related to paediatric extensions to which I will have to come). This rule cannot be read as if it contemplated (in order to prohibit) a fee to extend the certificate beyond the maximum term of the SPC (i.e. the term calculated under Article 13).  Such an extension would be prohibited by the SPC Regulation and no domestic legislation would be necessary to point out that no such extension was possible.  The rule is only consistent with a scheme in which an applicant might contemplate paying a fee for part only of the maximum duration and then seek to “top-up” the duration by payment of a further fee. The rule makes it clear, therefore, that “topping-up” is not possible.    Such a rule is only consistent with a scheme in which it is open to an applicant to elect for a shorter duration than the maximum, contrary to MDC’s position.  </p>

The applicant is prohibited by rule 116(5) from later paying top-up fees to extend the term beyond that specifically chosen pursuant to rule 6.  It follows that, at the end of the period chosen by the applicant, the SPC will lapse under Article 14(c) of the SPC Regulation, because the applicant will not be able to pay the further annual fees.   </p>

The UK scheme as it is interpreted by MDC, however, does not provide for the SPC to lapse for non-payment of annual fees in any meaningful sense, because the fees must always be paid in advance for the whole term and before the SPC comes into effect.  That is not something which is permitted by the SPC Regulation, and would render the UK national scheme non-compliant therewith.  </p>

For the reasons I have given, the notice did not have to.  The notice adequately identified the prescribed annual fees which the applicant would have to pay, depending on the term of SPC it elected for.  As the Comptroller, therefore, correctly notified the applicant of the prescribed fee due, this submission fails as well.  </p>

It would be an artificial exercise to decide discretion in these circumstances.  I would dismiss MDC’s appeal.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">I have already considered rule 116(5) to some extent at [38] to [39] above.  That rule provides that “… once the certificate has taken effect no further fee may be paid to extend the term of the certificate <span style="font-style:italic">unless</span> an application for [a paediatric extension] is made…” (my emphasis).  I shall refer to the clause beginning “unless” as “the proviso”.   Mr Lykiardopoulos accepts that, absent an application for a paediatric extension, the part of the rule before the proviso prevents top-up fees being paid so as to extend the term of the certificate beyond that corresponding to the fee originally paid.  He submits, however, that once a paediatric extension is applied for, the effect of the proviso is that the applicant may pay any necessary top-up fees as well as the fee for the paediatric extension.  Why, he asks forensically, would the fees dealt with by the proviso not be referring to, or at least include, the annual fees which are the subject of the earlier part of the rule?  He prays in aid the purpose of the Paediatric Regulation, namely to provide a reward for those who undertake the necessary research into paediatric indications, which is in the public interest.  He also submits that the fact that paediatric extensions can be granted after the SPC has taken effect explains why the rules would allow the payment of top-up fees where a paediatric extension application is made.  He further points to the first emboldened paragraph in the Rule 116(3) notification (see [18] above), which he submits is only consistent with his interpretation.  That paragraph is only dealing with the case where an applicant has chosen less than the maximum duration, yet it expressly contemplates an extension of the certificate under the Paediatric Regulation. </p>

The paediatric extension is not a separate SPC: the original SPC remains, but with a longer duration.  That is the only reward required or allowed by EU law to be given to an applicant who meets the conditions for a paediatric extension.  Article 14(c) still provides that the certificate, whether extended or not, shall lapse if the annual fees are not paid. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">One would expect the national provisions to be consistent with that background of EU law.  In particular, one would not expect the national scheme to provide that the filing of a paediatric extension application would have any other benefit apart from a potential extension to the maximum term.  One would also not expect the filing of a paediatric extension application to affect the lapsing of the certificate for nonpayment of annual fees.    I have already explained that, under the UK scheme, an applicant who elects to pay less than the fee for the maximum duration of an SPC also elects to allow the SPC to lapse for non-payment, as provided for by Article 14(c).  Genentech’s construction of Rule 116(5) allows a paediatric extension application to countermand the effect of that election.  I do not accept that this is justified by the fact that a paediatric extension can be granted after the SPC has come into effect. </p>

First, paragraph 5 of Schedule 4A to the Act envisages a single fee paid to bring the certificate into effect.  It does not envisage the payment of further prescribed fees after the certificate has come into effect.  It is true that it does not prohibit them either, but that does not prevent the point from providing important context as to what rule 116(5) was seeking to achieve. </p>

It must also pay the further annual fees.  Further annual fees are, however, specifically prohibited by rule 116(5). To read section 117 as permitting the Comptroller to rectify not only the document, but also the failure to pay the fees would be to allow section 117, an entirely general provision about rectifying errors in documents, to nullify the effect of rule 116(5).  The argument offends against the principle that general provisions should not be construed so as to derogate from more specific ones<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="2">

He allied this with a submission that at all material times the balance of MDC’s deposit account with UKIPO had within it sufficient funds to pay the full fee of £3,000.   </p>
