The claimant claims damages for personal injury, loss and damage consequent upon sexual abuse and assaults committed upon him by the first defendant, a teacher at Highgate Wood School, Hornsey, London, where he was a pupil from 1980 until 1982 and then again for a short time in 1983/4. It is alleged that these assaults continued after he left the school up until and including 1988. The first defendant was employed at all material times as a teacher of physical education by the second defendant. Proceedings are brought against the second defendant on the basis that the London Borough of Haringey is vicariously liable for his actions.  </p>

This defendant agreed to a limitation freeze on 13th November 2015. The proceedings were commenced against both defendants on 9th June 2016. It is the claimant's case that shortly upon his arrival at the school he was raped by another man named John Paul Monteil. Badly affected by this and unable to turn to his parents he confided in the first defendant who had encouraged him so to do. The first defendant told him that this meant that he, the claimant, was gay and that if this became known people would not understand and dislike him and his parents would throw him out of the family home. By contrast he, the first defendant, would understand, like him and be his friend. By this means it is alleged that the first defendant groomed and manipulated the claimant into sexual activity with him which included the anal rape of him almost from the start. There then continued frequent sexual activity between them until the claimant was about 21 years with very occasional contact thereafter. The claimant asserts that he has suffered complex post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of the abuse.  </p>

That primary period is 3 years from the date of knowledge of injury on the part of the person assaulted: Limitation Act 1980 s.11(4). The Respondent was a minor when first assaulted and for some time thereafter. He attained majority on 13 September 1984. By s.28(1) of the 1980 Act, the relevant period of three years, in respect of assaults prior to the Respondent’s majority, began on that date and expired on 13 September 1987. For assaults after the Respondent’s 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> birthday, the limitation period was 3 years from the date of each assault. As the judge noted, therefore, the claim was brought between 25 and 30 years after the expiry of the primary limitation period in respect of injury caused by the assaults in issue.  </p>

It suffices to say that the family appears to have had enough money for normal needs but was not well off. At junior school, the Respondent excelled at swimming and he claimed he was happy at that school, although text messages emerged during the proceedings in which he had spoken in very disparaging terms about his fellow pupils when, in adult life, he was invited to a former pupils’ reunion. He had some involvement in drama at a theatre school for the young and, for a period, was a cast member in an important West End production.  </p>

Instead of going directly to the friend’s home, they went first, together with others, to the flat of a man called Monteil. Monteil allowed the Respondent’s friend and others to smoke and to drink alcohol. The friends became very drunk. The Respondent said that he took his friend, a girl of his own age, back to her home, planning to stay there overnight as had been originally intended; her father was angry and, having taken his daughter into the house, refused to admit the Respondent. The Respondent, fearful of going home, first took refuge in a bus shelter, but then when it became too cold (on this winter night), he returned to Monteil’s flat where he asked to stay.

The First Defendant said it was the Respondent who had initiated the visit to Hampstead Heath and to the public lavatories. In short, it was the First Defendant’s case that it was the Respondent who “groomed” him rather than the reverse.

Professor Maden stands by his formulation of a worsening of personality disorder exacerbated by drug and alcohol misuse, or possibly a depressive episode. Professor Maden gives weight to the documented slow evolution and emergence of post-traumatic symptoms after the 2011 breakdown. He notes that FZO says his attitude changed when he perceived that Adams was unsupportive after the 2011 breakdown.

I accept the evidence of Dr O'Neill that it is impossible to look at the behaviour of the claimant and first defendant after the claimant left school separately from the grooming and abuse of him while he was at the school. I find that the delay in bringing these proceedings was because the claimant did not recognise that what happened to him at the hands of the first defendant was abuse until his breakdown in 2011. Had he done so it is inconceivable that he would have continued to be in touch with the first defendant in the way that he was. He failed to see it as abuse by reason of being groomed by the first defendant while it was happening. The way that he had been conditioned to think by the first defendant continued to operate in his mind. I agree with the submissions of Mr Seabrook that the delay in this case is a consequence of the grooming and emotional manipulation of the claimant which caused him to depend on the first defendant and to tolerate his behaviour rather than to sue.” </p>

There is no doubt that there will be some difficulty in determining the reason for the claimant's mental health difficulties following a breakdown which took place some 2431 years after the abuse occurred. Having said that there is some force in the contention made by the claimant that there would have been difficulty, perhaps even greater difficulty, in predicting when the claimant was 21 or 22 what the effects of the abuse would be on his future life. The burden of proving causation is on the claimant himself. The exercise of determining it will require a detailed scrutiny of the claimant's past life and history, together with an examination of the available evidence, particularly the medical evidence. It will also involve an assessment of the claimant's reliability as a witness. The courts are well used to carrying out such assessments.

She considered that it was artificial to separate out the two events in the way that Professor Maden had done. That was so because the First Defendant had used the fact of the earlier rape to create fear in the Respondent’s mind; that rape and the abuse were intrinsically linked. The judge found that a large part of the bullying that had occurred at the School was linked to the abuse by the First Defendant. The judge also discounted any bullying at junior school as having had any significant contribution to the Respondent’s mental state; the evidence of this was in any event slender. </p>

The judge inevitably had to assess this attack in the light of all the evidence that she had heard. It was a case in which the fact of some abuse was incontrovertible in the light of the First Defendant’s pleas of guilty in the Crown Court and the principal factual issue was as to who had been the “groomer” and the leader in the relationship.

This material included some 400 or so photographs taken by the appellant over a number of years of the complainant, posing naked and by her smile and demeanour appearing to indicate that she was willing for the appellant to take these photographs of her.” At [5], Lord Judge said:  </p>

Rather the evidence of prolonged grooming and potential corruption of the complainant when she was a child provided the context in which the evidence of her apparent consent after she had grown up should be examined and assessed. Properly analysed, so it was argued, the evidence of apparent consent did not undermine the credibility of the complainant that she never consented.  </p>

The first question is what functions or “field of activities” have been entrusted by the employer to the employee, or, in everyday language, what was the nature of his job. As has been emphasised in several cases, this question must be addressed broadly; see in particular the passage in Diplock LJ’s judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Ilkiw v Samuels</span> [1963] 1 WLR 991, 1004 included in the citation from <span style="font-style:italic">Rose v Plenty</span> [1976] 1 WLR 141, 147-148 (at para 38 above) and cited also in <span style="font-style:italic">Lister v Hesley Hall Ltd</span> [2002] 1 AC 215 by Lord Steyn at para 20, Lord Clyde, at para 42, Lord Hobhouse, at para 58 and Lord Millett, at para 77. </p>

Secondly, the court must decide whether there was sufficient connection between the position in which he was employed and his wrongful conduct to make it right for the employer to be held liable under the principle of social justice which goes back to Holt CJ. To try to measure the closeness of connection, as it were, on a scale of 1 to 10, would be a forlorn exercise and, what is more, it would miss the point. The cases in which the necessary connection has been found for Holt CJ’s principle to be applied are cases in which the employee used or misused the position entrusted to him in a way which injured the third party. <span style="font-style:italic">Lloyd v Grace, Smith &amp; Co</span> [1912] AC 716, <span style="font-style:italic">Peterson v Royal Oak Hotel Ltd </span>[1948] NZLR 136<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>and<span style="font-style:italic"> Lister v Hesley Hall Ltd</span> were all cases in which the employee misused his position in a way which injured the claimant, and that is the reason why it was just that the employer who selected him and put him in that position should be held responsible. By contrast, in <span style="font-style:italic">Warren v Henlys Ltd</span> [1948] 2 All ER 935 any misbehaviour by the petrol pump attendant, qua petrol pump attendant, was past history by the time that he assaulted the claimant.

It would be necessary to enquire in respect of the individual traffic accident whether the relationship between the School and D1 was, for this purpose, sufficiently close to the negligent driving of D1 on the occasion in question: see again Lord Phillips at [2012] UKSC 56 at [21].

Throughout her answers she stressed that the traumatic nature of abuse may only be appreciated by the victim over time. It was suggested to her that the sexual acts were consensual and could not, therefore, be traumatic. She responded that there was not true consent and that the perception of trauma can be delayed.

She found it was designed to cover circumstances where events evolve over time rather than a sudden dramatic trauma. The judge rejected Mr Kent’s submission that the abusive acts had to be violent at the time to qualify and considered that persistent abuse following grooming can be defined as extremely threatening or horrific in nature. She also found, as is not infrequently the case in domestic violence, the behaviour of the perpetrator towards the victim leads to a dependence from which it is either difficult or impossible to escape.

It is not surprising, I think, that as the nature of the past sexual abuse gradually emerged, up to June 2012, the treating psychiatrists’ views developed. A change of opinion, if such it was, was not necessarily wrong. It is to be recalled that the Respondent’s partner, FZOR, said that it was only after the breakdown in September 2011 that the Respondent disclosed even to him the abuse that he had experienced, and then only in general terms.  </p>

Professor Maden was inclined to disbelieve the Respondent’s reporting of past events and noted what he perceived to be a number of inconsistencies, although, as noted, he agreed with Dr Shanahan’s 2013 view that the Respondent’s personality had been “indelibly marked psychologically” by the abuse, even on his own assessment of the primary facts. In the end, the judge, who heard all the witnesses, clearly preferred (and strongly) preferred the evidence of the Respondent to that of the First Defendant on these issues. At three points in her judgment, the judge referred to Professor Maden’s concession that his professional opinion would be different if the court accepted the Respondent’s account that he was groomed in the way that he said he was. </p>

In so doing the judge preferred the evidence of Dr O’Neill to that of Professor Maden who concluded that the Respondent is suffering from an emotionally unstable personality disorder.  In arriving at her conclusion, the judge took account of the fact that Dr O’Neill was not alone in this diagnosis, she identified other psychiatrists “who have had greater involvement with the Respondent, including Dr Rackow and Dr Muller-Pollard” as having come to the same opinion.  The judge noted that before either of the doctors became involved “… at the claimant’s 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> admission to the Capio in 2014, the professionals were noting concerns that he may have symptoms of PTSD.

The prevalent diagnosis was that of a form of personality disorder and ADHD.  It is of note that by the third admission in June 2012 the Respondent had recently been interviewed by the police regarding his allegations of child sexual abuse.  It is clear from the medical records that from the third admission onwards the Respondent was speaking of the abuse which he suffered from the age of 11 to 17 and that was being noted and considered by the treating clinicians.  As the Respondent was an inpatient, the treating clinicians and other healthcare professionals were given the opportunity to record his complaints and monitor his presentation and condition.  It was in that context that in April 2014 Dr Muller-Pollard made the diagnosis of recurrent depressive disorder, generalised anxiety disorder and panic disorder.   </p>

Professor Maden did rely upon literature to support his contention that the Respondent was suffering from a form of personality disorder rather than PTSD.

Between 2011 and 2014, when the Respondent was an inpatient at the Capio hospital, he was assessed by five different consultant psychiatrists, none of whom diagnosed PTSD or Complex PTSD.  These diagnoses were material.  Account was taken of them by Professor Maden in reaching his diagnostic conclusion.  It is of note that from 2012 onwards those treating the Respondent in the Capio hospital were aware of the fact that he had spoken to the police and was alleging sexual child abuse.  The judge records that it was as the Respondent started to speak with the police and the abuse came to the forefront of his mind that the symptoms became more obvious.  It would appear to follow from this finding of the judge that the symptoms would have been increasingly obvious during the period 2012 to 2014 when the Respondent was being seen and treated at the Capio, not least in 2013/14 by Dr Muller-Pollard who did not diagnose Complex PTSD.   </p>
