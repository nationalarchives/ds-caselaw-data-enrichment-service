It is not clear whether or not they initially had a temporary right to remain but the FTT Judge held that if so, it would have been for no more than 6 months, after which they overstayed.  His mother abandoned him and he went to live with his aunt.   In April 2006 his daughter K was born.  She is now 14.  She is a British citizen by virtue of the British citizenship of her mother, the appellant’s partner at the time.  They separated and in May 2009 the appellant married a Portuguese national, as a result of which on 7 July 2009 he was granted a residence card valid for 5 years.  The marriage broke down and he had no contact with his wife after about 2011.  On 16 August 2011 he was convicted of driving whilst disqualified and without insurance and given a community sentence with a 180 hour work requirement.  On 29 November 2013 he was convicted, following a trial, of conspiracy to supply heroin and cocaine and sentenced to 4 ½ years imprisonment.  The sentencing remarks, which were before UT Judge Smith when coming to her UT Remade decision, but not before FTT Judge Swaney at the first hearing, revealed that he had been a willing drug runner for “MO” assisting him for financial gain in what he knew to be a substantial business, although it was in fact more substantial than he appreciated.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.13in">There has been a proliferation of case law on the application of the “unduly harsh” test in section 117C(5) of the 2002 Act, and the “very compelling circumstances” test in section 117C(6).  That is the result of the many different factual circumstances in which they regularly have to be applied by first instance judges of the Immigration and Asylum Chamber.  That does not mean, however, that there is a need to refer extensively to authority for the meaning or application of these two statutory tests.  It should usually be unnecessary to refer to anything outside the four authorities identified below, namely <span style="font-style:italic">KO (Nigeria) v Secretary of State for the Home Department</span> [2018] 1 WLR 5273; <span style="font-style:italic">R (on the application of Byndloss) v Secretary of State for the Home Department</span> [2017] 1 WLR 2380; <span style="font-style:italic">NA (Pakistan) v Secretary of State for the Home Department</span> [2017] 1WLR 207; <span style="font-style:italic">HA (Iraq) v Secretary of State for the Home Department</span> [2020] EWCA Civ 117.  It will usually be unhelpful to refer first instance judges to other examples of their application to the particular facts of other cases and seek to draw factual comparisons by way of similarities or differences.   Decisions in this area will involve an examination of the many circumstances making up private or family life, which are infinitely variable, and will require a close focus on the particular individual private and family lives in question, judged cumulatively on their own terms.   Nor will it be necessary for first instance judges to cite extensively from these or other authorities, provided that they identify that they are seeking to apply the relevant principles.  I would associate myself with what Coulson LJ said at paragraph [37] of <span style="font-style:italic">UT (Sri Lanka) v Secretary of State for the Home Department</span> [2019] EWCA Civ 1095, that it is an impediment to the efficient working of the tribunal system in this area for judges to have numerous cases cited to them or to feel the need to set out extensive quotation from them, rather than focussing primarily on their application to the factual circumstances of the particular case before them.  Judges who are experienced in these specialised courts should be assumed by any appellate court or tribunal to be well familiar with the principles, and to be applying them, without the need for extensive citation, unless it is clear from what they say that they have not done so.   </p>

On the other hand the expression “unduly harsh” seems clearly intended to introduce a higher hurdle than that of “reasonableness” under section 117B(6) , taking account of the public interest in the deportation of foreign criminals. Further the word “unduly” implies an element of comparison. It assumes that there is a “due” level of “harshness”, that is a level which may be acceptable or justifiable in the relevant context. “Unduly” implies something going beyond that level. The relevant context is that set by section 117C(1) , that is the public interest in the deportation of foreign criminals. One is looking for a degree of harshness going beyond what would necessarily be involved for any child faced with the deportation of a parent. What it does not require in my view (and subject to the discussion of the cases in the next section) is a balancing of relative levels of severity of the parent's offence, other than is inherent in the distinction drawn by the section itself by reference to length of sentence. Nor (contrary to the view of the Court of Appeal in IT (Jamaica) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2017] 1 WLR 240 , paras 55 and 64) can it be equated with a requirement to show “very compelling reasons”. That would be in effect to replicate the additional test applied by section 117C(6) with respect to sentences of four years or more.” </p>

Beyond that, further exposition of the phrase “unduly harsh” is of limited value.  Moreover, as made clear at [56]-[57], it is potentially misleading and dangerous to seek to identify some “ordinary” level of harshness as an acceptable level by reference to what may be commonly encountered circumstances: there is no reason in principle why cases of undue hardship may not occur quite commonly; and how a child will be affected by a parent’s deportation will depend upon an almost infinitely variable range of circumstances.

Parliament's unusual statement of fact was expressed to be for the purpose of section 3(5)(a) of the 1971 Act so its consequence was that every foreign criminal became automatically liable to deportation. Parliament's statement exemplifies the “strong public interest in the deportation of foreign nationals who have committed serious offences”: <span style="font-style:italic">Ali v Secretary of State for the Home Department</span> [2016] 1 WLR 4799, para 14, per Lord Reed JSC.

He needs to be in a position to assemble and present powerful evidence. I must not be taken to be prescriptive in suggesting that the very compelling reasons which the tribunal must find before it allows an appeal are likely to relate in particular to some or all of the following matters: (a) the depth of the claimant's integration in United Kingdom society in terms of family, employment and otherwise; (b) the quality of his relationship with any child, partner or other family member in the United Kingdom; (c) the extent to which any relationship with family members might reasonably be sustained even after deportation, whether by their joining him abroad or otherwise; (d) the impact of his deportation on the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of any child in the United Kingdom; (e) the likely strength of the obstacles to his integration in the society of the country of his nationality; and, surely in every case; (f) any significant risk of his reoffending in the United Kingdom, judged, no doubt with difficulty, in the light of his criminal record set against the credibility of his probable assertions of remorse and reform.” </p>

In our view, the reasoning of the Court of Appeal in the <span style="font-style:italic">JZ (Zambia)</span> case   [2016] Imm AR 781 applies to those provisions. The phrase used in section 117C(6) , in paragraph 398 of the 2014 rules and which we have held is to be read into section 117C(3) does not mean that a foreign criminal facing deportation is altogether disentitled from seeking to rely on matters falling within the scope of the circumstances described in Exceptions 1 and 2 when seeking to contend that “there are very compelling circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions 1 and 2”. As we have indicated above, a foreign criminal is entitled to rely upon such matters, but he would need to be able to point to features of his case of a kind mentioned in Exceptions 1 and 2 (and in paragraphs 399 or 399A of the 2014 rules), or features falling outside the circumstances described in those exceptions and those paragraphs, which made his claim based on article 8 especially strong.  </p>

One might describe that as a bare case of the kind described in Exceptions 1 or 2. On the other hand, if he could point to factors identified in the descriptions of Exceptions 1 and 2 of an especially compelling kind in support of an article 8 claim, going well beyond what would be necessary to make out a bare case of the kind described in Exceptions 1 and 2, they could in principle constitute “very compelling circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions 1 and 2”, whether taken by themselves or in conjunction with other factors relevant to application of article 8. </p>

Mr Southey QC, who represents KJ and WM, rightly submits that the Strasbourg authorities have an important role to play. Mr Tam rightly accepted that this is correct. The answer is that the Secretary of State and the tribunals and courts will have regard to the Strasbourg jurisprudence when applying the tests set out in our domestic legislation. For example, a tribunal may be considering whether it would be “unduly harsh” for a child to remain in England without the deportee; or it may be considering whether certain circumstances are sufficiently “compelling” to outweigh the high public interest in deportation of foreign criminals. Anyone applying these tests (as required by our own rules and legislation) should heed the guidance contained in the Strasbourg authorities……. </p>

The Upper Tribunal identified that within ground 2 there was said to have been an error of law by the FTT in determining that the unduly harsh test was met.  At paragraph [37] it acknowledged the force of the submission on behalf of the appellant that the respondent’s argument was in effect that the decision reached was one which could not reasonably have been reached on the facts.  At paragraph [41] the Upper Tribunal purported to summarise the circumstances relied on by the FTT Judge for concluding that the unduly harsh test was met “taken at their highest”.

Accordingly the only basis for such a decision would be one of irrationality or perversity, that is to say that it was a conclusion which no reasonable tribunal properly directing itself as to the law could reach on the evidence.  On the FTT Judge’s findings of fact, a conclusion of undue harshness, within the meaning of that term identified in <span style="font-style:italic">KO (Nigeria)</span>, was reasonably open to her.  At  the oral hearing of the appeal, before the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">HA (Iraq)</span> was handed down, Mr Lemer focussed on the words of Lord Carnwath JSC in paragraph [23] of <span style="font-style:italic">KO (Nigeria)</span> and submitted that there were a number of features of her findings which were specific to C and the children’s family circumstances and which did go “beyond what would necessarily be involved for any child faced with the deportation of a parent”.

That was not the basis of the decision.  No such misdirection is identified in the Error of Law decision. The critical conclusion at paragraph [50] is fairly to be read, in the light of paragraph [37], as treating the relevant error of law as being perversity; the UT had set out the evidence the FTT Judge had relied on as giving rise to undue harshness and purported to summarise it at its highest.  In saying that it could not identify a basis on which it could be said that those circumstances were unduly harsh, it can only have meant that such circumstances were not capable of forming a basis for such a conclusion.  It had observed at paragraph [37] that there was considerable force in the suggestion that the  respondent’s argument was that no reasonable tribunal could have reached such conclusion, and it was that argument which was being accepted. </p>

First, the right of appeal to the UT is "on any point of law arising from a decision made by the [FTT] other than an excluded decision": Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 ("the 2007 Act"), section 11(1) and (2) . If the UT finds an error of law, the UT may set aside the decision of the FTT and remake the decision: section 12(1) and (2) of the 2007 Act. If there is no error of law in the FTT's decision, the decision will stand. Secondly, although "error of law" is widely defined, it is not the case that the UT is entitled to remake the decision of the FTT simply because it does not agree with it, or because it thinks it can produce a better one. Thus, the reasons given for considering there to be an error of law really matter.

The factors which the FTT Judge identified were capable of supporting the conclusion that the effect on C and the children of remaining in the UK without the appellant met the elevated unduly harsh test.  That was an evaluative judgement for the FTT Judge on the basis of the full evidence before her, including cross-examined oral evidence and the report from Ms Meeks, the nuances of which will not be apparent to an appellate tribunal.  Her findings of fact are such that a conclusion of undue harshness was open to her.  Different tribunals might have reached a different conclusion, but it is inherent in the evaluative exercise involved in these fact sensitive decisions that there is a range of reasonable conclusions which a judge might reach, and the error of law here under consideration is only made out if the FTT Judge’s conclusion is outside that range.  In my view it was within the range in this case. </p>

That issue has now been fully addressed in <span style="font-style:italic">HA (Iraq)</span> at paragraphs [132]-[142] where the previous authorities are analysed.  As the court stated at [140] and [141], tribunals will properly remain cautious about their ability to make findings on the risk of reoffending, but where a tribunal is able to make an assessment that the foreign criminal is unlikely to reoffend, that is a factor which can carry some weight in the balance when considering very compelling circumstances, although not one which will carry great weight on its own. </p>

Mr Malik’s submissions mischaracterised rehabilitation as merely the absence of further offending.  Rehabilitation is not limited to the mere fact that there has been no further offending.  What is also relevant is the risk of further offending.  The fact that the criminal has not reoffended may inform that assessment, but may not of itself provide much if any basis for concluding that the risk of reoffending is significantly reduced, especially if it is for a relatively short period.   However rehabilitation, in the sense of a reduced risk of reoffending, is to be assessed by reference to a multitude of factors other than merely the absence of further offending.  It is the common task of the probation service daily to make such an assessment in the preparation of pre-sentence reports for sentencing judges, and they perform that assessment by reference to factors some of which are offence specific, but many of which are specific to the offender.  It is well recognised, for example, that a change of personal circumstances since the offending is capable of reducing the risk of further offending and may in some cases be of sufficient weight to render it unlikely.  It does not need the specialist experience of probation officers to reach such a conclusion, which may be apparent to an immigration judge depending on the particular personal circumstances in which the offender came to offend, how influential they were on the offending and how the change of circumstances affects the risk of further offending.  The FTT Judge in this case performed that evaluative exercise in concluding that the appellant was most unlikely to reoffend given the vulnerable circumstances in which he offended, his positive steps to reduce his risk of reoffending and the more stable family circumstances of his years since the offending.  Of course they cannot be said to eliminate any risk of reoffending.  But taken with the appellant’s own evidence as to his current attitude to his offending, they can properly support the Judge’s conclusion that the risk of reoffending was reduced to the level of most unlikely. </p>

This appears to me to be a case in which the Upper Tribunal has interfered merely on the grounds that its members would themselves have reached a different conclusion.  That is impermissible.  I appreciate that under the tribunal system, established by the Tribunals Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 Act, the Upper Tribunal is itself a specialist tribunal, with the function of ensuring that First-tier Tribunals adopt a consistent approach to the determination of questions of principle which arise under the particular statutory scheme in question by giving guidance on those questions of principle: see per Lord Carnwath JSC in the tax context in <span style="font-style:italic">HMRC v Pendragon Ltd</span> [2015] UKSC 37 at [48] and Baroness Hale PSC in the immigration context in <span style="font-style:italic">MM (Lebanon) v Secretary of State for the Home Department </span>[2017] 1 WLR 771 at [69] to [74].    However it is no part of such function to seek to restrict the range of reasonable views which may be reached by FTT Judges in the value judgments applied to the many different private and family life circumstances which make almost all cases in this area different from each other.  It is emphatically not part of their function to seek conformity by substituting their own views as to what the outcome should be for those of first instance judges hearing the evidence.

On a proper and fair reading of the UT Remade Decision I would not treat UT Judge Smith as having found that the consequences would be any more than harsh.  However her  reference to the fact that they “may be very harsh” was unhelpful.   Tribunal judges should not seek to express their decisions by categorisations of degrees of harshness, which is to complicate what is a single and straightforward statutory test.  They should identify the factors which are relied on as making the consequences of deportation unduly harsh and evaluate whether cumulatively they do so, bearing in mind that it is an elevated threshold, and that, as <span style="font-style:italic">HA (Iraq)</span> explains, it  is undesirable to approach the issue by trying to identify what is “the norm” and what in the individual case goes beyond that: almost all cases are different, involving a multitude of individual factors, and it is impossible to measure objectively a norm or baseline as the comparator against which the individual case is to be judged.   </p>
