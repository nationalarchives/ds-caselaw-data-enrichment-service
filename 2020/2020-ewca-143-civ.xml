The local planning authority, Conwy County Council (“the Council”), refused the application.  The applicants appealed under s.78 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (“the 1990 Act”) against that refusal. By a decision dated 28 August 2018 Ms Kay Sheffield, an inspector appointed by the Welsh Ministers, dismissed the appeal.  A challenge to the inspector’s decision was brought by Renew under s.288 of the 1990 Act and was upheld by His Honour Judge Keyser QC, sitting as a judge of the High Court.  The judge quashed the decision and remitted the matter for redetermination by the Welsh Ministers.  The Welsh Ministers now appeal to this court against the judge’s order.  The issues on the appeal are relatively narrow and relate primarily to the inspector’s finding that the development would result in an unacceptable loss of open space.  There is no dispute about the applicable legal principles. </p>

There was some doubt before us as to how the tables were to be read.  It appears to me, however, that Table 1 sets out the amounts of existing open space and includes 3.43 hectares of existing “play space” in Old Colwyn; whilst Table 2 sets out the deficits of open space against relevant standards and shows a deficit of 2.81 hectares of play space in Old Colwyn.  The detail is ultimately unimportant since, as considered below, it was common ground before the inspector that the grassed area of 0.85 hectares on the application site was included in the assessment of play space in Old Colwyn and that there was a substantial deficit of play space in the locality. </p>

It argued that the OSA provided only a quantitative assessment of open space across the borough; that policy CFS/12 did not require a like-for-like replacement of the play space being lost on the application site but required a value judgment, i.e. a qualitative assessment, not simply a quantitative one; and that the Council had failed to make the appropriate assessment (paragraphs 3.8-3.12).

The “open space” objection to the proposed development under policy CFS/12 rested on the supposition that the application site included 0.85 hectares of play space within a total of 3.43 hectares of play space in Old Colwyn identified in the OSA. That land could only have been included as being a “less formal area” within the third of the categories identified in paragraph 2.1 of the OSA. As it was land in private ownership, it could only have been considered as “contributing to public open space provision” if it were subject of a “formal agreement” with the landowner: see paragraph 3.1 of the OSA. As has been mentioned, the appellants’ case on appeal proceeded on the basis that the figures in the OSA did indeed include the 0.85 hectares. If that were all that was to be said, the Inspector’s approach would, in my view, have been unimpeachable: both parties accepted that the land was included in the OSA’s figures and that policy CFS/12 was engaged; if there were any mistake of fact, the appellants shared responsibility for it and could not now complain of it. As for the question of a formal agreement, in and of itself this was a side-show, because the actual question, on which there was no ostensible dispute, was whether the policy was engaged. If the policy was engaged, then in the absence of any contrary information the Inspector was entitled to proceed on the basis that any prior conditions for inclusion of the land in the OSA had been satisfied.  </p>

The plain averments in the appellants’ Statement of Case, which were not materially contradicted by the Council, tended strongly to indicate that there was no “formal agreement” of any sort in place in respect of the land. Actually, the formality of any agreement does not seem to me to be the most important question: the OSA was not a lawyers’ document and ought not to be construed like one; it would be idle to worry about the precise meaning to be attached to the word “formal” in this context. However, the substance of the matter is important. The object of policy CFS/12 and of the OSA is to preserve the bank of public open space. Most such public open space will of course be in public ownership. Where it is not, the land will be included in the bank of public open space only if the owner has made an agreement for its use as public open space. The Inspector accepted the premise of the appellants’ fall-back case as set out in paragraph 3.13 of their Statement of Case. This necessarily meant that, if there were any agreement at all on the part of the landowner, it could have amounted to no more than an agreement that people could play on the land until the landowner decided to stop them by enclosing the land. It is not strictly impossible that there was such an agreement. However, it is highly implausible; to see this, one has only to try to imagine someone actually making such an agreement with a public body. The implausibility is heightened by the repeated reference to the land in question as “informal” play space and by the absence of any actual reference to an agreement. Furthermore, an agreement of that nature, amounting to no more than a permissive licence terminable at will, is plainly not a proper basis for the application of a policy protecting public open space (as though a policy against development would apply if the landowner had “agreed” that it would not stop people playing on the land until it decided to do so, but would not apply if a landowner with a right to fence simply took no action until it decided to fence).  </p>

Therefore, residual visual amenity would be relevant only as a substantive matter in its own right, not as an aspect of the benefit of preserving public open space in accordance with a policy in the local development plan. It was not disputed that the refusal of permission for development would preserve the visual amenity of undeveloped land. The question was what, if anything, was the relevance of that fact. No objection to the development on the ground of visual amenity had been advanced by the Council. Mr Lewis submitted that the Inspector was not required to and did not make any determination on that point: she was entitled simply to consider that, having regard to the residual visual amenity that would be preserved, the fall-back was not a sufficiently weighty consideration to outweigh the policy contravention involved in the proposed development. However, once it is acknowledged that the open space will be lost both under the development and under the fall-back, the preservation of the visual amenity of undeveloped land can only militate against the grant of permission on the appeal if it is considered to be a sufficient free-standing objection to development.  </p>

The absence of reference to an agreement in the written representations was of no significance in circumstances where the point was simply not in issue and there was, as the inspector noted, “no evidence to suggest that the open space which falls within the appeal site was not based on a formal agreement with the landowner”.  There was no inconsistency between the existence of a formal agreement and the applicants’ stated fall-back position that the land could or would be fenced under permitted development rights. There is nothing in the OSA about the form an agreement must take or the degree of formality required, and there is no reason in principle why a formal agreement stating that an area of land is available for public use should not be entered into on the basis that it is terminable at will so as to exclude the public thereafter.   </p>

I can see no basis, however, for the judge’s view that land cannot be open space to which the policy applies if the landowner has the power to exclude the public from it at will.  The policy protects against the loss of open space as a result of development.  When planning permission is sought for a development, the policy must be applied to the open space existing at the time of the decision whether to grant permission.  The effect of the OSA is that if at that time there exists a formal agreement stating that an area of land in private ownership is available for public/dual use, that area counts as open space and the policy applies to it.  The fact that the agreement can be terminated at will so as to exclude the public in the future does not take the land outside the scope of the policy.  It is true that if the agreement is subsequently terminated and the public are then excluded from the land, it will cease at that point to be open space to which the policy applies.  But that is for the future.  It does not affect the existing status of the land as open space or the present application of the policy to it.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Planning applications are to be determined in accordance with the development plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise:  s.38(6) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004.  Within that framework, policy CFS/12 fell to be considered as part of the development plan, whereas the fall-back position relied on by the applicants fell to be considered as a material consideration.  The inspector therefore had to decide first whether there would be a loss of open space in breach of policy CFS/12 and, if so, whether the fall-back position was to be given such weight as to justify the grant of planning permission notwithstanding the conflict with the development plan (subject to a further question, considered below in relation to the respondent’s notice, as to whether there was conflict with the development plan taken as a whole).  The inspector had the correct approach clearly in mind.  The case for the Welsh Ministers on the second ground of appeal is that the judge did not do so and that he conflated the assessment of the proposal against the development plan with the separate question of the weight to be given to the fall-back as a material consideration.  The paragraphs of his judgment to which criticism is particularly directed are [50], [53] and [55]. </p>

I am satisfied, however, that he fell into error in his detailed reasoning on the fall-back position.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The judge’s central reasons for holding that the inspector had failed to deal properly with the fall-back position are at [53] of his judgment.  He said first that “it was irrational for the Inspector to conclude on the one hand that the fall-back was made out but to conclude on the other hand that the development would result in a loss of open space in conflict with policy CFS/12”.  I read that as a restatement of reasoning considered under the first ground of appeal, i.e. that acceptance of the fall-back meant that the land was not open space within the policy because the landowner could exclude the public from it at will.  I have already explained why I regard that reasoning as erroneous but I do not think that the restatement of it involved the further error of conflating the fall-back with the question of compliance with the development plan.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The judge went on in the same paragraph to make a further finding of irrationality in the inspector’s conclusion that the development would result in an unacceptable loss of open space “in circumstances where the proposed development included formal designation of some play space and where the fall-back … would involve the entire loss of the existing informal provision and of the potential formal designation”.  There is force in the argument that that passage does not draw a sufficiently clear distinction between breach of policy CFS/12 and the question whether non-compliance with the development plan was outweighed by the fall-back as a material consideration.  More importantly, however, the weight to be given to the fall-back was a matter of planning judgment for the inspector.  In making that assessment in this case the inspector took into account that, although fencing the land would prevent public use of it, the land would still be devoid of built development and depending on the type of fence erected it would continue to make a contribution to visual amenity.  As to the “formal designation of some play space” under the proposed development (i.e. the equipped play area to be provided on adjoining land to satisfy the separate policy CFS/11) and the absence of that facility under the fall-back, the inspector evaluated the pros and cons of the facility at [13] of her decision.  In the circumstances it cannot be said, in my judgment, that the inspector failed to have regard to relevant considerations or that it was irrational for her to conclude that the fall-back did not outweigh the breach of the development plan. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">At [55] the judge accepted the submission for Renew that the inspector had erred in relation to the issue of visual amenity.  In my view the judge was wrong to find such an error.  As to [55(1)], I think it clear that the inspector took into account the preservation of visual amenity if the fall-back materialised simply as a factor affecting the weight to be given to the fall-back.  She was not treating any loss of visual amenity resulting from the proposed development as a substantive reason for refusing permission. As to [55(2)], I do not really understand the judge’s reasoning, but I disagree in any event with his concluding statement that “once it is acknowledged that the open space will be lost both under the development and under the fall-back, the preservation of the visual amenity of undeveloped land can only militate against the grant of permission on the appeal if it is considered to be a free-standing objection to development”.  It seems to me that residual visual amenity could lawfully be taken into account in assessing the weight to be given to the fall-back (including the loss of open space to which the fall-back would give rise) even though the objection to the development itself was not put on the basis of loss of visual amenity as a freestanding ground.  Ms Osmund-Smith reluctantly but in my view rightly accepted that visual amenity was a legally relevant consideration.  As to the point made by the judge in [55(3)], that falls for separate consideration under the third ground of appeal. </p>

It is submitted that since the applicants had already made the point about visual amenity themselves, procedural fairness did not require the inspector to raise it with them before she could rely on it in the decision.

In summary, the decision-maker should have regard to all of the provisions of the development plan that are relevant to the application under consideration; and where policies pull in different directions, in determining whether a proposal is in accordance with the plan the decision-maker has to make a judgment bearing in mind such factors as the importance of the policies which are complied with or infringed and the extent of such compliance or breach.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The essence of the case for Renew on the respondent’s notice is that the inspector failed to adopt the correct approach:  she failed to have regard to material considerations and failed to consider whether the development would be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole.  Attention is drawn to passages in the officer’s report to the Council’s planning committee which, it is submitted, showed that most of the relevant policies in the development plan were complied with and that many of them told in favour of the proposed development. The policies themselves were listed in paragraph 59 of the report.  Paragraph 60 referred to various policies on housing and sustainable development and stated that the development was considered to be “acceptable in principle subject to the following considerations”.  Those considerations, including the issues of open space, were set out in the following paragraphs.  The conclusions in paragraphs 92-94 were (as summarised at [4] above) to the effect that the development would provide a number of benefits, including benefits in terms of helping to address the shortfall in land supply and providing a beneficial use for under-used previously developed land, but there were a number of critical questions (including the question of adequate provision of open space) that were unresolved, which led to the recommendation that planning permission be refused.  It is submitted that the inspector, by contrast, failed to acknowledge that some policies favoured the proposed development and that she treated the identified conflict with policy CFS/12 as amounting in itself to a conflict with the development plan as a whole. </p>

In my view the judge was right to reject it.  The argument ignores the way the applicants’ case was put to the inspector and the limited issues that were raised before her.  The Council’s reason for refusal had been based on open space and play space issues which were plainly considered to give rise to a conflict with the development plan taken as a whole – an unsurprising outcome, given the evident importance of </p>

There was no suggestion in the applicants’ written representations that because other policies favoured the proposed development it should be found to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole even if there was a breach of policy CFS/12.  The arguments were all about the open space and play space policies themselves, the fall-back position and national guidance relating to a 5-year supply of housing land.  The inspector dealt expressly with all those arguments and stated in terms that she had had regard to all other matters raised.  It was implicit in her conclusions that she regarded the conflict with policy CFS/12 as sufficient to constitute a failure to accord with the development plan as a whole.  It was not necessary for her to spell this out or elaborate it so as to address an issue that had not been raised. </p>
