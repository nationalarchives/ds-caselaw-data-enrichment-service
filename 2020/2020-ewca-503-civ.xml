The pipeline ran from an offshore riser platform (“the platform”) located some 230 km east of Aberdeen to an onshore redelivery terminal and gas processing plant (“the terminal”) at Seal Sands, Teesside. It transported gas, not only for TGTL, but also for other shippers who concluded contracts with the CATS Parties.  </p>

From 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> October 2013 to 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> October 2018 (when the Agreement ended), TGTL was to pay a “Capacity Fee” which was to be calculated according to a formula. The Transportation Fee and subsequently the Capacity Fee were payable whether or not TGTL used the capacity reserved to it.

If they contracted for the sale of capacity to third parties (by way of a “Non-Capacity Gas” contract), the CATS Parties were required by clause 4.6 to provide TGTL with certain information about that contract, including its estimated period of life, the proposed points at which gas would enter and leave the pipeline, and a <span style="font-style:italic">bona fide</span> estimate of the aggregate quantity and composition of the Non-Capacity Gas in the system. Of particular importance for this appeal, the information to be provided to TGTL included “the maximum rate of delivery of Non-Capacity Gas at such point during the proposed period of transportation”. </p>

The purpose of this agreement, in broad terms, was to make provision for the allocation of gas to shippers on redelivery. Gas entered the pipeline with varying quality and composition at a number of entry points and was necessarily mingled within the pipeline. Arrangements therefore needed to be established to determine how the commingled gas being redelivered from the pipeline at the terminal should be allocated between the various shippers of which TGTL was only one. The arrangements set out in the TAA replaced allocation principles which, as between TGTL and the CATS Parties, had been contained in Schedule XIII to the Agreement, considered below. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The Agreement as originally entered into in 1990 included Schedule XIII which contained various “Allocation Principles”. These were to apply until such time as a formal Allocation Agreement was concluded between all users of the pipeline. This was eventually concluded in 1998 in the form of the TAA. As already noted, allocation was necessary because the gas entered the pipeline with varying quality and composition at a number of entry points from different fields and was necessarily commingled within the pipeline. Thus a shipper could not get back at redelivery the same gas or even gas of the same quality and composition as it had delivered into the pipeline. A mechanism was therefore needed to determine what each shipper would get back.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Schedule XIII obliged the CATS Operator to operate the allocation procedures “on a basis that is demonstrably fair and equitable to all CATS Fields” (i.e. to all shippers using the pipeline). Demonstrably fair arrangements were essential for at least two reasons: first, because each field was required to contribute towards the “Static Volume” of gas in the pipeline, that is to say the minimum volume of gas which was necessary to maintain the pipeline at the desired operating pressure, in circumstances where the composition of such gas varied from field to field so that a simple quantitative comparison would be inappropriate; and second, to ensure, for example, that a shipper delivering gas of higher quality into the pipeline which was then commingled with gas of lower quality would obtain back on redelivery an appropriate proportion of the commingled gas. It was therefore important that a shipper (such as TGTL) should know such matters as the quantity and composition of gas to be delivered into the pipeline by other shippers during any relevant period so that it could calculate by reference to the allocation principles what quantity and composition of gas would be returned to it at the redelivery point. Consequently the allocation principles, whether contained in Schedule XIII to the Agreement or (from 1998) the TAA, were fundamental to the operation of the pipeline from the outset.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The way in which Schedule XIII sought to achieve these objectives was through a series of formulae which used the Capacity Reservation Rate (i.e. the capacity reserved by TGTL) plus (for third party shippers) the concept of “Booked Capacity”.

The “Notified Rate” (applicable to TGTL fields) was defined as “the maximum rate of delivery (which … shall not exceed the Capacity Reservation Rate) of such Capacity Gas at the proposed Entry Point during the proposed period of Transportation Service”. In essence, having reserved the right to ship gas up to the maximum rate reserved (i.e. the Capacity Reservation Rate), TGTL was required to notify the CATS Parties how much of the capacity which it had reserved it intended to use to ship from any particular field.  </p>

This exceeded the capacity of the pipeline, which was 48 million cubic metres per day, and far exceeded the throughput for the years from 2013 onwards, which was in the range of 14 to 18 million cubic metres per day. In contrast, the DRCRs plus CRR for those years was in the range of approximately 17 to 22 million cubic metres per day. The relatively low level of reserved capacity and throughput in these later years reflects the fact that gas fields deplete over time so that it is to be expected that maximum throughput will occur in the early years of production from the field and will gradually reduce over the field’s life. </p>

It was a forward-looking maximum, looking at the contract period as a whole. A maximum rate could increase, if the TPA in question was amended, but by definition could not reduce. Absent such an increase in the maximum expected rate, the CATS Operator could not give a valid notice to amend the clause 4.6(a)(vii) information, either under clause 4.6(b) in its original form or under its amended form where, in any event, a clause 4.6(b) notice could only be given in response to a request by TGTL.  </p>

Under such a cost share regime, it could be expected that those current costs would be divided amongst those actively using the facility during the period in which those costs were incurred and in proportion to their usage of the facility, and not on the basis of what they might have been shipping many years, and in some cases decades, earlier.”  </p>

The above analysis of the CRTA is further supported by the way in which the relevant concepts were expressed through the process of amendment. The phrase 'maximum rates of delivery of Non-Capacity Gas notified by the CATS Operator pursuant to clause 4.6(a)(vii)' was, in the unamended CRTA, adopted as the definition of 'Booked Capacities'. The contractual purpose of the phrase 'Booked Capacities' was in determining matters of allocation, under Schedule XIII. Upon amendment in 1998, Schedule XIII was deleted, the allocation provisions being thereafter found in the TAA, and the term 'Booked Capacity' was defined in the TAA as 'the aggregate of all the Firm Shipper Capacities'. The 'Firm Shipper Capacities' are the DRCRs for each shipper, as set out in Schedule VII to the TAA, as updated from time to time in accordance with clause 10.8 (which included a provision for the amendment of Schedule VII no more frequently than quarterly). Of course, the definitions in Schedule XIII and in the TAA never co-existed, and cannot properly be used to cross-define terms. </p>

In providing that what should be notified was the 'maximum rate of delivery' during the proposed period of transportation under a newly-entered into TPA, the parties were not seeking to identify a figure which would be the highest at any point during that period, which would then be the figure set in stone for the purposes of the CATS Capacity, absent a variation of the TPA. Instead, I consider that what was being sought was the relevant DRCR figure. In this regard, it is significant that in the TPAs, the DRCR was regularly referred to as the 'maximum rate' of reserved capacity. While I was not shown any transportation agreement pre-dating the conclusion of the CRTA in 1990, and thus was not shown any definition of a DRCR in terms of a 'maximum rate' which formed part of the background matrix to the contract as initially concluded, this usage was contained in almost all the TPAs, including the very first which dates from January 1991. I considered that it was very probable that in entering into the CRTA the parties had had such a way of referring to a DRCR in mind. In any event this type of definition of DRCRs was used in a number of other TPAs dating from the period between 1991 and 1998, and these can, I consider, be taken into account as part of the background known or taken to be known to the parties, when construing the CRTA as amended in 1998.  </p>

The second such error was to allow his view that the Capacity Fee provided for a cost sharing regime based on usage of the pipeline to drive his construction of the Agreement.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">For the CATS Parties Mr Tim Lord QC supported the judge’s reasoning. He emphasised that the Agreement should be viewed as a whole and that it was intended to operate for over 20 years before the Capacity Fee formula even became relevant. Viewing the contract as a whole it was plain that the language used in clause 4.6(a)(vii) which was incorporated into the definition of “CATS Capacity”, as well as the term “CATS Capacity” itself, was used elsewhere to refer to the up to date figure for the capacity reserved by a third-party shipper and not to whatever had been the maximum rate applicable during the whole period covered by a TPA which, by the time it was necessary to calculate the Capacity Fee payable by TGTL, was likely to be very out of date. Mr Lord emphasised that the definition of “CATS Capacity” referred not only to a notice given pursuant to clause 4.6(a)(vii), but was also expressly “subject to any changes notified pursuant to Clause 4.6(b)(i)”, while clause 4.6(b)(ii) required regular notification of the CATS Capacity to TGTL. All that, said Mr Lord, showed that third party shippers’ contribution to CATS Capacity was an up to date figure representing the capacity actually booked by them during any given Contract Year. So too did the express recognition in clause 4.6(c) that the information provided pursuant to paragraph (a) of the clause was provided “for operational and planning purposes only”. That would be so if the information to be provided was an up-to-date figure, but not if what was required was a figure which might be many years out of date. </p>

That is consistent with the language of the clause and, so far, no other “proposed period of transportation” is referred to.

The provision for changes to be notified does not exclude “the maximum rate of delivery” referred to in paragraph (vii) and thus appears to contemplate that this figure may change, and may do so often.

The CRR component of “CATS Capacity” either would not change or, if it did, TGTL would already know about the change. The changes to CATS Capacity contemplated by the clause about which TGTL needed to be notified must therefore refer to changes in the maximum rates notified under clause 4.6(a)(vii). While it can be accepted that the CATS Capacity figure would increase during the early years of the contract as new contracts were concluded with third party shippers, this would be a finite process due to the limited number of gas fields physically capable of connecting to the pipeline. Any suggestion that quarterly changes would or might continue throughout the period of the Agreement seems inconsistent with TGTL’s case.  </p>

Mr Thanki suggested that TGTL would need to know both the maximum rate of delivery under each TPA and also the overall CATS Capacity figure for the purpose of calculating the Capacity Fee, but notably did not suggest any other reason why TGTL would need to know the maximum rate of delivery under each TPA. However, I would not regard calculation of the Capacity Fee as an operational or planning purpose and, in any event, the suggestion begs the question why TGTL would need this information during the first 20 years of the operation of the Agreement before the Capacity Fee regime applied. If we start from the premise, stated in clause 4.6(c), that information about the CATS Capacity for each ensuing Contract Year was indeed required for operational and planning purposes, and then ask what kind of information would be useful to TGTL for such purposes, the answer must be that current up-to-date information will be useful whereas historical information based on quantities shipped in the past, and in some cases many years ago, will be of no real use at all. </p>

That objective would be achieved if the CATS Parties’ construction of “CATS Capacity” is correct, but not if TGTL is correct in its submission that third party shippers’ contribution to the ascertainment of “CATS Capacity” depended on historic and out of date maximum rates which (as time went by) were likely to be far in excess of capacity which those shippers had actually booked at the relevant time. That would be liable to result in some shippers being allocated a share of the available capacity out of proportion to the capacity which they had actually reserved merely because of an outdated maximum rate in their TPA. This would benefit those shippers and would unfairly prejudice TGTL. TGTL seeks to meet this point by submitting that this was the deal which the parties had struck but, given the obvious purpose of clause 12, I find that submission unconvincing. </p>

Thus abandonment could only occur at the earliest 15 years after commencement of operations, by which time it was to be expected that the fields would be substantially depleted so that throughput (and thus booked capacity) would be substantially lower than in the initial years of operation. In the event of such abandonment, provision was made for the CATS Parties to sell the abandoned facilities to users of the pipeline (including TGTL). Those users, defined as “Relevant Parties”, were those having a contract with the CATS Parties providing either for a capacity reservation or for the transportation of gas “on a firm basis”. Clause 22.3(b)(ii) provided that ownership of the abandoned facilities was to be allocated among Relevant Parties “pro rata to their proportionate shares of the CATS Capacity on the date of expiry of the notice” of abandonment. </p>

As Mr Lord pointed out, this was very much the tail end of the overall contract period. During the first 20 years of operation, TGTL was to pay a fixed “Transportation Fee”, initially at a high level and, from 2008, at a reduced level. Thus the payments to be made by TGTL corresponded, broadly speaking, to an initial period when production from the gas fields could be expected to be at its highest level, an intermediate period when production would begin to reduce, and a final period as the fields were depleted when payment (i.e. the Capacity Fee) was to be on a cost sharing basis. </p>

It should be noted, however, that if TGTL’s construction were correct, the Capacity Fee would not operate unfairly to TGTL but, on the contrary, would cast by far the greater burden of the costs of operating the pipeline on to CATS Parties by reference to outdated historic maximum rates of delivery of gas into the pipeline.

It was to be expected, therefore, that the highest rates of capacity reservation (or, in the language of the TPAs, the maximum DRCRs) would be in the early years, and would reduce thereafter. Thus a construction of the Capacity Fee payment obligation based upon maximum figures representing capacity booked by third party shippers during the early years of the contract would on the face of things produce a distorted figure by reference to which to share the cost of the pipeline. </p>

Moreover, a construction of “CATS Capacity” which results (as TGTL’s construction does) in a figure substantially in excess of the actual capacity of the pipeline and far in excess of the usage of the pipeline which would have been expected during the final years of the CRTA when the Capacity Fee was payable makes very little sense. </p>

In my judgment, for the reasons which I have given, the CATS Parties’ construction of the Capacity Fee provision makes better sense of the contract, including the terms of clause 4.6, and is to be preferred. Although the language is not entirely free from difficulty on either party’s construction of the contract, I consider that the judge was right to accept the construction proposed by the CATS Parties.

These judgments will, of course, be published. </p>
