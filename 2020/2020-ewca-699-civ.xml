In his judgment dated 2 August 2019 ([2019] EWHC 2071 (Ch)) the Judge also held that, if the claim had not been struck out, he would have granted reverse summary judgment dismissing part (but not all) of the claim on the ground that it was barred by two Deeds of Indemnity signed by the Claimant. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The Claimant issued the present claim on 25 September 2018. In his original Particulars of Claim he alleged that, in truth, the payments made by the Defendant to Hyman Sofer between 2006 and 2016 were gifts rather than loans, and were made in breach of the prohibition in clause M1(1). He sought (among other things) a declaration to that effect, together with orders that the Defendant should reinstate the Puyol Trust and be removed as trustee. It should be made clear that it is no part of the Claimant’s case that the Defendant benefitted from the breaches of trust he alleges. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The Defendant responded to the claim on 3 December 2018 by applying to strike it out, alternatively for summary judgment dismissing it. The strike out application was made on the basis that the Puyol Trust deed contains a trustee exoneration clause which provided a complete answer to the claim, in circumstances where the Particulars of Claim contained no properly pleaded allegation of dishonest breach of trust. The application was supported by witness statements by Nigel West (the Defendant’s solicitor) and Andrew Bayles (a director and General Counsel of the Defendant since January 2016). Their evidence was that the payments were intended to be, and were in fact, loans, and that the Defendant believed that it was acting in the best interests of the beneficiaries. Neither of them was involved in the payments at the time, however, and so their evidence was hearsay.   </p>

For example, as counsel for the Claimant himself acknowledged, in paragraph 29(6) what is now the Claimant’s primary case (deliberate and conscious breach of trust) is pleaded as the alternative, while what is now the Claimant’s alternative case (reckless indifference) is pleaded first. What matters for present purposes, however, is not the felicity of the drafting, but whether as a matter of substance it pleads sufficient particulars to disclose a case of dishonesty. </p>

It was, of course, open to the defendants to seek further particulars of that pleading of knowledge, and if they had not been provided it may be that the defendants could have proceeded to seek some sanction. But in the present case, it has not been asserted that the defendants were unaware of the plaintiffs’ case against them and, as I have said, they have at no time sought to have that knowledge particularised in a way which could lead to the striking out of the action.”    </p>

First, he submitted that the Judge was wrong to say that only sub-paragraph (viii) of paragraph 30 was directed to limb (ii). The Claimant relied upon all the facts pleaded as supporting not only his case that the Defendant had committed deliberate breaches of trust, but also his case that the Defendant had done so with one of the three states of mind identified in limb (ii). The Claimant’s case was one of inference, and he relied upon the totality of the particulars as permitting that inference to be drawn. This included, for example, such matters as the fact that the payments were really gifts, the number of the payments, the period over which they were made and the fact that a very large total sum was paid which amounted to the bulk of the Trusts’ assets. Those matters supported the Claimant’s case that the Defendant either knew that the payments were contrary to the interests of beneficiaries or was recklessly indifferent to the interests of the beneficiaries or was wholly unreasonable in believing that they were in the interests of the beneficiaries. </p>

I do not accept this submission. Although I agree that the statement of case is not as clear as it preferably should be, it is apparent that the Claimant advances each of the three cases identified in limb (ii) of <span style="font-style:italic">Fattal v Walbrook</span> in the alternative. Particulars which support case (c) may not support case (b) let alone case (a).

I do not accept this submission. Paragraph 8 of the Particulars of Claim alleges that the Trusts were “designed and intended to allow Hyman Sofer to deal with and enjoy his assets outside of the jurisdiction of Australia whilst not appearing to have any interest in or entitlement to or ability to benefit from the same”. As the Judge recorded at [22], counsel for the Claimant made it clear before the Judge, as he did again before this Court, that the Claimant is not alleging that the Trusts were shams. I do not see that the pleaded allegation is inconsistent with the Claimant’s case on dishonesty or impacts on the particulars which the Claimant has given. Nor is the Claimant’s acceptance that some of the money was ultimately received by other beneficiaries or the fact that in some cases purposes for the payments were recorded. (I would add that, as I read his witness statement, the Claimant denies receiving the payment he is recorded as having received.) Moreover, I do not accept that the exercise of comparing the Claimant’s statement of case with the evidence is a legitimate one. The application to strike out was based on CPR rule 3.4(2)(a), which excludes consideration of the evidence. Although it is true that the Claimant seeks permission to amend the Particulars of Claim, the only basis upon which the application is resisted is that the amended statement of case would also be strikable. There is no application for summary judgment dismissing the whole claim as having no real prospect of success on the facts. </p>

Thus some of the payments were received and kept by Hyman Sofer, whereas others were remitted to other beneficiaries; and some payments were made before Hyman Sofer was alleged to have suffered from dementia, whereas others were made after. As I understood it, counsel’s submission was that the Particulars of Claim needed to address each payment, or at least each category of payments, separately; and in the case of payments remitted to other beneficiaries, the Claimant needed specifically to set out the facts relied upon as showing that the Defendant had the relevant state of mind in relation to those payments. I do not accept these submissions. At this stage the Particulars of Claim does not need to condescend to that level of detail in order to plead a sustainable case of dishonesty. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Fifthly, counsel for the Defendant pointed out that Hyman Sofer was himself a beneficiary under the Trusts. Accordingly, payments made to Hyman Sofer were necessarily in the interests of one of the beneficiaries. Furthermore, it is often the case that trustees exercising their powers are called on to make decisions which favour one beneficiary (or class of beneficiaries) over another. It followed, counsel submitted, that the Defendant’s decisions to pay Hyman Sofer could not fall within any of three cases in limb (ii) of <span style="font-style:italic">Fattal v Walbrook</span>. I do not accept that this is necessarily so. The fact that Hyman Sofer was a beneficiary did not absolve the Defendant from considering the position of other beneficiaries. Still less did it mean that the Defendant was free to make gifts to Hyman Sofer that it was prohibited from making and which consumed the bulk of the Trusts’ assets, thereby inevitably prejudicing the prospects of other beneficiaries benefitting. In those circumstances it seems to me that the Claimant has a sustainable case that falls within at least (c) if not (b) or (a).   </p>

In my judgment, as a matter of construction, the indemnity is given in respect of payments made by the defendant which the defendant asserts are loans. It is not necessary that they should actually be loans. That is simply their description in the document. The reason for having the indemnity is precisely in case the payment turns out to be unlawful or a breach of trust in some way. To construe the terms of the indemnity as restricted only to the case where the payments concerned ultimately turn out to have been loans (and nothing else) would significantly reduce the width, and therefore the value to the defendant, of the indemnity. That would be uncommercial.  </p>

Clause 6 of the Deeds of Indemnity provides that the Claimant and others agree to indemnify the Defendant in respect of claims etc “arising out of the agreement of [the Defendant] to advance the Existing Loans and the New Loans”. I cannot see that the indemnity bites if the Defendant did not advance any loans to Hyman Sofer pursuant to clause D3(3), but instead made gifts to him which were prohibited by clause M1(1). I agree that construing the indemnity as being limited to payments which were indeed loans means that it has less width than construing it as extending to payments which purported to be loans, but were in fact gifts; but I do not see why this means that such an interpretation is “uncommercial” or why it should be presumed that the Claimant agreed to the wider indemnity. Furthermore, contrary to the submission of counsel for the Defendant, the fact that the trustee exoneration clause would protect the Defendant from liability for non-dishonest breaches of trust is neither here nor there.  </p>

There can be no doubt in the present case that the parties to the deeds of indemnity shared the assumption at that time that the payments to Hyman Sofer were loans rather than advances. On the evidence (which, as I have already said, on this application I am not entitled to reject) the defendant was advised and intended to make, and thought it was making, loans: see Mr Bayles’s first witness statement at [24][28]. Although the claimant now takes a different view, at the time he executed the deeds he had not seen the trust documents or the financial statements, and went along with the assumption that the payments were as they were described in the documents. It is only later that he has come to believe that they were not loans at all: see his witness statement at [43]-[47].

On the basis of that shared assumption at the time, the defendant thereafter acted to its detriment in paying over a further AUS$9.5 million to Hyman Sofer. That seems to me to be a classic case of estoppel by convention. In my judgment, having allowed the defendant to act to its detriment on the faith of the assumption that the payments were loans, the claimant is now estopped from asserting otherwise in bringing this claim for breach of trust.” </p>
