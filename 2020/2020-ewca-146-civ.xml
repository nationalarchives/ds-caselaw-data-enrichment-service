By his order the judge declared that the Appellant’s detention by the Secretary of State (“the Respondent”) between 24 January and 24 February 2016 (inclusive) was unlawful. He awarded the Appellant £1 nominal damages and otherwise dismissed the claim. It was ordered that the Respondent should pay 50% of the costs of the claim to be assessed (if not agreed). The judge refused permission to appeal. Permission was granted, however, by Singh LJ by his order of 13 May 2019. </p>

Those issues arise under five grounds of appeal (see below). </p>

He did not leave the United Kingdom after his visa expired and on 19 January 2016 he was encountered at Belfast docks having travelled on a ferry from Scotland with the apparent aim of continuing to the Republic of Ireland. He had a photocopy of his passport on which the date of expiry of his visa had been altered so as to make it appear it was still in force. He was however identified as an overstayer and was taken into immigration detention under paragraph 17(1) of and schedule 2 to the Immigration Act 1971 on the same day. He was detained initially in Larne House, which is a short term holding facility (STHF). On 23 January he was transferred to Brook House, an immigration removal centre at Gatwick airport. He claimed asylum (the date when he first made that claim is in dispute) and on 4 February he was moved to Harmondsworth Immigration Removal Centre. On 5 </p>

On arrival at each of these three detention centres the Claimant was seen by a staff nurse but not by a doctor though he did later see a doctor at his own request on 11 February at Harmondsworth. His full asylum interview had been initially fixed for 16 February but it was deferred at his own request to 24 February. On 22 February the Claimant's current solicitors Duncan Lewis wrote to the Defendant and, among other things, requested a further postponement of the full asylum interview. This request was declined but, these proceedings having been started on 23 February, Ouseley J made an interim without notice order that the Defendant be restrained from conducting the substantive asylum interview until at least 9 March. On the 24 February the Claimant was released from detention. His asylum interview took place on 5 July. He was given notice that the claim to asylum had been refused on 26 July 2016. He appealed to the First-tier Tribunal and his appeal was allowed in September 2017 following which he was given leave to remain for five years.” </p>

However, the judge found that even if the Respondent had complied with Rule 34 in the later periods at Brook House and Harmondsworth, the Appellant would still have been detained. He found further that there was nothing arising under the Respondent’s detention policy, in cases where asylum is claimed on sexual orientation grounds, that would have engaged an obligation to release the Appellant from detention earlier than he was. The judge also held that there was no basis for finding that the Respondent’s detention had infringed the <span style="font-style:italic">Hardial Singh</span> principles (<span style="font-style:italic">R v Governor of Durham Prison, ex p. Hardial Singh </span>[1984] 1 WLR 704). In view of the finding that the Appellant would have been detained in any event, even if there had been full compliance with Rule 34, the judge awarded nominal damages only for the wrongful detention that had occurred. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In a similar way, Mr Brown argues that, when one reads the paragraphs of Annex B to the DSO (quoted above), relating to health screening and doctors’ appointments as quoted above, they are intended to apply to IRCs only. The initial reference in the section on “2 Hour Health Screening” is to “arrival at a IRC …” (not at an RSTHF). The subsequent reference to “Appointment with Doctor” flows from that, and refers to the assessment of need for a doctor’s appointment and/or the offer of such an appointment by the healthcare professional responsible for the initial screening, i.e. at an IRC. There is then reference to Rule 35 which would only apply at an IRC and not to an STHF. Accordingly, it is argued, these provisions of the policy did not apply to Larne House.  </p>

She submits that the DSO is designed to provide for basic standards applicable to all forms of immigration detention. To find otherwise, would mean that there was no policy in force about health assessment at STHFs at all, which it should not be assumed was what the Respondent intended. Therefore, the document’s provisions as to healthcare should be treated as applicable to all the identified types of institution. </p>

She stressed to him that it was important to mention that he was feeling depressed.  </p>

Entries in the computerised record disclosed by the Defendant include a request on 19 February to see a nurse timed at 10.45 with, in the box for "Details", the words "Rule 35". At the foot of this entry also dated 19 February and timed at 16.32 there is "Request completed". It is unclear what that means and there is nothing in the clinical notes to suggest that he was actually seen on that day by a nurse or a doctor. The Defendant does not suggest that he was. Curiously Ms Maher in her witness statement says that her first attendance on the client was on 22 February and she does not refer to otherwise communicating with him on 19 February, that he reported that he felt depressed or that she told him to request a Rule 35 assessment. The Claimant himself in his witness statement does not say anything more than that he requested a Rule 35 assessment. In particular he does not say that he explained why he wanted the assessment namely that he was depressed. The computerised record also has an entry which states that the Claimant requested to see a doctor at 14.38 on 20 February and this is noted as "request completed" at 14.47 on 22 February. Again however there is nothing in the clinical notes to correspond to this entry. It is difficult to know what to make of these apparent discrepancies between different parts of the disclosed records. It seems likely that he was seen by someone in the healthcare department on 22 February but for some reason the relevant clinical note has not been located or disclosed otherwise it is difficult to see what the entry on that day could mean. On the other hand in relation to the request for a Rule 35 assessment it seems unlikely that the Claimant was seen on the very same day.

The position is different following receipt of the letter from Duncan Lewis on 22 February because reasons were given but as he was released only two days later I do not have the basis for saying that that period of delay disclosed public law error material to the continued detention.

In my view, while it may have been better to say something about the nature of the asylum claim put forward at the screening interview, it was not necessary for the officer completing a detention review immediately after it to repeat what he has recorded in the initial registration form. It is clear from the references to this being a late claim for asylum made only after the Claimant had been detained and served with removal directions that his claim was not at that point considered genuine. In my judgment that was a perfectly reasonable view to take on the facts as they then appeared which included of course the completely different explanation given when he was initially interviewed at Larne House as to why he had overstayed. Indeed Parliament in section 8 of the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004 required officers determining whether to believe a statement made by or on behalf of a person making an asylum or human rights claim to take account of the failure to make the claim before being notified of an immigration decision or before being arrested under immigration powers, unless the person had no reasonable opportunity to do so.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Brown argues that given the material disclosed at the screening interview there was nothing to require a change in the detention decision. The lateness of the claim and the inconsistency of the claim in outline with what the Appellant had said on initial apprehension gave good cause for scepticism. There were other inconsistencies about what had happened to the Appellant’s passport: was it lost or was locked away at his home in Manchester. The copy of it had also been altered so as to appear to be showing continuing leave to remain. The high risk of absconding was highly relevant. Further, the grounds for the asylum claim as outlined did not disclose any reasons for fearing persecution on Convention grounds: this was not a claim of state persecution or persecution from non-state agents against whom there was inadequate protection. In this respect, Mr Brown referred to the judgment of Lord Rodger of Earlsferry in the Supreme Court in <span style="font-style:italic">R (HJ Iran) v Secretary of State for the Home Department</span> [2010 UKSC 31 at [82], as follows:  </p>

When an applicant applies for asylum on the ground of a well-founded fear of persecution because he is gay, the tribunal must first ask itself whether it is satisfied on the evidence that he is gay, or that he would be treated as gay by potential persecutors in his country of nationality. If so, the tribunal must then ask itself whether it is satisfied on the available evidence that gay people who lived openly would be liable to persecution in the applicant’s country of nationality. If so, the tribunal must go on to consider what the individual applicant would do if he were returned to that country. If the applicant would in fact live openly and thereby be exposed to a real risk of persecution, then he has a well-founded fear of persecution—even if he could avoid the risk by living “discreetly”. If, on the other hand, the tribunal concludes that the applicant would in fact live discreetly and so avoid persecution, it must go on to ask itself why he would do so. If the tribunal concludes that the applicant would choose to live discreetly simply because that was how he himself would wish to live, or because of social pressures, e g, not wanting to distress his parents or embarrass his friends, then his application should be rejected. Social pressures of that kind do not amount to persecution and the Convention does not offer protection against them. Such a person has no well-founded fear of persecution because, for reasons that have nothing to do with any fear of persecution, he himself chooses to adopt a way of life which means that he is not in fact liable to be persecuted because he is gay.” </p>

Further, he submits that it would not have been permissible for the officer to scrutinise or question the substantive asylum claim (e.g. by asking why it had been made so late in the day) as that could expose the Appellant to giving answers prejudicial to the claim when he was without the legal representation to which he would be entitled at the full interview. </p>

In view of a lengthy failure to comply with immigration law requirements, the risk of absconding was real and had to be balanced against an assessment of the time to process the asylum claim. A full asylum interview was planned for 11 February and the judge found (paragraph 105) there was no additional information forthcoming after the screening interview until the “letter before action” of 22 February 2016.

It was slightly more complicated than one where there was no doubt about the fact that the Claimant was gay; however the issues of fact were likely to be dependent simply on the credibility of the Claimant at an interview designed to probe the consistency and reliability of his account while giving him every opportunity to articulate matters in his own way without necessarily using labels familiar to Western ears, on which the Asylum Policy Instruction I have referred to gives valuable guidance to interviewers.

As to the timescale for resolution of the claim the full asylum interview had been arranged for 16 February (2 ½ weeks after what I have found to be the first notification of a claim to asylum) and then deferred at the Claimant's request. He was released before the interview was conducted. It must be inherent in the proper approach that the first step, in following the <span style="font-style:italic">Hardial Singh</span> principles as set out in chapter 55.1.4.1 of the EIG, is to consider the removability of a detained person in the period up to that interview because that will be the time when it will be expected either that the claim is a good one in which case he will be granted asylum and released or it is a bad one and only then, if an appeal is indicated, will it be necessary to consider in the light of this development whether detention should be maintained pending the exhaustion of that process. It seems to me wrong to require the Secretary of State to assume in all cases that the claim will be refused and that an appeal will follow so that in applying the third <span style="font-style:italic">Hardial Singh</span> principle the SSHD must act on the assumption that the earliest the person could be removed was only after whatever should be considered the likely timescale for the exhaustion of all possible avenues of appeal and judicial review (including further appeals from first instance judgments). Indeed there is a tension between on the one hand the Claimant's case that his claim for asylum as a gay man from Pakistan was enough in itself to treat him as irremovable in a reasonable time (which presupposes that the facts asserted are true) and the assumption that the claim will be refused requiring an appeal (which presupposes that following the full interview the Defendant concludes that the facts are untrue or insufficient to justify the claim for asylum)<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="2">

In my judgment this case is very far removed from those cases where an overstayer or illegal entrant has been detained for many months ultimately in a sort of limbo because all avenues which might lead to successful removal appear to have closed. The simple making of a claim for asylum which might or might not on investigation prove to be a good one and, if rejected, might (but might not) then prompt an appeal process which might or might not succeed (statistics referred to in <span style="font-style:italic">Hossain</span> show many are not pursued and most fail) cannot in my view, at a time before the expiry of the target of 28 days for making a decision on such a claim and before the full interview has taken place, prevent the Defendant from holding the view that the Claimant may be removed in a reasonable time.” </p>

Until 5 February 2016, the only obstacle to removal that was apparent was the need for a travel document. Until very shortly before release there was no ground that would have been apparent to the Respondent for thinking that she would not be able to effect removal within a reasonable time.

This procedural rule exists because the Administrative Court seeks to make speedy decisions auditing the legality of decision making by public bodies.  The Administrative Court will not be able to do that if its lists are filled with damages claims.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">As a matter of procedural history this judicial review claim commenced on 23 February 2016 with challenges: to the Respondent’s proposal that the substantive asylum interview of the Claimant take place before a report had been obtained pursuant to Rule 35 of the Detention Centre Rules 2001; and to the detention of the Claimant.  Challenges to the legality of continuing detention are properly brought in the Administrative Court, and this claim was rightly commenced in the Administrative Court.  However, following the grant of urgent interim relief by Ouseley J. which restrained the Respondent from carrying out the substantive asylum interview until a particular date, the appellant was released on 24 February 2016.  This was the day after the claim commenced.  Thereafter the delayed substantive asylum interview took place and the remaining issue between the parties was the claim for damages for wrongful detention.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It is right to record that in this case the Appellant claimed a declaration that his past detention was unlawful and a declaration that the Respondent’s policies had not been applied to him so that his detention was unlawful.  However, in reality the claim for declarations added nothing to the claim for damages.  This is shown by the fact that at </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The overriding objective requires that cases are allotted an appropriate share of the court’s resources, see CPR Part 1.1(2)(e).  Parties are required to help the court to further the overriding objective, see CPR Part 1.3.  Therefore, once the appellant had been released from detention both parties should have addressed their minds to the issue of whether the claim should have been transferred either to the Queen’s Bench Division or the County Court.  There would also have been many advantages in such a transfer for both the Appellant and Respondent.  So far as the Appellant is concerned there would have been no need to obtain permission to bring the claim, and there were contested issues about the grant of permission to apply for judicial review in this case, because there would have been unfettered access to the Queen’s Bench Division or County Court.  There would have been a process for calling witnesses and for cross examination.  This would have meant that the Appellant could give oral evidence in support of his case that he had disclosed the fact that he was depressed to the nurse at Larne House Short Term Holding Facility.  As it was the judge rejected this evidence contained in a witness statement without hearing the claimant crossexamined because of the inconsistency of the Appellant’s evidence with the contemporaneous notes of the examination.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">From the point of view of the Respondent there would have been statements of case and proper case management of the claim, which would have given clarity to the case being made.  There would have been formal disclosure of documents and this might have increased the prospects of identifying the fact that the parties were relying on the wrong version of policy DSO 6/2013 at the trial, see paragraph 11 of the judgment of McCombe LJ.  A transfer to the Queen’s Bench Division or County Court would also have made matters easier for the trial judge who would have had the benefit of assessing what had happened after hearing live evidence from witnesses.  It was apparent from the judgment that the judge was well aware of the difficulties caused by the fact that he had not heard oral evidence, see paragraphs 49 and 61 of the judgment below. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In the final event the Respondent did make an application to transfer the case to the Queen’s Bench Division or County Court but this was just before the trial was to take place.  Granting the application at that late stage would have caused an adjournment of the trial, causing delays for the parties and for other court users, and the application was therefore rightly refused.  It is hoped that in the future all parties should give timely consideration to the issue of transfer from the Administrative Court when, as often happens in these cases, issues of continuing detention have been resolved. </p>
