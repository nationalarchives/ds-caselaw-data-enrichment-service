	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">At the start of the proceedings, the composition of the family was as follows. The two appellants, a woman, hereafter referred to as SS, and a man, DB, started a relationship in August 2018 at a point when each was looking after children from previous relationships. SS has two daughters, E, now aged ten, and S, who is seven. DB also has two children, a girl, T, aged nine, and a boy, A, who is also seven. Tragically, the mother of T and A took her own life in June 2018. At that point, in addition to his own children, DB was also looking after their mother’s older child, X, who is now aged twelve.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Following the breakdown of SS’s relationship with the girls’ father, involving arguments between the adults which led to the police being called, there were proceedings for child arrangements orders about contact between the girls and their father. There was, however, no involvement between the family and social services. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In contrast, the three children for whom DB was caring were involved with social services at various stages. There were referrals concerning X as a baby when he was in the care of his mother and father. After that relationship ended, the mother started a relationship with DB in 2010 which continued until 2015 and led to the birth of T and A. During that period, social services received a number of reports about concerns for the care of the children. In 2015, DB was arrested and subsequently convicted for an assault on the children’s mother. After the breakdown of that relationship, the three children, X, T and A, lived initially with their mother, but social services became involved again following concerns about the mother’s care of the children. In January 2016, following an alleged incident of rough treatment, the three children were made subject to police protection orders and placed with DB. Subsequently, a child arrangements order was made for all three children to live with DB, with a supervision order in favour of the local authority for a period of 12 months. Once that order came to an end in November 2017, the local authority closed the case. </p>

Both children were identified as having similar clinical difficulties, including autistic spectrum features and learning and communication delay. On two occasions in 2016, T was observed to have hurt herself at school, on one occasion hitting her hand “quite hard” and on another occasion “biting her arm all morning”. In February 2018, social services had become involved again after DB had reported concerns about sexualised behaviour between X and T. As a result, the children were made subject to child in need plans. In June 2018, as mentioned above, the mother of T and A died. </p>

On 14 October 2019, there was an incident at school when T was reported as pulling her tie round her neck tightly. There were further incidents at school when T was reported to have harmed herself. On 17 October 2019, A was noted at school to have a mark on his ear which he initially alleged had been caused by SS biting him. Subsequently, however, A said that T had inflicted the injury. On 31 October 2019, T attended an initial appointment with CAMHS where staff noted that she had marks on her neck and jaw. T said that she had hurt herself and gestured toward her neck with a fist. </p>

Asked about the bruising, she replied “mum and dad, they know about it”. DB was advised to take her the hospital, but in the event did not do so until the following day. During this period, SS said text messages to DB in which she appeared to discourage him from taking T to hospital, saying amongst other things “it took months to get out of her head at the hospital wasn’t a fun place to be and she herself more trying to get there I don’t want us all to go through that again” and “the bruises aren’t anywhere near as bad as they used to be and we are doing all we can already”. </p>

In a subsequent report, the registrar recorded DB’s explanation that T had harmed herself and expressed the view that it was developmentally possible for T to have inflicted the injuries herself. On reviewing the case a few days later, however, a consultant paediatrician at the hospital took a different view. He was concerned about the absence of any detailed explanation as to how the injuries had been inflicted and concluded that there should be a full assessment. It was his opinion that the injuries “are beyond doubt inflicted injuries representing a significant sustained serious assault”. As a result, social services and the police were notified and, following a strategy meeting, DB and SS were arrested and the children removed under a police protection order. Subsequently, on 11 November 2019, DB and SS signed an agreement for the accommodation of the children under s.20 of the Children Act 1989 and the children were placed in two foster care placements, with X, T and S in one placement and E and S in the other.  </p>

It was a hybrid hearing in accordance with the procedures which have been adopted as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. The hearing ran into a number of difficulties including technical problems and issues about disclosure of transcripts and other documents. As a result, after seven days the hearing was adjourned part-heard. At that point, the judge discharged the interim care orders with regard to SS’s children, E and S. The local authority’s appeal against that decision was allowed by this Court and the children remained in foster care. Further difficulties arose when the hearing before the judge resumed in August and as a result the hearing was adjourned again. After another false start on 4 September, the hearing finally resumed on 21 September and eventually concluded after a total of fifteen days. Judgment was reserved and handed down on 9 October. In his judgment, the judge made a number of findings against DB and SS which I shall consider below. After judgment, further case management directions were made, including an expert assessment by a child psychologist, with a view to a final welfare hearing which was listed before the judge for five days on 14 December 2020. An application by DB and SS for permission to appeal against the findings was refused. </p>

He then recited the findings sought by the local authority and set out the legal principles comprehensively. After that, he summarised in considerable detail the written and oral evidence, again adopting a chronological approach. He recorded relevant extracts from T’s school records in Yorkshire and details of her hospital attendances in Yorkshire in 2019. He summarised the ABE interviews of the children, noting the comments made by T about self-harming in her first interview and by the other children describing how DB and SS used the “naughty step” as a disciplinary method, including on occasions punishing T for harming herself. He recorded how A had said during his interview that it was DB who had hurt T’s face. He summarised T’s second ABE interview in which she had repeated the allegation made to her foster carer that the injuries had been inflicted by SS. At paragraph 101 of the judgment, he noted some criticisms of the way in which T’s second ABE interview was conducted. </p>

Children who are self-harming from a degree of psychological stress (for e.g. after a bereavement) will again do this in any area (school or home) and will settle once the cause of the distress is dealt with. Having considered the reports of the two incidents at school [in 2016] and the lack of self-harming behaviour in foster care she suggested that if T has been self-harming that this is more likely to be a response to some emotional or psychological distress which has now resolved. She recommended a psychological assessment, but none has been obtained.” </p>

Asked if T had hated SS he had replied “not all the time” but he accepted that T wanted to split them up. In her evidence, SS described having a “bumpy start” with T and that T had said she did not like her, but over time they had grown closer. SS told the judge that the use of the “naughty step” had been “blown out of proportion”, that it had not been overused, and that T had never been sent to the naughty step for self-harming behaviour. When challenged about evidence provided by neighbours who had been recorded as telling the police that they had heard the children being shouted and sworn at, both DB and SS denied that this happened, and SS described ongoing antagonism with the neighbours about whom she had made multiple complaints. DB and SS accepted that they had used make-up to cover up some of T’s bruises before sending her to school on 4 November 2019.

Although he did not say so in express terms, it is manifestly clear from what followed that the judge accepted Dr Cleghorn’s evidence as to how T’s injuries had been sustained. Later in the “Discussion” section, the judge recorded that DB and SS relied on the opinion of the hospital registrar, but added that he had not been called as a witness and it was not known whether he would agree with Dr Cleghorn or the hospital consultant as to the cause of the injuries. </p>

He observed that “the evidence is that they threw themselves into the relationship with limited regard for the feelings of the children”, adding that “T’s open opposition was ignored”. He recorded that each of them had denied that there were any additional stresses living in such small accommodation, notwithstanding the fact that T had said she did not like to be crowded.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The first and principal ground of appeal advanced on behalf of DB is that the internal reasoning of the judgment was fundamentally flawed in that the judge failed to explain his reasoning for the findings recorded at paragraph 188. The further grounds of appeal are summarised in terms that the judge was wrong to find that some of T’s injuries were inflicted by DB or SS rather than by T herself. The second ground of appeal is that the judge was wrong to make the finding at paragraph 188.3 in respect of DB because there was evidence that he was attempting to engage the support of CAMHS and the school to assist T and there is no basis for the finding that he sought to minimise issues or prioritise his relationship. The third ground is that the judge was wrong to find at paragraph 188.4 that attempts to put boundaries in place included putting T on the naughty step for failing to disclose how she sustained her injuries. The fourth ground is that the judge was wrong at paragraphs 188.5 and 188.6 to find that T self-harmed as a result of the conduct of the parents, inadequate supervision or emotional harm. It is contended that the judge was not in a position to make any findings about why T selfharmed. The fifth ground is that the judge was wrong to find that any of T’s injuries were inflicted by DB or SS and that the judge failed analyse why there was a likelihood that DB inflicted the injuries and was therefore “in the pool”. The sixth ground is that the judge was wrong to find that DB and SS exposed the other children in the home to emotional abuse through seeing T’s injuries. It is submitted that the judge was not in a position to make a finding that either of the adults would willingly expose the children to emotional harm. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The grounds of appeal advanced on behalf of SS are more limited. In particular, SS does not appeal against the finding that some of the injuries were inflicted or that there is a real possibility that both she and DB inflicted the injuries so that each of them is in the “pool of perpetrators”. The focus of SS’s appeal is on the judge’s findings relating to the cause of T’s self-inflicted injuries. There is some overlap between the five grounds of appeal. In the first ground, it is said that the judge erred in making findings which were not properly put to the parents. In the second ground, it is argued that he erred in not allowing the parents know the case against them and respond to that case. It is asserted that many of the incidents occurred when T was not in SS’s care and that, had she known these findings were a possibility, evidence as to the causation and duration of the self-harming would have been adduced. In the third ground, it is contended that the judge erred in making a finding as to the responsibility for the selfharming in the absence of expert evidence (as recommended by Dr Cleghorn) as to the reasons for the self-harming. In the fourth ground, it is argued that the judge erred in making a finding of emotional harm against SS when the incidents occurred when the child was not living with her. The fifth ground of appeal is that the judge erred in making a “pool” finding of emotional harm against SS when there was a history of concerns of emotional harm going back many years before T was in her care. </p>

I think it would have been better had he done so. I do not, however, regard his failure to do so as a “fundamental flaw” so as to require this court to conclude that the findings must be set aside.

It is clear from the earlier sections of the judgment there was evidence on which the judge was entitled to rely in reaching all of these findings.

It is correct that he did not say so in terms, but before us Mr Singh frankly acknowledged the findings were open to the judge on the basis of the expert evidence. Dr Cleghorn was the courtappointed expert and the judge was clearly entitled accept her evidence and to prefer it over the opinion of the hospital consultant which he rejected for reasons clearly explained in the judgment. For my part, I see nothing wrong with the judge’s approach to the opinion offered by the registrar. It follows that the judge was entitled to find that some of T’s injuries had been inflicted by another person and I reject the arguments advanced on behalf of DB to the contrary. It is notable that SS did not seek to appeal against this finding. </p>

But I do not read the judge’s finding in those terms. What he found was that the children had suffered emotional harm through witnessing T’s injuries. Given the fact that all five children were sharing a bedroom, that T’s injuries were significant and extensive, and that the children were plainly aware of the injuries, it was manifestly open to the judge to make the finding in those terms. I would therefore dismiss DB’s sixth ground of appeal. </p>

Indeed, it was their case before the judge that all of her injuries were self-inflicted. That contention was rejected by the judge who accepted the evidence of Dr Cleghorn as to which injuries were self-inflicted or inflicted by others. It is further asserted on behalf of DB and SS that, insofar as T’s injuries were self-inflicted, it was not open to the judge to find that her behaviour was caused by their conduct or neglect. It is pointed out that it was never asserted by the local authority in any of the iterations of the threshold document that T’s behaviour was attributable to the adults’ conduct. As a result, neither DB nor SS adduced any evidence on this issue. Had it featured as part of the local authority’s case, they would have sought to obtain and adduce in evidence more details about the background, including T’s behaviour and treatment in Yorkshire following the breakdown of her parents’ relationship and the tragic death of her mother. It was asserted on their behalf, and not denied by counsel for the local authority or the children’s guardian, that neither of them was cross-examined on that basis. It was never suggested to them in evidence that their conduct or neglect was the cause of T’s selfharming. Mr Singh told us that it had been put to DB in cross-examination that T was self-harming because she was suffering from emotional harm but not that it was attributable to the conduct of DB or SS. On behalf of the local authority, Ms Savage fairly conceded this point and accepted that the judge’s finding went beyond what the local authority had been seeking. It was assumed by all parties that the reason for T’s self-harming behaviour was not something to be determined at the fact-finding hearing. The approach agreed by the parties was that the judge would be invited to decide whether the injuries were self-inflicted or inflicted by another person or persons and, in the light of his findings, psychological and other assessments would be obtained to address the reasons for T’s behaviour for consideration at the final welfare hearing. In the course of her submissions, Ms Savage accepted that it was likely that the causes of T’s behaviour were multi-factorial. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In those circumstances, it seems to me that SS’s grounds of appeal and DB’s fourth ground of appeal are made out. I conclude it was not open to the judge at the factfinding hearing to find, as he did at paragraph 188.5, that T self-harmed “as a result of the conduct of the parents” (meaning DB and SS) or, at paragraph 188.6, that the selfinflicted injuries were caused “as a result of the emotional harm suffered by her” in their care or a lack of adequate supervision. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I would therefore allow the appeal against those findings and set them aside. The question as to why T harmed herself so extensively must be determined at the forthcoming welfare hearing. It may, of course, turn out that the conduct of DB and SS caused or contributed to T’s self-harming behaviour, but that conclusion was simply not open to the judge at the fact-finding stage. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">If my Lady agrees, the only remaining question is what should now happen to the proceedings. In the course of the hearing, all parties agreed with the court’s proposal that, if we were to reach the conclusion that the appeal should be allowed in part as I have set out above, the proceedings should remain with Judge Clarke. Following the hearing, however, Ms Wilson sent an email to the Court informing us that her client had lost confidence in the judge in the light of the two successful appeals in these proceedings and that it was SS’s perception that to allow the judge to consider the issue again could be unfair. In my view, however, there is no reason to doubt that the judge will be able to re-evaluate the issue as to the reasons for T’s self-harming behaviour in the light of all the evidence ultimately available at the welfare stage. Given the very limited basis on which, if my Lady agrees, this appeal will be allowed, it would be wholly disproportionate to transfer the case to another judge. Furthermore, given the difficulties facing the family justice system at present, such a course could lead to further delays in resolving the question of the future care of these children. </p>
