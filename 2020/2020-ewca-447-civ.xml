	    <p style="margin-left:0.60in;margin-right:0.00in">In November 2010 the appellant caused the unauthorised cutting down of 43 trees, together with the construction of a vehicle track, in the Gelt Woods near Carlisle in Cumbria, a Site of Special Scientific Interest (“SSSI”). Criminal charges were brought in consequence. Following the 2-day trial of a preliminary issue, which he lost, the appellant pleaded guilty to those charges. He produced a written basis of plea which strived to minimise his involvement in the relevant events, and which Natural England, the relevant prosecuting authority, did not accept. There was then a 4-day Newton hearing to determine the degree of the appellant’s culpability. Following that hearing, the judge found that the appellant’s culpability was “very considerable” and fined him £450,000 and ordered him to pay £457,317.74 costs. The appellant appealed against both conviction and sentence. Both appeals were rejected by the Court of Appeal Criminal Division (“CACD”) in a judgment dated 18 December 2014 ([2014] EWCA Crim 2683). </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.60in;margin-right:0.00in">Despite the lack of success which has marked his engagement with the legal process thus far, the appellant commenced new proceedings on 6 July 2018, claiming damages for breach of contract and/or negligence against his former solicitors Womble Bond Dickinson (“WBD”). The basis of his original pleaded claim was that it was “substantially more likely than not that he would have been acquitted if properly defended”. By a judgment dated 27 April 2019, Her Honour Judge Deborah Taylor, sitting as a Deputy High Court Judge (“the judge”) struck out the claim for damages on the basis that it was a collateral attack on the appellant’s conviction and sentence and/or was bound to fail by reason of the doctrine of illegality ([2019] EWHC 1102 (QB)). She found that, for the claim to succeed, the appellant had to prove one or all of a number of outcomes, “all of which are inconsistent with the current conviction and sentence”. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.60in;margin-right:0.00in">The appellant sought permission to appeal. There were three grounds: (i) that the judge had been wrong to find that the doctrine of illegality meant that the claim should be struck out; (ii) that the judge had been wrong to find that the claim was an abusive collateral attack on an existing conviction; and (iii) that the judge was wrong to find that two specific claims, relating to a) WBD’s failure to pursue an abuse of process argument, and b) the advice given by WBD as to choice of venue, were an abusive collateral attack. Males LJ refused permission to appeal on Grounds (i) and (ii). He granted permission on Ground (iii) on the basis that, although they might be very difficult to establish on the facts, it was arguable that these claims were available in principle to the appellant.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.60in;margin-right:0.00in">Accordingly, the twin issues that arise for determination on this appeal are whether the allegations of breach of contract/negligence in respect of an alleged failure to pursue an abuse of process argument, and an alleged failure to advise properly as to venue, were matters which, in principle, did not contravene the narrow rule as to illegality as formulated by Lord Hoffmann in <span style="font-style:italic">Gray v Thames Trains </span>[2009] UKHL 33; [2009] 1 AC 1339 and/or amount to an abusive collateral attack on the conviction and sentence imposed. This gives rise to a consideration of the scope of these principles and the extent - if at all - to which a convicted criminal can pursue claims against his legal advisors arising out of his criminal conduct and its consequences.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.60in;margin-right:0.00in">In October 2010, the appellant and his wife acquired the Hayton Estate near Carlisle which comprised about 500 acres, mainly of woodland. The Estate included the gorge of the River Gelt and the Gelt Woods. Part of this area was an SSSI, a designation intended to protect it. Unfortunately, it did not protect it from the appellant who, shortly after buying the Estate, caused the felling of 43 trees and the construction of a track wide enough to take vehicles, together with supporting banks and the like, through the Woods. Despite the appellant’s vigorous efforts to obstruct them with threats and bullying, the local residents brought the matter to the attention of Natural England.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.60in;margin-right:0.00in">As a consequence, the appellant was charged with offences under Sections 28E(1) and 28P(1) of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. The appellant was summoned before the Magistrates’ Court and pleaded not guilty. He elected trial at the Crown Court. He then sought the determination of a preliminary issue as to whether the offences with which he was charged were offences of strict liability, and whether the matters relied on by the prosecution could in law amount to the appellant ‘causing’ the prohibited operations. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.60in;margin-right:0.00in">Following a 2-day hearing in April 2013, HHJ Peter Hughes QC (“the trial judge”) held that the offences were ones of strict liability (indeed, it does not appear to have been seriously argued to the contrary) and that the question of causation would turn on the facts. Following this ruling, the appellant changed his plea to guilty. That did not prevent him from later challenging the preliminary issue ruling in the Court of Appeal in December 2014, as part of his appeal against conviction. That challenge was rejected in detailed terms: see [10] - [23] of the CACD judgment. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.60in;margin-right:0.00in">The appellant’s guilty plea was accompanied by a lengthy document, drafted by leading counsel, entitled ‘Basis of Plea and Points for Mitigation’. This document sought at every turn to minimise the appellant’s responsibility for causing the carrying out of the prohibited operations. It was not accepted by Natural England. This necessitated a further 4-day Newton hearing, with a good deal of oral evidence from both sides (although the appellant himself declined to testify), to allow the trial judge to determine his level of culpability.  </p>

	  <content>

Particular features of the appellant’s mitigation - which the trial judge rejected - included the repeated suggestion that the fault lay with others and that he had been let down by professionals who had failed to advise him on various matters. The trial judge was also very critical of the aggressive tactics he had adopted towards the local residents: as the judge put it, his “deeply unattractive” conduct towards them could be summarised as saying “don’t mess with me”. The trial judge also noted the absence of “a scintilla of apology and meaningful acceptance of responsibility” on the part of the appellant.    </p>

As the CACD found at [27] - [28], not only was it difficult to see how there could have been any misunderstanding on that fundamental issue, but the evidence which emerged at the 4-day Newton hearing precluded any possibility of the appellant arguing that he had not caused the operations. As the Lord Chief Justice summarised it, “the appellant had on the evidence subsequently heard before the judge plainly caused the operations.” Accordingly, both grounds of appeal against conviction were rejected by the CACD. </p>

One of the arguments expressly raised in the CACD was that the judge should have taken into account the fact that Natural England had been prepared to have the matter tried summarily in the Magistrates’ Court, where the maximum fine would have been £20,000 on each of the two counts.  </p>

Applying that same approach to individuals possessing the scale of wealth of the appellant, a fine significantly greater than that imposed by the judge would have been amply justified for his grossly negligent conduct in pursuit of commercial gain, particularly when so seriously aggravated by his conduct in obstructing justice. A fine in seven figures should not therefore be regarded as inappropriate in cases where such a fine was necessary (1) to bring home to a man of enormous wealth the seriousness of his criminality in cases such as this where there was gross negligence in pursuit of commercial gain, (2) to protect the public interest in SSSIs and (3) to deter others. In the case of deliberate conduct in similar circumstances, a fine in relation to a man of similar wealth should be significantly greater, as that would be necessary to reflect the greater culpability.

I have concluded that the Statement of Case does not disclose a claim which the court can entertain, as it is an abuse of process, and must fail as a matter of law by reason of illegality. It is clear from <span style="font-style:italic">Gray </span>and<span style="font-style:italic"> Patel v Mirza</span>, that the justification for the narrow rule when considering illegality in the context of bringing civil proceedings where there is a subsisting criminal conviction is the inconsistency of the law causing the loss, and the law ordering compensation. The points raised by Mr Stewart QC do not establish any competing policy justifying derogation from the narrow rule which applies to cases such as this where the claim is for the fine imposed and the costs ordered.  The passages of Lord Toulson’s judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Patel v Mirza </span>at [101] and [107] do not support the contention that this area of law is unsettled. I do not consider that this is a case which falls within the class of cases which needs to be fully argued in order that the law may develop in an uncertain area of law: see<span style="font-style:italic"> Barrett v Enfield London Borough Council </span>[2001] 2 AC 550 at 557 per Lord Brown-Wilkinson. This case falls within Lord Hoffmann’s test in <span style="font-style:italic">Gray</span>, supported by Lord Toulson at [99] of <span style="font-style:italic">Patel v Mirza</span>. The punishment was lawfully imposed by HHJ Hughes QC in consequence of Mr Day’s unlawful act to which he pleaded Guilty. The unlawful act preceded any intervention by WBD, or indeed Mr Stainer. There was and is no dispute that works were carried out which were not notified to NE and for which permission was not given. In addition, the Basis of Plea, which HHJ Hughes QC treated as, and Mr Stewart QC did not suggest was anything other than Mr Day’s position, accepted a measure of responsibility. HHJ Hughes QC found he had a very considerable degree of responsibility and the sentence was imposed accordingly.  </p>

Mr Stewart QC’s submissions clearly highlight that the aim of the proceedings is to show that Mr Day would have acted differently, and, on one scenario HHJ Hughes QC, and the Court of Appeal (if there had been an appeal) would have come to different conclusions, had WBD acted as Mr Day contends they should have done. The underlying requirement to succeed in this claim is proving one or all of a number of outcomes, all of which are inconsistent with the current conviction and sentence. Those include that the proceedings would have been held to be an abuse, and therefore stayed, or that Mr Day would have pleaded Not Guilty in the Magistrates Court, with a potential acquittal at trial. Or even if a conviction at trial, or on a plea in the Magistrates Court, that he would have been given a lower sentence and incurred lower costs. Those scenarios would be wholly at odds with the existing sentence and costs order imposed by HHJ Hughes QC and upheld in the Court of Appeal, and in the circumstances the claim is likely to bring the administration of justice into disrepute. </p>

At this stage I am not concerned with deciding the merits of disputed issues of fact or negligence. But as a matter of policy, as Lord Hoffmann said in <span style="font-style:italic">Hall v Simon</span>, the remedy for those who may have been prejudiced by incompetent representation is to appeal through the criminal courts or to the Criminal Cases Review Commission to overturn the conviction. Once the conviction has been overturned, the claim is no longer an abuse. Mr Day was represented by Leading and Junior counsel at all stages of the original proceedings, He has had the opportunity of appeal with different solicitors and Leading and Junior counsel. None of the issues he now raises regarding abuse of process or the negligence of WBD were apparently before the Court of Appeal. I reject the submission that a civil court is better placed to examine a case where allegations of this kind are made. The criminal appeal process has time, where appropriate, and the expertise necessary for consideration of what are criminal procedural issues which would be required to review a case which has gone through the Crown court and Court of Appeal. It is not, as was suggested, a question of protecting the amour propre of the courts that led the court in <span style="font-style:italic">Hall v Simons</span> to endorse the <span style="font-style:italic">Hunter</span> principle.   </p>

Not all potential points of law are the same, or create circumstances where such an approach can properly be taken. Mr Stewart QC argues that this is a clear case of a promise not to prosecute and likely to be successful. Even if the basis pleaded were accepted, the bar for success in an application of this kind in criminal proceedings is high, and the circumstances and the ability of Mr Stainer to make a binding promise, even if made, is contested by the Defence.

First, there is a Respondent’s Notice, in which WBD support the judge’s findings in order to assert that the rule relating to illegality applied to bar the allegations in respect of abuse of process and choice of venue, and to argue that those allegations were not presented (and were not capable of being presented) in isolation in a way which did not involve an attack on the subsisting conviction and sentence. </p>

Although some of the proposed amendments flow directly from these decisions, it appears to me that there remain pleaded allegations which are not now available to the appellant in any event. The continuing complaint at paragraph 15c), that WBD failed to formulate a proper case strategy “given that it was Mr Day’s case that he had not caused or permitted the relevant offences” is perhaps the best example of the appellant’s unwillingness, even now, to give up his underlying grievance that he was not guilty of these offences.  </p>

He had been a passenger on one of the trains in the Ladbroke Grove disaster and suffered PTSD as a result. It was when suffering from that disorder that the claimant had killed. His plea of guilty to manslaughter on the ground of diminished responsibility was accepted by the Crown. The claim for general damages was found by the Court of Appeal to be precluded by the rule against illegality, but not the claim for loss of earnings during his detention.

The courts had therefore evolved varying rules to deal with different situations. Because questions of fairness and policy were different in different cases and led to different rules, one could not simply extrapolate rules applicable to one situation and apply them to another. It had to be assumed that the sentence was what the criminal court regarded as appropriate to reflect Mr Gray’s personal responsibility for the crime he had committed. It was therefore right to apply the rule that he could not recover damages for the consequences of the sentence, reflecting an underlying policy based on the inconsistency of requiring someone to be compensated for a sentence imposed because of his personal responsibility for a criminal act. It was also to right to apply a wider rule that you cannot recover damage which is the consequence of your own criminal act, reflecting the idea that it is offensive to public notions of the fair distribution of resources that a claimant should be compensated (usually out of public funds) for the consequences of his own criminal conduct.” </p>

The essential rationale of the illegality doctrine is that it would be contrary to the public interest to enforce a claim if to do so would be harmful to the integrity of the legal system (or, possibly, certain aspects of public morality, the boundaries of which have never been made entirely clear and which do not arise for consideration in this case). In assessing whether the public interest would be harmed in that way, it is necessary a) to consider the underlying purpose of the prohibition which has been transgressed and whether that purpose will be enhanced by denial of the claim, b) to consider any other relevant public policy on which the denial of the claim may have an impact and c) to consider whether denial of the claim would be a proportionate response to the illegality, bearing in mind that punishment is a matter for the criminal courts. Within that framework, various factors may be relevant, but it would be a mistake to suggest that the court is free to decide a case in an undisciplined way. The public interest is best served by a principled and transparent assessment of the considerations identified, rather than by the application of a formal approach capable of producing results which may appear arbitrary, unjust or disproportionate.” </p>

It is evident in civil cases particularly that a party may lack any opportunity to resist a hostile claim, as for example where judgment is entered against him on the ground of procedural default, or may lack a full opportunity, as when summary judgment is given against him. We understand Lord Diplock to have been intending to preserve a party's right to make a collateral attack on a decision made against him in such circumstances. We cannot think that Lord Diplock would have regarded Mr. Smith as lacking a full opportunity of contesting the Crown Court decision against him when he had had the benefit of a solicitor and counsel throughout the proceedings, had pleaded not guilty, had attended every day of the trial, had been able to give instructions to counsel on the cross-examination of prosecution witnesses, had given evidence himself, had called witnesses, had sought to establish an alibi, had had the benefit of submissions made to the jury on his behalf, had pursued an application for leave to appeal against his conviction, had settled grounds of appeal drawing attention to some at least of his complaints about the manner in which his case had been conducted by his solicitor and had renewed his application for leave to appeal to the full court on the initial refusal of leave. Even if it be true that valid criticism can be made of the conduct of his defence, it seems to us quite impossible to hold that Mr. Smith lacked a full opportunity to contest the charge. Were this the correct meaning of the rule, then the rule itself would be virtually meaningless, since it is hard to imagine a case in which a convicted defendant could not find some plausible ground upon which to criticize the preparation of the defence by his solicitor. We fully appreciate the great difficulty which faces any convicted defendant seeking to challenge his conviction on appeal on the grounds that his defence had been negligently conducted; this does not, however, lead to the conclusion that such a defendant lacked a full opportunity to contest the charge against him.” </p>

The other is to ensure that, in appropriate cases, the conviction itself can be reviewed. It seems to us clear that it is this second solution which has, over the past century, been favoured: by giving a criminal defendant a right of appeal; by providing a relatively low standard for the admission of fresh evidence on appeal; by empowering the appellate court to order a new trial; by giving the Home Secretary power to refer a case back to the Court of Appeal; and by proposals to establish a new review body. </p>

On the face of it, the carrying out of appropriate remedial work would have been the minimum requirement of Natural England in any event, and therefore the appellant’s legal obligation regardless of prosecution. It is very difficult to see how the carrying out of this work was to the appellant’s detriment if it was what he was obliged to do by law.

The abuse argument is being pursued because it is an essential part of the appellant’s continuing refusal to accept his conviction and sentence. In such circumstances, it is hard to imagine a clearer collateral attack on the conclusions of the Crown Court (and in this case, on the decision in the CACD). </p>

In both the Crown Court, and then the CACD, every possible point was taken by the appellant. He left no stone unturned in seeking to avoid his liability for the destruction in Gelt Woods. In the CACD, he even sought to undo his earlier guilty plea. Furthermore, in relation to the argument about venue, in his appeal the appellant sought to rely on an alleged assurance from a junior solicitor at Natural England that they would not object to trial in the Magistrates’ Court. In all the circumstances, therefore, if the appellant had received the alleged unequivocal representation from Mr Stainer, (rather than just a passing remark) and/or if he had acted on it to his detriment (rather than done what he was always obliged to do) he would and should have raised that no later than the hearing of his appeal against conviction and sentence. </p>

It was open to them to take any point which they thought would or might be of assistance in the furtherance of the appeals against conviction or sentence, regardless of any errors or omissions which might have been made before. That would therefore have included the abuse of process argument. It is all too common in hearings before the CACD for criticisms to be made of the defendant's previous legal advisors; there is even a special process by which, if privilege is waived, these criticisms are passed on to them so that their responses to the acts and omissions alleged can be considered as part of the appeal hearing. This process is designed to ensure that all the points available to a defendant are advanced before the CACD, regardless of what might have gone wrong in the Crown Court. It is also designed to ensure that there is not a constant stream of solicitors’ negligence cases started by disgruntled criminal defendants, and to prevent a situation where every criminal case that ends with a conviction then gives rise to a subsequent claim in negligence against the lawyers, with the same issues being re-argued in a different court. </p>

I do however accept that the claim in relation to the appellant’s own additional costs is a claim which, in principle anyway, and limited to the venue point, is not susceptible of being struck out at this stage. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.60in;margin-right:0.00in">Throughout his submissions, Mr Stewart QC referred to the test he considered applicable to this application to strike out, namely whether an intelligent twelve-yearold child would understand why an otherwise arguable claim against the appellant’s previous solicitors should be prevented at an early stage from going any further. It was unclear to me what the source of this test was, but I am happy to adopt it to summarise my conclusions. It seems to me that Mr Stewart’s putative twelve year old child would appreciate quite quickly that it was sensible and necessary for the final decisions in criminal courts to be just that - final - and that subsequent satellite litigation, re-arguing points that could and should have been raised before, and which went (directly or indirectly) to undermine the conviction and its consequences, was inappropriate, wasteful of resources, and likely to bring the law into disrepute.  </p>
