Those are orders which the United States District Court for the Central District of California (“the California court”) has indicated that it is minded to make by way of enforcement of a judgment for US $79,129,905 (being compensatory damages of US $26,376,645, tripled pursuant to the North Carolina Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Act (“UDTPA”)). That judgment was obtained by SAS in an action before the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina (“the North Carolina court”). </p>

The Turnover Order would apply to payments received from WPL customers anywhere in the world including the United Kingdom, wherever those payments were received, although in practice it appears that all payments by WPL customers are made to a bank or banks in the United Kingdom.  </p>

The North Carolina court held as follows: (1) the English court had found that what WPL had done in developing WPS was contrary to the terms of its licence agreement with SAS; (2) as a matter of comity and collateral estoppel, WPL was precluded from arguing otherwise; but (3) a United States court was under no obligation to apply the Software Directive because the licence was governed by an express choice of North Carolina law; and (4) accordingly the North Carolina court was not bound by the English court’s decision that terms of the licence prohibiting what WPL had done were null and void. The result was that summary judgment was granted to SAS on its breach of contract claim. However, its claims for copyright infringement were dismissed. Subsequently the North Carolina court decided that it would determine the first of these issues for itself rather than treating the decision of Arnold J as giving rise to an issue estoppel.

I do not find it surprising that a business such as SAS which has suffered losses assessed at US $26 million should seek to use all available means to recover those losses.

She said that injunctions have been granted to restrain conduct which the English court regards as vexatious or oppressive, and also where an injunction is necessary to protect the English court’s jurisdiction and judgments, but she did not regard this as such a case. An injunction to restrain vexatious conduct will generally be granted only where England is the natural forum to resolve the dispute, but the fact of WPL’s submission to the North Carolina court created an obvious difficulty for it.

Further, while the Orders would have the effect of enforcing in this jurisdiction a United States judgment which had been held to be contrary to English public policy in more than one respect, that did not cut across or interfere with the Enforcement Judgment which had decided nothing more than that the English court would not lend its enforcement processes to SAS.

He accepted that the judgment is enforceable by normal methods of enforcement against assets in the United States, but contended that the proposed Assignment and Turnover Orders would constitute an illegitimate interference with the enforcement jurisdiction of the English court. That is because they reach into this jurisdiction by having an effect on assets which are situated here and require WPL on pain of contempt proceedings in California to do acts here, and because they create in substance the same result as if SAS had succeeded in obtaining recognition and enforcement here of the North Carolina judgment when in fact such recognition and enforcement was refused on grounds of public policy. In those circumstances Mr Raphael submitted that an antisuit injunction to restrain SAS from seeking such orders was necessary to prevent illegitimate interference with the jurisdiction of the English court. He submitted also that it was vexatious and oppressive for SAS to seek such orders from the California court because of their extra-territorial reach and interference with the Enforcement Judgment and the public policy on which it was based.  </p>

She emphasised the evaluative and discretionary nature of the issue, the fact that WPL carries on business in the United States and submitted to the jurisdiction of the North Carolina court, which included submission to the enforcement jurisdiction of the United States, and that the orders sought are <span style="font-style:italic">in personam</span> orders against the defendant over whom the United States courts have personal jurisdiction, which are not so very different from the kind of order which an English court might make in comparable circumstances. She relied also on considerations of comity, emphasising in particular the views expressed by the North Carolina court and the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. </p>

Nevertheless the effect of the proposed Assignment Order would be to require WPL to assign debts situated in England to SAS which would at least purport to discharge its customers from any obligation owed to WPL, while the effect of the proposed Turnover Order would be to require WPL to give instructions to its banks in England which would discharge the debts situated in England currently owed by the banks to WPL. In substance, therefore, the proposed orders are exorbitant in that they affect property situated in this country over which the California court does not have subject matter jurisdiction, thereby infringing the sovereignty of the United Kingdom. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.00in;text-indent:0.00in">“47. The following propositions can be derived from this important decision. First, it is not permissible as a matter of international law for one state to trespass upon the authority of another, by attempting to seize assets situated within the jurisdiction of the foreign state or compelling its citizens to do acts within the foreign state's boundaries. Second, it would be an exorbitant exercise of jurisdiction to put a third party abroad in the position of having to choose between being in contempt of an English court and having to dishonour its obligations under a law which does not regard the English order as a valid excuse. Third, an <span style="font-style:italic">in personam</span> order against a person subject to the English jurisdiction may be contrary to international comity. Fourth, a garnishee or third party debt order is a proprietary remedy which operates by way of attachment against the property of the judgment debtor, and creates a proprietary interest by way of security in the debt or fund and gives priority to the claim of the judgment creditor to have his debt paid out of the fund before all other claims against it including that of the judgment debtor himself (Lord Bingham at [24]), or has proprietary consequences and takes effect as an order <span style="font-style:italic">in rem</span> against the debt owed by the third party to the judgment debtor (Lord Millett at [87]-[88]), or is in essence execution <span style="font-style:italic">in rem</span> against the property of the judgment debtor, because the discharge of the third party's indebtedness is an essential part of the execution. Fifth, a third party debt order cannot be made where it will not discharge the debt of the third party or garnishee to the judgment debtor according to the law which governs that debt, even if the order is directed <span style="font-style:italic">in personam </span>to a bank with a branch in London, because the order in respect of a foreign debt was an attempt to levy execution on an asset in the foreign jurisdiction.” </p>

CCOG will have to inform customers of the position and they will have to take advice. I suggested in the course of argument that the reality of the matter is that CCOG will be concerned that customers may think that a receiver has been appointed because it is bankrupt.

Oil contracts are high value, and it will not take many customers or many shipments to clear the judgment debt.

It was a decision, as a matter of substance, that the North Carolina judgment would not be recognised and is not enforceable in this jurisdiction. This follows from the internationally recognised principles concerning the territorial allocation of enforcement jurisdiction to which I have referred. </p>

Of the two examples to which we were referred, one was based on the fraud of the respondent and the other involved an attempt to execute a judgment when, after it had been obtained, the respondent had promised not to do so. Knowles J suggested another circumstance where an injunction might be granted, namely where the judgment was obtained too quickly or too secretly to enable an anti-suit injunction to be obtained, a circumstance far removed from this case. No example has been cited to us of a case where an anti-enforcement injunction has been granted simply on the basis that the proceedings sought to be restrained were commenced in breach of an exclusive jurisdiction or arbitration clause.  </p>

If, as has heretofore been thought to be the case, an applicant for anti-suit relief needs to have acted promptly, an applicant who does not apply for an injunction until after judgment is given in the foreign proceedings is not likely to succeed. But he may succeed if, for instance, the respondent has acted fraudulently, or if he could not have sought relief before the judgment was given either because the relevant agreement was reached post judgment or because he had no means of knowing that the judgment was being sought until it was served on him.

An anti-suit injunction always requires caution because by definition it involves interference with the process or potential process of a foreign court. An injunction to enforce an exclusive jurisdiction clause governed by English law is not regarded as a breach of comity, because it merely requires a party to honour his contract. In other cases, the principle of comity requires the court to recognise that, in deciding questions of weight to be attached to different factors, different judges operating under different legal systems with different legal policies may legitimately arrive at different answers, without occasioning a breach of customary international law or manifest injustice, and that in such circumstances it is not for an English court to arrogate to itself the decision how a foreign court should determine the matter.

We are not here concerned with judicial <span style="font-style:italic">amour propre</span> but with the operation of systems of law. Courts around the free world endeavour to do justice between citizens in accordance with applicable laws as expeditiously as they can with the resources available to them. This is an exercise in the fulfilment of which judges ought to be comrades in arms. The burdens imposed on courts are well known: long lists, size of cases, shortages of judges, expanding waiting times, and competing demands on resources. The administration of justice and the interests of litigants and of courts is usually prejudiced by late attempts to change course or to terminate the voyage. If successful they often mean that time, effort, and expense, often considerable, will have been wasted both by the parties and the courts and others. Comity between courts, and indeed considerations of public policy, require, where possible, the avoidance of such waste.  </p>

In the case of an anti-enforcement injunction the application will, by definition, be made after the rival proceedings have run to judgment. The grant of an injunction will mean that the cost of those proceedings and the resources of the rival court will (unless the injunction is discharged) have been wasted. It will not avoid the risk of inconsistent decisions although it will preclude the respondent from enforcing the existing potentially inconsistent decision.  </p>

First, an order precluding enforcement in countries outside England and Wales or those States which are subject to the Brussels/Lugano regime will, if obeyed, in effect preclude the consideration by the courts of those countries as to whether they should recognise or enforce the judgement in question. That is a matter which it is, intrinsically, for the relevant court to decide according to its applicable law. Moreover, insofar as the order prevents enforcement in the country of the court which gave the judgment it is, indirectly, an interference with the execution in its own country of the judgment which the court has given and can expect to be obeyed.  </p>

To grant such an injunction would render the entire liability proceedings a waste of time and resources. That is not this case. In the present case the injunction sought by WPL does not seek to prevent SAS from enforcing the North Carolina judgment in its entirety. WPL does not invite the English court to prevent SAS from enforcing the North Carolina judgment by normal methods of enforcement against assets in the United States. Nor does it suggest that the English court has any role in considering the appropriateness of the order upheld by the Fourth Circuit preventing WPL from licensing new customers in the United States. Accordingly, regardless of the outcome of this appeal, the North Carolina judgment will stand and there are processes of enforcement available to SAS in the United States. These have already achieved some (albeit not a full) recovery and may well continue to do so in any event.  </p>

The essential question which arises on this appeal is whether Teare J was right to say that JFC's Russian proceedings were vexatious or oppressive. It is suggested on behalf of Star Reefers that that finding was an exercise in discretion, and that no effective appeal can be mounted against it. In my view, however, such a finding is an evaluative judgment, and a condition precedent to the grant of any injunction in such a case as this, where no exclusive English jurisdiction or arbitration clause has been agreed between the parties. In this respect it is analogous to the concept of abuse of process: see <span style="font-style:italic">Aktas v. Adepta</span> [2010] EWCA Civ 1170, [2011] QB 894 at [53]. In both cases, those of vexatious or oppressive conduct and abuse of process respectively, an evaluative assessment has to be made, which is not an exercise of discretion but a matter on which there is, in theory, a right or wrong answer. If the answer is that such conduct exists, there then arises a question of discretion as to whether an injunction against foreign proceedings in the one case, or a stay of domestic proceedings in the other case, will be granted. It may be of course that the finding of vexatious conduct or of an abuse of process carry the court almost the whole way to its decision to grant an injunction or a stay: but that does not affect the fact that the prior finding is not itself an exercise of discretion. Factors which may come in at the second, discretionary, stage in the context of an anti-suit injunction include the important matter of comity.  </p>

It is notable that SAS has not so far sought, and the United States courts have not indicated that they would be prepared to grant, an Assignment Order extending to debts due from WPL customers in the United Kingdom. It may be that this forbearance involves some recognition of the exorbitant effect of such an order and the proper role of the English court in relation to such debts. Whether or not that is so, such an order would be exorbitant in the sense I have described, which means that relatively little, if any, weight should be given to comity as a factor telling against the grant of an injunction. While it would be a matter of regret to grant an injunction which would risk causing offence to a United States court, it would in my judgment be our duty to do so. </p>

Such debts are less obviously situated in the United Kingdom than debts due from customers here. Nevertheless it was not disputed that such debts are indeed situated here pursuant to English conflicts rules when WPL’s contract with the customer concerned provided for arbitration here or for the exclusive jurisdiction of the English court. In principle, therefore, these debts are in the same position as debts due from United Kingdom customers and, for the same reasons, no undertaking being offered, there should be an injunction to restrain SAS from seeking an Assignment Order extending to these debts. </p>

I respectfully disagree. While I too would hope that the California court will recognise and understand the position of the English court, in accordance with internationally recognised principles the enforceability of the judgment of a foreign court against assets located in this jurisdiction is a matter for the English court. </p>

Such debts are not situated in England but in the country of the customer’s residence. An Assignment Order requiring WPL to assign such debts to SAS might be regarded as exorbitant, but is not an order in which the English court would have a sufficient interest to intervene. Accordingly the injunction which I would grant should be limited in the case of third country customers to debts which are situated here. </p>
