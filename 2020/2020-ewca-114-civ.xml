	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">There was a time, 30 or 40 years ago, when construction litigation was a byword for expense and delay, and where the costs were often out of all proportion to the sums at stake. Subsequently, thanks in part to compulsory construction adjudication, which has reduced the number of construction cases that go through to a final trial, and the careful case management by TCC judges of those cases which do, construction litigation has become a much more efficient and cost-effective method of dispute resolution. But occasionally, circumstances conspire to create a construction case with echoes of the bad old days.  Unfortunately, this is one such case.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The appellant is an American-qualified architect, who was a friend and former neighbour of the respondents. Gratuitously, she provided assistance to the respondents when they wanted to undertake major landscaping works (including structural elements) in their North London garden (“the garden project”). There was a falling-out which led the respondents to commence proceedings against the appellant in the TCC for breach of contract and/or negligence. The appellant made a Part 36 offer in the sum of £25,000 three weeks after the start of proceedings, which was not accepted.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Following the trial of Preliminary Issues, the existence of any contract was rejected. Although it was found that the appellant owed the respondents a duty of care (a finding subsequently upheld by the Court of Appeal), this court made plain that, in these particular circumstances, the duty of care related to only such professional services as the appellant in fact provided; in other words, she could have no liability in respect of any alleged omissions. That meant that what the appellant actually did was critical to any claim in negligence against her. Following numerous further interlocutory skirmishes and a 5-day trial, the judge concluded that the appellant had in fact provided very few services and had not been negligent in providing any of them. The claim failed in its entirety. </p>

She sought assessment on an indemnity basis. The respondents argued, and the judge agreed, that costs should be assessed on the standard basis. The appellants’ appeal against that decision on costs, together with the respondents’ notice, raised three distinct issues:</p>

The respondents did not immediately proceed with this quotation because of their concerns about the costs. Following some casual conversations with the appellant, she became involved in the garden project between March and July 2013. In April 2013 (contrary to the evidence of the first respondent) Mr Nissen QC subsequently found that a budget figure of £130,000 was discussed between the appellant and the first respondent.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Over the next few weeks, a considerable amount of piling and other groundworks was carried out at the site. By early July the first respondent had become concerned about the budget. At a meeting on 8 July, he said that he had understood that the budget was £78,000, not £130,000. He denied that he had ever agreed the £130,000. In consequence of this, on 9 July 2013, the appellant terminated her relationship with the respondents. At no stage did she make any claim for fees in connection with the garden project.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The respondents did not comply with the TCC pre-action protocol, but commenced proceedings, alleging breaches of contract and a duty of care at common law, on 5 March 2015. The claim was for approximately £300,000, most of which was a global claim (explained below). On 26 March 2015, the appellant made an offer in accordance with CPR Part 36 to settle the case for £25,000. This offer was not accepted either within 21 days, or at all. Instead, on 31 March 2015, the respondents made a counteroffer in the sum of £220,000.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The claim was unusual because of the nature of the relationship between the parties, and the fact that such services as were provided by the appellant were provided free of charge. It appears that, at the first CMC, Edwards-Stuart J was sceptical about the legal basis of the claims, and he ordered Preliminary Issues to address the existence of the alleged contract and the alleged duty of care. As noted above, Mr Nissen QC decided those Preliminary Issues in a judgment dated 15 January 2016. Although he found the existence of a duty of care in tort, the respondents lost their case that there was a contract, and also suffered a major reverse on the arguments about the budget advice. Thereafter, on 5 February 2016, the respondents made a Part 36 offer in the sum of £150,000, which was £70,000 less than their offer the previous March.</p>

O’Farrell J made some orders in relation to costs budgeting on 1 December 2017. Although the respondents argued on appeal that the consequence of these was that the appellant’s approved costs budget was £415,000 excluding VAT, there was no order to that effect.  Only some elements of the anticipated costs were the subject of the order; other important elements (such as the anticipated costs of experts) were not. Paragraph 11 of O’Farrell J’s order of 1 December 2017 demonstrated that the incurred costs (which even at that stage ran to hundreds of thousands of pounds) were not agreed by the parties. She also ordered that revised costs budgets were to be provided. It does not appear that this ever happened.  </p>

He considered that the respondents had wrongly assumed that any item of bad workmanship on the part of the contractor would automatically be reflected in a claim against the appellant for negligent inspection.

He noted that, in contrast with the position of a claimant who makes a Part 36 offer and then subsequently beats it, a defendant in the same position was not automatically entitled under the CPR to indemnity costs. At [26] he correctly noted that, as part of his general discretion, the fact that the appellant had beaten her own offer was an important matter which he should take into account in considering whether or not the appellant was entitled to indemnity costs. But he did not appear to consider that issue further because, in the very next paragraph at [27], the judge concluded that this was a case in which costs should be assessed on the standard basis.</p>

But it cannot be right that every defendant in every case can put themselves in the way of claiming costs on an indemnity basis simply by inviting the claimant at an early stage to give up, discontinue and pay the defendant's costs on a standard basis. It might be different if a defendant offers to move some way towards a claimant's position and the result is more favourable to the defendant than that…  </p>

With that I respectfully agree. To my mind, however, such conduct would need to be unreasonable to a high degree; unreasonable in this context certainly does not mean merely wrong or misguided in hindsight.

Take this very case. No encouragement in the way of an expectation of indemnity costs was required for him to make his offer to accept £75,000: its object was to protect the respondent against a standard costs order were the Court, say, to reduce the damages to that level. Where, as here, one member of the Court considered the jury’s award “wholly excessive”, and thought that £60,000 would have been the highest sustainable award, it seems to me quite impossible to regard the appellant’s refusal to accept the £75,000 offer as unreasonable, let alone unreasonable to so pronounced a degree as to merit an award of indemnity costs. It is very important that <span style="font-style:italic">Reid Minty</span> should not be understood and applied for all the world as if under the CPR it is now generally appropriate to condemn in indemnity costs those who decline reasonable settlement offers.” </p>

In the context of that case I see that those paragraphs set out the need for there to be something more than merely a non-acceptance of a payment into court, or an offer of payment, by a defendant before it is appropriate to make an indemnity order for costs. Insofar as that is the intent of those paragraphs, I have no difficulty with them. However, I would point out the obvious fact that the circumstances with which the courts may be concerned where there is a payment into court may vary considerably. An indemnity order may be justified not only because of the conduct of the parties, but also because of other particular circumstances of the litigation. I give as an example a situation where a party is involved in proceedings as a test case although, so far as that party is concerned, he has no other interest than the issue that arises in that case, but is drawn into expensive litigation. If he is successful, a court may well say that an indemnity order was appropriate, although it could not be suggested that anyone's conduct in the case had been unreasonable. Equally there may be situations where the nature of the litigation means that the parties could not be expected to conduct the litigation in a proportionate manner. Again the conduct would not be unreasonable and it seems to me that the court would be entitled to take into account that sort of situation in deciding that an indemnity order was appropriate.  </p>

It is because of that that I do not respond to Mr Davidson's submission that this court should give assistance to lower courts as to the circumstances where indemnity orders should be made and circumstances when they should not. In my judgment it is dangerous for the court to try and add to the requirements of the CPR which are not spelt out in the relevant parts of the CPR. This court can do no more than draw attention to the width of the discretion of the trial judge and re-emphasise the point that has already been made that, before an indemnity order can be made, there must be some conduct or some circumstance which takes the case out of the norm. That is the critical requirement.  </p>

But his language is not apposite to all circumstances, as my Lord has pointed out. My Lord has referred to the example of a test case where a litigant wishes to pursue a case to obtain a ruling, whatever steps the other party has taken to prevent himself being a party to litigation, and the ruling goes against the person bringing the desired test case. That conduct cannot, as my Lord has said, be categorised as unreasonable, never mind unreasonable to a high degree. But the case might well be one outside "the norm", thus justifying an order for indemnity costs. In agreement with my Lord, this court should strive, first, not to replace language of the rules with other phrases; and secondly, should also strive to leave the question of costs so far as possible to the discretion of judges at first instance. Certain principles have to be adhered to, as indicated by the rules. So far as relevant to this case, the first principle is that expressed by May LJ in paragraph 28 in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Reid Minty</span> (which I have read). "As the very word 'standard' implies, this would be the normal basis". From that first principle it is also possible to say that in the context of Part 36.20, or under Part 44.3 the mere fact that an offer of settlement or a Part 36 offer has been made by a defendant and then been bettered, will not necessarily lead to an order for costs on an indemnity basis… </p>

In this case, if the judge had awarded indemnity costs simply on the basis that a Part 36 offer had been made and bettered, I would be inclined to have interfered with that decision. But there are clear indications that what happened here was that the judge took the view that this was a speculative claim by the claimant which the defendants had made various attempts to resolve outside the court and in relation to which the Part 36 offer was the final straw. The key factor which demonstrates to my satisfaction that this was the judge's approach is the fact that the cut-off date he chose from which costs would be on an indemnity basis, was the date of the payment in, not the date up to which the claimant would have had the opportunity to take the money or to accept the Part 36 offer. The judge fully appreciated the 21 days which the claimant had because he was told of that immediately prior to commencing his judgment. But he still chose the date of the payment in. In my view he must have said to himself: "This is a case which is close to being out of the norm in any event", and once the claimant was (and I use the words that the judge himself used when explaining the matter to Mr Davidson) "aware of the payment in", it was a case that the claimant should only be entitled to pursue on the basis that they paid indemnity costs if they lost.” </p>

The first is whether, even leaving aside the question of the Part 36 offer, the judge erred in principle in failing to find that the respondents’ conduct was out of the norm, such that indemnity costs should have been ordered. In my view, the central element of this debate is whether or not, prior to trial, the respondents (or their advisors) should have realised that these were speculative/weak claims which were most unlikely to succeed and that, in pursuing them to trial, their conduct was out of the norm and should have been recognised by an award of indemnity costs in favour of the appellant.</p>

Much of the debate, both before the judge and in the written material provided to this court, concerned the CPR and the plain distinction in the treatment of a claimant who beats its own Part 36 offer, on the one hand, and a defendant who beats such an offer, on the other. In my view, this focus was misguided. For good or ill, the CPR plainly makes that distinction. The right question was and remains whether, in all the circumstances of this case, the respondents’ failures to accept and then to beat the offer meant that indemnity costs should have been awarded, not automatically, but in the exercise of the judge’s discretion pursuant to CPR Part 44.3. </p>

He appeared to consider that an order for indemnity costs was only appropriate where it could be shown with hindsight that costs had been unnecessarily incurred. I do not accept that this was the right approach as a matter of principle. Indemnity costs are, for example, routinely ordered in favour of a vindicated defendant when allegations of fraud are dismissed at trial. Obviously, there are many cases in which the strength of one side’s position, or the flaws in the other side’s case, only become apparent at trial: <span style="font-style:italic">Bank of Ireland v Watts</span> [2017] EWHC 2472 (TCC), to which the judge referred, was just such a case.

That may have been because Mr Oram was arguing the converse. But however that focus came about, it was misplaced: the judge should instead have been asked to consider whether, at any time following the commencement of the proceedings, a reasonable claimant would have concluded that the claims were so speculative or weak or thin that they should no longer be pursued.

Prior to the latter, because of the finding of a duty of care on the part of the appellant, the respondents had an arguable (if not very strong) case both in relation to design and in relation to inspection, that focused not on what the appellant had done, but on what it was said that the appellant had failed to do. The Court of Appeal’s judgment, although in one sense a modest modification of the original finding of a duty, emphasised that the duty related only to the things that the appellant had actually done, not the things which it was suggested she should have done but omitted to do.  </p>

Once that argument (based as it was on omissions) was no longer open to them, the respondents had to create a new case which suggested that her drawings were inadequate, after all. That case plainly arose out of necessity (i.e. it was all that the respondents could say, in the light of the Court of Appeal’s judgment), rather than an objective and reasoned view of the merits (i.e. that the allegations were objectively justified). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The speculative/weak nature of that design case was demonstrated for all to see at the trial: see paragraph 23 above. But the failure of a case that was diametrically opposed to that which the respondents had originally argued cannot have come as a surprise to anyone. Moreover, it was no answer for Mr Oram to say that some parts of the design case were supported by expert evidence: such expert evidence as there was did not support the claim as pleaded, did not primarily come from an architect, and was served much too late to be the basis of the amended allegations. The principal reason why the new and wholly inconsistent design claim failed was not because of the judge’s rejection of the limited, late expert evidence which supported it, but because, once the omissions claim had gone, he found that the new claim “lacked credibility and conviction”. That was in effect a finding that the new design claim had been, since its formulation in 2017, speculative/weak.  </p>

As the judge noted in his judgment at [92], the judgment on the Preliminary Issues, as confirmed by the Court of Appeal, required the respondents to advance “a new and wholly inconsistent case” that the budget figure of £130,000, far from being too much (which was why the parties had fallen out in the first place), was actually too little.

In my view, that claim always was (and should have been appreciated by the respondents to be) speculative/weak. The respondents, as the residents of the property, would have known better than anyone that (as the joint expert eventually confirmed by reference to the photographs that the respondents belatedly disclosed) all but one of these defects were not apparent on site on or prior to 9 July 2013, when the appellant’s involvement ceased. Secondly, as the judge found at [57(ii)], the claim was in any event based on the false premise that any item of bad workmanship automatically gave rise to an allegation of negligent supervision against the appellant. The related claim for non-conformance with the Enright design was regarded by the judge at [88] of the costs judgment as being “hopeless” and a claim which he said should not have been pleaded, let alone pursued (see paragraphs 24-25 above). That finding was more than enough to trigger indemnity costs, at least in relation to these parts of the claim. </p>

Although this was not dealt with at all by the judge, this can be seen in their own Part 36 offers. Having sought £220,000 before the decision in the Court of Appeal, thereafter they were prepared to accept one fifth of that (£45,000) and, subsequently, they were prepared to take even less when they offered to accept £48,000 and just 60% of their costs. Those significant reductions in the amount that the respondents were prepared to take is, on the facts of this case, eloquent testimony to the fact that the respondents must have known that, after the Court of Appeal judgment, their claims were speculative/weak and that all that really mattered now was costs. From then on, the respondents found themselves in an absurd position, where they were incurring hundreds of thousands of pounds in costs, solely in order to try and recover some of those costs from the appellant. The respondents should have called a halt, because their underlying claims were speculative/weak, but they failed to do so. </p>

An irrational desire for punishment unlinked to the merits of the claims themselves is precisely the sort of conduct which the court is likely to conclude is out of the norm. </p>

That was the relevant question. For the reasons that I have given, I consider that, if he had asked himself the question, the judge would have concluded that such a time came not later than one month after the Court of Appeal judgment (namely by 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2017).

The appellant had undertaken some work for people that she regarded as her friends, free of charge. That work took a matter of weeks. It involved one or two drawings and some visits to site. Following what the appellant saw as the respondents’ unreasonable (not to say mendacious) attitude towards the £130,000 figure which she had discussed with the first respondent not once but twice, she ceased her involvement in the garden project. </p>

However, proportionality is not in issue if costs are to be assessed on the indemnity basis; see r. 44.3(3). I therefore find it difficult to see why logical analysis requires importing the approach in r. 3.18 into assessment on the indemnity basis. The first reason given by Coulson J<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="5">

	      </authorialNote>, at [29], has force if at all only if an approved or agreed budget does indeed reflect the costs that the receiving party says it expects to incur. However, the present case is an example precisely of the proper use of costs management in approving a budget at a lower figure than that proposed by the receiving party, on the very ground of proportionality. To suppose that the imposition of a budget under Part 3 would create some sort of presumption as to the limits of reasonable costs would be to ignore the fact that the approval of costs budgets is done on the basis of proportionality, not mere reasonableness. The matters referred to in connection with the first reason may, accordingly, justify having regard to the amount of costs the receiving party expected to incur, but they do not justify applying the r. 3.18 analogously to assessment of costs on the indemnity basis. Similarly, the second reason, stated at [30], seems to me, with respect, to go further than is justified by the costs management regime. When a costs management order is made, the parties know that costs within the approved budget are likely to be considered proportionate, and costs in excess of the approved budget are likely to be considered disproportionate; in either case, the burden of justification lies on the party seeking a departure from the approved budget. But the costs management regime is not intended to give litigants an expectation that they will not incur a liability for disproportionate costs pursuant to an order for costs on the indemnity basis; any such expectation must rest on a party's own reasonable and proper conduct of litigation. It is no objection to an order for costs on the indemnity basis that it is likely to permit the recovery of significantly larger costs than would be recoverable on an assessment on the standard basis having regard to the approved costs budget; that possibility is inherent in the different bases of assessment, and costs on the indemnity basis are intended to provide more nearly complete compensation for the costs of litigation. I accept, of course, that a party seeking to recover disproportionate costs on an assessment on the indemnity basis is required to show that those costs were reasonably incurred; though that requirement is subject to the provisions of r. 44.3(3). That does not, however, justify the analogous use of r. 3.18, which has three disadvantages. First, it is both unnecessary and contrary to the rationale of that rule. Second, it tends to obscure the fact that the nature of the justification required of a receiving party is quite different under the two bases of assessment. Third, and consequently, it risks the assimilation of the indemnity basis of assessment to the standard basis, which is not justified by the costs management regime in the CPR. In my judgment, the proper way of addressing the concern identified by Coulson J in <span style="font-style:italic">Elvanite </span>at [30] is, first, by ensuring that applications for indemnity costs are carefully scrutinised and, second, by the proper application of the well understood criteria of assessment in r. 44.3(3) to the facts of the particular case. It might also be remembered that, even if there exist grounds on which an award of indemnity costs could properly be made, such an award always remains in the discretion of the court.” </p>

I find it difficult to comprehend how such costs were incurred in a dispute about a garden in Highgate when the appellant’s original involvement lasted no more than a few weeks and was not the subject of charge. Accordingly, I am confident that, even on the indemnity basis from 7 May 2017 onwards, the costs finally determined on assessment are likely to be less than that figure.  </p>

There is no r.3.15 order to that effect. The best that Mr Oram could do was to show particular figures for certain future phases which O’Farrell J approved on 1 December 2017 (paragraph 15 above). However, even those figures were uncertain because her order expressly envisaged that there would be revised costs budgets. On any view, therefore, there was no clear or settled starting point as envisaged by the costs management regime. Accordingly, I am not persuaded that this is a case in which it is appropriate to compare the figure of £415,000 with the much higher figure actually incurred. </p>

Thus, even if there had been an approved budget figure, it could not affect whether or not the court should make an order for indemnity costs. </p>
