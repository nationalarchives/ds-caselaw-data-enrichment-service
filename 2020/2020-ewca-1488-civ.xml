By a claim issued on 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2016 against “Persons Unknown” Birmingham City Council sought an injunction pursuant to s 222 of the Local Government Act 1972 to prohibit street cruising throughout their local authority area.

On 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2019 His Honour Judge McKenna, also sitting as a Deputy High Court judge, refused an application by the present appellant Harun Mansoor Sharif to discharge the injunction. The question on this appeal from Judge McKenna’s decision is whether the injunction was properly granted, given what is said to be the alternative remedy available to the Council of itself making a public spaces protection order (“PSPO”) under Part 4 of the Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014.  </p>

Mr de Mello, who appeared for him below as well as before us, relied on the decision of this court in <span style="font-style:italic">Birmingham City Council v Shafi </span>[2009] 1 WLR 1961 (“<span style="font-style:italic">Shafi</span>”). In that case, as he put it, the Court of Appeal concluded that where a local authority sought an injunction on terms that were identical or almost identical to the terms that could have been sought on an application for an anti-social behaviour order (“ASBO”), which latter order was Parliament's preferred remedy for the type of conduct complained of and incorporated safeguards for defendants not available under the civil injunction regime, then while the Court retained jurisdiction to grant an injunction, it would not, as a matter of discretion, grant one save in exceptional circumstances. </p>

PSPOs are not a specific statutory remedy designed or introduced by Parliament to tackle the specific problem of car cruising. They replace, as I have already indicated, public space orders, restricting problem drinking, gating orders and dog control orders and give local authorities a general power to tackle activities that may cause a detrimental effect to quality of life of those living in their localities. The fact that Gateshead MBC may have made use of that power to deal with similar issues to those in respect of which the injunction was sought is neither here or there.  </p>

That would be a very surprising result – even more so when it is remembered that in the <span style="font-style:italic">Shafi </span>case the 'ASBO' regime provided specific safeguards which were lacking in the alternative approach and which made it more difficult for a local authority to obtain an 'ASBO'. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.00in">“44. The significance of the principle stated by Hoffmann J in this appeal is this. The terms of the injunction sought in this action are typical of an ASBO and, as already indicated, on the facts of this case they are identical or almost identical to the terms of an ASBO. We have already referred to what is in our view a striking feature of the council's approach in this case, namely that it seeks ASBOs against those under 18 and injunctions in identical terms against those over 18. Parliament has laid down a number of specific requirements which apply to ASBOs, some of which may not apply to injunctions granted at common law. In so far as it may be said that it is easier to obtain an injunction than an ASBO, the granting of an injunction in such circumstances would in our view be to infringe Hoffmann J's principle. In any event, it appears to us that where, as here, Parliament has legislated in detail to deal with a particular problem, the courts should in general leave the matter to be dealt with as Parliament intended and, save perhaps in exceptional circumstances, refuse to grant injunctive relief of the kind which can be obtained by an ASBO.  </p>

We recognise that there is a general principle that, where a claimant in a civil action has two available rights or remedies, he is in general entitled to choose which to rely upon. However, the principle to which we have referred is an exception to that general principle and applies in the kind of case contemplated by Hoffmann J, of which this seems to us to be an example. We recognise that it may be said that in <span style="font-style:italic">Chief Constable of Leicestershire v M </span>Hoffmann J was considering what he regarded as an unprincipled extension of the common law in a field in which Parliament had already legislated and that in this case the jurisdiction to grant an injunction in aid of the criminal law (and indeed to restrain a public nuisance) is already established. However, it seems to us that the thought which underlies Hoffmann J's principle applies here. Parliament has recently legislated to restrain anti-social behaviour in a particular way and subject to particular safeguards. In our view the court should have that fact well in mind in deciding how to exercise its discretion whether or not to grant an injunction in a particular case. </p>

The orders sought are in identical or near identical terms. It would again surely be bizarre, not to say irrational, if the standard of proof in the two cases were different. What then is the solution? In our view the natural solution is for the High Court or county court to decline to grant an injunction but to leave the council to seek an ASBO in both cases.

In this case, as already stated, the council seeks injunctions in aid of the criminal law (in the sense discussed above) or to prevent a public nuisance. However, the principles upon which such an injunction is to be granted remain to be determined. As stated above, as we see it they have been worked out to a considerable extent in the first class of case and in the classic case of public nuisance, but they remain to be worked out in a case which has elements of both and they also remain to be worked out where what is sought is in effect an ASBO. The critical factor in the present case is in our opinion that, whether the council seeks an injunction in aid of the criminal law or on the basis of an alleged public nuisance, the essential remedy sought is an ASBO. </p>

Firstly, he says, <span style="font-style:italic">Shafi</span> concerned two alternative judicial remedies, one (the ASBO) with greater safeguards than the other (the injunction), whereas in the present case the choice is between a judicial remedy (the injunction) and an administrative procedure which the Council can operate itself without permission or even oversight from anyone else. Second, the ASBO available in <span style="font-style:italic">Shafi</span> was designed to address precisely the same mischief as the injunction which the Council sought, which is not the position here. Third, the intention of Parliament in creating the ASBO in the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, which is what the court considered in <span style="font-style:italic">Shafi, </span>is no longer relevant because the ASBO has been abolished. Fourth, the leading judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Shafi</span> clearly envisages that local authorities will still be able to apply for injunctions under s 222 to restrain public nuisances (see [53] and [65]). Fifth, subsequent decisions of this court have made it clear that local authorities can seek injunctions in aid of the criminal law, and that there is no doctrine of the “closest fit”. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in">222 injunction to restrain anti-social behaviour rather than applying to a magistrates’ court or the Crown Court for an ASBO because (1) (as the judgment repeatedly emphasises: see paragraphs [51]-[53], [61] and [65]) the terms of the injunction sought were “identical or almost identical” to those which would be obtainable in an ASBO; (2) the criminal law could not be said to be ineffective (breach of an ASBO was punishable with imprisonment); and (3) it was unfair to circumvent the criminal standard of proof which the House of Lords had held in <span style="font-style:italic">McCann </span>was required on an application for an ASBO. This was why the court departed from what they accepted to be the general principles laid down in <span style="font-style:italic">B&amp;Q </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">Bovis</span>. Like Judge McKenna in the present case and Warby J in <span style="font-style:italic">Afsar</span>, I do not regard it on its proper construction as being of any assistance in the present case.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The third written ground of appeal argues that the court below was wrong to grant, or to refuse to discharge, an injunction carrying the penalty of up to two years’ imprisonment for contempt when the sanctions for breach of a PSPO are so much less severe. But that seems to me to turn the <span style="font-style:italic">B&amp;Q </span>case on its head, and it was not the way Mr de Mello put the point in oral argument. Rather he submitted that Parliament had created a specific scheme of PSPOs with provision for consultation with persons affected, and by doing so it intended to replace any alternative remedy the Council might otherwise have invoked such as an injunction under s 222. He told us that PSPOs have been deployed against street cruising both in Gateshead (as Judge McKenna noted) and more recently in Milton Keynes. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in">case was enough to indicate that a PSPO might well be ineffective. Breach of a PSPO is a non-arrestable offence carrying only a financial sanction (whether by prosecution or by service of a fixed penalty notice). As one item of evidence (among many) mentioned by Mr Bird records, “a caller complains that the vehicles go when police arrive and simply return when the police have moved on”. There may also be potential difficulties about what does or does not constitute a “public space”; how large that public space can be; and whether a PSPO can properly cover the activities of those who organise or advertise street cruises.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr de Mello’s case before Judge McKenna was that the Council could and should have used a PSPO rather than applying for an injunction; and, as already noted, each of the three pleaded Grounds of Appeal was to the same effect. However, in a supplementary skeleton argument and oral submissions he sought to argue that another alternative provided by Parliament, which the Council should have used rather than seeking an injunction, was to seek to have individuals such as his client prosecuted for an appropriate motoring offence. In the event of conviction, he submitted, the prosecution could apply to the court for a criminal behaviour order (“CBO”) to be made under s 22 of the 2014 Act to address any problems of public nuisance.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I would reject that submission, not simply because it was not made in the court below. It seems to me to be as unrealistic as the suggestion of a PSPO, though for different reasons. No submissions were made as to who, in practice, would initiate and conduct such a prosecution; which individual or organisation would be specified under s 24 of the 2014 Act to supervise compliance with the requirements of the CBO; or who would prosecute for an offence contrary to s 30 of the Act in the event of a breach of the CBO. Even assuming (without deciding) that a CBO is an appropriate order to be made on conviction for a motoring offence such as dangerous driving or racing on the highway, it could only be made against an individual who had been prosecuted and convicted of an offence, a process which might well take several months. The purpose of the injunction was to prevent future nuisances, not to impose penalties for past ones.</p>

I regard this as a classic case for the grant of an injunction. </p>
