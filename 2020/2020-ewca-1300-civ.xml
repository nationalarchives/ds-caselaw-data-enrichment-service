In addition, TRP claimed that SIS conspired with others to injure TRP by unlawful means. SIS admitted some limited infringements of database rights and breach of contract in respect of later periods, but denied wrongdoing in the respects alleged during the period from January to July 2017. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The betting prices relevant in this case are the fixed odds either offered by bookmakers (both on-course and off-course) or offered and accepted between market participants on online betting exchanges. A vital piece of information collated from racecourses is a single representative price for each horse in a race, sometimes referred to as the consolidated pre-race price, but which is known, when transmitted to off-course bookmakers, as a “Betting Show”. Each Betting Show is the product of an algorithm (which essentially calculates a form of average price) into which is fed a selection of the fixed odds being offered by a sample of on-course bookmakers. Betting Shows are produced from time to time in the period of eight to ten minutes before the start of the relevant race. The Betting Shows are vital information for offcourse bookmakers because they enable them to offer odds to their customers that reflect the prices being offered by the on-course bookmakers.  </p>

This is referred to as “Raceday Data”. It is of particular value to off-course bookmakers as it enables them to take bets right up to the start time of the race, but not beyond, and pay out winnings as promptly and accurately as possible after the conclusion of the race. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">For the reasons outlined above, in order for off-course bookmakers to offer bets on horseraces to their customers, it is essential for them to have access to Betting Shows and Raceday Data as quickly as possible. It is also essential that the information is accurate and reliable. There is accordingly a commercial value in being able to collate Betting Shows and Raceday Data and distribute them in real time to off-course bookmakers. It is for that reason that TRP is (and SIS before it was) willing to pay substantial sums to the owners of racecourses to be allowed the exclusive right to collate and distribute such information to off-course bookmakers. The value in the information is, however, short-lived. Its value lasts for a matter of minutes only, and much of the value does not extend beyond the start of the race. </p>

Those restrictions are contained in standard terms and conditions of entry, published on Arena’s website, signposted at the entrances to the racecourses and incorporated into contracts with those that enter (for example, upon purchase of a ticket) (“the Arena Terms”).  </p>

At trial SIS admitted that, during January and February 2017, it had knowingly breached the express terms and conditions of the Exchanges by taking and using pricing information available on the Exchanges for this purpose. Although there were issues at trial concerning SIS’s alleged use of another source and as to whether its use of Betdaq after March 2017 was authorised, the judge resolved those issues adversely to TRP and there is no appeal against those conclusions.  </p>

The Tote is the successor to a body originally established by the Racecourse Betting Act 1928. This authorised the Racecourse Betting Control Board, later known as the Horserace Totalisator Board (“the Board”), to operate a “totalisator” on approved racetracks. The Board was a public body. On 13 July 2011 all property, rights and liabilities to which the Board was entitled or subject vested in the Tote, a private company. On the same day, the Tote became part of Betfred. The Board and the Tote have successively had a presence on British racecourses, including the Arena Racecourses, for many years. </p>

That service includes collecting certain elements of Raceday Data from racecourses and making it available to offcourse bookmakers via a dedicated data feed (“the Tote feed”). The Tote had carried out this service at the Arena Racecourses during the period covered by the SIS-Arena Agreement and continued to do so after 1 January 2017. </p>

It is important to note that the judge found that the data provided by the Tote to SIS in this way included, but extended beyond, data which the Tote collected and distributed for pool betting purposes in the Tote feed. Indeed, it even extended beyond the data which the Tote was contracted to provide in Appendix 2 to the Tote HoT. The judge also found that SIS’s employees had attended the Tote’s premises in Wigan in January 2017 for the purposes of obtaining information that was not within the Tote feed. There is no challenge by SIS to any of these findings. </p>

Since there is no challenge to that finding, I shall for convenience, and without intending to be pejorative, refer to them collectively as “the Conspirators”. The Conspirators are related to each other as follows: SIS is wholly owned by Sports Information Services (Holdings) Ltd (“Holdings”); Ladbrokes owns 23% of the shares in Holdings; the Tote owns 6% of the shares in Holdings; in turn, the Tote is wholly owned (indirectly) by Betfred; and Fred Done, the founder of Betfred, owns 8% of the shares in Holdings. In addition, Philip Siers was, at the material times, Chief Commercial Officer of both Betfred and the Tote. </p>

First, TRP relies upon the Arena Terms as fortifying its case that the Raceday Data, or at least some of it, constituted confidential information. Secondly, TRP relies upon a breach of the Arena Terms by the Tote as one of the unlawful means deployed by the Conspirators. </p>

At trial TRP contended that, while the Tote was permitted by Arena to collect and distribute on-course data to bookmakers for pool betting purposes, it was prohibited from collecting and distributing such data for any other purpose. TRP contended that the Tote had acted in breach of a contract with Arena in two ways: (i) collecting and distributing data that was not required for pool betting and (ii) collecting and distributing data for fixed-odds betting that it was only permitted to collect and distribute for pool betting. TRP relied upon two sources of contractual restriction on the Tote: (a) an agreement between Arena and the Tote entered into some time in 2013 (“the Tote Agreement”) with effect from 1 January 2013; and (b) the Arena Terms. For reasons that will appear, it is necessary to consider the position with respect to the Tote Agreement before turning to the Arena Terms. </p>

Neither agreement contains a term which expressly grants the Board/the Tote a right to enter the Arena Racecourses, but both contain provisions which assume that the Board/the Tote will be present at the Arena Racecourses and offering pool betting services. It appears that, prior to 13 July 2011, the Board had a statutory right to do so.   </p>

As Lewison LJ pointed out during the course of argument, this submission requires consideration of the effect of the Tote having exceeded the limits of its licence to enter the Arena Racecourses under the Tote Agreement.

The Tote's presence on racecourses for the purposes of pool betting was originally pursuant to a statutory right, and there is no evidence of its presence on the Arena Racecourses having been made the subject of any agreement (other than the Tote Agreement, dealt with above). There is accordingly no evidence of there being any agreement that might constitute a Third Party Media Agreement within the meaning of Special Conditions B. </p>

They would preclude the Tote from carrying out any activity at all, yet it is common ground that the Tote was carrying on its pool betting activities at the Arena Racecourses lawfully. I reject the claimants’ contention that it is necessary to read clause 4.6 of the general conditions subject to an implied term ‘save insofar as expressly authorised’. Arena recognised that it was necessary to set out in express terms (i.e. the Special Conditions) the extent to which a third party would be entitled to make use of information acquired at the racecourse. It is possible to imply a term (among other requirements) only if it can be said with certainty what the term would have been.

Nor is it necessary to recite SIS’s original responses to those criticisms. As noted above, in his submissions in reply, counsel for SIS raised the more fundamental question of whether any contract was concluded between Arena and the Tote on the Arena Terms. As he pointed out, in the case of ordinary racegoers, they accepted Arena’s offer to admit them to the Arena Racecourses on the Arena Terms because that was the only basis on which they could gain admittance. In the case of the Tote, however, he argued that its employees gained admittance by virtue of the Tote Agreement, and therefore they had not accepted an offer to enter on the Arena Terms. </p>

As the judge explained, it is only during this short period of time that the information has value to bookmakers. The judge stated at [15] that “its value lasts for a matter of minutes only”. TRP accepts that the information comes into the public domain, and thus ceases to be confidential, after this period.  </p>

Both guests and employees were checked to ensure that they were not carrying cameras.

If the purpose of publishing the pictures was simply to convey the information that the Douglases had married, the bride wore a wedding dress and so forth, then the publication of any photographs would have put that information in the public domain. So would a description of the event. In this case, however, the point of the transaction was that each picture would be treated as a separate piece of information which ‘OK!’ would have the exclusive right to publish. The pictures published by ‘OK!’ were put into the public domain and it would have had to rely on the law of copyright, not the law of confidence, to prevent their reproduction.

Moreover, because other racecourses … did not contain similar restrictions to those set out in the Arena Terms, it is impossible to conclude that the information is subject to any ‘general obligation of confidence’. That, however, misses the point. Raceday Data is not confidential because it is of an inherently confidential nature, but because there is a substantial commercial value in the information, provided it is disseminated to off-course bookmakers as soon as possible, and Arena has the ability to, and does in fact, control its dissemination via exclusive channels so as to exploit that value. As in the <span style="font-style:italic">Hello!</span> case, the fact that TRP (and, before it, SIS) was willing to pay substantial sums for the benefit of an exclusive right to collect and disseminate the information to off-course bookmakers engaged in fixed-odds betting is a strong indication of its confidential nature.” </p>

The point may be demonstrated by posing the following question: why did SIS not source the Key Raceday Triggers simply by watching television broadcasts of the races? The answer is that, as the judge found, the information was not available to SIS by that route quickly enough (and accurately enough) to satisfy the needs of SIS’s customers. This is illustrated by an internal SIS email which the judge quoted at [149] saying, “The data necessary to take and settle bets has to get into the public domain at some point at which point anyone can collect it and use it but it is not clear whether we (or anyone else) can source the data quickly enough to be useful to bookmakers.” Hence, as explained in more detail below, SIS went to considerable trouble to obtain a data feed from the Tote that met its customers’ needs.

I do not accept this argument either. Arena <span style="font-style:italic">did</span> exercise its rights of property in the Arena Racecourses and its contractual rights under the Arena Terms to control the information by exclusively licensing TRP to collect and distribute Raceday Data. It is true that Arena did not seek to restrain the actions of the Tote by imposing contractual restrictions upon it, but as explained above the Tote was, so far as use of the data for fixed-odds betting purposes was concerned, a trespasser. In other words, the Tote was in materially the same position as Mr Thorpe in <span style="font-style:italic">Douglas v Hello!</span>.

It follows from the judge’s findings that the additional information comprised all of the items coloured amber in the 7 October 2016 document. Thus the additional information included items such as “OFF (Actual time race starts)”, “Official Off time”, “Stewards Enquiry or Objection called” and “Outcome of stewards Enquiry or Objection”, which fell within the definition of the Key Raceday Triggers. (There might be room for argument as to whether the judge was correct about “OFF (Actual time race starts)” given that Appendix 2 included an item described as “Totepool Pool OFF (Actual Pool off time)”, but I see no such doubt about the other items.)   </p>

Indeed, the equitable obligation of confidence is of practical relevance precisely because there is no contractual restriction. Second, I do not think it makes any difference that the Tote is allowed on to the Arena Racecourses in order to collect the information, as opposed to the information being provided to it by Arena. In either case it is information over which Arena asserts control and decides to whom it should be made available. Third, the fact that the Tote was lawfully permitted to collect Raceday Data and use it for one purpose (pool betting) does not in itself mean that the information cannot have been acquired by it in circumstances importing an obligation of confidence. It is perfectly possible that where A provides information to B knowing and intending that it be used by B for a specific purpose, the circumstances may be such that B ought to have been aware that it was otherwise confidential and thus could not be exploited by B for its own purposes. …” </p>

In these circumstances, I consider that the crucial factor, in determining what a reasonable person in SIS’s position (as opposed to the Tote’s position) would have understood, is that SIS received assurances from the Tote that it had the right to provide Raceday Data to SIS: would a reasonable person in the position of SIS, having received these assurances, have understood that the Tote was free to use (and pass on) Raceday Data for purposes unconnected with pool betting? </p>

It is important to pay close consideration to the details of the assurances given. As I have already explained, Mr Smith, as of 29 November 2016, knew that the Tote did not claim a contractual basis for its rights to use the information. Had the basis of the Tote’s rights been contractual, then it would be difficult to argue that SIS's reliance on an assurance by the Tote that it could lawfully provide the Raceday Data was unreasonable. Instead, Mr Smith knew that the Tote was relying solely on its ‘roots as a government franchise’.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Counsel for SIS submitted that this reasoning was flawed for two main reasons. First, the judge asked himself the wrong question at [186]. The starting point was that parties were free to receive information and pass it on to others unless some lawful restriction prevented them from doing so. A recipient of information would only be fixed with an equitable obligation of confidence if it had notice, objectively assessed, that the information was confidential. Thus the question the judge should have asked himself was whether SIS had had notice that the Raceday Data which it obtained from the Tote (or, more specifically, the Key Raceday Triggers) was confidential to Arena and/or TRP. Secondly, and in any event, SIS had acted entirely reasonably in relying upon the assurances, warranties and indemnities it had received from the Tote as the supplier of the information. The judge, counsel submitted, had held SIS to far too high a standard. </p>

So far as the first submission is concerned, while I accept that, read in isolation, what the judge says at [186] appears to suggest that he was looking at the matter the wrong way round, I do not think this does justice to the judge’s process of reasoning. As I have explained, by this stage in his judgment, the judge had already concluded that (i) the Tote was bound by an equitable obligation of confidence and (ii) SIS knew essentially the same facts that were known to the Tote. <span style="font-style:italic">Prima facie</span>, that would lead to the conclusion that SIS was also bound by an obligation of confidence. Thus it is understandable that the judge asked himself whether the assurances which SIS had received from the Tote made any difference.

Although counsel for SIS relied upon evidence concerning discussions between SIS and the Tote earlier in 2016, these do not assist SIS because SIS had acquired further information by late November 2016, and in particular it had learnt that the Tote had no contractual right to collect and distribute Raceday Data at the Arena Racecourses.  </p>

Given knowledge of all the facts known to SIS which the judge set out at [184]-[185], however, a reasonable person standing in the shoes of SIS would appreciate that the absence of a contractual prohibition could not be equated with a right to supply the information. Otherwise, the exclusivity which both SIS and TRP had paid good money for would have been non-existent.  </p>

What the judge found at [184] was that “SIS knew … (4) the Tote had no contractual arrangement with Arena regulating its entitlement to collect, or sub-licence to others, Raceday Data”. Thus the judge found that SIS knew that the Tote had no contractual <span style="font-style:italic">entitlement </span>to supply it with Raceday Data, particularly for fixed-odds betting purposes. Thus I consider that the judge was correct to conclude that there was a precise parallel between this case and <span style="font-style:italic">Douglas v Hello!</span>. Mr Thorpe was not subject to any contractual prohibition either, but the Hello! defendants were perfectly well aware that that did not entitle him to supply them with the unauthorised photographs, because he had no contractual right to do so. </p>

I agree with the judge that that should not have given SIS any comfort. As SIS must have been aware, the Tote had been privatised in 2011. Moreover, as SIS certainly knew, the Tote’s operations had hitherto been restricted to pool betting, but SIS wanted it to supply Raceday Data for fixed-odds betting. A reasonable person standing in the shoes of SIS would therefore appreciate that the Tote’s “roots as a government franchise” could not be sufficient to entitle it to supply Raceday Data, and in particular the Key Raceday Triggers, to SIS for fixed-odds betting purposes.  </p>

Contrary to the submission of counsel for SIS, the judge’s conclusion did not require SIS to have the legal knowledge and powers of analysis of a High Court Judge or even a majority of Law Lords. It simply rested upon his findings that SIS knew all of the facts which gave it notice that the Key Raceday Triggers were confidential to Arena/TRP.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Furthermore, the judge’s conclusion is reinforced by the following points. First, it can be seen from the 29 November 2016 email that Mr Smith felt reassured by the fact that what the Tote was offering was “Tote data (‘Tote Off’); ‘Tote results’; ‘Tote Non-runners’) and … not … official race-day data”. The reference to “Tote data” must mean the data which the Tote supplied as part of the Tote feed for pool betting purposes (hence the references in Appendix 2 to the Tote HoT to “Totepool Pool” data). But, as I have explained above, the judge found that the data which SIS obtained from the Tote went well beyond this. Secondly, the warranties and indemnities contained in clauses 3.2 and 3.3 of the Tote HoT were clearly intended to protect SIS against the eventuality that the Tote did <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> have the right to supply SIS with the Raceday Data listed in Appendix 2 to the HoT. They did not cancel out the knowledge that SIS had as to the Tote’s (lack of) entitlement to supply the data. Thirdly, in the event, the data which SIS obtained from the Tote exceeded even that specified in Appendix 2. SIS obtained no warranties or indemnities in respect of the additional data. Thus, even if SIS was not on notice that information comprised in the Key Raceday Triggers was confidential to TRP/Arena as at late December 2016, it was certainly on notice by some point in January 2017. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Accordingly, I consider that the judge was correct, at least from January 2017, to conclude that SIS became bound by an equitable obligation of confidence in respect of the Key Raceday Triggers.

The essence of the crime is the agreement or understanding that the parties will act unlawfully, whether or not it is implemented. The overt acts done pursuant to it are relevant, if at all, only as evidence of the agreement or understanding. … a tortious conspiracy, like most other tortious acts, must have caused loss to the claimant, or the cause of action will be incomplete. It follows that a conspiracy must necessarily have been acted on. But there is no more to it than that. The critical point is that the tort of conspiracy is not simply a particular form of joint tortfeasance. In the first place, once it is established that a conspiracy has caused loss, it is actionable as a distinct tort. Secondly, it is clear that it is not a form of secondary liability, but a primary liability. … Third, the fact of combination may alter the legal character and consequences of the overt acts. In particular, it may give rise to liability which would not attach to the overt acts in the absence of combination. This latter feature of the tort was what led Lord Wright in <span style="font-style:italic">Crofter</span> … to say that it was ‘in the fact of the conspiracy that the unlawfulness resides.’ He was speaking of a lawful means conspiracy, but as Lord Hope of Craighead pointed out in <span style="font-style:italic">Revenue and Customs Comrs v Total Network SL</span> at para 44, the same applies to an unlawful means conspiracy, at any rate where the means used, while not predominantly intended to injure the claimant, were directed against him.

To say that a predominant purpose of injuring the claimant in the one case and the use of unlawful means in the other supply the element of unlawfulness required to make a conspiracy tortious simply restates the proposition in other words. A more useful concept is the absence of just cause or excuse … A person has a right to advance his own interests by lawful means even if the foreseeable consequence is to damage the interests of others. The existence of that right affords a just cause or excuse. Where, on the other hand, he seeks to advance his interests by unlawful means he has no such right. The position is the same where the means used are lawful but the predominant intention of the defendant was to injure the claimant rather than to further some legitimate interest of his own. This is because in that case it cannot be an answer to say that he was simply exercising a legal right. He had no interest recognised by the law in exercising his legal right for the predominant purpose not of advancing his own interests but of injuring the claimant. In either case, there is no just cause or excuse <span style="font-style:italic">for the combination</span>. </p>

The first is the decision of the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">British Industrial Plastics Ltd v Ferguson</span> [1938] 4 All ER 504. In that case Mr Doherty had been employed by the plaintiffs for many years, and thus had knowledge of a secret process they used for moulding plastics. Having left the plaintiffs’ employment in 1932, Mr Doherty approached the defendant company in 1934. At an interview with Mr Ferguson and Mr Welch of the defendant company, Mr Doherty said that he had a process which was his own, which he was free to use and which he did not think infringed any patents. Messrs Ferguson and Welch suspected that Mr Doherty’s process was the plaintiffs’ secret process, or part of it. Mr Ferguson arranged for Mr Doherty to see the company’s patent agents with a view to getting their advice as to whether Mr Doherty’s process was patentable. The judge found that, in a muddleheaded way, Messrs Ferguson and Welch thought that, if the process was patentable, it would for that very reason not be confidential to the plaintiffs, but open to Mr Doherty to use. The patent agents reported that the process was patentable, and therefore the company hired Mr Doherty and used his process. In fact, the process was, at least substantially, the same as the plaintiffs’. </p>

The appellant was employed as a book-keeper by a company which, with an associated company, sold a quantity of diesel oil for road transport purposes. When so used, the oil was known as “Derv” and attracted duty at 2s. 9d. a gallon. The same substance, when used as “gas oil” for stationary plant or heating installations, had a red dye added to it and the rate of duty was 2d. a gallon. The companies sold a quantity of gas oil without the red dye as Derv, but did not pay the extra duty. The appellant was charged with two counts. Count 1 was that the appellant had conspired with others to cheat and defraud the Revenue of the extra duty. Count 2 was conspiracy to contravene section 200(2) of the Customs and Excise Act 1952, which prohibited the use of diesel oil as fuel for a vehicle unless the correct duty had been paid, and breach of which was made a criminal offence by section 33 of the Finance Act 1953. The jury acquitted the appellant of count 1, but convicted him on count 2. The judge had directed the jury that they should convict the appellant on count 2 if he was party to an arrangement to use fuel in road vehicles which was (albeit without his knowledge) prohibited by section 220(2) because it had not been fully taxed as Derv. The appellant’s appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal was dismissed, but his appeal to the House of Lords was allowed. </p>

There were also certain other terms of the transaction which are not essential for present purposes. None of the parties obtained an independent valuation of Maximum, but Mr Grosscurth obtained counsel’s opinion that the proposed purchase of Maximum by Belmont would not contravene section 54(1) of the Companies Act 1948, which made it unlawful for a company to give any financial assistance for the purpose of a purchase by any person of shares in the company.

At trial the chairman of Williams, City and Belmont, Mr James, gave evidence that he believed that buying Maximum for £500,000 was a good commercial proposition for Belmont because they were buying Mr Grosscurth’s ability to make money. Foster J accepted that evidence and dismissed the claims. The Court of Appeal allowed Belmont’s appeal. The Court held that the transaction contravened section 54 even if £500,000 was a fair price for Maximum, because it was not a commercial transaction in its own right, but merely part of a scheme to enable Mr Grosscurth and his associates to acquire Belmont at no cash cost to themselves, was not a transaction in the ordinary course of Belmont’s business and did not enable Belmont to acquire anything which it genuinely needed for its own purposes.

In this Court, this is a somewhat arid dispute given that, if the two are in conflict, we are entitled and bound to choose between them: see <span style="font-style:italic">Young v Bristol Aeroplane Co Ltd</span> [1944] KB 718. Nevertheless, given my analysis of <span style="font-style:italic">British Industrial Plastics v Ferguson</span>, I do not consider that <span style="font-style:italic">Belmont v Williams</span> was decided <span style="font-style:italic">per incuriam</span>. It follows that it is authority binding on this Court that knowledge of the unlawfulness is not required for unlawful means conspiracy. </p>

I do not see that there is any relevant distinction. Indeed, it would be surprising if the law imposed a higher threshold of knowledge in civil cases than in criminal ones. Since <span style="font-style:italic">British Industrial Plastics v Ferguson</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">Churchill v Walton </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">Belmont v Williams</span> all concerned wrongs of strict liability, there is no distinction between the three cases in that regard. In any event, it is not clear to me why the test for liability for unlawful means conspiracy should depend on whether the underlying unlawfulness involves strict liability or a mental element given that unlawful means conspiracy is a form of primary, not accessory, liability.    </p>

In that caseBritel, as freeholder of a block of flats which was registered land, granted a lease of the rooftop space to ACP to use it for the construction of penthouses in accordance with an agreed timetable pursuant to a “preliminary” agreement. ACP undertook to give Britel a share of the proceeds of sale of the penthouses and a “leaseback option” whereby Britel would be entitled to require ACP to grant it a sublease of those parts of the demised property which ACP had failed to develop in accordance with the agreed timetable. First Penthouse, the parent company of ACP, guaranteed ACP’s obligations under the agreement. ACP entered into an “introduction” agreement with Meretz, a sister company of Britel, to pay it part of the profits of the development as commission and charged the development lease to Meretz to secure the commission. First Penthouse provided funding for the development, and ACP also charged the development lease to First Penthouse to secure debts owed to it in connection with the funding. In due course First Penthouse exercised its power as mortgagee to sell the development lease to another defendant, with the result that ACP and First Penthouse were in breach of their contractual obligations under, respectively, the preliminary agreement and the guarantee. Meretz and Britel brought claims against ACP and First Penthouse for breach of contract in, <span style="font-style:italic">inter alia</span>, failing to complete the project within the timetable and failing to perform the leaseback option, and against all the defendants for the torts of inducing breach of contract and conspiracy to injure by unlawful means. Lewison J (as he then was) dismissed the tortious claims and an appeal by the claimants to this Court was dismissed on the ground that the defendants had not had the requisite intention for either tort. </p>

Just as the tort of conspiracy to induce breach of contract is not committed if the defendant believes that the outcome sought by him will not involve a breach of contract (the <span style="font-style:italic">Mainstream </span>case [2005] IRLR 964), so a defendant should not be liable for conspiracy to injure by unlawful means if he believes that he has a lawful right to do what he is doing. This is consistent with Lord Hoffmann’s comment in the <span style="font-style:italic">OBG </span>case [2008] 1 AC 1, para 56, when considering the tort of causing injury by unlawful means, that the common law in this area is designed only to enforce basic standards of civilised behaviour. Moreover, Lord Nicholls was not addressing such a situation in the passage set out at para 125 above. (I would note two supplementary points. First, for avoidance of doubt, I do not consider that this conclusion is inconsistent with the decision of the House of Lords in<span style="font-style:italic"> R v Churchill (No 2) </span>[1967] 2 AC 224, which concerned a very different issue, namely, the mens rea element of the crime of conspiracy in the context of an agreement which led to the commission of a strict liability offence. Secondly, we are not in this case concerned with the alternative form of conspiracy to injure, where the intent to injure is the defendant's dominant intention and questions of the lawfulness of the means do not arise.) I would also concur with Arden LJ’s conclusions about intent on the evidence before the judge.”  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The first is that the tort of conspiracy to injure by unlawful means would otherwise be a tort of very broad reach, in particular because a predominant intention to injure the claimant is not required, and it is sufficient that the defendant intends to advance his own economic interests at the expense of those of the claimant. Accordingly, counsel for SIS argued, limits are required to keep it within acceptable bounds. I am sympathetic to the proposition that the tort should be kept within bounds, but it does not necessarily follow that requiring knowledge of the unlawfulness of the unlawful means is an appropriate limit. I see very little support for such a limit in the appellate authorities. The judge was impressed by Lord Hoffmann’s point in <span style="font-style:italic">OBG v Allan</span>, relied upon Toulson LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Meretz</span>,<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>that “the common law in this area is designed only to enforce basic standards of civilised behaviour”, but it is commonplace for the common law, equity and statute to impose liability without requiring knowledge of unlawfulness. Ignorance of the law is generally no defence either in crime or in the civil law. That proposition is not, I accept, an absolute one, but exceptions to it are infrequent. I am not convinced that an exception is justified here given that what the authorities do require is that the defendant should have knowledge of all of the facts which make the means unlawful.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The second point is that otherwise the tort of inducing breach of contract would be rendered redundant. It is now clearly established that this requires knowledge on the part of the defendant that he is inducing an act which is a breach of contract: see in particular <span style="font-style:italic">OBG v Allan</span> at [39]-[41] (Lord Hoffmann). Counsel for SIS argued that almost all cases of inducing breach of contract could be reframed as conspiracy to injure by unlawful means, and it could not be right to require knowledge of unlawfulness for the former tort but not for the latter. I do not accept this argument. In <span style="font-style:italic">OBG v Allan</span> Lord Hoffmann was at pains to differentiate between the economic torts, and in particular the tort of inducing breach of contract and the tort of causing loss by unlawful means, and to debunk the unified theory adopted in some previous cases. He pointed out at [8] that the tort of causing loss by unlawful means differed from that of inducing breach of contract in at least four respects, one of which concerned the intention required. Much of what he said there seems to me to be equally applicable to unlawful means conspiracy. Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead also contrasted the two torts at [194]. Furthermore, in <span style="font-style:italic">BTA v Ablyazov</span> Lord Sumption and Lord Lloyd-Jones cautioned at [6] that it was “dangerous to assume” that common elements of the economic torts, “notably intention and unlawful means”, “have the same content in each context”. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The third point is that knowledge of unlawfulness should be required if the unlawful means consists of an infringement of private law rights, even if it is not required where it consists of a crime or contravention of a regulatory provision imposed for public benefit. This receives a degree of support from the observations of Lord Sumption and Lord Lloyd-Jones in <span style="font-style:italic">Ablyazov </span>at [15] to the effect that breaches of private law rights raise different considerations to crimes.

Counsel for TRP submitted that this was simply illogical: either all of the conspirators had to have such knowledge, or none. Counsel for SIS submitted that, if there was a conspiracy involving three or more persons, then only those persons who had such knowledge would be liable. This is not quite the same as what the judge held: on the judge’s formulation, a conspiracy of three requires two to have the knowledge, but not the third, whereas on counsel for SIS’s formulation one conspirator out of three could be liable if only that person had the knowledge. If knowledge of the unlawfulness is an essential ingredient of the tort, it seems to me to follow that each of the alleged conspirators must have had that knowledge in order to be liable, although I would accept that the involvement of additional parties who did not have the knowledge </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I respectfully disagree with Lord Nicholls’ reference to the patent example in this context. As I have explained, in that example claims for common law causes of action are excluded by statutory implication. More importantly, while the requirement of instrumentality seems clear, I do not find it easy to understand why it is not present in the courier example. The same example, substituting a pizza delivery business for a courier service, was referred to by Lord Walker at [266]. Although Lord Walker appeared to agree that there should be no liability in this example, he hesitated to accept the test of instrumentality at [268]-[269]. </p>

As an example of the latter situation, Lord Walker cited <span style="font-style:italic">Lonrho Ltd v Shell Petroleum Co Ltd (No 2) </span>[1982] AC 173. The defendants in that case were alleged to have acted in breach of the statutory order imposing sanctions on Southern Rhodesia, but the order ‘was not the instrument for the intentional infliction of harm’: para 95. Lord Mance in <span style="font-style:italic">Total Network</span> (para 119) was, we think, making the same point, by reference to the example of a pizza delivery business which obtains more custom, to the detriment of its competitors, by instructing its drivers to ignore speed limits and jump red lights. Addressing the character of the unlawfulness required, Lord Walker derived from the authorities the proposition that ‘unlawful means, both in the intentional harm tort and in the tort of conspiracy, include both crimes and torts (whether or not they include conduct lower on the scale of blameworthiness) provided that they are indeed the means by which harm is intentionally inflicted on the claimant (rather than being merely incidental to it)’: para 93, and cf para 95. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It seems to me that the discussions of instrumentality in the case law tend to conflate two different questions. The first concerns the defendant’s intention. As noted above, it is now well established that, in unlawful means conspiracy, the defendant must intend to injure the claimant, although that need not be the defendant’s predominant intention and it is sufficient that the defendant intends to advance their economic interests at the expense of the claimant’s. To that extent, the defendant’s intention must be directed at the claimant. The second question is one of causation. The unlawful means must have caused loss to the claimant, rather than merely being the occasion of such loss being sustained. As I see it, this is the best explanation of the courier service/pizza delivery example: in that example the claimant’s loss is caused by customers (who may be presumed not to appreciate that the defendant is systematically breaking the law and some of whom may prefer the defendant’s service for other reasons) choosing to place their orders with the defendant, and so the unlawfulness is the occasion for the loss rather than the direct cause of it.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The judge’s reasoning raises a third question, which is whether or not the unlawfulness must be unlawful as against the claimant (or at least against a class of persons of which the claimant is a member, which may include the general public in the case of criminal offences). As to this, the House of Lords held in <span style="font-style:italic">Commissioners v Total </span>that (unlike in the tort of causing loss by unlawful means) it is not a requirement of unlawful means conspiracy that the unlawful acts should be actionable at the suit of a third party. In those circumstances, I cannot see that it can be necessary that they be independently actionable at the suit of the claimant. Accordingly, I cannot agree with the judge’s reason for holding that SIS’s breaches of the Exchanges’ terms and conditions were not relevant unlawful means. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It remains necessary to consider, however, whether SIS’s breaches of the Exchanges’ terms and conditions caused TRP loss, or were merely the occasion for that loss. In other words, can the present case be distinguished from the pizza delivery example? With some hesitation, I have concluded that it can. This case is all about obtaining and supplying information. SIS obtained information in order to supply that information to its customers. SIS obtained some of the information from the Tote in breach of an obligation of confidence to Arena/TRP and some of the information from the Exchanges in breach of their contractual terms and conditions. In both cases TRP suffered loss because it was competing to supply the same information to the same customers. The judge accepted that the breach of confidence satisfied the test of instrumentality. As counsel for TRP submitted, however, there is no relevant distinction between the two means. Accordingly, I consider that in both cases the use of the unlawful means caused loss to TRP.       </p>

The judge did not take into account his findings later in the judgment at [207]-[209] as to the extent of the information SIS actually obtained from the Tote.

If the question was whether SIS had a positive belief that the Tote was acting lawfully in supplying the Key Raceday Triggers for fixed-odds betting purposes, then I consider that the answer would be that it did not, at least from January 2017. But the fact that SIS carried blithely on despite knowing that it was obtaining more data even than the Tote had contracted to supply does not demonstrate that it turned a blind eye to the fact that the Tote was acting unlawfully. As the judge rightly held, there is a difference between what a reasonable person in SIS’s position should have appreciated and a determination on the part of SIS not to consider the lawfulness of the Tote’s actions lest such consideration should confirm a suspicion that the Tote was acting unlawfully. </p>

In considering whether SIS received the Key Raceday Triggers subject to an obligation of confidence (applying the test set out by Arnold LJ at [79] above), the starting point must be that the Tote had provided that data pursuant to a contract with SIS in which the Tote had provided an express warranty that it had all necessary right from third parties to provide the information and that SIS’s use of the data would not breach any third party rights. In my judgment, a reasonable person receiving information on the basis of such a warranty from a reputable counterparty would not be on notice that the information was supplied in breach of an equitable duty of confidence unless there were clear countervailing indications, sufficient to override the contractual assurance of the party best placed to assess its own entitlement to provide the information. In the present case SIS made inquiries of and received assurances from the Tote which caused SIS to conclude and proceed on the basis that the Tote was lawfully entitled to provide the information. It is difficult to see why a reasonable person would have been expected to make further or different inquiries and/or to have reached the opposite conclusion.

The point was directly in issue and so decided by this Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Belmont v Williams, </span>a decision that was not referred to by Toulson LJ in his <span style="font-style:italic">obiter dictum </span>in <span style="font-style:italic">Meretz</span>. The interplay between unlawful means conspiracy and inducing breach of contract (where knowledge of an unlawful breach of contract is an essential element) may merit further examination in a suitable case, but I am not convinced that many cases in which a defendant induces a breach of contract, but without knowing that he is doing so, would be capable of being reformulated as an unlawful means conspiracy.    </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I also agree with Arnold LJ that the unlawful obtaining of information from the Exchanges was instrumental in SIS causing injury to TRP, being the very means by which SIS was able to and intended to compete with TRP. I see a clear distinction between the present case and the “pizza delivery” example, where the cause of the claimant’s loss results from the competitiveness of the defendant’s business due to its offer of speedier deliveries. The defendant’s breach of traffic laws is an incident of fulfilling the promise of speedier deliveries, not the cause of the claimant’s loss.        </p>

The judge can invite, and even encourage, the parties to recast or modify the issues. But if they refuse to do so, the judge must respect that decision. One consequence of this may be that the judge is compelled to reject a claim on the basis on which it is advanced, although he or she is of the opinion that it would have succeeded if it had been advanced on a different basis.

Quite apart from any pleading point, it cannot be reasonable to expect SIS to have understood that data were confidential (let alone obviously confidential) that even TRP did not claim were confidential. </p>

Moreover, because other racecourses (in particular the Independent Racecourses) did not contain similar restrictions to those set out in the Arena Terms, it is impossible to conclude that the information is subject to any “general obligation of confidence”. That, however, misses the point. Raceday Data is not confidential because it is of an inherently confidential nature, but because there is a substantial commercial value in the information, provided it is disseminated to off-course bookmakers as soon as possible, and Arena has the ability to, and does in fact, control its dissemination via exclusive channels so as to exploit that value. As in the Hello! case, the fact that TRP (and, before it, SIS) was willing to pay substantial sums for the benefit of an exclusive right to collect and disseminate the information to off-course bookmakers engaged in fixed-odds betting is a strong indication of its confidential nature.” </p>

If the event (for instance, figure-skating or show-jumping) was held in a relatively small indoor venue, with tight security, the hoped-for exclusivity might actually be achieved.

Indeed, the judge so found. The difficulty with his discussion at [207] and his conclusion at [209] is that he was dealing indiscriminately with raceday data, rather than with the pleaded Key Raceday Triggers. But it is necessary, once again, to concentrate on the Key Raceday Triggers. As Arnold LJ rightly says at [81] the judge made no specific finding in this regard. In my judgment an appeal court should be extremely cautious about making findings of fact that the judge (who was immersed in all the evidence) did not make. I do not consider that either the colour-coded document to which Arnold LJ refers at [82] or the operations manual to which he refers at [83] are a firm enough foundation. </p>

As I understand that phrase, what was meant was that the information was to be collected by the Tote rather than by TRP or Arena. For the reasons I have given, I do not consider that each of the Key Raceday Triggers, considered individually, can be said to have been separately confidential. What was potentially confidential was the compilation. But in so far as it was the compilation that had value, it was to be a compilation made by the Tote and not by anyone else. That is reinforced by the statement that the Tote were not offering “official” raceday data. Moreover, the data that were to be offered might differ from the official data. The reference to their being no detailed contracts in place explains why, in Mr Smith’s view, there were no restrictions on the Tote’s ability to provide the data.

They rely on the fact that the Tote had never sought to do so and that SIS had, until December 2016, the exclusive right to distribute Raceday Data from Arena Racecourses. It would—if it seriously thought that its rights were vulnerable to being undermined by the Tote (particularly given they viewed Mr Siers as a “canny and aggressive” businessman)—have taken steps to close off that possibility. Moreover, SIS knew (at least from the time of TRP's press release in September 2016) that TRP believed that it had exclusive rights. The claimants also rely on the fact that SIS's internal documents from the outset show that it had a concern that the Tote was not in a position lawfully to supply the data, and that this was a potentially “controversial” matter. In my judgment, these points all go to confirm something which is evident from the documents I have already referred to, namely that SIS did indeed have concerns that the Tote was unable to provide Raceday Data to it. That, however, is only the starting point. If SIS, having realised at the outset that there was risk that the Tote could not lawfully provide Raceday Data to it, had thereafter done nothing to satisfy itself on the point, then it would be difficult to avoid the conclusion that it had, at least, blind-eye knowledge of the breach of confidence.

That is clear from paragraphs 4B.3 and 39 of the Re-Amended Particulars of Claim. There has been no application to amend it. All the identified Key Raceday Triggers were already covered by Appendix 2 to the Tote heads of terms. So the supply of additional information adds nothing to the pleaded case.

He offered to disclose to Mr Ferguson information about a process used by BIP, which he had invented, and which Mr Ferguson knew was secret and confidential. But Mr Ferguson was found not to have known that the process belonged to BIP rather than to Mr Doherty. The reason for that was that “muddleheadedly and illogically” he believed that, if the process was patentable, that would establish that the process belonged to Mr Doherty and not to anyone else. Mr Ferguson sent Mr Doherty to his (Mr Ferguson’s) patent agents for advice; but they only advised on the question of patentability. Mr Ferguson then took the secret information in the honest belief that Mr Doherty would not be in breach of contract. As McKinnon LJ remarked in the Court of Appeal, Mr Ferguson’s honesty was vindicated at the expense of his intelligence. BIP sued both Mr Doherty and Mr Ferguson. They relied on two causes of action: inducement to breach a contract; and conspiracy. Both claims failed in this court. An appeal to the House of Lords on the question of inducing a breach of contract also failed: [1940] 1 All ER 479, but the claim in conspiracy was not considered by the House. The clearest statement of principle on the conspiracy claim was that of Finlay LJ who said that Mr Ferguson could not be liable in conspiracy “when he did not know that there was any illegality”. </p>

On the findings of the trial judge, which Arnold LJ summarises at [127], Mr James cannot have had any intention to harm Belmont; because he believed that in entering into the transaction Belmont was getting value for money. For that reason (if no other) it seems to me, in respectful disagreement with Arnold LJ, that it was an important part of the decision that the contravention of section 54 was itself an offence of strict liability. Take a case in which A and B agree to do something, believing it to be lawful. In fact it is unlawful because, say, it amounts to a breach of contract. One of A’s purposes (but not his predominant purpose) is to injure C. B has no such purpose.

The conspirators must intend to do the act prohibited by the substantive offence. The conspirators' state of mind must also satisfy the mental ingredients of the substantive offence. If one of the ingredients of the substantive offence is that the act is done with a specific intent, the conspirators must intend to do the prohibited act and must intend to do the prohibited act with the prescribed intent. A conspiracy to wound with intent to do grievous bodily harm contrary to section 18 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861 requires proof of an intention to wound with the intent of doing grievous bodily harm. The position is the same if the prescribed state of mind regarding the consequence of the prohibited act is recklessness. Damaging property, being reckless as to whether life is endangered thereby, is a criminal offence: Criminal Damage Act 1971, section 1(2). Conspiracy to commit this offence requires proof of an intention to damage property, and to do so recklessly indifferent to whether this would endanger life.” </p>

Two directors of Mainstream diverted a development opportunity from Mainstream to a joint venture consisting of themselves and Mr De Winter. That was a breach of their contractual and fiduciary duties to Mainstream. Mr De Winter was not liable in tort for inducing the two directors to break their contracts, because he honestly believed that there would be no breach. Lord Hoffmann added at [69]: </p>

In the <span style="font-style:italic">Lumley v Gye</span> tort, there must be an intention to procure a breach of contract. In the unlawful means tort, there must be an intention to cause loss. The ends which must have been intended are different. <span style="font-style:italic">South Wales Miners' Federation v Glamorgan Coal Co Ltd</span> [1905] AC 239 shows that one may intend to procure a breach of contract without intending to cause loss. Likewise, one may intend to cause loss without intending to procure a breach of contract. But the concept of intention is in both cases the same. In both cases it is necessary to distinguish between ends, means and consequences. One intends to cause loss even though it is the means by which one achieved the end of enriching oneself. On the other hand, one is not liable for loss which is neither a desired end nor a means of attaining it but merely a foreseeable consequence of one's actions.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Tenth, there is a well-known cause of action for assistance in a breach of trust. But in order to succeed on that basis it is necessary to prove that the assistance was dishonest: <span style="font-style:italic">Royal Brunei Airlines Sdn Bhd v Tan</span> [1995] 2 AC 378. It is notable that in that case Lord Nicholls at 387 adverted to the close analogy with breach of contract; and said that the underlying rationale was the same. It seems to me to be clear from his discussion at 390 that action under a mistake made in good faith about what is authorised by the trust instrument is not dishonesty, even if in fact it turns out to be unauthorised. If breach of an equitable obligation counts as unlawful means for the purposes of the tort of conspiracy, the way lies open to allege conspiracy to commit a breach of trust without having to prove dishonesty on the part of the non-trustee conspirators. It would, I think, not generally be regarded as dishonest to act in accordance with a mistaken view of one’s own legal rights. I do not consider that this is affected by the reformulation of the test of dishonesty in <span style="font-style:italic">Ivey v Genting Casinos (UK) Ltd</span> [2017] UKSC 67, [2018] AC 391. The example given by Lord Hughes at [60] is of the man who gets off the bus without paying, because he does not realise that public transport is not free. He, says Lord Hughes, would not be regarded as dishonest. But that is because he has made a mistake about his legal liability to pay for his bus ride. Lord Hughes went on to say: </p>

It is clearly important that the law should provide proper incentives to parties to familiarise themselves with the law, but if the bar under consideration does not now apply to the recovery of money paid under a mistake, it is difficult to see why it should apply to the economic tort of interference with contractual relations.” </p>

Just as the tort of conspiracy to induce breach of contract is not committed if the defendant believes that the outcome sought by him will not involve a breach of contract (the <span style="font-style:italic">Mainstream </span>case [2005] IRLR 964), so a defendant should not be liable for conspiracy to injure by unlawful means if he believes that he has a lawful right to do what he is doing.

These however are only examples, and afford little assistance in determining the circumstances which will constitute sufficient justification.

Perhaps one cannot safely go further than the statement to be found in <span style="font-style:italic">Glamorgan Coal Co v South Wales Miners' Federation</span>, and <span style="font-style:italic">Conway v Wade</span>, per Lord Loreburn, that they are not matters for definition but for a consideration of the individual circumstances of each case.

I do not, therefore, consider that the mere fact of collaboration or co-operation can be justified as of itself reprehensible. HHJ Russen also said that practical difficulties would arise if knowledge that the means were unlawful were to be an ingredient of the tort. No doubt there is some truth in that. But that did not deter the House of Lords in <span style="font-style:italic">OBG </span>from deciding that knowledge that there would be a breach of contract was an essential element of the tort of inducing a breach. That, too, might involve an investigation into what legal knowledge a defendant had. </p>

He also pointed out at [287] that since conspiracy catches those who have merely agreed to or collaborated in a course of action, the wider view of the ambit of the tort risks imposing liability on one who has done nothing unlawful and did not intend to agree to anything unlawful. </p>

Criminal offences are created for the benefit of society as a whole, and their enforcement may be described as enforcing basic standards of civilised behaviour. Everyone is expected to obey the criminal law. But even this cannot be pushed too far; as the frequently cited example of the pizza delivery business instructing its drivers to jump red lights and ignore speed limits shows. Private rights, on the other hand, are created to protect the right holders and do not have the same societal effect. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">I agree with Arnold LJ that the real question is whether the example of the pizza delivery business (which everyone agrees is not liable simply because of road traffic offences) is distinguishable. As Lord Walker explained in <span style="font-style:italic">Total</span> at [96] it is not enough that there is unlawfulness somewhere in the story. Arnold LJ distinguishes the case of the pizza business because the loss is caused by customers choosing to place their orders with that business, rather than with its rivals. But that is not the hypothesis on which the judges concerned based their discussion. In <span style="font-style:italic">OBG</span> Lord Nicholls said clearly at [160] that the courier service gained an unfair and illicit advantage over its rivals “because” its cyclists ignored speed limits and jumped red lights. Lord Walker used the same language at [266], substituting pizza delivery business for couriers. In <span style="font-style:italic">Total</span> at [119] Lord Mance used exactly the same language as Lord Nicholls and Lord Walker. In <span style="font-style:italic">Ablyazov</span> in the passage quoted by Arnold LJ at [150], Lords Sumption and Lloyd-Jones described the example as the pizza business obtaining more custom “by instructing” its drivers to ignore speed limits. In all these cases something more than “but for” causation is required. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Put in terms of the distinction that Arnold LJ draws at [156], it is all about selling pizzas. The pizza delivery business instructed its drivers to break the speed limit in order to sell more pizzas to its customers. Breaking the speed limit enabled it to do so. Its rival suffered loss because it was competing to supply the same commodity. I do not see a valid ground of distinction here, such that we can say that the judge’s evaluative judgment was wrong. </p>
