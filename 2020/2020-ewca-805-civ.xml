Material considerations fall into two categories: those which the decision-maker may take into account (but need not) and those which the decisionmaker must take into account. The point was neatly encapsulated by Holgate J in <span style="font-style:italic">R (Client Earth) v Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy</span> [2020] EWHC 1303 (Admin) at [99]: </p>

It is insufficient for a claimant simply to say that the decision-maker did not take into account a legally relevant consideration. A legally relevant consideration is only something that is <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> irrelevant or immaterial, and therefore something which the decision-maker is <span style="font-style:italic">empowered or entitled</span> to take into account. But a decision-maker does not <span style="font-style:italic">fail</span> to take a relevant consideration into account <span style="font-style:italic">unless he was under an obligation to do so</span>. Accordingly, for this type of allegation it is necessary for a claimant to show that the decision-maker was expressly or impliedly required by the legislation (or by a policy which had to be applied) to take the particular consideration into account, or whether on the facts of the case, the matter was so “obviously material”, that it was irrational not to have taken it into account.” (Original emphasis) </p>

But that submission necessarily entails that the officer contradicted herself within two adjacent paragraphs of her report. I do not consider that that is a fair reading of the thrust of the report. While the use of the phrase “once again” is unfortunate, in my judgment paragraph 9.10 makes it clear that Harrogate did have a 5 year supply of deliverable housing sites; and that the officer’s advice was given on that basis. Paragraph 9.11 gives two reasons for giving limited weight to policies SG1, SG2 and SG3; and the more natural reading of “once again” is that both the first reason and the second reason engage the tilted balance. </p>

She gave two reasons for that view. First, in order to maintain the supply of housing land, greenfield sites were needed; and that meant that settlement boundaries were out of date. Second, policies SG1, SG2 and SG3 were themselves based on a housing target that was out of date. That meant that those policies could only be given limited weight. It follows that the basis on which the tilted balance was triggered was on the basis that relevant policies were out of date. </p>

But if two reasons were given for the engagement of the tilted balance, one of which was good, and one of which was bad, I do not consider that it can be said that overall the advice misdirected the committee in a serious way. Because (a) the latter basis is one of the bases on which the tilted balance is triggered, and (b) whether a policy is out of date is a matter of planning judgment, the court can only interfere if the latter judgment is itself vitiated by an error of law. </p>

In the course of formulating the new development plan, Harrogate had considered the housing target and took the view that it did need updating. Thus, in accordance with NPPF paragraph 73, it was required to assess “local housing need” as defined by the glossary. That assessment permitted an assessment either by the standard method or by a justified alternative approach. In my judgment, therefore, Harrogate was not required to use the standard method in calculating local housing need. Having used a different method, which produced a target figure much higher than the figure in policy SG1, Harrogate was entitled to conclude that that policy was out of date. </p>

The 2012 version of the NPPF did not require the use of the standard method, even as a starting point. In accordance with NPPF paragraph 48 Harrogate was entitled to give weight to the housing policies in its emerging development plan. In addition, the government explanation of the standard method said in terms that plans that adopted higher housing targets than the minimum produced by the standard method would be considered “sound”. </p>

Just as lesser weight should be given to a contravention of policies in the development plan where there was a shortfall in the 5 year supply, so greater weight had to be given to those policies in a case in which there was a surplus in supply. The tilted balance was still a balance. The extent of the housing surplus was critical to striking that balance. The ONS statistics are a necessary input to determining the extent of the surplus of housing land. The construction of new homes in the countryside may have adverse effects (such as, for example, the loss of green space or open countryside, or increased demands on infrastructure) and the extent of the benefit of creating more homes must be balanced against those adverse effects.  </p>

Although her statement about the “marginal” supply of land was correct when written, it was falsified by the ONS statistics published after the report was compiled.

	    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.00in">“The NPPF does not state that the decision-maker must reduce the weight to be given to restrictive policies according to some notional scale derived from the extent of the shortfall against the five-year supply of housing land. The policy in paragraph 14 of the NPPF requires the appropriate balance to be struck, and a balance can only be struck if the considerations on either side of it are given due weight. But in a case where the local planning authority is unable to demonstrate five years’ supply of housing land, the policy leaves to the decision-maker’s planning judgment the weight he gives to relevant restrictive policies. Logically, however, one would expect the weight given to such policies to be less if the shortfall in the housing land supply is large, and more if it is small. Other considerations will be relevant too: the nature of the restrictive policies themselves, the interests they are intended to protect, whether they find support in policies of the NPPF, the implications of their being breached, and so forth.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Wald’s point was that just as logic would suggest that the weight to be given to restrictive policies would be less if the shortfall in the housing land supply is large, and more if it is small, so in the case of a surplus one would expect the weight to be given to restrictive policies to be less if the surplus was small and greater if the surplus was large.

But the weight given to the benefits of new housing development in an area where a shortfall in housing land supply has arisen is likely to depend on factors such as the broad magnitude of the shortfall, how long it is likely to persist, what the local planning authority is doing to reduce it, and how much of it the development will meet.” (Emphasis added) </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.00in">“One may, of course, infer from paragraph 49 of the NPPF that in the Government's view the weight to be given to out-of-date policies for the supply of housing will normally be less than the weight due to policies that provide fully for the requisite supply. <span style="font-style:italic">The weight to be given to such policies is not dictated by government policy in the NPPF. Nor is it, nor could it be, fixed by the court.</span> It will vary according to the circumstances, including, for example, the extent to which relevant policies fall short of providing for the five-year supply of housing land, the action being taken by the local planning authority to address it, or the particular purpose of a restrictive policy—such as the protection of a “green wedge” or of a gap between settlements. There will be many cases, no doubt, in which restrictive policies, whether general or specific in nature, are given sufficient weight to justify the refusal of planning permission despite their not being up-to-date under the policy in paragraph 49 in the absence of a five-year supply of housing land. Such an outcome is clearly contemplated by government policy in the NPPF. <span style="font-style:italic">It will always be for the decision-maker to judge, in the particular circumstances of the case in hand, how much weight should be given to conflict with policies for the supply of housing that are out-of-date.

As Mr Boyle submits, there is nothing in statute or policy which expressly or impliedly required the Inspector to take into account the existence of a 5YHLS when deciding the weight to be attached to countryside policies. Accordingly, it was for the Inspector to determine the weight to be attached to the fact that there was more than 5YHLS, subject only to a <span style="font-style:italic">Wednesbury</span> challenge. </p>

When the Inspector came to consider the overall planning balance, at DL47, he did consider the weight to be attached to the provision of housing. That was the proper place in the analysis for that consideration. I see no basis for saying he should have <span style="font-style:italic">increased</span> the weight, prior to conducting the balancing exercise because of the absence of a negative, namely that there was no shortage of housing land.” (Original emphasis) </p>

Such circumstances were found in the widespread public controversy surrounding the proposal, and the departure from development plan and Green Belt policies; combined with the members' disagreement with the officers' recommendation, which made it impossible to infer the reasons from their report or other material available to the public. The same combination is found in the present case, and, in my view, would if necessary have justified the imposition of a common law duty to provide reasons for the decision.” 57.<span style="font-family:Arial"> </span>The key point here is that the committee disagreed with the officer’s recommendation. Where the committee follow their officer’s recommendation it is a fair inference, in the absence of other evidence, that they have accepted the reasoning in the officer’s report: <span style="font-style:italic">R (Palmer) v Herefordshire County Council</span> [2016] EWCA Civ 1061, [2017] 1 WLR 411 at [7]. Where, on the other hand, they have rejected the officer’s advice, it may be impossible to discern the reasons for the decision. In the present case the committee followed their officer’s recommendation. Mr Vendy’s intervention was directed to persuading the committee that there was no shortfall in the 5 year supply of housing land; and that was the basis on which the committee took its decision. The reason why the committee’s decision departed from the development plan, and in particular from policies SG1, SG2 and SG3, was because they accepted the officer’s advice that those policies were out of date.  </p>
