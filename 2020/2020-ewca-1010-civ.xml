The decision was that the Government of the United Kingdom (“the Government”) would not support resettlement of the Chagossians to the Chagos Islands, which are part of the British Indian Ocean Territory (“BIOT”), but would provide a financial support package of approximately £40 million for Chagossians over a period of ten years.   </p>

It also addresses the implications of a recent opinion of the International Court of Justice of 25 February 2019 (“<span style="font-style:italic">the Advisory Opinion</span>”) and a consequential resolution of the General Assembly of the UN of 22 May 2019 which was adopted to give effect to the Advisory Opinion (“<span style="font-style:italic">the UN Resolution</span>”).  </p>

Their interests were ignored and overlooked because they did not have any formal ownership or equivalent rights to possession of the land.  It was estimated that there were 37 Chagossian families on Diego Garcia, with the balance of the population containing workers from Seychelles.  The process of removal of the inhabitants started when Chagossians who had gone to Mauritius on leave were prevented from returning when shipping links were suspended.  In January 1971 the Administrator of the BIOT announced to the assembled inhabitants of Diego Garcia that the island would be closed in July.   </p>

Various attempts were made to settle the action for payment of the sum of £1.25 million, but at different times different groups became involved and claims were made for a sum of £8 million.  In the final event, following negotiations with representatives of the Chagossians and the Mauritius government, an agreement was signed on 7 July 1982 providing for payment of £4 million for the Chagossians.  Renunciation of claims forms were signed by either 1332 or 1344 of the Chagossians which provided that “… <span style="font-style:italic">all claims, present or future, that I may have against the government of the United Kingdom, the Crown … their servants of agents</span>” were renounced.  The Ilois Trust Fund Act 1982 was enacted by the legislature in Mauritius.  A cheque for £4 million was handed over at a ceremony at which Ilois representatives were present.

The Prime Minister attended with the Secretary of State, and there was also the Secretary of State for Defence, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, the Home Secretary, the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, the Attorney General and the Minister for DfID.  The Permanent Under Secretary at the FCO addressed the three main options, and it is necessary to set out what he said because it is relevant to the grounds of appeal.  He noted that the Outer Islands were a 5-hour boat trip from the US air base.  He said that “<span style="font-style:italic">The largest was the size of Hyde Park, which ruled out building a landing strip, and the highest point was only 6 feet above sea level. This would be an even more challenging location for resettlement than Option A.</span>”   </p>

New healthcare facilities, private tuition places, vocational training places and funding for degrees would be £21 million over 10 years.  Heritage visits would be £5.5 million; restoration of cultural sites would be £4.2 million; scientific conservation projects, with volunteering opportunities for the Chagossians would be £4 million, and a training package for UK Chagossians would be £4.6 million (a total of £39.3 million).  It was noted that this was a reduction of the £55 million package agreed in March 2016.  The main risk to the delivery of the package would be the need for the consent and co-operation of the Mauritian government.  In this respect in May 2016 the Mauritian Prime Minister had announced that, unless the UK provided a date to return sovereignty over the BIOT to Mauritius, he would seek referral by the UN General Assembly to the ICJ. </p>

In coming to this decision, the Government has considered carefully the practicalities of setting up a small remote community on low-lying islands and the challenges that any community would face. These are significant, and include the challenge of effectively establishing modern public services, the limited healthcare and education that it would be possible to provide, and the lack of economic opportunities, particularly job prospects. The Government has also considered the interaction of any potential community with the US Naval Support Facility – a vital part of our defence relationship.  </p>

This was because the legal right of abode was linked to the practicalities of resettlement in the Chagos Islands, as illustrated by the fact that between 2000 and 2004 no one had chosen to take up the right to go and live in the Chagos Islands noting that the reality was that “… <span style="font-style:italic">there would need to be established an entirely new society in the Chagos Islands</span> …”. </p>

This in due turn shapes the common law which must be properly considered in the light of the position set out in international law.

The ECtHR described the bases upon which the jurisdiction of the Convention could apply.  The first basis was the territorial principle (paragraph 131) under which a state’s jurisdiction was normally exercised throughout that state’s territory. Acts performed or producing effects “<span style="font-style:italic">outside</span>” the territory would constitute an exercise of jurisdiction only in exceptional cases. The Court then identified the exceptional situations where extraterritorial acts could engage Article 1.  It is not necessary to go into detail. In short, the Court referred to the acts of diplomatic and consular agents, (paragraphs 133 – 135), to acts of force by a state’s agents (paragraph136) – for example where an individual was transferred into the custody of a foreign state’s representatives by the local authorities, and to cases where a foreign state exercised “<span style="font-style:italic">effective control over an area</span>” due to lawful or unlawful military action (paragraphs 138 – 140).  </p>

Secondly, the mere fact that many of the applicants resided in the UK did not bring their complaint within the jurisdiction of the ECHR since an applicant’s place of residence was irrelevant: “… <span style="font-style:italic">the Court’s competence cannot become justiciable in Strasbourg merely because an applicant moved address</span>” (paragraph 63). Thirdly, in relation to the argument that, even if the UK has not made a declaration in relation to the BIOT the Convention still applied because of Article 1, the Court observed that it had to have “… <span style="font-style:italic">regard to the most recent and authoritative statement of principles as regards jurisdiction under Article 1 pronounced by the Grand Chamber in Al-Skeini </span></p>

This interpretation is strongly rejected by the respondent Government and would indeed render Article 56 largely purposeless and devoid of content since Contracting States generally did, and do, exercise authority and control over their overseas territories.” </p>

They had either (a) been compensated by the UK for what was an accepted violation of their rights; or (b), been afforded a proper opportunity under domestic law to bring claims for vindication of their substantive rights and/or for compensation.

States have consistently emphasized that respect for the territorial integrity of a non-self-governing territory is a key element of the exercise of the right to selfdetermination under international law. The Court considers that the peoples of non-self-governing territories are entitled to exercise their right to self-determination in relation to their territory as a whole, the integrity of which must be respected by the administering Power.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">The Advisory Opinion remitted the issue of resettlement to the General Assembly (see paragraph 181); the Court stated that the issue was an issue relating to human rights which should be addressed by the General Assembly during the completion of the decolonisation process.  The General Assembly, for its part, equally did not decide the issue and further remitted it to be addressed later “<span style="font-style:italic">during</span>” the completion of the process of decolonisation. Paragraph 2(f) of the UN Resolution “<span style="font-style:italic">affirms</span>” in accordance with the Advisory the Opinion that: “<span style="font-style:italic">The resettlement of Mauritian nationals, including those of Chagossian origin, must be addressed as a matter of urgency during the completion of the decolonisation process</span>”. Paragraph 4 “<span style="font-style:italic">urges</span>” the UK to cooperate with Mauritius to facilitate resettlement, but it imposes no obligation of resettlement upon Mauritius, as the state that would, on the basis of the conclusions of law arrived at, have the power to secure such resettlement.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">Second, there are problems with the submission in relation to the power of the domestic courts to grant relief under the ECHR even assuming that the Appellants are correct. As we have set out above, the concern of the Appellants is to secure resettlement, whereas the focus of the Advisory Opinion and the UN Resolution was upon completion of a process of decolonisation as part of the right of selfdetermination of Mauritius. The issue of resettlement was identified (in the second question posed to the Court, see paragraph 111 above) but only as one possible incident of the consequences of a finding that there had been a breach of the right to self-determination. We accept that the right to self-determination and the right of resettlement are, by their natures, related concepts but they are not legally synonymous.  The right to full decolonisation is conferred upon a state or Government as proxy for the individual citizens. As the Court explained, the right to selfdetermination is one granted to “<span style="font-style:italic">peoples</span>” and is a right to “<span style="font-style:italic">self-government”</span> (see e.g. paragraphs 177 and 178). Under the Advisory Opinion and under the UN Resolution the right to self-determination is conferred upon Mauritius as a State and Government; it is not a right for every single one of those “<span style="font-style:italic">peoples</span>” to express a different and divergent view as to where they would wish to live <span style="font-style:italic">within</span> the decolonised, selfdetermining, state.  A decision by the Government of Mauritius whether to permit resettlement in the islands would be an <span style="font-style:italic">internal</span> matter for the Mauritian Government. If the Government of Mauritius refused to allow resettlement or did so in a manner falling short of the full aspirations of the Appellants, then that would be an internal matter governed by the law of Mauritius, not international law. Nothing in the Advisory Opinion or UN Resolution compels Mauritius to grant resettlement rights. It must therefore follow that if the Appellants are correct in their analysis, then the relief that is sought under the ECHR does not lie in the hands of the UK Government to grant nor could it therefore be for the domestic courts to enforce.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">Third, and perhaps most fundamentally, neither the Advisory Opinion nor the UN Resolution support the proposition that the UK does not have <span style="font-style:italic">responsibility</span> for the foreign relations of the BIOT, at least pending full decolonisation, within the context of Article 56 ECHR.  We see the force in the argument that, properly construed, the concept of responsibility in Article 56 assumes, and is predicated upon, <span style="font-style:italic">lawful</span> responsibility. The Appellants’ argument, however, wrongly assumes that in expressing the opinion that the failure to complete the process of decolonisation was unlawful the ICJ intended the <span style="font-style:italic">added</span> consequence of rendering void all of the (myriad) acts taken by the UK in pursuance of being responsible for the foreign relations of the BIOT, for instance all actions relating to the military presence of the US on Diego Garcia.  The Appellants’ argument, in our judgment, elides and confuses two different points.  It is well established in domestic law, in the case law of the ECtHR under the ECHR and in international law that a finding of unlawfulness may have prospective effects only. When a court finds and declares that some act of a state or Government is unlawful it may then need to proceed to determine what the effects of that declaration are.  In many cases the impugned act might be quashed along with its past, antecedent, effects; but in other cases, the Court might conclude that the declaration should have prospective effects only and should leave the prior legal position unchanged.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">In our judgment in this case both the ICJ and the General Assembly were careful to fashion a remedy which was prospective and which entailed the UK in completing an ongoing (albeit long interrupted) complex “<span style="font-style:italic">process</span>”.  The Court was at pains to emphasise that practical implementation was a matter for the General Assembly and not for it, and the thrust of the UN Resolution is resolutely forward looking. It demands completion of the “<span style="font-style:italic">process</span>” of decolonisation within 6 months, which assumes that all sorts of future legally binding steps would need to be completed during that time frame and, one assumes, this could well involve legally binding acts in the field of foreign relations in connection with the US presence on Diego Garcia.  It also calls for cooperation and facilitation of that “<span style="font-style:italic">process</span>” of completion which also presupposes the possible entering into of a variety of legally binding agreements between the UK and foreign states.    The repeated use of the phrase “<span style="font-style:italic">process</span>” in the Opinion (eg paras 167, 174, 178, 179 and 180) and in the UN Resolution (e.g. recitals (a) and paragraph 3) all recognise the reality which is that the process of decolonisation cannot be achieved overnight and may involve a series of binding commercial, practical and legal steps and actions by the decolonising power and equivalent and commensurate steps by the transferee state, for instance in setting up its own governmental institutions, authorities and agencies, so that it is ready to assume and exercise sovereign control and power. We therefore conclude that both the Advisory Opinion and the UN Resolution are intended to be forward looking and not to put into legal jeopardy all acts of the UK in relation to the foreign relations of the BIOT. In our view neither the Advisory Opinion nor the UN resolution support the contention that at all material times the UK was not responsible for the foreign relations of the BIOT for the purposes of Article 56.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">We are strengthened in this conclusion by the fact that there was clearly a lively debate as between the judges as to how far the Court should go in the Advisory Opinion.  This can be seen from the contents of the separate declarations and opinions of several judges that wished the Court to go beyond the finding that the breach by the United Kingdom was of customary law.  These judges wished the Court to express the opinion that the violation was of a “<span style="font-style:italic">peremptory norm</span>” i.e. of a higher and more serious nature.  One reason for this was that, if the Court had expressed the view that the breach by the UK was of a peremptory norm, this could then have had a profound effect upon the validity of all of the legal acts taken by the UK in the exercise of its responsibility for the foreign relations of the BIOT; and, of course, the prime instance of this would have been the agreements between the UK and the US over the installation of military bases.  </p>

By way of illustration, in her separate Opinion, Judge Sebutinde strongly criticised the Court for <span style="text-decoration:underline">not</span> finding a peremptory breach not least because this act of self-restraint would fail to render void the agreement between the UK and the US over Diego Garcia.  At paragraph 45 she stated:   </p>

Having failed to recognize the peremptory status of the territorial integrity rule in the context of decolonization, the Court has failed to properly articulate the consequences of the United Kingdom’s internationally wrongful conduct. Any treaty that conflicts with the right of the Mauritian people to exercise their right to self-determination with respect to the Chagos Archipelago is void. This has clear implications for the agreement between the United Kingdom/United States. Further consequences flow from the serious nature of the United Kingdom’s internationally wrongful conduct. All States are under an obligation to co-operate to bring an end to the United Kingdom’s unlawful administration of the Chagos Archipelago. Moreover, all States are under an obligation not to recognize as lawful the situation created by the United Kingdom’s continued administration of the Chagos Archipelago and not to render aid or assistance in maintaining the illegal situation.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">There is a yet further difficulty confronting the Appellants.  Even if this Court had been free to conclude that Article 56 was not a bar to the applicability of the ECHR (and that Article 1 applied and brought Article 8 and A1P1 into play), it is by no means clear that this would have had any, or any material, effect upon the outcome of <span style="font-style:italic">Bancoult (No 2)</span>.  There it was accepted that there was an “<span style="font-style:italic">important</span>” common law right of abode (paragraph 45), even though the argument advanced that the right was absolute and indefeasible was rejected.  The way in which the House of Lords described and applied that important right is analogous to the manner in which rights conferred under A1P1 and Article 8 would have been addressed: it was accepted that the Chagossians had a right of abode and that it was “<span style="font-style:italic">important</span>”; it was held that the right was not absolute; it was accepted that there had nonetheless been a serious historical violation of that right; it was held that in determining the relief to be granted the asserted right to actual resettlement had to be weighed against competing interests including the practicability of observing the right; and, it was accepted that, absent enforcement of a right of resettlement, reparation or compensation was due for the serious violation of the right (and had been paid). We detect no real difference between the approach that the House of Lords applied to the right of abode and the way in which A1P1 and Article 8 would have been dealt with had they been applicable.  Our conclusion is supported by the approach of the ECtHR in <span style="font-style:italic">Chagos Islanders v United Kingdom</span> (ibid), where the Applicants were seeking vindication of rights under the ECHR (see paragraphs 105ff above).  The Court (in paragraph 81) expressly rejected the admissibility of the applications of the Chagos islanders upon the basis that they had either been compensated or that the applicants had been accorded a fair chance to seek redress in the domestic courts.  In so finding the Court was aware that the right that had been breached, and for which a remedy by way of compensation had been paid in the domestic courts, was the <span style="font-style:italic">different</span> common law right of abode, and not Article 8 or A1P1.  In describing the basis upon which compensation had been paid or offered the Court nonetheless referred to “<span style="font-style:italic">damages flowing from the expulsion and exclusion from their homes</span>” and clearly treated this as a sufficient proxy for compensation payable more directly under the ECHR itself.    </p>

In oral argument Mr Jaffey QC for the Appellants did accept that neither the Advisory Opinion nor the UN Resolution sounded in law independently from the ECHR; Ms Kaufmann QC in her submissions did though equate customary international law with domestic common law and the Advisory Opinion and the UN Resolution did creep into an oral argument that the common law should recognise a right of resettlement, as had been forcibly argued in written submissions.

The presumption reflects the policy of the common law that it should be in alignment with the common customary law applicable between nations. The position is different from that in relation to unincorporated treaty obligations, which do not in general alter domestic law. In part, since the making of treaties is a matter for the executive, this reflects the principle that the Crown has no power to alter domestic law by its unilateral action: see <span style="font-style:italic">J.H. Rayner (Mincing Lane) Ltd v Department of Trade and Industry </span>[1990] 2 AC 418, 499-500 (Lord Oliver) and <span style="font-style:italic">R (Miller) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union</span> [2017] UKSC 5 [2017] 2 WLR 583. The common law is more receptive to the adoption of rules of customary international law because of the very demanding nature of the test to establish whether a rule of customary international law exists: see above. That is not something that the Crown can achieve by its own unilateral action by simple agreement with one other state. Accordingly, in the case of a rule of customary international law the presumption is that it will be treated as incorporated into the common law unless there is some reason of constitutional principle why it should not be. In the case of an obligation in an unincorporated treaty the relevant rule is the opposite of this, namely that it will not be recognised in the common law.” </p>

The decision called for “<span style="font-style:italic">anxious scrutiny</span>” because there is a well-recognised right of abode in the common law, which existed in the BIOT before 2004. Its removal in 2004 by the 2004 Immigration Ordinance did not remove the need for “<span style="font-style:italic">anxious scrutiny</span>”, particularly in circumstances where it was clear that the Chagossians had a right to selfdetermination as identified by the ICJ in the Advisory Opinion at paragraph 181 and therefore a right to return.     </p>

Nonetheless, <span style="font-style:italic">ex parte Smith </span>remains good law, and the Appellants submit that the Divisional Court should have applied a standard of review of “<span style="font-style:italic">anxious scrutiny</span>”. On this point we agree with the Divisional Court that this was not a decision which should be subjected to “<span style="font-style:italic">anxious scrutiny</span>” within the meaning of the test set out in <span style="font-style:italic">ex parte Smith.  </span>This is because there was no “<span style="font-style:italic">interference with human rights</span>”.  As the House of Lords observed in <span style="font-style:italic">Bancoult (No.2), </span>the “<span style="font-style:italic">important</span>” right of abode had been satisfied by the payment of compensation.<span style="font-style:italic">  </span> Mr Bancoult had been prevented from returning to the Chagos Islands in 1968 after his family had travelled to Mauritius for hospital treatment and Ms Hoareau had been removed from Diego Garcia to the Seychelles in about 1971.  Thereafter, as Lord Rodger had noted in <span style="font-style:italic">Bancoult (No.2) </span>at paragraph 112 “… <span style="font-style:italic">the economic conditions and infrastructure which had once supported the Chagossian way of life has ceased to exist </span>…”.  The removal of the right to remain and return in the case of both Mr Bancoult and Ms Hoareau was wrongful.  Compensation was offered to those who were victims of the wrongful removal. Any further right to return to the Chagos Islands had been removed by the 2004 Orders, the legality of which was upheld in <span style="font-style:italic">Bancoult (No.2)</span>.  The decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Bancoult (No.4), </span>which affirmed the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Bancoult (No.2), </span>did not alter this conclusion.  It is right that reference was made in <span style="font-style:italic">Bancoult (No.4) </span>to the 2012 review and that this might give rise to a decision the legality of which might be reviewed by the Court.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">We should record that this point is, in our judgment, a narrow one.  It appears to proceed upon the premise that, unless a claim relates to an interference with human rights as set out in <span style="font-style:italic">ex parte Smith,</span> the Courts will not examine the issue closely nor “<span style="font-style:italic">anxiously</span>”. We consider that this premise is flawed.  As we set out above, the Divisional Court was correct to find that there was no extant human rights issue.  This does not mean, however, that a court will refrain from considering a matter closely if it raises issues of real importance to individuals.  The Courts do not maintain any rigid classification or taxonomy of rights which is then used to govern the intensity of the scrutiny.  In recent years the Courts have accepted that the more important the right the greater the care that will be taken by the courts to examine the reasoning behind the challenged decision.  This was the approach of the House of Lords in <span style="font-style:italic">Bancoult (No 2)</span> where Lord Hoffmann stated that it did not “<span style="font-style:italic">assist</span>” to classify the right of abode as a “<span style="font-style:italic">constitutional right</span>” but that it was nonetheless correct to describe it as an “<span style="font-style:italic">important right</span>” (see paragraph 45).  </p>

As the point was argued, however, we will express our view on it.  The Appellants rely upon the statement of Buxton LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">WM (DRC) v Secretary of State for the Home Department </span>[2006] EWCA Civ 1495, [2007] Imm AR 337, which addressed whether further materials amounted to a “<span style="font-style:italic">fresh claim</span>” for the purposes of rule 353 of the Immigration Rules.  Rule 353 required the Secretary of State to assess whether further materials were significantly different from the materials relied on in an earlier application to the Secretary of State and, if so, whether the further materials created “<span style="font-style:italic">a realistic prospect of success in a further asylum claim</span>”.  This meant that the Secretary of State had to consider the approach to be taken by the adjudicator (now the First-Tier Tribunal Judge in the Immigration and Asylum Chamber).  It was in this context that Buxton LJ said that “… <span style="font-style:italic">since asylum is in issue the consideration of all the decision-makers, the Secretary of State, the adjudicator and the court, must be informed by the anxious scrutiny of the material that is axiomatic in decisions that if made incorrectly may lead to the appellant’s exposure to persecution</span>.”  Reference was then made to <span style="font-style:italic">Bugdaycay</span>.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">In our view Buxton LJ was right in that case to note that “<span style="font-style:italic">anxious scrutiny</span>” was required by the adjudicator and court because of the dicta in <span style="font-style:italic">Bugdaycay </span>and the fact that it was an asylum claim and therefore a decision taken in a human rights context.  Further, the judge was right to extend the requirement of anxious scrutiny to the Secretary of State because the Secretary of State was required to assess the prospect of success of the asylum claim before the adjudicator and Courts.  We do not consider, however, that Buxton LJ’s statement is support for the wider proposition that every decision maker has to apply “<span style="font-style:italic">anxious scrutiny</span>” or some equivalent heightened process of evaluation to any decision made in a human rights context, let alone comply with procedural requirements suggested by Ms Kaufmann QC, such as to list points for and against those with an interest in the decision.

The principle of anxious scrutiny, and more generally the principle that the greater the intrusion into the rights of individuals the more closely the court will examine the reasoning behind the intrusion, are essentially descriptions of a judicial process. On the other hand, logically the more important the decision the more care is likely to be required to be taken by the decision maker to produce a rational decision.  If a court applies a heightened level of scrutiny to a decision because of its deep importance and impact upon the lives of citizens and finds fault with the decision and remits it to be taken again, it must follow that the decision maker must apply greater care than before to reflect the judgment and its recognition of the importance of the decision.

Further, a mistake made about a fact might give rise to such unfairness as to be a basis for quashing a decision if it is a mistake as to an existing fact, which was established (in the sense that the fact was uncontentious and objectively verifiable), which mistake was not created by the applicant, and which mistake must have played a material part in the reasoning, see <span style="font-style:italic">E v Secretary of State for the Home Department </span>[2004] EWCA Civ 49, [2004] QB 1044, at paragraph 66.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">It also relevant to note that this is an appeal by way of review and not re-hearing, see CPR 52.21(1).  This Court can only overturn a finding of fact made by the court below if we conclude that it was wrong: see CPR 52.21(3).  In proceedings for judicial review the facts are often not in dispute, and they are often adduced to illustrate the context and effect of the decision.  Where, however, findings of fact have been made in judicial review proceedings, including evaluative findings about whether mistakes of facts were made, or whether certain facts were material, the approach by an appellate court to reviewing findings of fact in judicial review cases should and does mirror the approach by appellate courts to findings of fact generally.  In such cases it is established that appellate courts should be cautious in overturning findings of fact made by first instance judges. This is because first instance judges will have taken into account the whole "<span style="font-style:italic">sea of the evidence</span>” rather than indulged in impermissible "<span style="font-style:italic">island hopping</span>" to parts only of the evidence: compare <span style="font-style:italic">Fage v Chobani UK Ltd</span> [2014] EWCA Civ 5.  In this case at first instance the claim proceeded over five full days, whereas the appeal lasted three full days.  Further there were 16 open bundles of documents and two closed bundles of documents before the Divisional Court, whereas the parties on appeal had managed to reduce the documents to one core bundle and two supplementary appeal bundles, and small bundles of closed materials.  </p>

This approach applies even where, as here, there was no live witness evidence at first instance and the proceedings were by way of judicial review: see <span style="font-style:italic">R (BT) v HM Treasury </span>[2020] EWCA Civ 1, [2020] Pens LR 12, at paragraphs 45-47 adopting the approach set out in <span style="font-style:italic">Smech Properties Ltd v Runnymede Borough Council </span>[2016] EWCA Civ 42 at paragraph 27.

It held in paragraph 312 of its judgment that the figure of £40 million was always approximate and indicative only. It was never a finalised amount as appeared from the documents.  In paragraph 318 the Divisional Court found that Ministers were not materially misled and specifically noted that there had never been a suggestion that the Chagossians in the Seychelles would be excluded from support.  We can see no basis from any of the materials which are before us to show that the conclusion of the Divisional Court was wrong.  This is because the figure of £40 million was to cover all of the Chagossians, including those in Seychelles, and was understood to be approximate.  This was part proved by the DfID submission to Ministers on 24 August 2016 in which it was noted that DfID was preparing the outline of a combined DfID/FCO package.  The briefing to the Prime Minister on which so much reliance was placed was one document in the whole process, which concluded with a writeround before the final decision.  If there had previously been any misstatement, it was put right before the final decision because the final write-round referred accurately to “<span style="font-style:italic">a support package which – following further policy work – is now suggested to amount to around £40 million</span>”.
