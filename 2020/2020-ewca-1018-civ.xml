	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The injunction follows an undertaking given by Koza Ltd earlier in the proceedings not to use its assets otherwise than in the ordinary and proper course of business.  There is a dispute between the parties as to whether the funding falls within that exception, which has already been considered by this Court ([2019] EWCA Civ 891).  This Court decided that the issue could not be definitively resolved either way on the basis of the written evidence in that application.  It was common ground that it was equally incapable of definitive resolution on the injunction application before the Judge.  The Judge granted the injunction on the grounds that he had a high degree of assurance that the funding would be a breach of the undertaking and the balance of least irremediable prejudice clearly favoured it.  The application for permission to appeal against his decision was adjourned to the full Court for a rolled up hearing of the application and, if granted, the appeal itself.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The proceedings involve a dispute over control of Koza Ltd.  Koza Ltd is an English company incorporated on 24 March 2014 and capitalised by the respondent, Koza Altin, with £60m to carry out mining operations outside Turkey including ventures with other established international mining companies.  Mr Ipek was one of its two directors and is now its sole director.  Koza Altin is its immediate parent company owning all the equity shareholding. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Koza Altin is a Turkish company which is part publicly owned and part owned directly and indirectly by Mr Ipek and members of his family.  It is not, however, currently controlled by Mr Ipek or his family.  Mr Ipek says that the Turkish Government has illegally expropriated the Koza Group’s assets for political reasons and has pursued a concerted campaign of harassment and oppression against the group and its shareholders and employees, including pursuing criminal proceedings against Mr Ipek and his family on the basis of allegations which Mr Ipek says are spurious. The Republic of Turkey sought the extradition of Mr Ipek from England to Turkey, but such extradition was refused on the grounds that the criminal proceedings against him in Turkey were politically motivated. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In proceedings in Turkey relating to the criminal investigation into the Koza Group, on 26 October 2015 the Fifth Ankara Criminal Peace judge appointed certain individuals as trustees of Koza Altin and 21 other Turkish companies in the group, pursuant to article 133 of the Turkish Criminal Procedure Code, with power to control the affairs of those companies in place of the existing management.  Pursuant to further decisions of that judge dated 13 January and 3 March 2016, five individuals were appointed as the trustees of Koza Altin.  In September 2016 the trustees were replaced by the Tasarruf Mevduati Sigorta Fonu, the Savings Deposit Insurance Fund of Turkey (“the SDIF”) as the single trustee of Koza Altin.  The SDIF has appointed various individuals to the board of Koza Altin.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In order to defend his control of Koza Ltd, in September 2015 Mr Ipek caused a number of changes to be made to Koza Ltd's constitution and share structure. Resolutions were passed to create a new class of "A" shares and to amend Koza Ltd's articles of association to introduce a new article 26 which purported to preclude any further changes to the articles of association or any change of directors save with the prior written consent of the holders of the "A" shares. Two "A" shares were issued, one to Mr Ipek and one to his brother. </p>

IIL is an English company.  Its interest in the Koza Group is said to arise pursuant to a share purchase agreement dated 7 June 2015 (“the SPA”), under which members of the Ipek family sold their shares in Koza-Ipek Holding AS, the Turkish holding company for the Koza Group, to IIL, in return for IIL issuing shares to the Ipek family, the effect of which would be to insert between the Ipek family and the group an English holding company.  The significance of the effective holding company for the group becoming an English company is that it introduced the international element relied upon by IIL to confer jurisdiction on the ICSID tribunal under the bilateral treaty between the English and Turkish governments.  The authenticity of the SPA is disputed by the Republic of Turkey in the Arbitration and by Koza Altin in the current proceedings.  It is alleged by them to be a sham and backdated document fraudulently created for the purpose of founding ICSID jurisdiction.  The Republic of Turkey contends in the Arbitration, and Koza Altin contends in these proceedings, that the insertion of IIL under what they allege to be a fraudulent SPA, is the only basis for the jurisdiction of the ICSID tribunal, which otherwise would be concerned with a dispute solely between the Turkish Government and Turkish individuals and companies. The appellants maintain the authenticity of the SPA but further contend that the jurisdiction of the tribunal does not depend upon its authenticity, arguing that it is only one factor and that the share transfer itself, although unregistered, is sufficient to found jurisdiction irrespective of the authenticity of the SPA.  The issue of jurisdiction in the Arbitration will be dealt with by the tribunal as a preliminary issue, with a hearing currently scheduled to take place from 14 to 18 September 2020.   </p>

Koza Ltd also contended that the arbitration would prevent the enforcement of a seizure order granted by the Turkish courts of funds belonging to Koza Ltd and held in the client account of its then solicitors, Morgan Lewis &amp; Bockius LLP.  Koza Altin argued that the Funding was prohibited by the Undertaking on the grounds (a) that any payment made for the purposes of relying on the SPA was not a proper use of Koza Ltd's funds because the SPA was "a sham and backdated, created in order to engineer a position in which IIL can attempt to bring an ICSID arbitration"; (b) that the proposed arbitration was wholly or substantially concerned with furthering the interests of the Ipek family and would not be of commercial benefit to Koza Ltd; (c) that there were serious issues about the jurisdiction of the ICSID tribunal to hear the dispute even if the SPA was authentic; and (d) that the evidence did not establish that Koza Ltd was the only source of funds available to IIL. </p>

He accepted that it was at the lowest seriously arguable that success for IIL in the Arbitration would provide the commercial funding benefits to Koza Ltd which it claimed, and so could qualify as in the ordinary and proper course of Koza Ltd’s business; that the authenticity of the SPA was open to very serious doubt; that he was not satisfied on the evidence that IIL had no alternative source of funding; and that the SPA, even if authentic, did not confer jurisdiction on the ICSID tribunal as a qualifying investment under the bilateral treaty; and that accordingly the expenditure was not permitted by the terms of the Undertaking.  He also held that there should be no variation of the Undertaking on the grounds that there had been no material change of circumstance since it had been given. He therefore declined to make the positive declaration sought by Koza Ltd in relation to the Funding or to vary the Undertaking to permit it.   Instead he made a negative declaration that the Funding would not be in the ordinary and proper course of business within the meaning of the Undertaking.  This was at the request of the appellants, not Koza Altin who had not sought such a negative declaration and was content with a simple dismissal of the appellants’ application for a positive declaration that the expenditure was permissible, but was the logical consequence of the Judge’s finding on the jurisdiction issue. </p>

It is not necessary for me to rehearse all the arguments which led the judge to hold that the authenticity of the SPA was open to very serious doubt. On the basis of those arguments, which were repeated before us, the judge was plainly correct to reach that conclusion, and was in no position to accept the SPA as definitely authentic. Equally, in my judgment, he was correct not to go on and decide the very serious allegations against Koza Ltd and Mr Ipek which were engaged by the authenticity issue. What is clear is that, once there is accepted to be a seriously arguable case that the SPA was a forgery, as the respondent alleges, it was impossible for the deputy judge to declare, in advance of the expenditure being made, that the expenditure was in the ordinary and proper course of Koza Ltd's business. The court plainly should not lend its authority to a transaction by granting a positive declaration that it is in the ordinary and proper course of business when there is a real possibility that the transaction is a fraudulent one. </p>

Ownership of the shares is governed by Turkish law, as to which there is no evidence. I do not think this argument provides a route to a potentially viable arbitration claim in the absence of the SPA. It follows that the positive declaration falls out of the picture. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.00in">In relation to what he termed the balance of convenience, the Judge referred to the summary of the principles by Lord Hoffmann in <span style="font-style:italic">National Commercial Bank v Olint </span>and his statement at paragraph [19] that the underlying principle is that the court should take whichever course seems likely to cause the least irremediable prejudice to one party or the other (Judgment [89]).  He determined that if Koza Altin were right but the injunction were refused, it would suffer the prejudice of a £3m depletion in Koza Ltd’s assets and so in its shareholding (Judgment [89, 93]), for which damages would not be an adequate remedy.  It was artificial to compare that £3m figure with the size of the claim in the ICSID Arbitration of US$5-6 billion, even if all went to plan for the success of that claim, because what Koza Ltd might receive from any success would depend on IIL’s allocation of its recoveries and might not result in any financial benefit to Koza Ltd itself (Judgment [93]).  But in any event, if the injunction were to be granted, it would be likely that IIL would be able to fund the Arbitration by the use of resources which the Judge inferred from the evidence were available to Mr Ipek, evidence which he set out in some detail (Judgment [89], [96]-[98] and [39]).  This included the fact that Mr Ipek had refused to explain the evidence suggestive of the availability of substantial assets or to give any details of his assets, which the Judge regarded as significant on this issue applying the principles enunciated by Lord Sales in <span style="font-style:italic">Sarpd oil International Ltd v Addax Energy SA &amp; another</span> [2016] 1 CLC 336 at [19]-[20] in the context of applications for security for costs and <span style="font-style:italic">Yorke Motors v Edwards</span> [1982] 1 WLR 444, 449B-E in the context of arguments that requiring payment into court as a condition of leave to defend a claim on a summary judgment application would stifle the ability to conduct the defence.  Mr Ipek’s explanation for this failure was a fear that there would be a leak to the Turkish authorities who would then seek to expropriate any such assets or use the information to further oppress him and his family.  MdR had sought to meet this concern by offering a confidentiality club comprising only UK lawyers to which such disclosure would be confined.  This was flatly rejected by Mr Ipek for what the Judge described as extremely unimpressive and unsatisfactory reasons (Judgment [101]-[103]).  The Judge also concluded that Koza Altin’s cross-undertaking in damages was sufficient to cater for the speculative loss which Koza Ltd might suffer in the unlikely event of the injunction having the effect of stifling pursuit of a valid claim in the Arbitration (unlikely both because of the availability of alternative sources of funding and the merits of the authenticity issue).   His conclusion was that the balance of convenience came down clearly in favour of grant of an injunction and that there was a far greater risk of irremediable injustice if the injunction were refused than if it were granted (Judgment [109]).  </p>

The plea of res judicata applies, except in special cases, not only to points upon which the court was actually required by the parties to form an opinion and pronounce a judgment, but to every point which properly belonged to the subject of litigation, and which the parties, exercising reasonable diligence, might have brought forward at the time." </p>

But <span style="font-style:italic">Henderson v Henderson</span> abuse of process, as now understood, although separate and distinct from cause of action estoppel and issue estoppel, has much in common with them. The underlying public interest is the same: that there should be finality in litigation and that a party should not be twice vexed in the same matter. This public interest is reinforced by the current emphasis on efficiency and economy in the conduct of litigation, in the interests of the parties and the public as a whole. The bringing of a claim or the raising of a defence in later proceedings may, without more, amount to abuse if the court is satisfied (the onus being on the party alleging abuse) that the claim or defence should have been raised in the earlier proceedings if it was to be raised at all. I would not accept that it is necessary, before abuse may be found, to identify any additional element such as a collateral attack on a previous decision or some dishonesty, but where those elements are present the later proceedings will be much more obviously abusive, and there will rarely be a finding of abuse unless the later proceeding involves what the court regards as unjust harassment of a party. It is, however, wrong to hold that because a matter could have been raised in earlier proceedings it should have been, so as to render the raising of it in later proceedings necessarily abusive. That is to adopt too dogmatic an approach to what should in my opinion be a broad, merits-based judgment which takes account of the public and private interests involved and also takes account of all the facts of the case, focusing attention on the crucial question whether, in all the circumstances, a party is misusing or abusing the process of the court by seeking to raise before it the issue which could have been raised before. As one cannot comprehensively list all possible forms of abuse, so one cannot formulate any hard and fast rule to determine whether, on given facts, abuse is to be found or not………..While the result may often be the same, it is in my view preferable to ask whether in all the circumstances a party's conduct is an abuse than to ask whether the conduct is an abuse and then, if it is, to ask whether the abuse is excused or justified by special circumstances. Properly applied, and whatever the legitimacy of its descent, the rule has in my view a valuable part to play in protecting the interests of justice.” </p>

Those allegations were investigated by the trial judge, Bridge J, in a lengthy voir dire and rejected.  The defendants were convicted and unsuccessfully appealed.  They were much later acquitted, upon a further reference of their case to the Court of Appeal Criminal Division.  But long before that, they brought proceedings against the police for damages for assault, making the same allegations of violence and threats of violence which were directly contrary to the findings of the criminal trial judge on the voir dire.

None of the material relied on had come to their attention subsequently; Cooke J had given them an opportunity to raise any objections to the shares as fortification, but they had not raised the points now sought to be raised, although they were well known to them; there had been no significant or material change of circumstances [81].

The Claimants' counsel, Mr Trace QC, had submitted that all that he needed to show was the usual prerequisites for a freezing order, namely a good arguable case on the merits, a real risk of dissipation and that the balance of convenience favoured the grant of the order [18].

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in;margin-right:0.00in">42.<span style="font-family:Arial"> </span>In my judgement the tension is more apparent than real.  The <span style="font-style:italic">Henderson</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Hunter</span> principles apply to interlocutory hearings as much as to final hearings.  Many interlocutory hearings acutely engage the court’s duty to ensure efficient case management and the public interest in the best use of court resources.  Therefore the application of the principles will often mean that if a point is open to a party on an interlocutory application and is not pursued, then the applicant cannot take the point at a subsequent interlocutory hearing in relation to the same or similar relief, absent a significant and material change of circumstances or his becoming aware of facts which he did not know and could not reasonably have discovered at the time of the first hearing.    This is not a departure from the principle in <span style="font-style:italic">Johnson v Gore Wood</span> that it is not sufficient to establish that a point <span style="font-style:italic">could</span> have been taken on an earlier occasion, but a recognition that where it <span style="font-style:italic">should</span> have been taken then, a significant change of circumstances or new facts will be required if raising it on a subsequent application is not to be abusive.  The dictum in <span style="font-style:italic">Woodhouse v Consignia</span> that the principle should be applied less strictly in interlocutory cases is best understood as a recognition that because interlocutory decisions may involve less use of court time and expense to the parties, and a lower risk of prejudice from irreconcilable judgments, than final hearings, it may sometimes be harder for a respondent in an interlocutory hearing to persuade the court that the raising of the point in a subsequent application is abusive as offending the public interest in finality in litigation and efficient use of court resources, and fairness to the respondent in protecting it from vexation and harassment.  The court will also have its own interest in interlocutory orders made to ensure efficient preparations for an orderly trial irrespective of the past conduct of one of the parties, which may justify revisiting a procedural issue one party ought to have raised on an earlier occasion.  There is, however, no general principle that the applicant in interlocutory hearings is entitled to greater indulgence; nor is there a different test to be applied to interlocutory hearings.  In every case the principles are those identified in paragraphs [30] to [40] above, the application of which will reflect that within a single set of proceedings, a party should generally bring forward in argument all points reasonably available to him at the first opportunity, and that to allow him to take them serially in subsequent applications would generally permit abuse in the form of unfair harassment of the other party and obstruction of the efficacy of the judicial process by undermining the necessary finality of unappealed interlocutory decisions. </p>

There is a considerable overlap between the Funding Application and the Injunction Application.  Not only were both broadly concerned with the same central purpose, namely whether Koza Ltd should be allowed to fund the Arbitration, but there was a substantial overlap in the evidence and issues which arose in each application.  In each application it was necessary to put forward the same substantial material by way of background and context.  In each application the courts were asked to consider whether the Funding would be a breach of the Undertaking, including addressing the merits of the authenticity issue, and whether alternative sources of funding were available, both of which questions occupied a significant part of the evidence and argument on each occasion.  The mere fact of such duplication, and that it could have been avoided had the injunction application been made to Mr Spearman, is not, however, determinative of the abuse issue.  The first critical question is whether the Injunction Application should have been brought before Mr Spearman.  If it should, then I would regard the bringing of it in a separate and subsequent application as an abuse.  If, however, it cannot be said that it should have been brought then, I would not regard it as an abuse, given the important article 6 rights of access to justice emphasised by Lord Millett in <span style="font-style:italic">Johnson v Gore Wood</span>, unless it amounts to an abusive collateral attack on the Court of Appeal decision, which is the second critical question.

Koza Ltd made the application for a declaration that it was entitled to fund, or alternatively a variation to permit it, and did not fund or threaten to fund whilst the application was pending at first instance or on appeal.  Koza Altin’s rhetorical question “Why make the application if the intention was to fund anyway?” is pertinent.  Indeed at one point in the course of his submissions to us, when addressing the degree of overlap between the two applications, Mr Flynn submitted that “…on the prior occasion we debated over several days before Mr Spearman …whether the ICSID funding could be made.  True, we did so in the context of our application for a declaration regarding the undertaking or variation of it, but the <span style="font-style:italic">whole point</span> of the exercise was to ascertain whether or not Koza Ltd could make the ICSID expenditure (my emphasis).”  Yet his submission on <span style="font-style:italic">Henderson</span> abuse amounts to saying that Koza Altin should not have assumed that this was the whole point of the exercise, and should have appreciated that Koza Ltd would go ahead with the Funding whichever of the three outcomes which were available to Mr Spearman was adopted by him, namely positive declaration, variation, or refusal of relief.   </p>

Mr Ipek was therefore confirming that funding was subject to the outcome of the Funding Application, as the appellants accepted before the Judge and in the skeleton argument on this appeal.  Since the only outcomes contemplated at the time of the application to Mr Spearman were a positive declaration, a variation, or the refusal of either relief, funding would not have depended on the outcome if it was to be made in the last of these possibilities, since it would clearly be made in the event of either of the other two.   Koza Altin was entitled to assume that what this meant was that the funding would only be made if the Funding Application was successful and Koza Ltd obtained the prior sanction of a positive declaration in its favour or a variation. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Flynn advanced a number of criticisms of this reasoning, which is essentially the same as that of the Judge.  He submitted that the answer to the rhetorical question was as follows.  Koza Ltd considered that it had good commercial reasons for funding the ICSID claim for the purposes of the Undertaking.  Koza Ltd wanted to have the comfort of the Court on this point.  However those in control of Koza Altin had taken (and continue to take) an extremely narrow and aggressive view of what projects and investments are permitted by the Undertaking and made very clear that they thought it would not be for the commercial benefit of Koza Ltd to fund the ICSID claim and that the Funding would be a breach of the Undertaking upon that basis.  It was for this reason that much of the evidence filed in support of the Funding Application was devoted to showing why it would be of commercial benefit to Koza Ltd to fund the ICSID Claim. This was a major issue on the Funding Application, as it was on the appeal. Both Mr Spearman and the Court of Appeal held that, subject to the jurisdiction point (at first instance only) and the authenticity point (at first instance and on appeal), the Funding would be permitted by the Undertaking because it would be within the ordinary and proper course of Koza Ltd’s business.  Koza Ltd thus obtained the comfort it was primarily looking for on the Funding Application.  It did not regard the jurisdiction point as a proper obstacle to the ICSID Funding - a view vindicated by the Court of Appeal - or the authenticity point either, because the relevant facts are all within its sole director’s knowledge and he is sure that the point is ill-founded.  This is why Koza Ltd wants to proceed with the Funding even though it did not obtain a positive declaration or variation on the Funding Application.  The only obstacle to a positive declaration was the authenticity point and Koza Ltd knows there is nothing in it. Aside from that, Koza Ltd has the comfort of knowing that funding the ICSID claim would not be a breach of the Undertaking on grounds that it would not be within the proper and ordinary course of its business. The Funding Application was made principally to establish that point.  Mr Flynn submitted that this was a complete answer to the rhetorical question.  It lay clearly in the evidence before the Judge but he did not see it.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Flynn further submitted that whether or not such an assumption on Koza Altin’s part would have been reasonable, there is no evidence that it in fact made any such assumption.  This is not a fair point.  During the exchange of evidence, the closest that the appellants came to identifying that an argument of abuse of process would be advanced was in a passage in Ms Lamb QC’s first witness statement relying upon what was said at paragraph [48] of Floyd LJ’s judgment (wrongly identified as paragraph [47]) which was essentially that the application was a collateral attack on that finding, although it did not use that expression.  There was no foreshadowing in the appellants’ evidence of a <span style="font-style:italic">Henderson</span> abuse argument that a cross-application should have been made to Mr Spearman.  That submission was identified for the first time once the skeleton argument for the hearing was served.  In the course of the oral argument dealing with the point at the hearing Mr Crow QC, appearing for Koza Altin, made a submission in terms that Koza Altin was entitled to <span style="font-style:italic">and did</span> make this assumption.  There was no objection from Mr Flynn then or at any stage before the Judge that this was unsupported by the evidence.  The Judge gave the parties the opportunity to put in further evidence after the conclusion of the hearing on a number of issues, and had the present objection been taken at the time, no doubt Koza Altin would have recorded in a witness statement what must have been submitted on instructions. Indeed the overwhelming probabilities must be that Koza Altin did indeed make that assumption given that the Injunction Application was subsequently made.  There is no suggestion of dishonesty on Koza Altin’s part in deliberately holding it back or otherwise, and it is difficult to imagine why it would have sought to do so had it indeed appreciated at the time of the application to Mr Spearman that Koza Ltd would go ahead with the Funding even if it didn’t get its positive declaration or variation.  No reason was suggested, and although what Mr Kitchener told us about the penny dropping only when Lord Falconer positively advocated a “grey” result as a fall back in the Court of Appeal is not in the evidence, it is consistent with all the other evidence.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in;margin-right:0.00in">At is simplest, the argument is that what the Court of Appeal was asked to do was to determine whether the Funding should be permitted by determining whether it would be a breach of the Undertaking; it made a positive decision that it could not prevent the Funding by way of the negative declaration which Koza Altin sought; and that what Koza Altin is now seeking to achieve is the same result by way of injunction, and therefore a collateral attack on that decision.  Mr Flynn developed his argument by submitting that the practical outcome of the Court of Appeal’s refusal of both the positive and negative declarations sought was that Koza Ltd should be free to fund the Arbitration at its own risk, something which Floyd LJ said in terms at paragraph [48] of his judgment was a matter for its own decision at its own risk.  The injunction prevents such conduct and so is a collateral attack upon the decision.  The Injunction Application posits that the court can and should prevent the funding in circumstances where it cannot decide definitively that it would be a breach of the Undertaking, whereas the Court of Appeal decided that in such circumstances it was for Koza Ltd to determine whether to proceed with the funding.   Moreover, he submitted, an injunction would subvert the carefully agreed regime put in place by the Asplin Order, whereby Koza Altin agreed to leave Mr Ipek in control of Koza Ltd pending the trial subject only to undertakings designed to give transparency, and therefore free to take business decisions such as this one.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in;margin-right:0.00in">This is a formidable argument, but I am afraid I am unable to accept it.  The Court of Appeal was not asked to allow or prevent the Funding as such, but to determine by way of declaration that the Funding definitely was or definitely was not a breach of the Undertaking.  That was all it was asked to decide.  It decided on the evidence that it could do neither.  On an application for a positive declaration the defendant bears the burden of putting before the court the evidence necessary to enable the court to make the declaration it seeks; see <span style="font-style:italic">JSC BTA Bank v</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">Ablyazov No3</span> [2010] EWCA Civ 1141 at [79].  The converse is true of a claimant who seeks a negative declaration.  If in each case the party fails to fulfil the burden, the court cannot make any declaration.  That is what happened in this case. The Court was not engaged on the question whether the Funding could be enjoined on the hypothesis that the question of breach was arguable but unresolvable, which was what the Court determined, and all that it needed to determine for the purposes of the relief it was asked to grant. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in;margin-right:0.00in">It is therefore an unacceptable elision to say that the Court of Appeal was asked to decide whether the Funding should be permitted.   The relief sought on each side was a declaration.  Even a negative declaration would not in fact have been an order forbidding Koza Ltd from making the Funding, and had it done so in the face of such a declaration it would not have been in breach of any order made in the Funding Application.  Only an injunction could perform that function.  The Court was asked to decide by way of declarations whether the Funding was permissible as being within or without the terms of the Undertaking.  That is a narrower question than the wider question whether the court will make an order permitting or forbidding it if the narrower question cannot be resolved.  The Court was not asked to decide, and did not decide whether the Funding was to be permitted in circumstances where it could not definitively be decided whether it was within or without the terms of the Undertaking.  That is the territory held by injunctive relief, upon which the Court was not invited to enter. </p>

It is concerned with the consequences of that decision.  It takes as its starting point that there is an issue whether the Funding would be in breach of the Undertaking as something that cannot be definitively resolved on the documents, as the Court of Appeal held.  It builds upon such arguability by invoking the <span style="font-style:italic">Olint </span>principles of least irremediable prejudice.

In the Injunction Application the Judge was required to address the merits of the issue and to consider whether he had a high degree of assurance that it was inauthentic, which he did.  Although these expressions are at different points on the spectrum of arguability, I see no inconsistency between them.  The Court of Appeal did not need to go any further than Mr Spearman’s “very serious doubt” as justifying refusal of the positive declaration sought.  It is not inconsistent with that finding for another tribunal to have a high degree of assurance on the issue. </p>

In paragraph 47 of his judgment, set out above, Floyd LJ used the expression “in circumstances where it is not shown that IIL could fund the arbitration from other sources”.  If this paragraph stood alone it might well be thought that that was an important part of the reasoning for determining that the Funding would be permitted by the Undertaking but for the authenticity issue.  However in the previous paragraph, at [46], he describes it as “not a factor which carries much if any weight”, and in the context of the extradition expenses appeal, he accepted the finding of Morgan J that Mr Ipek could meet the expenses from </p>

If that be right, and the issue was largely or wholly irrelevant to the question to be decided by the Court on that occasion, there is nothing inconsistent with the decision in seeking to revisit the issue in the different context of least irremediable prejudice in an injunction application.  In any event, I do not see any necessary inconsistency between the dictum that it had not been shown that IIL could not fund the Arbitration from other sources and the submission made to, and accepted by, the Judge in the injunction application at [105] that it was likely that Mr Ipek had other resources available to make the funding.  Moreover even were there some room for conflict, which I do not think there is, I would not treat it as sufficient to make the Injunction Application abusive or an attack on the Court of Appeal decision.  In the Injunction Application this was simply one of many issues, and looking at the abuse question in the broad based merits way required, Koza Altin should not be debarred from the relief to which it would be entitled (on the assumptions to be made for the purposes of the abuse argument) merely because it asked the second court to say that other funds were available on the evidence it subsequently put before that court. </p>

It did so subject to their being in the ordinary and proper course of business with a regimen for prior notice to Koza Altin.  The obvious purpose of such prior notice was to enable Koza Altin to go to court if it thought there would be a breach of the Undertaking, and to seek an injunction to prevent it.

Nor does Mr Flynn contest that such jurisdiction extends to making ancillary orders for the purposes of enforcing or rendering effective undertakings.  The court’s interest in seeing that undertakings given to the court are complied with is no less than its interest in seeing that its orders are complied with.  He submits, however, that what has happened in this case is not the exercise of such a jurisdiction.  It cannot be said that the court is enforcing or rendering effective an undertaking when there is an issue as to whether what is restrained is a breach of the undertaking, at least where, as in this case, it is not a question of holding the ring whilst that issue is determined in this forum within a short period of time, but one where the issue is never going to be resolved in a forum which binds the parties.  Therefore, he argues, the injunction assumes that which is necessary to engage the jurisdiction, namely a breach of an undertaking given to the court, which is exactly what the Court of Appeal decision determines cannot be established.  </p>

This is a common feature of freezing orders.  They are expressed to apply generally to all the defendant’s assets and specifically to those identifiable at the time of the application.  If, as often occurs, further assets are found, they can be made the subject of further specific freezing orders so that third parties can be notified, thereby rendering the freezing order effective in relation to the specific assets.  The court is not required on each occasion to revisit the freezing order requirements as if it were granting an injunction for the first time.  It takes the existing freezing order over all assets as its starting point.   </p>

A defendant may give an undertaking to the court to refrain from conduct which the court could not or would not restrain by way of prohibitory injunction.  Equally a defendant may undertake to do something which the court could not or would not order it to perform by granting a mandatory injunction.  Both are a common experience in the many different circumstances in which interim injunctions are sought.  This happens when in the defendant’s perception it is only by giving such undertakings that it will avoid the grant of an interim injunction whose terms will have a more onerous or less welcome effect than the undertaking.  Indeed it is the appellants’ case that that is what happened in this case: Koza Ltd gave the Undertaking in return for the Asplin Order in circumstances in which Mr Flynn now argues that a freezing order in those terms is unavailable because it cannot be made in support of declaratory relief. </p>

It does not revisit whether the undertaking should have been given or whether an injunction could or would have been granted in equivalent terms.  It takes the undertaking, voluntarily given, as its starting point without searching for some original jurisdiction to make an equivalent order.  So if, for example a foreign bank undertakes to provide books and records held abroad, and fails to do so, it is no answer to an application for the provision of information about them that the court would not grant such an order by way of original jurisdiction: <span style="font-style:italic">Mackinnon v Donaldson Lufkin and Jenrette Securities Corporation</span> [1986] Ch 482.  So too if a defendant to a libel action undertakes not to publish until trial and subsequently threatens to do so, it is no answer to an application for an injunction to restrain him from a particular publication for him to say that he is running a defence of truth which normally precludes interlocutory relief.    </p>

The plaintiff brought an action to restrain the defendant from using its information relating to the construction of knitting machines and an order for delivery up of all the knitting machines similar to those made with the plaintiff’s information, together with parts, jigs patterns and drawings in relation to them.  On a motion for interlocutory relief, the defendant gave undertakings in the terms of the injunction and delivery up order sought, in return for the plaintiff agreeing to take no further steps in the action and pay money into court.  The plaintiff had reason to doubt whether the delivery up order had been complied with and sought an order for information on affidavit as to what drawings existed and for the delivery into escrow of any such drawings retained by the defendant.  The defendant argued that there was no power to make an interlocutory order for delivery up.  Danckwerts J accepted that the court might not have had jurisdiction to make the delivery up order on the motion, but that the undertaking having been given, such objection could not be maintained.

Normally the court will determine the issue of whether the threatened conduct is permitted by the undertaking or injunction in advance of trial.  But it may not be able to do so immediately.  In those cases it can exercise the jurisdiction to hold the ring until that can be done by giving the parties a fair opportunity to assemble the necessary evidence.  <span style="font-style:italic">VB Football Assets v Blackpool Football Club (Properties) Ltd</span> [2019] EWHC 3294 Ch is a recent example of the routine exercise of such a jurisdiction.  Again this does not involve revisiting the justification for making the original order.

The funds which would otherwise be spent on preparing for the jurisdiction hearing would be duplicated in this forum, which on neither side’s case would be a sensible use of the assets in dispute.   </p>

The court has developed principles catering for just such a situation when exercising its original jurisdiction to grant interim injunctions.  Cases not infrequently arise of “interim” injunction applications where the circumstances mean that the grant or refusal of relief will in practice be finally determinative.  In such situations the court does not say that it has no power to restrain a threatened invasion of a disputed right simply because there will never be a final determination of that issue.  Rather it recognises that the grant or refusal of the injunction will be a permanent and unjustified invasion of one party’s rights, and so grants or refuses an injunction on the basis of the least irremediable prejudice, recognising that there is a </p>

It is not necessary to cite extensive authority for this well- known practice and the applicable principles: see, for example: <span style="font-style:italic">NWL Ltd v Woods</span> [1979] 1 WLR 1294; <span style="font-style:italic">Lansing Linde v Kerr</span> [1991] 1 WLR 251; and <span style="font-style:italic">Forse v Secama Ltd</span> [2019] EWCA Civ 215.  There is still a threshold of a “serious issue to be tried” in the sense of a seriously arguable case that the threatened conduct is an invasion of the claimant’s rights even though, if the injunction be granted, there will never be a trial of that issue.  But the merits on the issue also come in at the discretionary stage of balancing the least irremediable prejudice and may be a very important part of that balancing exercise. </p>

Moreover and in any event the court has an interest in the performance of its orders and undertakings, just as a claimant has an interest in the performance of its private rights.  In each case the fact that the issue is not going to be determined, and that the injunction is in practice going to afford final relief, is an important factor in the exercise of discretion importing what will usually be a higher threshold on the merits of the issue.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">This is simply an aspect of the flexibility of the s. 37 jurisdiction which recognises that, although in a perfect world the court would resolve definitively all issues relevant to the grant of interlocutory relief, in practice it is often not possible or proportionate to do so.  For example a claimant seeking a freezing order may rely on conduct by the defendant in some transaction which has nothing to do with the claim in the action which is said to be fraudulent, for the purposes of seeking to establish a real risk of unjustified dissipation of assets.  The court does not seek to have that issue tried and resolved for the purpose of considering whether to grant a freezing order, but may take the evidence into account and form a provisional view as to the strength of the allegation of fraud based on the written evidence of the parties.  A similar approach applies in the exercise of the ancillary jurisdiction to render orders effective.  A claimant may seek further disclosure orders in support of a freezing order on the basis that there is a strongly arguable case that the defendant has breached the order.  That is a routine example of the exercise of the ancillary jurisdiction, sometimes characterised as doing what is necessary to “police the order”.  The court does not have to try the issue and find that there definitely has been a breach of the freezing order before it can order further disclosure: it proceeds upon a criterion of sufficient arguability, as the court commonly has to in many different interlocutory contexts.  There is no principle that the court cannot grant interlocutory relief unless it has reached a definitive resolution of an issue which is relied on to support the entitlement to relief.   </p>

However, the exercise of the jurisdiction in this case is not in substance a variation of the Asplin Order; nor of the Undertaking as part of the regime put in place under such order.  On the contrary, it does not seek to establish any greater entitlement than to restrain an alleged breach of the Undertaking, in fulfilment of the agreement reflected in that order.   </p>

However, the enhanced standard of proof is only required in contempt proceedings because they are quasicriminal in nature by virtue of the fact that they carry penal sanctions, including up to two years imprisonment.  No such sanction is in play in the current application and the issue of breach, if it were to be tried outside the context of contempt proceedings carrying penal sanctions, would be determined on the civil balance of probabilities, as indeed would a contractual claim for breach of an undertaking. </p>

Mr Flynn emphasised that the power must be exercised in accordance with principle, relying on what was said by Lord Nicholls in his dissenting judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Mercedes Benz AG v Leiduck</span> [1996] AC 284, in a passage at p. 308 cited more recently with approval by this Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Cartier International AG v British Sky Broadcasting Ltd</span> [2016] EWCA Civ 658, [2017] Bus LR 1 at [46]).  The passage was concerned to emphasise the width and flexibility of the s. 37 jurisdiction to adapt to changing conditions and standards, but I accept that its exercise must be principled.  Where a claimant has a proprietary claim to assets, there is obviously a principled basis for preserving those assets pending trial, and a proprietary freezing order is commonly granted in such circumstances.  In the present case Koza Altin has no proprietary claim as such to the assets in question: the Funding will be from assets owned by its subsidiary, Koza Ltd.   However, a parent company does have an interest in the use by its subsidiary of the latter’s assets because such use affects the value of its shareholding in the subsidiary, and such interest is proprietary in nature because the shareholding is a species of property.  It is, therefore, in accordance with principle that the court’s wide jurisdiction under section 37 should be exercisable to protect such a proprietary interest in appropriate circumstances.  Koza Altin’s proprietary interest in preserving the value of Koza Ltd’s assets, and the consequent value of its own shareholding, is a legitimate interest which is capable of justifying protection by the grant of a freezing order.   It is a separate question whether the circumstances justify the grant of such an injunction in any particular case; but the existence of a power to grant it is consistent with principle.  Indeed if Mr Flynn were right and there were no such power, it would leave an unfortunate gap in the court’s ability to do justice where the circumstances justified making such an order.   </p>

In that case Pumfrey J declined to continue freezing orders against the respondents, who were executive directors, in the absence of any substantive cause of action against them in the s. 459 proceedings. Those freezing orders were in respect of their personal assets. In the present case, the interim relief which is sought is designed to protect the assets of the Company from dissipation or further dissipation. No order is sought freezing the personal assets of Mr or Mrs Gershinson [a director and shareholder respectively]. Bearing in mind the other conclusions I have reached, it seems to me to be manifestly proper and sensible to grant such interim relief, protecting the assets of the Company pending the determination of the Petition. Indeed, Pumfrey J expressly acknowledged, at p.638e, that such an order might be made in s.459 proceedings, albeit he described it as “Mareva” relief. In so describing the relief, I believe that Pumfrey J was there referring to an order preventing further dissipation of the assets of the company.” </p>

Interim freezing orders in respect of personal assets were granted on a without notice application against a director of the company, and against another company and its directors.  The Commissioners did not claim any cause of action of its own against the respondents, nor did it undertake to bring any proceedings against them.  The injunctions were sought on the basis that when the company was wound up the liquidator would have substantial claims against them arising out of the fraud which he would be likely to pursue, the recovery of which would be for the benefit of the Commissioners as creditors.

If successful, it merely brings into existence a statutory scheme for the getting in and distribution of the company's assets among its stakeholders, of whom the petitioner is no more than a member of a particular class, namely an unsecured creditor. But in my judgment the particular nature of the relief sought by means of the presentation of a creditors' winding up petition does not disable the petitioner from asserting that it is pursuing a cause of action for the purpose of conferring jurisdiction upon the court to grant appropriate interim relief, whether by way of freezing order or otherwise.  </p>

That seems to me an irrational and unjust result and one which the court should avoid unless compelled to do otherwise. The authorities on interim relief in relation to company petitions have, happily, led me to the opposite conclusion, and therefore Miss Smith's “no cause of action” objection fails. The reason why freezing orders are not in practice sought or obtained in relation to the assets of companies the subject of creditors' winding up petitions is probably that statutory provisions such as those invalidating transactions after the presentation and/or advertisement of the petition generally afford appropriate protection to the company's creditors.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The grounds on which Mr Flynn seeks to distinguish the two cases are not germane to the principles which they identified and applied.  In the <span style="font-style:italic">Ravenhart</span> case, the reasoning at paragraph [102] was not dependent on there being a claim for final injunctive relief in the alternative.  The reasoning justified the granting of the freezing order in support of the claim for buy out at a fair value or a winding up.   In that case there were no money claims against the other director or shareholder, and their absence formed the very basis for the argument that there was no jurisdiction to grant the interlocutory relief, an argument which was rejected.   The absence of such a money claim was irrelevant because the injunction sought to restrain dealings with the assets of the company, not those of the individuals.  Protection of those assets was justified by the fact that the petitioner had an interest in the value of the company if it was wound up, or if his shareholding were to be bought out at fair value. What mattered was preserving the value of the company in circumstances in which the petitioner had a legitimate interest in such preservation.  </p>

But that was not sufficient in itself to found interlocutory relief at the suit of the claimant Customs Commissioners, because they had no such causes of action themselves.  Their only claim was a petition that the company be wound up.  The presentation of that creditors’ petition, however, created a sufficient legitimate interest as a stakeholder in the company, as Briggs J put it, which founded jurisdiction to grant interim freezing order relief.  The Commissioners had a legitimate interest in the preservation of the personal assets of the respondents because those assets might ultimately be amenable to recovery by the company through a claim brought on its behalf by the liquidator; and so the preservation of those assets was a legitimate target by way of protection of the Commissioners’ legitimate interest in the value of the company’s assets which was the subject matter of their winding up petition.  It was that legitimate interest in preserving assets potentially available to the company which could be afforded protection under the wide jurisdiction conferred by s. 37(1) of the 1981 Act. </p>

It would be a triumph of form over substance if the court were now to be deprived of the jurisdiction to grant interlocutory relief to preserve the company’s assets merely because Koza Ltd has not threatened such obstruction and so no quia timet injunction is yet justified.    </p>

The declaratory relief sought is designed to regain control of a company the disposition of whose assets directly affects the value of Koza Altin’s shareholding.  The declarations are remedies which are sought to vindicate existing rights to control, not rights which will arise at the conclusion of the trial: if Koza Altin be right on the merits of the counterclaim, it should be in control of Koza Ltd now; and in those circumstances its proprietary interest in the value of its shareholding would not need the court’s protection.  It is that arguable existing right vested in Koza Altin to enjoy control of the company, and thereby to enjoy its proprietary rights to its shareholding in the company, which is what provides a jurisdictional basis for preserving the assets of Koza Ltd at Koza Altin’s suit pending determination of the rights in issue in the counterclaim.   If Mr Flynn’s argument were correct, it would have the unfortunate consequence that the court would be powerless to prevent Mr Ipek asset stripping Koza Ltd so as to make the counterclaim not worth pursuing (in the absence of the Undertaking which for the purposes of testing the argument of an original freezing order jurisdiction must be ignored). </p>

As I understand it the appellants raised no issue about the merits threshold of the counterclaim.  If my understanding is wrong, it would have been necessary to remit that merits issue to the Judge if the only basis on which the Judge could have granted the injunction was by way of an original freezing order jurisdiction.

It is a jurisdiction to make an order which is consistent with the terms Koza Ltd offered in the Undertaking.  It merely addresses the question which arises as much under the terms of the Undertaking as by way of original jurisdiction, namely whether particular expenditure which has subsequently been identified as threatened should be restrained in circumstances where it cannot be definitively resolved whether such expenditure would be in the ordinary and proper course of business.  Mr Flynn’s argument on this point amounts to saying that the effect of the Undertaking is that where Koza Altin cannot definitively establish that threatened conduct will be a breach, Koza Altin has agreed that it should be permitted.  That is not what Koza Altin has agreed in accepting the Undertaking, just as that would not be the effect of a court order in equivalent terms in the exercise of the freezing order jurisdiction.  On the contrary the Undertaking is to be construed as permitting Koza Altin to invoke whatever jurisdiction the court might have where there is a dispute as to whether threatened conduct is a breach.   </p>

Insofar as the jurisdiction being exercised is the power to make ancillary orders in order to render effective the Undertaking, there is no need for an underlying claim or cause of action.  The court can enforce an undertaking freely given even where it could not grant an order in such terms.  Insofar as the jurisdiction being exercised is an original freezing order jurisdiction, the counterclaim is a sufficient underlying claim to support the exercise of the jurisdiction for the purposes of preserving the assets of the company. </p>

This criticism is unfair because it is apparent that he positively invited the Judge to apply the <span style="font-style:italic">American Cyanamid</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Olint</span> principles if his other points of principle were rejected.  It is in any event unsound.  It is trite law that the principles applicable to the grant of freezing orders are those summarised in <span style="font-style:italic">Crowther</span> and that they differ from a simple <span style="font-style:italic">American Cyanamid</span> approach.  However where the court is making orders ancillary to an existing freezing order, or undertaking, it does not have to, and does not in practice, revisit the criteria which justified exercise of the original jurisdiction.  The existing freezing order or undertaking is taken as the starting point.  Moreover in the particular circumstances of this case, the exercise of an original freezing order jurisdiction by the judge would have resulted in exactly the same discretionary criteria when considering whether there was a real risk of unjustified dissipation of assets, and if so whether the balance of irremediable prejudice favoured the grant of discretionary relief. </p>

There were two aspects to his submissions.  The first was that a finding of such a high degree of assurance as to the authenticity of the SPA went further than the findings of the Court of Appeal and Mr Spearman, which were only that there were grounds for very serious doubt about its authenticity; and that movement in that direction was impermissible when the “dial had moved the other way” by the only additional evidence before the Judge being in Koza Ltd’s favour.  The second was that the Judge could not have had such a high degree of assurance in relation to IIL’s alternative basis for the ICSID tribunal’s jurisdiction, based on the mere fact of share transfer even if the SPA was a fraudulent sham. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in;margin-right:0.00in">As to the first, Mr Flynn’s submissions initially placed great reliance on a statement from Selman Turk, a former employee of Goldman Sachs and close associate of Mr Ipek, stating that he had witnessed signature of the SPA on the date in question.  It emerged, however, that this statement had been before Mr Spearman and the Court of Appeal in the Funding Application.  It was not therefore new evidence.  The only new evidence was a witness statement made by Mr Ipek in the Arbitration, and some answers of his under cross examination, and a statement served in the Arbitration by an anonymous witness.  The Judge considered afresh all the evidence before him on authenticity and expressly acknowledged in his judgment that he had considered the additional evidence.  We do not have all the evidence which was before the Judge.  Nevertheless it is apparent from the material which we do have that the two additional pieces of evidence are not such that they must invalidate the Judge’s evaluation of all the evidence in reaching his view of the merits of the authenticity issue.  One comes from Mr Ipek himself, who is party pris, and the other from someone whose identity is unknown and without support from any contemporaneous documents.  It is questionable whether the latter is properly to be regarded as evidence in the application at all given that no attempt was made to justify anonymity on this application, whatever the position in the Arbitration.  But however that may be, the two statements do little if anything to dent the weight of the other evidence in the form of contemporaneous documentation (or its absence), the course of events, and the inherent probabilities, all of which point against authenticity.   This is not a case where it can be said that no judge could properly reach such a conclusion in the face of the two pieces of additional evidence, taking account of all of the other evidence which was before the Judge and is before this </p>

Nor is the Judge’s conclusion an impermissible movement from the Court of Appeal’s assessment.  All that was necessary for the purposes of the Court of Appeal’s decision to refuse the positive declaration sought by Koza Ltd was a sufficiently arguable case that the SPA was inauthentic.  The Court did not need to decide where on the merits spectrum the degree of arguability fell.  Nothing said by the Court of Appeal would be inconsistent with their taking the view that they had a high degree of assurance that it was inauthentic if that had been something which they had had to address.  They simply did not have to address it and did not do so.  Mr Flynn submitted that the Judge ought to have set out his reasoning in relation to the merits of the point by addressing the new evidence in detail and explaining why it did not in his view preclude a high degree of assurance of the inauthenticity of the SPA.  Whilst it might have been helpful had he done so, there is no basis for concluding that he failed to take it into account in his review of all the evidence: he said that he had done so, and there is no reason to doubt that statement in what is clearly a careful as well as lengthy judgment.  Nor can it be said that the conclusion he reached was not reasonably open to him.  This therefore provides no ground for this Court interfering with the exercise of his discretion. </p>

There is a reference in Ms Lamb’s first witness statement to the authenticity of the SPA being only one factor relied on to establish jurisdiction, but an alternative basis was not there articulated with any clarity and there was no supporting evidence about the way the point was to be advanced before the tribunal.  The Judge dealt with the point at [106] stating that Koza Altin had the better of such argument and referring to what Floyd LJ said at paragraph [31] of his judgment.  Floyd LJ there said “I do not think this argument provides a route to a potentially viable arbitration claim in the absence of the SPA”.  That amply justifies the conclusion drawn by the Judge. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Flynn also attacked the Judge’s conclusion that he could draw the inference which Mr Crow invited him to draw, namely that it is likely that the Arbitration can and will be funded, at least through the jurisdiction stage, with alternative sources of funding available to Mr Ipek: paragraphs [36(ii)],  [103] and [105].  The Judge rehearsed some of the aspects of the evidence which led to this conclusion, including bank statements from 2015 to 2016 suggesting the transfer of sums in excess of US$20 million between Mr Ipek and members of his family; and a reference to Mr Ipek’s evidence to the ICSID tribunal in July 2019, a little over 6 months before the Injunction Application hearing, which comprised a witness statement saying that “my available assets are very substantially less than $10 million”, which he explained when cross examined about it meant that “the amount of cash that I can use at my disposal is less than $10 million, but this doesn’t mean that the worth of my assets are below $10 million.”    Since the funding needed to pursue the Arbitration to the conclusion of the jurisdictional stage of the Arbitration is said to be of the order of about £1.5m, evidence in these terms does not suggest the unavailability of assets available for that purpose (I have taken the figure as £1.5m not £3m, because £1.5m is all that is said to be necessary for IIL’s fees and expenses, the balance being a reserve to meet an adverse costs order; but if only £1.5m is available from other sources, that would be sufficient to meet any argument that the injunction will stifle IIL’s ability to pursue the Arbitration to the jurisdiction stage).   Moreover the “less than $10 million cash” evidence is to be contrasted with a witness statement made by Mr Ipek just over a year earlier in which he had said he was down to his last £400,000.  On 12 November 2019 Mr Ipek paid £557,000 in discharge of a costs order against him personally in relation to the jurisdiction challenge, almost £400,000 of which came from him personally from an unexplained source, and the balance from a company he owns and controls.  The Judge also relied on Mr Ipek’s failure to address this evidence, or to provide any evidence as to the nature or whereabouts of his current assets, and said that it justified drawing adverse inferences, relying on the <span style="font-style:italic">Sarpd</span> case and <span style="font-style:italic">Yorke Motors v Edwards</span>.   The Judge was unimpressed with Mr Ipek’s failure even to engage with the proffering of a confidentiality club to meet his explanation for his reluctance to identify his assets for fear that the Turkish authorities would expropriate them or use the information to oppress or harass him or his family.  The Judge also noted Mr Ipek’s failure to address the availability of commercial sources of litigation funding, despite Mr Spearman having specifically relied upon the absence of such evidence when the Funding Application was before him. </p>

He was also entitled to treat the outright rejection of the confidentiality club proposals as unreasonable so as to justify the drawing of adverse inferences from Mr Ipek’s reticence to explain that evidence or put before the court evidence of assets available to him.  Mr Flynn submitted that a confidentiality club provided no adequate protection because the material would inevitably have been deployed in open court.  That is not so: the court often deals with material which there is good reason not to make public by having parts of hearings in private or by handling the material in a way which keeps it confidential without the need to do so, and could have done so in this case.  Such steps were not considered only because Mr Ipek rejected the concept of a confidentiality club in principle. </p>

If it was unclear to her, that can only have been as a result of her client leaving it unclear, which cannot have been the result of any concern about the detail being revealed to the Turkish authorities.  This is a case in which the Judge was entitled to draw adverse inferences from the reticence of Mr Ipek to address the issue in his evidence and to conclude, upon the basis of all the evidence before him, that alternative sources of funding were likely to be available.  The Judge reached a conclusion on this issue which was open to him.   Indeed I would have reached the same conclusion.

The court may decide to accept the further undertaking and, in the light of it, to grant the application for release.  Equally the court may indicate that it will grant the application for release only on condition that she is willing to give a further undertaking or one in terms different from those of a further undertaking currently on offer.  In either event the court’s power is only to grant or refuse the application for release; and, although exercise of its power may result in something which looks like a variation of an undertaking, it is the product of a different process of reasoning.

Given that the deputy judge concludes in sub-paragraph (7) that the expenditure does not fall within the scope of the undertaking, and is therefore not within the ordinary and proper course of business, his conclusion in sub-paragraph (1) that the expenditure "would be of benefit to Koza Ltd, and thus in the ordinary and proper course of business" must be understood to be subject to at least some of what follows in sub-paragraphs (2) to (6). That would appear to indicate that he considered that it was the ICSID jurisdiction issue which took the expenditure outside the ordinary and proper course of business, particularly when read with [101] where he said, "in the event that [the ICSID expenditure] falls outside that ambit (as I consider that it does <span style="font-style:italic">in light of my findings on jurisdiction below</span> )". Moreover, in [101], the deputy judge clearly indicates that the possible availability of alternative funding was not something on which he relied to take the expenditure outside the scope of the ordinary and proper course of business. It is less clear whether the grounds for doubting the authenticity of the SPA formed part of his decision that the ICSID expenditure was not in the ordinary and proper course of business, as opposed to a reason for not exercising his discretion to grant a variation. He says in (4) that the grounds for doubting the authenticity were relevant to whether the expenditure was in the ordinary and proper course of business, but given the view he expresses in [88], which I understand to mean that he is not able to reach a concluded view on the issue, it is difficult to see how this could provide a basis for saying, definitively, that the expenditure was not in the ordinary and proper course of business.” </p>

It is a derivative right based on the existence of an undertaking.  The court is, therefore, being asked to restrain what is alleged to be a threatened breach of that undertaking without deciding whether what is proposed is or is not a breach.  In this way, Koza Altin, is seeking to use the existence of the Undertaking to obtain a new, enhanced, remedy, namely prohibiting expenditure which may <span style="font-style:italic">or</span> may be prohibited by the Undertaking as being outside the ordinary and proper course of business.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Accordingly, if Koza Altin’s argument was correct, and a party could use an existing undertaking or injunction to obtain a derivative injunction as sought in this case, the effect of the standard exception for dealings or dispositions in the ordinary and proper course of business would change.  Rather than such dealings or dispositions being permitted unless they were not in the ordinary and proper course of business, they would potentially only come within the exception and be permitted if it was not arguable that they might not be in the ordinary and proper course of business.  This is because they could be prevented simply on the basis that there was a serious issue that they were arguably in breach of the undertaking or injunction because they were <span style="font-style:italic">arguably</span> not in the ordinary and proper course of business.  This is a very different threshold or test and it would no longer be “the hard-edged question” referred to by Floyd LJ, at [28].

The judge took the view that if there were unresolved issues on the evidence as to whether the disposals of the underlying assets were carried out by the companies themselves or by him as part of his own business, the burden rested on the bank to show that the transactions were outside the para 9(b) exception and that they had not done this.  This was, in our view, the wrong approach.  Most of the evidence in support of the application was provided by Mr A in his second witness statement of 16 March 2010 and his fourth witness statement of 17 May 2010.  On an application for committal the burden is undoubtedly upon the applicant to prove the breaches relied upon to the criminal standard of proof.  This includes the burden of showing that a disputed transaction is not within an exception to the order such as that contained in para 9(b): see <span style="font-style:italic">Nokia France SA v Interstone Trading Ltd</span> [2004] EWHC 272 (Comm).  But where the defendant chooses to seek guidance or clarification from the court as to whether certain transactions have contravened or will contravene the terms of the injunction, it seems to us that it is incumbent on him to provide the court with the evidence upon which it can properly answer the question posed by the application.  Declaratory relief is discretionary and if the applicant is unwilling to do this the judge should simply decline to make the order and leave it to the claimant to decide in due course whether it wishes to pursue committal proceedings of its own.  In any such proceedings the court would have to decide whether the disposals were disposals by Mr A of his assets at all and, if so, whether they were made in the course of his own business.  But the court is not obliged to adjudicate upon the defendant's compliance or otherwise with its orders on the basis only of whatever material the defendant chooses to put before it. </p>

We therefore take the view that, even if otherwise unobjectionable, the transactions involving the shares in BTA Kazan and Omsk Bank and the re-investment of the proceeds of sale were not within the exception contained in para 9(b) and that the judge should have dismissed the application for declaratory relief in that respect.  If Mr A is right about the nature and purpose of the transactions then the breach of the freezing order is likely to be a technical one in the sense that permission for the transactions would have been granted and, in those circumstances, is unlikely to have much influence on the court on the central question whether Mr A would be likely to breach the freezing order in the future.  We have not therefore taken these breaches into account in deciding whether the judge was right to make the receivership order.  But that is not a matter for us and would have to be dealt with in a further application by Mr A if so advised.” </p>

Rather than being an exception to the prohibitive or mandatory terms of a freezing order by reference to whether dispositions or dealings are or are not in the ordinary and proper course of business, it enables a claimant to use the exception, without any determination of that issue, to seek to prevent expenditure on the ground that it is arguably not permitted by the exception.  This converts the exception into the justification for a further injunction, and uses it, as the basis for the lower threshold of an arguable breach.  The serious issue to be tried is not an issue in the substantive proceedings but simply the issue of whether the proposed expenditure is arguably in breach of the exception.  In my view, as submitted by Mr Flynn, this does not support the effectiveness of the existing undertaking or injunction; rather than ensuring its effectiveness it provides a subsidiary or derivative basis for extending the reach of the undertaking or injunction detached from the underlying proceedings. </p>

As Popplewell LJ goes on to say, and I agree, “the application of the principles will often mean that if a point is open to a party on an interlocutory application and is not pursued, then the applicant cannot take the point at a subsequent interlocutory hearing in relation to the same or similar relief, absent a significant and material change of circumstances or his becoming aware of facts which he did not know and could not reasonably have discovered at the time of the first hearing”.  This was, effectively, the test which was applied by Mr Spearman when determining Koza Ltd’s variation application and is consistent with the approach set out in <span style="font-style:italic">Birch v Birch</span>.

I consider that this would apply in this case even if the previous application by Koza Ltd had been confined to the application for a declaration.  It is, however, made even clearer because Koza Ltd expressly sought, in the alternative, the variation of Asplin J’s Order to permit them to fund the Arbitration.  The obverse to both these applications, or if not the obverse, at the very least an alternative formulation, is the subsequent application by Koza Altin for an injunction to restrain the same expenditure at issue in the previous applications.  In summary, I consider that the application to restrain Koza Ltd from funding the Arbitration is, to put it colloquially, the other side of the same coin or sufficiently the other side of the same coin for the principle to be engaged. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">I would describe the current application as fighting “over again a battle which has already been fought”, adopting what Buckley LJ said in <span style="font-style:italic">Chanel</span> (quoted in <span style="font-style:italic">Holyoake v Candy</span> [2016] EWHC 3065 Ch, as set out by Popplewell LJ in [40] above).  I also consider that it falls within the scope of the principle set out by Sir Terence Etherton, Chancellor of the High Court (as he then was) in <span style="font-style:italic">Holyoake v Candy</span><span> </span><span style="color:#212121">[2016] EWHC 1718 (Ch)</span>, at [21], (as also quoted in [40] above) which again, in my view, apply both ways.  In other words, the principle he sets out is not confined to an application being made by the same party, but applies whenever the application concerns the same issues which have already been addressed by the court.  To apply the principle otherwise would, I suggest, be contrary to its purpose and to the overriding objective.  I propose to quote again Sir Terence Etherton’s observations: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:0.50in;text-indent:0.00in">"[21] I do not agree with Mr Trace's statement of principle. The starting point in such a case as the present is that the claimants must point to something that has happened since the grant of the original order.  They must show something material has changed to make it appropriate to investigate the same issues over again at yet another extensive hearing with even more voluminous evidential material.  Absent any such change, the application for a freezing order is not only a disproportionate call on the court's resources, but an abuse of the court's process, in effect making successive applications for the same objective but testing the court's willingness each time to see how far the court will go, each such application involving, to a greater or lesser extent, duplication of issues, evidence and arguments." </p>

As referred to above, a possible outcome of the applications was that Koza Ltd would be given permission.  In my view, it was incumbent on Koza Altin to advance any alternative basis for preventing Koza Ltd from doing so at that time.  Further, however, I consider that it overlooks the well-known principle, referred to by the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Ablyazov (No 3)</span> and by Floyd LJ in this case, that declaratory relief is discretionary.  I do not see how this “alternative submission” could have come as a surprise when it would always have been a potential outcome to the application because of this well-known principle. </p>
