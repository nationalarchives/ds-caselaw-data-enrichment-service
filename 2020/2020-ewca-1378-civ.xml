After 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February it seems to me that the IP should pay the Claimant’s costs because, contrary to its submissions, it plainly took on the burden of defending the claim by applying to file an AoS out of time together with summary grounds of resistance in circumstances where the Defendant was conceding the claim, even following the refusal of permission on the papers.  While it is fair to acknowledge the amendments to the grounds following the oral hearing, the fundamental grounds survived – the amendment did not amount to a wholesale replacement of the grounds.  Absent the IP’s position, an oral hearing and the preparation for it are unlikely to have been necessary and the subsequent costs would have been very significantly reduced.  The IP did not formally abandon its resistance until 18 April 2019.  It also contributed to the delay and costs in providing a consent order prior to 23 January 2019.  I do not see the relevance of the compromise of a different JR claim without a costs order against the IP as that was a different case about which I know nothing.  I do not follow the point made in relation to the Consent Order of David Elvin QC.  I cannot see that any part of it gives any indication as to whether or not the IP took the burden of defending the case.  On the contrary, the provisions for submissions on costs make it plain that the issue was live.  It is not fair to suggest that the Defendant agreed to sign a consent order after the IP as the Defendant was willing to sign the consent order agreed between it and the Claimant for some time and it was not until 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April that the Claimant sought a different consent order.  I am satisfied that the IP should pay the Claimant’s costs incurred after 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2019.” </p>

Paragraph (2) addresses the situation where a Court Officer may enter and seal an agreed judgment or order in the circumstances which are then set out in particular at paragraph (3).

As CPR 1.4(1) makes clear, the Court must further the overriding objective by actively managing cases.  Active case management includes helping the parties to settle the whole or part of the case: CPR 1.4(2)(f); and, where appropriate, dealing with the case without the parties needing to attend at court: CPR 1.4(2)(j).   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">This also accords with what is clearly good practice in the Administrative Court.  Although Mr Straker focuses his submissions understandably on a situation like the present, where there is an interested party, typically the beneficiary of the grant of some permission or licence by a public authority which is then challenged by a third party, his submissions about the correct construction of CPR Part 54 would apply equally to the more routine case, where there is no interested party but only the person who is the immediate subject of a decision by a public authority.  I can see no good reason why, in such a case, the parties should not be able to agree that permission should be granted even though it has been refused on the papers without the need for a hearing.  Indeed, in practice, an agreement that a substantive claim for judicial review should be allowed without a hearing, which on any view Mr Straker accepts can be done under CPR 54.18, will have to include the grant of permission.  This is because the substantive claim for judicial review requires permission to be granted: see section 31(3) of the Senior Courts Act 1981, which provides (still using the original terminology, which pre-dates the linguistic changes made by the Civil Procedure Rules in 1998) that “[n]o application for judicial review shall be made unless the leave of the High Court has been obtained in accordance with rules of court …”.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Next, I would refer to the fact that the discretion which is enjoyed by a Judge when dealing with costs applications under CPR Part 44 is a broad one.  In deciding what order (if any) to make about costs, the Court will have regard to all the circumstances, including the conduct of the parties: CPR 44.2(4)(a).  The conduct of the parties includes the manner in which a party has pursued or defended its case or a particular allegation or issue: CPR 44.2(5)(c). </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Furthermore, it is clear that an appeal against the exercise of discretion in making a costs order will only succeed if there has been an error of principle or the result is unjust or perverse.  The task of this Court is not to substitute its own opinion for that of the Judge at first instance when determining matters of costs.  This has been confirmed in many cases by this Court.  For present purposes it will suffice to refer to the recent judgment of Males LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">R (Parveen) v Redbridge LBC </span>[2020] EWCA Civ 194; [2020] 4 WLR 53, at paras. 23-30 and 38-42, in which earlier decisions of this Court were reviewed and summarised.  Importantly, as Males LJ also said, at para. 42, a judge determining a costs issue is entitled to express her reasons shortly and an appellate court should not interfere unless it is clear that she has gone wrong.  As he continued: “For rulings to become too elaborate or formulaic in an attempt to make them appeal-proof would be contrary to the interests of justice.”  As it happens, in the present case, I consider that the Judge gave reasons which were more detailed than </p>

As she put it at para. 9 of her reasons, this inevitably involved doing “broad justice” but she was well aware of the circumstances.  The key point, as it seems to me, is that the Defendant was prepared to concede the case on 29 November 2018.  The Claimant was prepared to settle the claim on the basis then put forward by the Defendant, which was essentially that the claim should succeed on Ground 4.  Although that would not have conceded all of the grounds in support of the claim for judicial review, that did not matter in practice.  At that stage, of course, the Court had not yet refused permission on the papers: that only occurred on 23 January 2019.   </p>

It would still have been possible at that stage for the parties to agree a consent order.  The representatives of the Claimant and the Defendant participated in correspondence in late January and early February 2019 with a view to achieving precisely such a consent order.

This was not merely a formal document.  It was a substantive document, which took issue with the grounds which the Claimant wished to advance in support of her claim for judicial review.  The Judge was perfectly entitled to conclude that, from this point in time, in substance it was the Interested Party which had taken on the burden of defending the claim, since the Defendant never filed an acknowledgement of service and indeed was prepared to concede the case. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Fourthly, in my view, the Judge was entitled to reach the conclusion (at para. 11 of her reasons) that “the fundamental grounds survived” the process of amendment which followed after Holgate J granted permission at the hearing on 26 February 2019.  The original grounds were not abandoned, although to some extent they were merged and an additional ground was added. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I also bear in mind that, at that hearing, only the Interested Party appeared, in order to resist the application for permission.  Mr Straker himself appeared on its behalf and vigorously contested the grounds for judicial review.  He failed.  It is just in those circumstances that the Interested Party should have to take the risk that it would be ordered to pay costs.  I would observe in that context that it was reserving a right to claim its own costs  in the event that the claim failed.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I am conscious that not all of the steps which were required after the grant of permission by Holgate J necessarily concerned the Interested Party.  There was undoubtedly some correspondence which took place between the Claimant and Defendant, in particular in relation to the amended grounds and whether the claim for judicial review would be conceded on all of those grounds.  Eventually it was decided that it would be and that was the order made by Mr David Elvin QC on 23 July 2019.  That does not detract, however, from the fundamental point that the Claimant had at all material times, since late November 2018, been prepared to settle the claim on the basis then put forward by the Defendant, albeit limited to Ground 4.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Furthermore, it is important in this context to bear in mind that the Judge was well aware that there were some costs which were incurred as a result of the Claimant having to deal with the Interested Party even before 5 February 2019.  In doing what she described as “broad justice”, at para. 9 of her reasons, she was entitled to “set off” those costs against the ones which were incurred after 5 February 2019 but did not concern the Interested Party. </p>
