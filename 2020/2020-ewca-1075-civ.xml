The ET found that Mrs Walker was treated more harshly than her comparators over the performance issues said to justify the level of bonus she was awarded, so that the burden of proof shifted to the Respondents to prove that there was no discrimination whatsoever. They failed to do so on that issue. Yet the ET did not go on to apply the same conclusion to the performance issues ostensibly relied upon by the Respondents as justifying the decision to give notice. This is illogical. The ET failed to take any account of the chain of causation between a discriminatory view of Mrs Walker’s performance and the decision to dismiss her. Had it done so, it would have concluded that the discriminatory appraisal and/or Mr Pennycook’s views about her, her performance, and her reaction to the restructure, was an underlying part of the decision to dismiss, so that it could not be said that there was no discrimination whatsoever in the decisions to give notice of dismissal and then to dismiss.  </p>

Her challenge is put on the basis that the ET erred in law by failing to consider whether a reason<span style="font-style:italic"> not </span>found by the ET to be the reason for the dismissal was discriminatory. That, it was submitted, was bad in law. If a claim of direct discrimination for dismissal is to succeed, the actual reason for dismissal needs to be discriminatory. </p>

I am not greatly impressed by Mr Burns’ point that the JES results were not communicated to Remco at that stage. The ET found at paragraph 312 that Mr Pennycook accepted the Hay evaluations of the roles, including those of Mrs Walker and her two comparators “in the full knowledge of the Claimant’s score relative to the scores of all of the other executive roles”. That is sufficient for it to form the basis of a claim under s 65(1)(b). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">There was a debate between counsel about whether a “trigger event” is required to set up an equal pay claim. Ms Romney advanced what seemed to me to be an ambitious argument that in the latter part of 2014, once the crisis had begun to abate, the Co-op were under a continuing duty to review the differences in pay between Mrs Walker and her comparators. She relied on the decision of this court in <span style="font-style:italic">Benveniste v University of Southampton</span> [1989] ICR 617. In that case the claimant was appointed as a lecturer at a time when the university was operating under financial constraints. It was agreed that by reason only of such constraint her salary would be lower than the normal figure for her age and qualifications. When the financial constraints ended (a concept which would sadly be inconceivable in the current financial climate in higher education) the employers failed to increase her salary to the rate paid to four male comparators engaged on like work. There was no relevant distinction between the applicant and the comparators on the basis of skills or experience. This court upheld the claim for equal pay. Neill LJ said at 628A:- </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Ms Romney emphasised the word “evaporated” used by Neill LJ. But her argument gives it a weight which it cannot bear, for several reasons. The first is that as Neill LJ said earlier in the judgment (at 624H), and as is so well known as to be a matter of judicial knowledge, “[academic] salaries seem to be fixed at the beginning of the academic year”: the annual consideration of lecturers’ pay was an obvious fresh decision if any was required. Secondly, the case was decided before <span style="font-style:italic">Glasgow City Council v Marshall </span>[2000] 1 WLR 333 and must therefore be viewed with caution. Thirdly, since it is a case in which there had been only one material factor operating at the time of the claimant’s appointment at a lower salary than that of her male comparators, and that material factor had ceased, the result of the case seems obvious (though I do note that the claimant had failed in both the ET and the EAT). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.04in">“The scheme of the Act is that a rebuttable presumption of sex discrimination arises once the gender-based comparison shows that a woman, doing like work or work rated as equivalent or work of equal value to that of a man, is being paid or treated less favourably than the man. The variation between her contract and the man's contract is presumed to be due to the difference of sex. The burden passes to the employer to show that the explanation for the variation is not tainted with sex. In order to discharge this burden the employer must satisfy the tribunal on several matters. First, that the proffered explanation, or reason, is genuine, and not a sham or pretence. Second, that the less favourable treatment is due to this reason. The factor relied upon must be the cause of the disparity. In this regard, and in this sense, the factor must be a 'material' factor, that is, a significant and relevant factor. Third, that the reason is not 'the difference of sex'. This phrase is apt to embrace any form of sex discrimination, whether direct or indirect. Fourth, that the factor relied upon is or, in a case within section 1(2)(c), may be a 'material' difference, that is, a significant and relevant difference, between the woman's case and the man's case.  </p>

In order to fulfil the third requirement he must prove the absence of sex discrimination, direct or indirect. If there is any evidence of sex discrimination, such as evidence that the difference in pay has a disparately adverse impact on women, the employer will be called upon to satisfy the tribunal that the difference in pay is objectively justifiable. But if the employer proves the absence of sex discrimination he is not obliged to justify the pay disparity. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.04in">Some of the confusion which has arisen on this point stems from an ambiguity in the expression 'material factor'. A material factor is to be contrasted with an immaterial factor. Following the observations of Lord Keith of Kinkel in <span style="font-style:italic">Rainey v Greater Glasgow Health Board</span> [1987] A.C. 224, 235, the accepted synonym for 'material' is 'significant and relevant'. This leaves open the question of what is the yardstick to be used in measuring materiality, or significance and relevance. One possibility is that the factor must be material in a causative sense. The factor relied on must have been the cause of the pay disparity. Another possibility is that the factor must be material in a justificatory sense. The factor must be one which justifies the pay disparity. As already indicated, I prefer the former of these two interpretations. It accords better with the purpose of the Act…..” </p>

In the case of Mr Asher there is simply no finding that the market forces which explained why a commercial lawyer of his experience had to be remunerated at a particular level if he was to be attracted to the job had ceased or even diminished. Ms Romney implicitly accepted this by concentrating her argument on the comparison between the Claimant and Mr Folland.

But even if it can, Ms Romney is in more difficulty on the subject of executive experience. I have noted earlier the view expressed by Mr Pennycook to Remco in February 2014 that Mr Folland had “deep experience that will ensure that we develop and sustain the external and internal relationships that are vital to our future success” and that he would continue to work on the reform of the Co-op’s membership system. His salary on first appointment in May 2013 had been £350,000; it was increased to £425,000 in July 2013 when his responsibilities were expanded; and in February 2014 it was further increased to £550,000. The ET did not find, and there is no material referred to in their decision in reliance on which they could have found, that the greater executive experience of Mr Folland by comparison with Mrs Walker had ceased 11 or 12 months later to be causative of the difference between his pay and hers.

As he said, “while there is a competing narrative, it is for the ET to evaluate the reasons for the notice and subsequent termination”. Ms Romney was reduced to arguing, in effect, that having found against the Respondents in respect of the year-end appraisal at paragraph 366 of their decision, the ET must have forgotten that when reaching their conclusions about the dismissal at paragraphs 368-369.

As section 64 of the 2010 Act makes clear, only then does consideration of the statutory sex equality clause and the possibility of a material factor defence become relevant. The ET did not find that Mrs Walker’s work was equal to that of Mr Folland or Mr Asher from the time when she took on her new role in February 2014, but only that it had become equal between then and February 2015, leaving the date at which this had occurred to be determined later. In my judgment that was not a satisfactory approach, either conceptually or practically. Conceptually, it left unresolved the essential starting point for Mrs Walker’s claim. Practically, it ran the risk that much of the case would have to be re-litigated as part of the remedy hearing. The ET should either have made a finding as to the date on which Mrs Walker was doing work which was equal to that of a named comparator or should have found that she had failed to prove this at any stage before February 2015. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">There were two ways in which Mrs Walker could seek to prove that, thereafter, she was employed on work that was equal to the work of a comparator. First, she could rely under section 65(1)(b) and (4) on the findings of the job evaluation study, but that spoke only about the position as at February 2015 and had no retrospective effect (<span style="font-style:italic">Redcar &amp; Cleveland Borough Council</span> v <span style="font-style:italic">Bainbridge</span> [2008] EWCA Civ 885, [2009] ICR 133). It appears that this is the principal way in which Mrs Walker put her case. Second, she could seek to prove as a fact under section 65(1)(c) that her work was of equal value to that of a comparator at some stage earlier than February 2015. It is not clear to me whether she ever sought to identify a time before February 2015 when this had occurred but, in any event, the analysis of the ET is confined to the passage set out by Bean LJ at [21] above. Essentially, the ET seems to have found that the importance of Mr Folland’s and Mr Asher’s jobs had declined relative to Mrs Walker’s, presumably because by February 2015 they had largely succeeded in performing the “vital roles” for which they were being handsomely remunerated, which were to ensure “the immediate survival of the Co-op”: by February 2015 the rescue phase had been completed and the recovery phase was under way.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Perhaps because it was wrongly focusing on the existence of material factors in February 2014, the ET has unfortunately failed to make findings about the position of Mr Folland as at the relevant date of February 2015. At paragraph 147 the ET recorded without comment the evidence of Mr Pennycook that Mr Folland had left the Co-op in January 2015, but it seems clear that this was a mistake. The parties’ agreed chronology states that Mr Folland was made redundant in May 2015, while Ms Romney’s submission on the issue of “flight risk” was on the basis that he was given notice in January 2015 but actually left in May. It appears that there was no dissatisfaction with his performance. Rather, Mr Pennycook’s evidence was that “the company could not find a role big enough for his skills at the end of the rescue phase”. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">I would wish to have heard argument on how the fact that Mr Folland was given notice in January 2015 affects any comparison between him and Mrs Walker as at February 2015 for the purpose of an equal pay claim. On the face of things, it would appear that Mr Folland was an employee who had been given notice, essentially because he was being paid more than was really justified by his role in the company, and was due to leave within a few months. I find it hard to see how such an employee can be a valid comparator for the purpose of sections 64 to 70 of the 2010 Act. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The other comparator relied on was Mr Asher. As at February 2015, but not before, Mrs Walker’s contract had to be treated as including a sex equality clause which had the effect under section 66 of modifying her contract so that it was no less favourable to her than Mr Asher’s was to him -- in other words, to provide for equal pay; but section 69 provided that this would have no effect if the Co-op could show that the difference in pay was “because of a material factor”.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">In the present case the ET found that the difference in pay was “justified” as at February 2014, but that “the historical explanations for the pay differential given at the time the pay was set were no longer material at the time of the Hay job evaluation study”. As I have sought to explain, the issue of “justification” or even of “material factor” did not arise as at February 2014. Nevertheless it is clear in my judgment that in saying that the historical explanations “were no longer material” by February 2015, what the ET meant was that the differential could no longer be justified. That, however, was answering the wrong question. </p>

The ET had found that in February 2014, when executive salaries were set, Mr Asher “was paid at the high market rate for top general counsel”; and that this had nothing to do with sex discrimination. There was nothing to suggest that this had ceased to be a reason why he was paid more one year later. To dismiss this explanation as “historical” misses the point. What matters is that it was indeed the explanation for the pay difference. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">On the footing that he was a relevant comparator, the same analysis applies in the case of Mr Folland. The reasons why he was paid more than Mrs Walker were because, when his salary was set, he was viewed as performing a vital role in ensuring the survival of the Co-op, to which he brought considerable executive experience, and because it was thought that if he were to leave, that could have brought down the company. These reasons likewise had nothing to do with sex discrimination. They remained the reasons why he was paid as much as he was a year later, although it had been recognised that by then they had lost much of their force: the solution was that Mr Folland would leave the company. </p>
