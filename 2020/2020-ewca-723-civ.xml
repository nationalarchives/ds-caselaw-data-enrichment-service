He served as a district councillor for Braintree East from 2003 to 2007 and as a town councillor for Witham North from 2013 to 2015. He believes that requirements for identification of voters at elections tend to disenfranchise the poor and vulnerable and render it less likely that their electoral voices will be heard. He considered that the scheme proposed for Braintree and similar schemes were unlawful as being outside the powers conferred by the 2000 Act upon the Secretary of State and he brought the present proceedings to challenge them.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Contrary to the Appellant’s arguments on the claim, the learned judge held that, on the true construction of the Act, the pilot scheme proposed in the present case, to require voter identification at polling stations as a pre-condition of the issue of a ballot paper, was a scheme making provision “as regards … (a) … <span style="font-weight:bold">how</span> voting at the elections is to take place”. The Appellant contended that the scheme was not properly within that definition; the judge found that the Appellant’s case was a properly arguable one and so gave permission to apply for judicial review, but having considered it, he dismissed the claim. He refused permission to appeal to this court. The judgment below bears the neutral citation [2019] EWHC 641 (Admin); it is publicly available and can be found, for example, on the BAILII website. </p>

He did not, however, apply for expedition of the appeal and, orders implementing the schemes having already been made in respect of the Interested Parties’ areas in February and March 2019, local elections conducted in accordance with the schemes were held in those areas in May 2019.  The appeal proceedings continued nonetheless and permission to appeal was granted by order of 25 October 2019 of Simon LJ.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The issue on the appeal, therefore, is whether or not the judge’s construction of the Act, as to its application to the schemes in this case, was or was not correct.

First, there was a 1998 report of the House of Commons’ Home Affairs Committee: its Fourth Report entitled “Electoral Law and Administration” (“the HAC Report”). Second, following the general election of 1997 the then Home Secretary directed a review of electoral procedure and a working party was set up under the chairmanship of Mr George Howarth MP. The working party produced its report in October 1999 (“Howarth”). Thirdly, the government published a response to that report in November 1999. </p>

Such schemes, it said, should take account of the need to safeguard the integrity of the voting arrangements. To this list, the summary of recommendations for piloting innovative approaches added other proposals for changes to polling days and polling hours, early voting, mobile polling stations and “out of area voting”. It recommended encouragement of innovation in “re-engaging the electorate”. There was nothing in the report to say that the particular suggestions were made to the exclusion of all others. </p>

The EC reported favourably upon the schemes, while commenting that there was “a small number of people who were unable to vote because they did not have, or did not bring with them, the right type of identification”. It was said that there was some evidence to suggest that the identification requirements “had a positive impact on public confidence in the May 2018 elections, although this picture was not consistent within the individual pilot areas and there was evidence that wider local circumstances also have an impact”. It was thought the measures were likely “to have had some positive impact on reducing the potential for electoral fraud by impersonation at polling stations”. The EC recommended further trials in May 2019. A Cabinet Office report of July 2018 concluded that the pilots had been a success. However, it is acknowledged by the Respondent in evidence in these proceedings that the 2018 pilots were controversial and were opposed by some organisations, including the Electoral Reform Society. </p>

On 3 November 2018, the Cabinet Office announced that eleven authorities had chosen to participate, with the stated objective to “… provide further insight into how best to ensure the security of the voting process and reduce the risk of voter fraud”. This is the decision challenged by the Appellant’s judicial review claim. Orders, purportedly pursuant to s.10 of the 2000 Act, followed in February and March 2019. It seems that only ten of the original eleven interested authorities participated in the final schemes. </p>

This argument was developed in the context of the principle of legality, i.e. that the voter identification scheme was an interference by Ministerial order (with potential for future extension by statutory instrument) with the fundamental right of the citizen to vote, not properly to be done by general words of the type found in s.10(2)(a). <span style="font-style:italic">Statutory Language (Grounds para. 7(1))</span></p>

If such a restriction had been intended, it would have been quite simple for Parliament to introduce it. It did not do so. The words simply indicate how, i.e. the steps by which, electors achieve the casting of a lawful vote. If the words are clear, as I think they are, Parliament did render lawful pilot schemes of the present type.

If (hypothetically) one assumes a legal requirement to present identification at a polling station (as in the present case) and a new voter were to ask, “How do I vote in this election?”, the answer would be likely to be: “You go to the polling station, produce your ID to the clerk and answer a couple of formal questions, if asked. He or she then gives you a ballot paper. You go into a booth and mark a cross on the ballot paper against the name of the person for whom you wish to vote and then you put your paper into a sealed box at the exit to the polling station”.

For my part, I do not see that that would relate to “how” votes were to be cast all. By that stage, the voter would have completed the phase of “how” to vote and the new procedure would be a step further. It would be gratuitous publication and it would not be necessary or incidental to how to vote or even to the counting of votes, envisaged by s.10(2)(b).

It is argued that this means that identification requirements must have been contemplated as being necessary for some admittedly lawful schemes. The Appellant answers that point by saying that such an arrangement would be an incident of a <span style="font-style:italic">new</span> scheme to facilitate voting; it would not introduce, as this scheme does, an additional pre-condition of using the <span style="font-style:italic">existing</span> voting procedures for the traditional method of voting in person at a polling station.

They do not have anything to do with <span style="font-style:italic">how</span> voting is to take place.  They are distinct and separate from the process of how to vote. It was surely sensible, therefore, to make additional provision for those matters, if required, as is done by (b) and (c) of s.10(2).

Further, the provisions contemplate, it seems to me, that a scheme that has other advantages might nonetheless fail to facilitate voting or indeed might render voting less easy. That is what is meant by the “success <span style="font-style:italic">or otherwise</span>” in facilitating voting.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I accept that the extraneous material produced suggests that the most immediate prompt for this part of the legislation was a perceived decline in voter participation in these elections and Parliament wished to address that. However, I do not consider that the materials to which we were taken indicate that Parliament was not interested in any other features of the voting system. It seems to me that it was anxious to promote modernisation of the system and its integrity. Clearly, the HAC Report had considered the issue of fraud and thought that it was not an immediate problem in Great Britain (in contrast to Northern Ireland). However, I do not think that when Parliament adopted such general words as it did in s.10(2)(a), it should be taken as having prohibited ministers from even looking at schemes that might have the effect of reducing malpractice. I think that that is particularly so when one bears in mind that the Act was for the use of pilots to test voting systems <span style="font-style:italic">for the future</span> and not just to achieve a higher participation in the very narrow field of the particular elections to which such schemes might be applied.  Further, it is to be recalled that these provisions were not limited to the when, where and how of voting, but also to the counting of votes and the rules for free distribution of candidates’ election communications. The desire for improvement and modification seems to have been quite general.  </p>

It was found that the order had been sought not for that purpose but for the dominant purpose of investigating whether an offence had been committed in the conduct of a client’s business. Thus, the power had been invoked for purposes outside that for which it was expressly conferred by the section. However, in contrast, when one looks at s.10(2) of the Act I cannot see that the introduction of these schemes went outside a purpose for which the power was expressly conferred. </p>

In the absence of express language or necessary implication to the contrary, the courts therefore presume that even the most general words were intended to be subject to the basic rights of the individual.

Clearly, the right to vote at any election is an important right and courts will be vigilant to prevent the use of so-called “Henry VIII” powers of this type by ministers to curtail such an important right by mere order, unless the claimed use of the power has been clearly and distinctly conferred by Parliament. In my judgment, however, the use of the power in section 10 to test a pilot scheme of this type does not in truth override or abrogate the right to vote at all. The voter remains entitled to vote and must only produce sensible means of demonstrating that entitlement. The words in section 10(2)(a) used, on these specific occasions, to launch an experimental scheme requiring identification at the polling station do not, in my judgment, “override” the important right to vote at the particular elections concerned. </p>

Moreover, any draft order exercising that power has to be laid before both Houses of Parliament and must be accompanied by every s.10 report relating to a scheme making similar provision. Any such order is also subject to the affirmative resolution procedure in both Houses. </p>

But, at least in the case of a phrase of this generality, I do not find it helpful to start by trying to identify a “natural meaning” without reference to the context (see the observations of Lord Mance in <span style="font-style:italic">Bloomsbury International Ltd v Sea Fish Industry Authority and Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs</span><span style="font-size:10pt"> </span>[2011] UKSC, [2011] 1 WLR 1546, at para. 10).

It is only possible to form a view about which meaning is correct by considering the phrase against the background of the overall statutory purpose, as determined by reference both to the other provisions of the statute and to any other admissible materials. </p>

There is no reason in principle why changes to the actual mechanics should be the only kind of change in the voting process which Government might in due course wish to consider; and it would be unsatisfactory if it had to return to Parliament to obtain authority to pilot such other changes if the occasion arose.  It is more likely that the intention was that the Act should convey a wide power to pilot changes to the voting process in response to such concerns as might arise from time to time.   </p>

Mr Peto submitted that that is the case here, because subsection (7) refers only (so far as relevant) to impact on turn-out.  But, as Mr Mussa pointed out, subsection (9) requires the Commission, if asked by the Secretary of State, to report on “matters relating to the scheme” other than those specified in subsection (7): see para. 26 above.  A report on the piloting of voter identification procedures would plainly fall within the terms of that provision.  (I should, however, say that I do not find any real assistance in another provision of section 10 relied on by Mr Mussa, namely the requirement in subsection (8) (c) that the Commission in its report consider whether the procedures piloted led to any increase in personation: while that shows that Parliament had the possibility of voter fraud in mind, it cannot be read as a reference to procedures which are themselves directed at reducing it.)  </p>

Supperstone J refers at para. 82 of his judgment to an observation in the Cabinet Office’s “prospectus” (see para. 23 above) that “if voters have confidence in the integrity of the electoral system then they are more likely to participate in that process”.  I have to say that I do not find it very plausible that any significant number of voters are deterred from voting by the perception that other people may be voting when they are not entitled to, but I must respect the fact that the Cabinet Office apparently takes a different view.  Fortunately, it is unnecessary for me to express a concluded view on this point since it does not arise in view of my conclusion on the prior issue. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I turn to Mr Peto’s submission based on the principle of legality.  I can understand the Appellant’s concern that the introduction of an identification requirement may inhibit some voters from voting, and that the impact may be greater on the more disadvantaged groups.  But I do not think that it is right to approach the construction of section 10 of the Act on the basis that Parliament cannot have intended to authorise the <span style="font-style:italic">piloting</span> of procedures that might have that effect.  Part of the purpose of a pilot scheme in relation to voter identification requirements is to establish whether they would in fact have such an impact, and if so to what extent.  The decision whether, in the light of the evidence produced by the pilot, to introduce such requirements universally and on a permanent basis – no doubt weighing such impact as there may be against the perceived benefits – is a distinct matter.  I appreciate of course that the effect of section 11 is that that decision can be made by the Secretary of State without further primary legislation; but it would be conditional on both (a) the Electoral Commission recommending the change (subsection (1)) and (b) approval by both Houses of Parliament under the affirmative resolution procedure (subsection (3)).  Those are significant safeguards, deliberately introduced, and in the light of them I do not believe that we should approach the construction of section 10 on the basis that Parliament cannot have contemplated the possibility of permanent voter identification requirements being introduced under the section 11 procedure. </p>
