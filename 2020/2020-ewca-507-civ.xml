In her order the learned judge recited that findings of fact had been made by her in these care proceedings in her judgment of the same date, in which she had made a number of findings of sexual and other abuse committed upon the children in the case. The children are A (a boy, now 12), B (a boy, now 10) and X (a girl, now 9). In this judgment the appellant will be called “the Father”. Permission to appeal to this court was granted by Peter Jackson LJ by his order of 20 February 2020. </p>

At the hearing we had oral submissions from Mr Roche and Mr Pryce. Pursuant to directions from my Lord, Peter Jackson LJ, Mr Veitch did not attend the hearing as the Guardian was not putting a case distinct from that of the Local Authority. I was much assisted by the helpful arguments of all counsel.  </p>

This was a period of about 11 weeks when the children were, for the first time for a while in the care of the Mother, with W living in the same home. The Mother and W, as an intervener, were principal parties to the hearing below. Two specific allegations of sexual abuse were, however, also made against the Father, in respect of matters said to have occurred while the children were in the care of their paternal grandparents in Lincolnshire between 2015 and 2018. The Father also faced allegations of physical mistreatment of the children in the same three-year period. </p>

In the May, the Mother suffered a serious accident and sustained injuries of a life-changing nature. She made an informal arrangement for the children to live with the paternal grandparents in Lincolnshire. The Father visited them there from time to time. Initially following her accident, the Mother had been living in accommodation with carers and she had not spent much time with the children. In 2018, however, the Mother moved to live with W, by then her partner, who had also taken over as her carer. In this period, she did see the children, as did W, on about three occasions, but for a few hours only. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">The children were brought to the property where the Mother and W were living. The judge found that the property was not suitable for the children in a number of respects. There was no bed for X and the room that she was supposed to use was undecorated and “full of clutter”. The judge also found that at one stage X had been sleeping at the foot of the bed shared by the Mother and W (sometimes even with “one of the four dogs”). The judge heard evidence that the property was in general “unhygienic, unsafe” and lacking proper lavatory and washing facilities. No schooling or medical arrangements had been made for the children, although later a school place was organised for A. The Mother was to claim that she was engaged in some kind of “home schooling”, about which the judge clearly had her doubts. It is in respect of the period between July and October 2018 that the principal allegations of abuse against the Mother and W arose. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">There emerges from the judge’s judgment, and from her formal findings of fact, a catalogue of sexual and other abuse perpetrated by the Mother and W upon the children, some of which I will outline below. When the first inklings of this became known to the police, in October 2018, they exercised powers under s.46 of the Children Act 1989 to remove the children from the Mother and W. The children were placed in foster care. Initially, the boys were fostered together, but were later separated. X has always been fostered on her own. The judge noted that when taken into foster care all the children were in poor physical condition and with ill-fitting clothing. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">The intervention in the family’s affairs began following reports made by S to the police in Lincolnshire, alleging acts of historic sexual abuse committed upon her by the Father. On 13 October 2018, S was interviewed about these allegations by the police and later that same day she visited the Mother and W at their home. The judge said that it was agreed evidence that some little time before then X had said two or three times to her brother A, “You kiss my foo-foo and I sit on your willy and kiss you lots”. S said that when she visited on 13 October, she was asked by the Mother to speak to X who, it was said, had that day repeated the remark just mentioned. S said that, during the subsequent conversation with X, X told her that the Father had abused her. The three adults then agreed that they would report this to the police and S undertook to make the report. However, she did not do so until about 24 hours later and then, after passage of yet another 24 hours, on the evening of 15 October, a police officer (DC G) visited the home. </p>

It is not necessary to state all the findings in this judgment. A summary of the main features will suffice; they were: more than one event when W sexually touched X’s genitals and penetrated her vagina; the Mother was present during, and complicit in, these assaults and on one such occasion performed oral sex on W at that time; the Mother also touched X sexually on her genitals; W exposed his genitals to X; the Mother and W engaged in sexual intercourse in the presence of A; W accessed pornography on a telephone in A’s presence; the Mother and W caused the children to be naked together in the living room while they (Mother and W) engaged in oral sex and mutual masturbation; the Mother and W caused the children (when naked) to touch each other’s genitals; the Mother and W caused X to touch the Mother’s breasts; the Mother viewed pornography on her telephone while in bed and in the presence of X; the Mother and W were each found to be in possession of indecent images of children on their telephones. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">X was born in early 2011. She had spent the first four years of her life with both parents and with her brothers, A and B. The Father left them in February 2015 and in the May of that year the Mother suffered her accident. For the first six months, the children were in the care of friends of the Mother and then moved to the paternal grandparents’ home, where they stayed until collected by the Mother and S in July of 2018. They then lived with the Mother and W until the police removed them in October 2018. There is no dispute between the Father and the Local Authority but that in that eleven-week period, the children lived in what Mr Roche described as “a depraved atmosphere”. Included in the acts of abuse found against W were sexual assaults on and digital penetration of X, acts of the same character as against the Father. The Mother played a full part in that abuse: she was present when acts of abuse took place; she herself sexually assaulted X and encouraged W in his own acts of abuse perpetrated on X. The children were encouraged to be naked in the home and to keep secrets. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">In the period up to 13 October 2018, X had made the comments to her brother A which I have recorded above. Then on that day, S came directly from the police station where she had made allegations of historic sexual abuse against the Father. In respect of these, as we were told, the Father has never been charged and, as we were also told, the Local Authority did not invite the judge to make any findings in respect of them. It was on this occasion that the Mother and W asked S to speak to X about what she had said to A. The subsequent conversation between S and X was not private; W was present. It was alleged that in this conversation X had made the allegation of abuse by the Father. It was agreed that S would report the matter to the police, but she did not do so for another 24 hours. A further 24 hours then elapsed before DC G’s visit on 15 October. The judge found that the matter was likely to have discussed in the two days between S’s conversation with X and DC ’s attendance. The allegation against the father about “sitting on his willy” was never repeated outside the conversation with DC G; it was not otherwise mentioned to social workers or to foster carers or in the interviews. Equally, nothing was said about the digital penetration other than in the formal interviews. This was in distinct contrast to what the boys had said to their foster carers in relation to W’s abusive behaviour. </p>

However, Mr Pryce argued, the judge clearly had these features of the case well in mind. She was also, he said, fully conscious of the formal deficiencies of the evidence gathering process and she was critical of how the evidence was elicited from X in many respects. The judge had taken all this into account and indeed remarked upon the comfortable interaction that DC G appeared to have with the children, in comparison with other interviewers of whom the judge had experience. In spite of the countervailing features, the judge had made the findings that she did having seen and heard all the evidence. </p>

However, DC G had given evidence of similar allegations made on 15 October. Further, the passage in the first interview (quoted above) was direct and clear. Based on these matters, the judge made the findings that she did on evidence which she had found compelling, in spite of the defects and overall context which she had fully recognised. </p>

However, in spite of these problems she had found herself able to place reliance upon X’s answers which, adopting the judge’s language, “had been spontaneous, clear and had come from the child without probing”.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">In my judgment, taking full account of the arguments of Mr Pryce and Mr Veitch, in the light of the extremely tenuous nature of the evidence, the allegation against the Father of encouragement of X to engage in sexual intercourse simply cannot be sustained. The circumstances of DC G’s conversation with X on 15 October, inadequately recorded as it was, render the contents of that conversation unacceptable as evidence. Finally, that allegation was never repeated and did not feature in anything that X said in either interview. There was really no satisfactory evidence of it at all. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Turning to the single allegation of digital penetration of X, the evidence here too had number of unsatisfactory features which I have outlined above, and which were frankly acknowledged by Mr Pryce. The principal evidence was found in the first interview and was repeated, entirely as a result of prompting, eight days later in the second interview. There were a number of features of those interviews which demonstrated a failure to comply with the applicable Guidance. They will be apparent from what I have said already. Of course, failure to comply with the Guidance will not always render evidence obtained incapable of establishing acts of sexual abuse: see <span style="font-style:italic">Re B (Allegation of Sexual Abuse: Child’s Evidence)</span> [2006] EWCA Civ 773, per Hughes LJ (as he then was) at [34] – [35] and [40] – [42], cited by McFarlane LJ (as he then was) in <span style="font-style:italic">Re J (A Child) </span>[2014] EWCA Civ 875 at [73] – [75]. However, deficiencies of this type can be very significant and, in this case, in my judgment, they were just too numerous to be overcome in order to sustain this single finding in the context of the serial sexual abuse that had been perpetrated by W and the Mother against all these children in the immediately preceding 11 week period. For my part, I accept Mr Roche’s submission that the value of the evidence about this single alleged act of abuse, elicited at a very late stage of a long interview and only as a result of a distinct prompt about a conversation with S, was also reduced to vanishing point.  </p>

There is no narrative or free recall or any details that might make it possible to understand when and in what circumstances such an event might have occurred.

In the face of that, it seems to me that a careful assessment of the Father’s own credibility was required and an identification of the reasons why his denials were not to be accepted. The judgment below does not provide this. The Father has been found to be lying, without any statement of the reasons why his evidence was found to be incredible. </p>
