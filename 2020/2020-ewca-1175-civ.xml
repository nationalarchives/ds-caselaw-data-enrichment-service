A “Statement of Common Ground” between the appellant and the Council included an agreement that the Council did not have “an up-to-date policy on housing need” and that the SUDP did not contain any saved policies in respect of housing supply. It was further agreed, however, that the Council was able to demonstrate a mathematical housing land supply in excess of five years for the agreed period April 2017 to March 2022, although the supply consisted largely of apartments rather than houses and was principally concentrated in the centre of the city. It was further agreed that there was a demonstrable need for affordable housing within the Council’s administrative area. It was the appellant’s case that the agreed “mathematical” five-year housing supply did not comply with national planning policy on a “qualitative” basis in that the Council was unable to provide an adequate supply of affordable housing, or of housing suitable to meet the needs of families. </p>

The appellant sought to renew the application for permission on three further grounds. The matter was listed for hearing before Dove J in May 2019. For reasons set out in a reserved judgment delivered on 2 August 2019, the judge dismissed the appellant’s claim on the grounds for which permission had been granted and refused permission on the other grounds. On 23 August 2019, the appellant filed a notice of appeal under CPR 52.10 seeking permission to appeal to this court against the refusal of permission in respect of one of the other grounds (“ground 7”). On 27 August, the appellant filed a second notice of appeal under CPR 52.6 seeking permission to appeal against Dove J’s judgment. On 16 December 2019, Lewison LJ granted permission to appeal. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.18in;margin-right:0.00in">These are three distinct concepts. A development plan will be "absent" if none has been adopted for the relevant area and the relevant period. If there is such a plan, it may be "silent" because it lacks policy relevant to the project under consideration. And if the plan does have relevant policies these may have been overtaken by things that have happened since it was adopted, either on the ground or in some change in national policy, or for some other reason, so that they are now "out-of-date". Absence will be a matter of fact. Silence will be either a matter of fact or a matter of construction, or both. And the question of whether relevant policies are no longer up to date will be either a matter of fact or perhaps a matter of both fact and judgment. </p>

Government policy in the NPPF does not, and could not, modify that statutory framework, but operates within it – as paragraph 12 of the NPPF acknowledges. The Government has taken the opportunity in the NPPF to confirm its commitment to a system of development control decision-making that is "genuinely plan-led" (paragraph 17). But in any event, within the statutory framework, the status of policy in the NPPF, including the policy for decision-making in paragraph 14, is that of a material consideration outside the development plan. It is for the decision-maker to decide what weight should be given to the policy in paragraph 14 if it applies to the case in hand. Because it is government policy it is likely to command significant weight when it has to be taken into account. But the court will not intervene unless the weight given to it can be said to be unreasonable in the <span style="font-style:italic">Wednesbury</span> sense …” </p>

It needs to work for other forms of development covered by the development plan, for example employment or transport. Thus, for example, there may be a relevant policy for the supply of employment land, but it may become out-of-date, perhaps because of the arrival of a major new source of employment in the area. Whether that is so, and with what consequence, is a matter of planning judgment, unrelated of course to paragraph 49 which deals only with housing supply. This may in turn have an effect on other related policies, for example for transport. The pressure for new land may mean in turn that other competing policies will need to be given less weight in accordance with the tilted balance.

However, this does not necessarily mean that the plan or any individual policy should be considered out-ofdate as it may very well continue to be effective in delivering its original objectives and those relevant today.

Paragraph 157 of the Framework positively promotes that Local Plans should, amongst other things, identify land where development would be inappropriate, for instance because of its environmental or historic significance. That is exactly what Policy EN 2 seeks to do and there is nothing inconsistent with the Framework in that approach, even if the development plan does not currently fulfil all other requirements of the Framework. Whilst the first part of the policy seeks to prevent development in absolute terms this is unsurprising given its objective to protect openness and continuity and it does not alter the need to undertake a statutory balancing exercise against material considerations. </p>

In any case, there is nothing to suggest that the appeal sites might be allocated. The draft SLP in fact anticipates increased protection of the area. These are squarely matters for the Local Plan Examination. Any potential release of the Greenway envisaged as part of the Core Strategy is similarly of little relevance given that the CS was withdrawn many years ago. In addition, the fact that there is a recognised need to release greenfield land and/or Green Belt to meet future housing needs in the draft SLP and GMSF demonstrates an emerging strategy to deal with the issue.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">“… the notion of a policy being out-of-date is one which exists within the structure of the Framework and which exists for particular purposes, namely the question of whether or not the tilted balance should apply and the weight which should be attached to the policy in the decision-taking process. In my judgment it is critical to note that there is nothing in the relevant provisions of the Framework to suggest that the expiration of a plan period requires that its policies should be treated as out-of-date. Indeed, to the contrary, the provisions of paragraph 213 specifically contemplate that older policies which are consistent with the Framework should be afforded continuing weight. Furthermore, I would entirely accept and adopt the formulation of the approach to the question of whether a policy is out-of-date given by Lindblom J in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Bloor Homes</span>. It will be a question of fact or in some cases fact and judgment. The expiration of the end date of the plan may be relevant to that exercise but it is not dispositive of it, nor did Lindblom J suggest that was the case. In so far as reliance is placed by the Claimant on the observation of Lord Carnwath in paragraph 63 of <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Hopkins Homes</span>, I accept the submissions made by the First and Second Defendants that it is an obiter remark which does not lay down any legal principle, or provide a gloss on Lindblom J's approach. It is important to note that Lord Carnwath had endorsed Lindblom J's views at an earlier part of the judgment and it would be inconsistent with that endorsement to read the sentence in paragraph 63 as a further gloss on Lindblom J's conclusions. In short, this sentence from the judgment is quite incapable of bearing the forensic weight which the Claimant seeks to ascribe to it. Lord Carnwath was not identifying a legal principle that when a plan's end date has been passed its policies are out-of-date in the terms of the policy of the Framework.” </p>

It was equally clear from paragraphs 371-2 that he was alive to the fact that the development plan no longer contained policies for the needs and distribution of housing since those policies have not been saved in 2009.

As the Inspector observes in the preceding sentences, a policy may continue to be effective in delivering its original objectives and, moreover, may have been saved as the present policy was, and thus remain part of the development plan to be applied in accordance with the statutory Framework. Thus, the exercise required by paragraph 213 of the Framework and the <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Bloor Homes</span> test is not one which is dictated simply by the passage of time, but rather an assessment of consistency of the Framework, and the factual circumstances in which the policy is being applied including, amongst other things, what the Inspector characterised as "results on the ground". In the particular circumstances of this case that was, as he reflected in paragraph 372 of the report, whether or not an appropriate quantity of housing was continuing to be delivered through the application of the remaining elements of the development plan which had not been saved.

Both paragraphs 15 and 16 crossrefer to the relevant paragraphs in the Inspector's report. In my view it is clear from those paragraphs to which the First Defendant cross-refers that the appropriate interpretation of the Framework in relation to whether or not a policy is out-of-date has been applied. The assessment of the Inspector, adopted and acknowledged by the First Defendant, addressed both the issue of consistency with the Framework (and therefore the policy's continuing validity as a proper reflection of national planning policy) but also whether or not, as the Claimant contended, the policy had been overtaken by the demise of the policies relating to the need and distribution of housing and the current evidence in relation to housing need and supply. Both the Inspector's conclusions and paragraphs 15 and 16 of the decision letter deal directly with the question of whether or not the policy is consistent with the Framework and also whether it has been overtaken by events, and in particular the absence of policies for the need and distribution of housing and the current position in relation to the evidence of housing need and supply.” </p>

The only feature of the 2018 NPPF on which the appellant had relied were those policies relating to the qualitative features of the available supply of housing. The judge observed that this element of national policy in relation to qualitative requirements was debated before the inspector in the context of the 2012 NPPF.

The absence of policies concerning such matters was clearly before the inspector and taken into account in his assessment of whether or not policy EN2 was out-of-date.

It was contended that the inspector and the Secretary of State failed to identify that policy EN2 was in fact “impeding delivery”.

Furthermore, the judge wrongly referred at paragraph 68 to “the current position in relation to the evidence of housing need and supply”. The fact that certain events are occurring cannot on a correct construction of the NPPF render a policy up-to-date, or protect it from being out-of-date. At best, such events are capable of being a material consideration in favour of a grant or refusal of permission, but only in the context of the inspector having correctly identified that paragraph 11d and the “tilted balance” are engaged. Equally, the housing supply figure was not capable of determining whether policy EN2 and the plan as a whole were out-of-date.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In the fourth ground of appeal, reiterating “ground 7” before the Planning Court, the appellant asserted that the judge erred in basing his decision on the inspector’s erroneous and inconsistent findings as to the impact of policy EN2 on the provision of housing. It was submitted that, in paragraph 25 of the decision letter, the Secretary of State wrongly followed the inspector in paragraph 377 of his report in stating that policy EN2 was “not impeding delivery”. That statement in the decision letter was, however, expressly placed in the alternative to “to deliver the necessary number of houses needed”. The appellant submitted that this amounted to a statement that the policy was not restricting delivery of houses of any type. This was factually wrong. Neither the Secretary of State nor the inspector conducted any assessment of the specific effect of the policy restricting the supply of houses of the required type. The appellant’s case was that the specific geographical nature of policy EN2 meant that this was one of the only locations in the area in which to provide housing of the required type. This was therefore an important consideration when determining whether the policy was out-of-date for the purposes of paragraph 11d.  </p>

It does not have the force of statute and should not be treated as if it did. It does not have the same status in the statutory scheme as the development plan. As a result, the duty under s.38(6) of the 2004 Act is not displaced or modified by the Framework policy. The presumption in favour of sustainable development in paragraph 11 of the NPPF is not intended to alter the statutory presumption in favour of the development plan. Instead, paragraph 11d is intended to add an additional factor into the s.38(6) balance in particular circumstances, including “where the policies which are most important for determining the application are out-of-date”. </p>

Mr Honey submitted that the sentence does not have the effect of establishing a point of principle about the interpretation of paragraph 11d, and made a number of points in support of this submission. First, the comment was made about the plan being out-of-date in a general sense, not in terms of the presumption in favour of sustainable development in the NPPF. Secondly, the comment was <span style="font-style:italic">obiter</span> as it was not part of the Court’s reasoning. Thirdly, a blanket approach to outdatedness based on the plan period would be incompatible with the more sophisticated approach set out by Lindblom J in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Bloor Homes</span> in a passage described by Lord Carnwath in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Hopkins Homes</span> as “helpful”.

Section 19 of the 2004 Act is headed “preparation of local development documents” and contains provisions governing that process. The subsections cited by the appellant – S.19(1B) and (1C) – were inserted by statute in 2017 and applied to the preparation of plans from 2018 onwards. The policy provisions on which the appellant relies in chapter 3 of the 2018 NPPF, headed “Plan-making”, including paragraphs 17 and 20, apply to the making of new plans after the introduction of the NPPF. Mr Honey submitted that it would undermine the plan-led system if implementation of a new framework policy about adoption of plans automatically rendered pre-existing plans out-of-date. </p>

In any event, it was wrong to contend that the Secretary of State equated the task of identifying whether a policy was out-of-date as merely relating to consideration of consistency.

There was nothing inconsistent in the inspector finding that the numbers of houses being built was exceeding the five-year supply whilst noting, and taking into consideration, deficiencies in the quality of the houses being constructed. It was submitted that the inspector was entitled to conclude that the policy was not impeding the delivery of homes, given that the Council was comfortably meeting its five-year housing land supply.

They stressed that the obligation imposed on the decision-maker by paragraph 11d of the 2018 NPPF is to ascertain whether a particular set of policies – those which are “most important for determining the application” – are out-of-date. That is a policy-specific enquiry, rather than one which can be undertaken simply by checking whether the development plan as a whole has gone past the specified plan period.

The Secretary of State decided in 2009 to save a significant number of the policies in the SUDP, including the majority of the strategic policies. It is, therefore, incorrect to characterise policy EN2 as a “freestanding” policy but rather one of a hundred and four policies in the SUDP saved by the Secretary of State. Furthermore, it is obvious that many policies will not expire with the plan but, rather, will survive beyond the plan period. The policy under consideration here, which addresses environmental protection, clearly has a life beyond the expiry of the plan. I agree with the judge’s observation at paragraph 66 of his judgment that although a local development document is intended to present as a coherent suite of policies, that objective is not inconsistent with the inclusion of some environmental policies being intended and designed to operate on a longer time scale than that which may be contemplated by the plan period. Paragraph 133 of the 2018 NPPF describes the “fundamental aim” of Green Belt policy as being “to prevent urban sprawl by keeping land permanently open”, adding that “the essential characteristics of Green Belts are their openness and their permanence”. This characterisation of Green Belt policy in the NPPF is wholly inconsistent with the notion that environmental policies lapse automatically when the plan period comes to an end or when there are no strategic housing policies in the plan. The provisions in s.19(1B) and (1C) of the 2004 Act and paragraphs 17 and 20 of the 2018 NPPF do not, in my judgment, provide support for the appellant’s case on the second ground of appeal. They relate to the preparation of future plans, not the question whether existing policies are out-of-date. </p>
