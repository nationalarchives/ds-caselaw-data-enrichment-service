For convenience I will refer to them all as appeals and to the applicants as Appellants.  The appeals were directed to be heard together because the factual situation which gives rise to them has generated a large number of claims in the tribunals and several applications for permission to appeal to this Court.  The precise nature of the orders appealed against in each case and the procedural routes by which they come before the Court vary.  The details appear in the judgment of Dingemans LJ, and I need not recapitulate them here. </p>

They all came to this country over ten years ago with leave to enter as students and have had further grants of leave to remain since then.  They claim to be entitled to indefinite leave to remain (“ILR”) on the basis of long residence.  The Secretary of State does not accept that they are so entitled, essentially because at the time of their applications their leave to remain had expired and they were overstayers.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">In three of the appeals – <span style="font-style:italic">Hoque</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">Kabir</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Arif</span> – the primary issue is whether, as they claim, the Appellants are entitled to ILR under the long residence provisions of the Immigration Rules.  That turns on the correct interpretation of paragraph 276B of the Rules.  That is an issue of law the outcome of which will necessarily be determinative of the rights of all applicants for ILR in the same circumstances.  By way of alternative they contend that the refusal of ILR is in breach of their rights under article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  In the fourth appeal – <span style="font-style:italic">Mubarak</span> – the Appellant relies only on article 8.  The article 8 issues are case-specific and do not in themselves raise any issue of principle. </p>

But very commonly that will not be the case, because even if the application is made some time before the end of the period the current leave may expire before the Home Office makes a decision (or before the expiry of the applicable review and appeal processes if the application is refused).  That situation is addressed by section 3C of the Immigration Act 1971, which provides (in summary) that in such a case leave will be automatically extended until 14 days after the decision is made (or any right of review or appeal has been exhausted).  It is important to appreciate that section 3C only operates where the application for further leave is made before<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>the expiry of the current period (“in time”).  If it is made after the expiry of the current period, the application may in due course be granted, but during the intervening period the applicant will have no leave and will be an overstayer. </p>

I will have to analyse it more fully later, but at this stage it is important to note that it consists of the primary “requirement” ([A]), followed by provision for two circumstances in which periods of overstaying may be “disregarded” ([B] and [C]), the first of which relates to “<span style="font-style:italic">current</span> … overstaying” <span style="color:#0B0C0C">and the second to “</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#0B0C0C">previous</span><span style="color:#0B0C0C"> … overstaying </span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#0B0C0C">between periods of leave</span><span style="color:#0B0C0C">”</span>.   Those two kinds of overstaying were referred to in the argument before us as, respectively, “openended” and “book-ended” overstaying.  I should also explain that the distinction under element [C] based on the date of the previous/further application reflects the fact that as from 24 November 2016 the previous general policy under the Rules of disregarding periods of overstaying of under 28 days was abandoned and a regime providing for different kind of disregard (“the paragraph 39E regime”) was introduced.  </p>

It does not itself provide for the disregard: that will be done in the operative provision which incorporates it by reference – in our case, paragraph 276B. The two circumstances which attract the disregard are of different characters, but in both the application for further leave needs to have been made within 14 days of the expiry of the previous leave or (to over-simplify) the refusal of a previous in-time application.  The effect for our purposes is that, when read with sub-paragraph 276B (v), where either condition is satisfied the periods of overstaying identified in element [B] or element [C], as the case may be, are disregarded: I will have to come back later to what exactly that means. </p>

Subparagraph (v) is expressed in the present tense – “must not <span style="font-style:italic">be</span> in the UK …”.

Subparagraph (i) (a), by contrast, requires that the applicant “has had” ten years’ continuous lawful residence.  That formulation does not necessarily require that the lawful residence is continuing at the date of decision.  No doubt typically that would be the case, but it would also be satisfied in a case where an applicant has accrued the relevant period in the past but has become an overstayer since then.  In my view the purpose of the requirement in sub-paragraph (v) is evidently to ensure that overstayers are not entitled to ILR in those circumstances (subject to the effect of the disregard).   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">I should mention one other point.  In course of the hearing Dingemans LJ pointed out that a further distinction between sub-paragraphs (i) (a) and (v) is that the phrase “in breach of immigration laws” in the latter is wider than the requirement of “lawful” residence in the former (as defined in paragraph 276A (a)), in that it covers not only cases where the person has no leave but also cases where they have it but are in breach of conditions: a breach of conditions does not automatically terminate leave, though it will be a ground on which it can be curtailed.  The result is that an applicant with ten years’ continuous lawful residence whose leave remains current at the date of decision will still be refused ILR if (say) they have leave as a student and are found to be working in excess of the permitted number of hours.  I understood Ms Giovannetti to accept that this was correct.  That is, however, entirely consistent with the purpose of sub-paragraph (v) being to address the applicant’s position at the date of the decision.  There is nothing surprising in the Secretary of State wishing to ensure compliance with immigration laws at the date of decision but not reserving a right to rely on past breaches (maybe up to ten years previously) which did not attract curtailment at the time. </p>

Subject to the arguments which I consider below, its effect is that where the applicant has had ten years’ continuous lawful residence in the past but it has expired, so that he or she is “currently” (i.e. at the date of decision) overstaying, that breach of the immigration laws will be disregarded in deciding whether the requirement in sub-paragraph (v) is satisfied, <span style="text-decoration:underline">provided</span> that one of the two “paragraph 39E circumstances” applies.  Such a situation might readily occur.  The applicant’s current limited leave (or, perhaps, an extension of it under section 3C) might expire after the ten-year anniversary and without them having made a further application on the basis of their ten years’ residence: they would thus become overstayers.  The effect of paragraph 39E would be that if they made that application within the 14-day grace period, or could show that the omission was the result of circumstances beyond their control, the overstaying would be disregarded with the result that the requirement in sub-paragraph (v) was treated as satisfied. </p>

That requirement is, as we have seen, concerned only with the applicant’s immigration status at the date of decision, to which previous book-ended periods of overstaying could never be relevant<span style="font-style:italic">.</span>  There is a frank disconnect between the disregard and the requirement to which it appears to be applied.  That is in fact reflected in the way that element [C] is verbally linked to the rest of the paragraph.  Unlike element [B], which is explicitly framed as an exception to the primary requirement and part of the same sentence, it takes the form of a self-contained sentence to the effect that the relevant periods of overstaying “will also be disregarded”.  In short, element [C] does not belong in subparagraph (v).  The only context in which previous periods of overstaying between periods of leave – and thus also a provision that they be disregarded – would matter is the requirement of ten years’ continuous lawful residence, which would of course otherwise be broken by a period of overstaying between periods of leave.

It is unfortunately not uncommon for tribunals and courts to have to grapple with provisions of the Immigration Rules which are confusingly drafted, but it is our job to try to ascertain what the drafter intended to achieve and give effect to it so far as possible.  In this case it is clear from its terms what the intended effect of element [C] is, but it has been put in the wrong place.  Treating it as if it appeared in sub-paragraph (i) (a) does violence to the drafting structure, but I do not believe that that is a sufficient reason not to give effect to it. </p>

It makes use of the provisions of paragraph 39E of the Rules. Paragraph 39E is the ‘exceptions for overstayers provision’ which, in effect, grants a 14-day period of ‘grace’ in respect of the lodging of LTR applications in certain circumstances. Under sub-paragraph (v), where paragraph 39E applies, any <span style="font-style:italic">current</span> period of overstaying as well as any <span style="font-style:italic">previous</span> period of overstaying after the advent of the amendment to the rules on 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2016 will be ‘disregarded’. In addition, periods of overstaying of less than 28 days before that date are also disregarded. The reference to previous periods means that, in requiring that the applicant should not ‘be in the United Kingdom in breach of immigration laws’, the sub-paragraph is not looking simply at the applicant’s status at the date of the application, but also looks back in time to his previous immigration status. [Counsel for the claimant] confirmed that the sub-paragraph referred to all previous periods of overstaying. This is, of course, subject to the SSHD's residual discretion.” </p>

With respect, I am unable to agree with that, even though it appears to have been conceded by counsel for the claimant.  As I have already said, the requirement is framed in the present tense – “must not <span style="font-style:italic">be</span> in the UK in breach of immigration laws” – and the first disregard refers to “current overstaying”.

But, in a helpful supplementary skeleton argument submitted shortly before the hearing, Ms Giovannetti and Mr Keith conceded that there was force in the point that “the first and second part of paragraph 276B (v) are addressing different matters” and that it followed that “some of the reasoning in <span style="font-style:italic">Masum Ahmed</span> is erroneous”.

If the Secretary of State’s policy was to allow a short period of grace where the applicant was subsequently granted leave, why should it be any different where the application remains outstanding?

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">However, that is not a complete answer.  Mr Biggs submitted that the unavailability of a “paragraph 39E disregard” for the purpose of satisfying the requirement of continuous lawful residence was irrational and/or a disproportionate interference with an applicant’s article 8 rights.  He pointed out that there were some circumstances in which an applicant would be positively unable to make a further application until after the previous (in-time) application had been determined.  If a period of grace is required in the case of book-ended gaps it is also necessarily required in the case of open-ended overstaying.  If he is right about that it might be necessary to give a strained construction to the rule.  I should therefore also say that I do not regard it as unreasonable or disproportionate for the Secretary of State to treat book-ended and open-ended overstaying differently.  In the case of a book-ended gap the applicant has been granted further leave, and has attained ten years’ residence, since the period of overstaying; and the only reason why the overstaying occurred was that they did not make in-time the <span style="font-style:italic">ex hypothesi </span>well-founded application which in due course led to the grant of leave.  It is in those circumstances unsurprising that the Secretary of State should think it right to allow the period between the expiry of the previous leave and the grant of the further leave to count as continuous lawful residence – assuming of course that the applicant can satisfy the requirements of paragraph 39E.  The case of open-ended overstaying is necessarily different because, <span style="font-style:italic">ex hypothesi</span>, there will have been no grant of leave on the original application: it will have remained, in effect as a place-marker, until the point where it is varied by the making of an application based on ten years’ continuous lawful residence. That is an essentially different situation from one where the application has in fact been granted.  It is also one that is capable of being abused, since an applicant could in principle make a wholly unfounded application as he or she approached the end of the ten-year period and count on the time taken to determine it (perhaps prolonged by a variation) in order to get to the point where an application under paragraph 276B could be made.  The facts of the present cases illustrate how that could be done, though of course I express no view about the merits of the particular applications on which the Appellants rely.  The Appellants argued that if the Secretary of State was concerned about that the remedy was in her own hands: she could, for example, alter the practice of permitting variation, or simply determine applications more promptly.  But even if that were a complete answer to the risk of abuse (which I am not persuaded that it is) it is not the fundamental point.  There is a plain difference between the situations where an applicant has attained ten years’ residence with leave and one where they have attained it without leave, albeit with a pending application, and it is in my view reasonable for the Secretary of State to treat the two situations as distinct.   </p>

At that point both paragraph 276B (i) (a) and the definitions of “lawful residence” and “continuous residence” in paragraph 276A were in the same form as they are now; but, as we have already seen, paragraph 276B (v) had not been introduced.  The only provision for a grace period of any kind was in an IDI which gave case-workers a discretion to overlook “a single short gap in lawful residence through making one single previous application out of time by a few days”.  The principal issue in the appeal was whether it was right in principle to seek to construe the definition of continuous lawful residence so as to conform with the IDI: as already noted, it was held that it was not.  But the Court also had to address a submission from counsel for the appellant (as it happens, Mr Gill) that “the definition of what constitutes lawful residence in rule 276A (a) is not exhaustive”.  At para. 25 of his judgment Dyson LJ roundly rejected that argument.  In one sense that supports Ms Giovannetti’s submission, but I agree with Mr Gill that it is in truth neutral.  Dyson LJ was, if I may say so, obviously right if one considers only the terms of the definition itself; but the whole argument before us is based on paragraph 276B (v) acting as a qualification to it.  I do not therefore think <span style="font-style:italic">MD (Jamaica)</span> advances the argument either way.  </p>

The fact remains that he did not qualify for ILR under the Rules, and UTJ Gill was in my view right to hold that the Secretary of State’s decision that the matters on which he relied under article 8 did not create a real prospect of success in the FTT was not irrational.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">This Court has very frequently in recent years had to deal with appeals arising out of difficulties in understanding the Immigration Rules.  This is partly a result of their labyrinthine structure and idiosyncratic drafting conventions but sometimes it is a simple matter of the confused language and/or structure of particular provisions.  This case is a particularly egregious example.  The difficulty of deciding what the effect of paragraph 276B (v) is intended to be is illustrated by the facts not only that this Court itself is not unanimous but that all three members have taken a different view from that reached by a different constitution in <span style="font-style:italic">Masum Ahmed</span>.  Likewise, the Secretary of State initially sought to uphold <span style="font-style:italic">Masum Ahmed</span> – contrary, it would seem to her own Guidance – but, as we have seen, shortly before the hearing executed a <span style="font-style:italic">volte face</span>.  (This illustrates a different vice, also far from unique, that the Home Office seems to have no reliable mechanism for reaching a considered and consistent position on what its own Rules mean.)  Of course mistakes will occasionally occur in any complex piece of legislation, or quasi-legislation; but I have to say that problems of this kind </p>

The result of poor drafting is confusion and uncertainty both for those who are subject to the Rules and those who have to apply them, and consequently also a proliferation of appeals.  The Secretary of State has already taken a valuable first step towards improving matters by asking the Law Commission to report on the simplification of the Immigration Rules, and I hope that action will be taken on those recommendations.  But the problem goes further than matters of structure and presentation, and I would hope that thought is also being given to how to improve the general quality of the drafting of the Rules. </p>

It begins with definitions in para. 276A. Para. 276B(i)(a) (there is no (b)) then tells the reader that the basic qualification requirement for achieving ILR is 10 years continuous lawful residence in the UK. Para. 276A defines “continuous residence” and “lawful residence”. In the basic case, of the type mentioned by Underhill LJ in his paragraph 8, the application of these provisions will cause no problem. Paras. 276C and 276D provide that leave may be granted or will be refused respectively, depending upon whether or not each of the requirements in para. 276B are or are not met. I agree that each of sub-para. (i) to (v) of that para., therefore, are largely separate requirements. Nonetheless, I see no reason why the tenor of those requirements should not be drawn from that paragraph as a whole and the concepts that it is seeking to define and/or qualify. It would be odd to isolate completely one part of a single paragraph from another. Normally, one construes a document, and <span style="font-style:italic">a fortiori</span> one clause in a document, with regard to its contents as a whole, rather than by its individual parts in isolation. Indeed, the Secretary of State’s presently favoured construction requires para. 276B(i) to be read with part (but not the whole) of para. 276B(v). </p>

This must be so because the relevant part of the definition of “breach of the immigration laws”, in para. 6, is that it means “without valid leave where such leave is required …”.

Until about 10.43 on the first morning of the present hearing (28 July 2020), when the new skeleton argument actually reached us, the court did not know that this new reading of para. 276B(v) was even being advanced even as a possible construction of that provision, let alone as being the “natural and ordinary” one. In my view, that is not surprising. There is no hint of such a meaning in any of the underlying materials before the deployment of the new argument. </p>

By the time the review was completed the previous leave would have expired and, if unsuccessful, it would be impossible (without sub-para. (v)) to reapply in time. Where the new sub-paragraph applied the applicant would not be treated as being in breach of immigration laws and would not be obliged to leave the country. As Mr. Gill submitted, it is hard to see why the applicant’s residence in the UK, continuing just as before, should not be regarded as “lawful” for the purpose of sub-para. 276B(i)(a). Any normal reading of the provision seems to me to require para. 276B(i)(a) to be qualified accordingly. As Mr Gill said, other breaches of immigration laws may still take the applicant outside the protection of sub-para. (v), but that only reinforces the point that that sub-paragraph would seem to qualify the rigour of sub-para. 276B(i)(a). </p>

However, it seems to me that current periods of overstaying might well have been within para. 7.48 and thus included in the phrase in para. 7.49 “or the exceptions identified above”. While the drafting of the explanation is singularly opaque, it does not seem to me that it is suggesting that the new sentence added to sub-para.

The new version provided that the entire period of current overstaying (as opposed to the 28day period only in the previous version) would be disregarded in a case where para. 39E applied. This brought both parts of the provision into line in cases where para. 39E applied. It would be most strange that the two parts of the provision, changed at the same time, should be intended to apply the “disregards” to different aspects of the paragraph as a whole.

The court’s quotation of para. 245AAA(a) includes sub-para. (iv), but not (iii). This is perhaps understandable as that case concerned periods of previous overstaying between periods of leave. However, to me, this provision does not show a contrast with para. 276B at all. It is a similarity. It makes similar provision for “disregards” of both types of overstaying (“current” and “previous”, without distinguishing between the two). I see no difference in para. 276B. </p>

Once an application is made promptly, the baton then passes to the Secretary of State to deal with the applications. If they are dealt with promptly, no problem arises. The real problem is where, as in some of these cases, there are long time lags between application and decision and a new application is then made which is treated as a variation of the first application. The remedy for that inconvenience is not to twist the wording of the existing rules but to amend them. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">Miss Giovannetti QC, for the Secretary of State, in a customarily attractive argument, contended that the two sentences of para. 276B(v) have two separate effects, as is succinctly stated in paragraph 19 of her skeleton argument (quoted above). She says that the first part of (v) is only intended to benefit a person whose application is made after having clocked up already the necessary 10-year period for the purposes of subpara. (i). It then allows for the “disregard” of any short period of overstaying after expiry of an old leave, to avoid the applicant being in breach of immigration laws, provided that the application is made within the 28-day (now 14 day) period of grace. It should not allow an applicant with less than 10 years lawful residence to clock up the 10-year period while waiting for the new application to be dealt with and the Rules were not intended so to provide. </p>

However, the remedy is in the Secretary of State’s own hands. If an application is made for further leave to remain after expiry of a former period of leave and before 10 years residence is achieved, it would have to be on other grounds. Such an application was made, for example, by Mr Hoque, who asked again for further leave as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant on 20 July 2016, within the 28-day period then prevailing.  (An earlier application had been rejected because of a technical failure to provide evidence to satisfy the requirements of the points-based system.) With the July 2016 application still extant, which had not been dealt with in the meantime by the Secretary of State, he applied on 13 October 2017 for ILR outside the Rules which took effect as a variation of the July 2016 application. Then while the application, as so varied, was still extant, he reached the period of 10 years residence and submitted (on 12 January 2018) a third application for ILR under the long residence provisions; that again took effect as a variation of the first application of July 2016. The July 2016 application, by then varied twice, was refused by the Secretary of State on 18 May 2018.  </p>

The Secretary of State drafts the rules; the Secretary of State issues the IDIs and guidance statements; the Secretary of State authorises the public statements made by his/her officials. The Secretary of State cannot toughen up the rules otherwise than by making formal amendments and laying them before Parliament.

(In my view, ambiguity only comes in if one tries to distort the language of the rule in the manner now suggested.) If it is ambiguous, this guidance does not help in supporting the construction now advanced. However, for the reasons given by Mr Gill (and others for the Appellants) we do not need to go there. There is also a telling absence from the Guidance to caseworkers that they should apply para. 276B in the manner now suggested by the Secretary of State. At best, this poorly drafted provision is not easy to construe and if it had been intended that two “disregards” appearing in the <span style="font-style:italic">very same</span> sub-sub- paragraph were to have different effects for different parts of the paragraph as a whole one might have expected that to be spelled out clearly for the guidance of Home Office staff in their work.

After many years of trying to understand and construe infelicitous drafting in various parts of these Rules and in simply trying to see how they are supposed to work in practice, I think that there may be no solution other than to discard the present Rules and to start again. It may take a considerable time to achieve, but the result should enable officials, migrants (and their advisers) and the Tribunals and courts to understand what is going on and should reduce the volume of litigation. That result, it seems to me, would be well worth it. </p>

The chronologies in the individual appeals show that after leave to remain had expired or been curtailed a further application had been made, and it is the time taken by these repeated applications which the appellants say counts to the 10 year period.  However difficult it is to interpret the provisions in paragraph 276B (and the way in which the exceptions have been added on to paragraph 276B(v) have made the Court’s task unnecessarily difficult) this seems to me to be a construction which defies reason because it would sanction the making of numerous repeated applications until 10 years had passed.

However I am persuaded that Underhill LJ’s construction that this second exception of paragraph 276B(v) applies to paragraph 276B(i), should be accepted for three reasons.  First this is because Underhill LJ’s construction: accords with the explanatory memorandum to HC667; reflects the Secretary of State’s practice when dealing with applications (so we are told on behalf of the Secretary of State); and is more beneficial to applicants for indefinite leave to remain than my provisional view.  In the case of ambiguity in the rules it is permissible to adopt an interpretation more generous to applicants on the basis of the Secretary of State’s statements about her practice, compare <span style="font-style:italic">Pokhriyal v Secretary of State for the Home Department </span>[2013] EWCA Civ 1568 at paragraph 39.  Secondly Underhill LJ’s analysis provides a meaning for the second exception which, as is pointed out by Underhill LJ at paragraph 35 of the judgment, would otherwise be lacking.  Thirdly there is a need to have some agreement on the proper construction of sub-paragraphs 276B(i) and (v), and my agreement with Underhill LJ’s construction gives a majority in favour of his interpretation of paragraph 276B.   </p>

The way in which sub-paragraph 276B(v) came to be in its present format appears from the judgments of Underhill and McCombe LJJ.  It is not apparent that any thought was given to the interrelationship of the parts of sub-paragraph 276B(v) [A], [B] and [C] (as defined in paragraph 8 of the judgment of Underhill LJ) with themselves or sub-paragraph 276B(i).  This leads to understandable confusion on the part of parties and their legal advisers.  In this respect McCombe LJ has pointed to the differing submissions made on behalf of the Secretary of State about the proper construction of the second exception to paragraph 276B(v) advanced in <span style="font-style:italic">R (Masum Ahmed) v Secretary of State for the Home Department</span> and in this case.

Further, where a human rights claim has already been made and rejected, the Secretary of State may refuse to treat the new human rights claim as amounting to a fresh claim under paragraph 353 of the Immigration Rules.

After the FTT dismissed his appeal and he was refused permission to appeal to the UT, Mr Arif commenced a claim for judicial review of that refusal of permission to appeal in the Administrative Court. The claim was dismissed by Elisabeth Laing J and an application to set aside that dismissal was refused by Saini J.  Mr Arif seeks permission to appeal against those decisions and requires an extension of time in which to do so.

The new claim followed on from the rejection of Mr Kabir’s claim before the FTT.  Very little detail was provided about Mr Kabir’s life in the UK apart from the chronology of events.    There was no material to show that the public interest in the maintenance of effective immigration controls was outweighed by Mr Kabir’s family and private life protected under article 8 of the ECHR.  The Secretary of State was entitled to refuse to treat Mr Kabir’s claim as a fresh claim because it was “clearly unfounded” because it was bound to fail before a FTT Judge.  UT Judge Craig was therefore right to refuse Mr Kabir permission to apply for judicial review. </p>

This was for a job as a sales account manager with Utility Choice Limited.  However he got a better opportunity with “Save My Quid Ltd” who offered a higher salary package and enhanced benefits and he moved to them. By an application made on 11 December 2015 he was granted further LTR as a Tier 2 (General) Migrant until 31 January 2019.  However on 29 October 2017 Mr Mubarak’s LTR as a Tier 2 (General) Migrant was curtailed to expire on 29 October 2017 because of issues concerning the sponsorship licence of his employer.  Mr Mubarak said that this was his employer’s fault.  Mr Mubarak noted that if his leave had not been curtailed because of those problems he would have been entitled to ILR after completing five years residence under Tier 2 (General). </p>

This was because the public interest in the maintenance of effective immigration controls, as set out in section 117B(1) of the 2002 Act, outweighed Mr Mubarak’s right to respect for his private and family life under article 8 of the ECHR which included the interaction with cousins and friends in the UK and even taking full account of Mr Mubarak’s young daughter’s best interests and her use of swimming pools and playgrounds in the UK.

She also referred to the more extensive grounds of appeal presented on the application for permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal; these included a submission that the decision of Sweeney J in <span style="font-style:italic">R (Juned Ahmed) </span>was wrong. The judge also noted that the original grounds before her did not address the “second appeals” test, applicable to any application to the High Court for permission to apply for judicial review of a decision of the UT refusing permission to appeal. Clearly, however, the judge did not have before her the draft amended grounds for review as finalised with leading counsel and lodged on 16 September nor the previous “existing version” of the draft amended grounds sent to the court on 23 August.

It is rightly described in the authorities as ‘exceptional’. It is ‘exceptional’ in the sense that it will be engaged only where some obvious and egregious error has occurred in the underlying proceedings and that error has vitiated – or corrupted – the very process itself. It follows that the CPR r 52.30 jurisdiction will never be engaged simply because it might plausibly or even cogently be suggested that the decision of the court in the underlying proceedings, whether it be a decision on a substantive appeal or a decision on an application for permission to appeal, was wrong. The question of whether the decision in the underlying proceedings was wrong is only secondary to the proper question of whether the process has itself been vitiated. But even if that prior question is answered ‘Yes’, the decision will only be reopened if the court is satisfied that there is a powerful probability that it was wrong.”</p>

In his reasons, the judge rejected the submission that the integrity of the proceedings had been critically undermined and found that the reasons for delay in submitting final grounds for judicial review were “far from convincing”. He said that, in any event, he agreed with the decision of Elisabeth Laing J refusing the original application for permission to apply and found that the “second appeal” test (<span style="font-style:italic">Cart</span>) was not met. By Appellant’s Notice of 13 February 2020, Mr Arif applied for permission to appeal from Saini J’s order.

It must have been immediately apparent as early as 17 September 2019 that Elisabeth Laing J’s order had been founded solely upon the grounds for review originally that had been lodged with the Claim Form as required by the Rules and the relevant Practice Direction. Further, no application had ever been made to amend those grounds. The prospect of further grounds being settled by leading counsel did not constitute such an application to amend, nor did the lodging of “the existing version of the grounds” on 23 August 2019, even with a request that the papers should not go before a judge until 9 September, achieve that end. The original papers did go before Elisabeth Laing J and she dealt with them comprehensively on Friday, 13 September, before the finalised draft amended grounds were despatched to the court on the following Monday. It cannot, therefore, be said that the judge did not confront and deal with the formal grounds of review. She did precisely that. The process had not been critically undermined. </p>

By the time that the judge dealt with the papers, even the delay asked for (on 23 August), before the papers went before a judge, had expired. No request had been made for the informal “existing version” of 23 August to be placed before the judge. No assurance had been given after 23 August that the papers would not be considered. Such matters are not without significance when it is sought to reopen proceedings that have already been final for a lengthy period when application to reopen is made. </p>

She was well aware of the issues in the case, even on the grounds before her, and she made a comprehensive decision upon them. Given the overall delays by Mr Arif in presenting his draft amended claim to the High Court, the delay thereafter in making an application to reopen the case, and the law as it was understood to be, there were no conceivable grounds upon which Saini J could have reopened the original proceedings.  </p>

The proceedings were themselves subject to a time limit of 16 days from the sending of the notice of the UT’s decision for the lodging of the Claim Form and supporting documents and the permission to apply for review was subject to a requirement that the case should give rise to an important point of principle or practice or that there is some other compelling ground to permit the claim to be brought: CPR 54.7A(3) and (7). The evidence seeking to explain the delay after receipt of Elisabeth Laing J’s order was inadequate for the purpose. One only has to consider again the judgment in the <span style="font-style:italic">Goring</span> case to understand that the principle of finality renders impossible a reopening of judicial review proceedings in circumstances such as those in Mr Arif’s case. </p>
