	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">David Joseph was an equity partner in Deloitte NSE LLP (“Deloitte”) pursuant to the terms of a limited liability partnership agreement dated 1 June 2017 (“the LLP Agreement”). Clause 16.2 of the LLP Agreement confers a power on the Board of Deloitte (“the Board”) to expel a partner by issuing a Notice of Retirement. The partner has a right to ask the Board to reconsider the decision to issue a Notice of Retirement. The partner also has a right to put their case to a special meeting of the full partnership of Deloitte numbering around 1,700 partners in 13 countries (“a partners’ meeting”). On 23 July 2019 the Board issued a Notice of Retirement to Mr Joseph with effect from 31 January 2020. The Board’s reasons for taking this step are not relevant for present purposes. On 1 August 2019 Mr Joseph asked the Board to reconsider the decision to issue a Notice of Retirement. On 18 September 2019 Deloitte’s General Counsel and Managing Director, Caryl Longley, sent Mr Joseph an email to inform him that his request would be considered by the Board at its meeting on 2 October 2019, that he would have the opportunity to attend and that “[t]he final Board decision following this meeting will be communicated to you by no later than 9 </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">October 2019”. Mr Joseph did not attend the Board meeting, but submitted written representations. On 10 October 2019 Mr Joseph sent Deloitte an email noting that he had not yet been informed of the Board’s decision and requesting that, if it was adverse to him, a partners’ meeting be convened. The Board’s decision on its reconsideration was communicated to Mr Joseph on 11 October 2019. The Board decided not to withdraw the Notice of Retirement. On 12 October 2019 Mr Joseph repeated his request for a partners’ meeting to be convened. On 17 October 2019 Deloitte’s solicitors wrote to Mr Joseph’s solicitors declining this request on the ground that Mr Joseph’s email dated 10 October 2019 was out of time since clause </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">On 25 October 2019 Mr Joseph issued proceedings seeking an order for specific performance of the obligation to convene a partners’ meeting. Mr Joseph contended that, on the true construction of clause 16.2, alternatively by virtue of an implied term, his request was in time, alternatively that Deloitte was estopped from denying that it was in time by virtue of Ms Longley’s email dated 18 September 2019 and Mr Joseph’s reliance thereon. After an expedited trial on 27 November 2019 Whipple J dismissed Mr Joseph’s claim for the reasons given in her judgment dated 5 December 2019 [2019] EWHC 3354 (QB). Mr Joseph now appeals with permission granted by Males LJ on two grounds, namely that (i) the judge should have held there was an implied term, alternatively (ii) Deloitte was estopped. Mr Joseph no longer seeks an order for specific performance, but damages for breach of contract. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Three points concerning the interpretation of clause 16.2 are now common ground (and in the case of the first and third points, always have been). First, clause 16.2 specifies a three-stage procedure: stage 1 is the Board’s decision to issue a Notice of Retirement; stage 2 is the Equity Partner’s right to make their point of view known to the Chairman and to present their case to the Board orally or in writing; and stage 3 is the Equity Partner’s right to demand that the Board convenes a partners’ meeting. Secondly, the seven-day period specified in clause 16.2(b) for demanding that a partners’ meeting be convened runs from the date of the Board meeting (subject to the implied term contended for by Mr Joseph). Thirdly, the purpose for which the partners’ meeting may be convened is to review the Board’s original decision to issue a Notice of Retirement, not the Board’s decision following the Board meeting to consider the Equity Partner’s representations. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Nevertheless, there remain disputes as to the interpretation of clause 16.2, and in particular the words “the Board has not withdrawn the Notice of Retirement and such Equity Partner is still aggrieved” in clause 16.2(b). Deloitte contends, and the judge accepted at [27(i) and (ii)], that withdrawal of the Notice of Retirement requires (a) a decision of the Board to withdraw the Notice and (b) communication of that decision to the Equity Partner, and hence that the Equity Partner may be still aggrieved if the Board has decided to withdraw the Notice, but has not communicated that decision to the Partner. Mr Joseph disputes this. There are a number of aspects to this issue which I will consider in turn. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The first point is that, as is common ground, the Board is obliged to notify the Equity Partners of their decisions (clause 8.2) and to do so in a timely and effective manner (clause 7.2(a)(x)). Clause 16.2(b) does not, however, specify any time limit within which the Board is required to communicate its decision whether or not to withdraw the Notice of Retirement to the Equity Partner. What amounts to timely communication will inevitably depend on the circumstances, and in particular the time it takes the Board to make its decision and the time it takes the Board to communicate that decision to the Equity Partner. </p>

Even if the Equity Partner presents no new information, the Board may need time to consider their submissions and to reach a decision. If the Equity Partner does present new information, the Board may need time in which to investigate the new information. Indeed, this may be required by the obligation of good faith (clause 14.1(a)). Either way, the Board may wish to take legal advice before taking its decision. </p>

If the Equity Partner is not present, then the Board’s decision will have to be communicated to them subsequently even if the Board is able to make a decision during the meeting. The speed of this will depend on the method of communication adopted. Clause 16.2 does not specify any method of communication for the steps to be taken at the various stages, clause 27.6 does not apply (because it only applies to notices pursuant to clause 16.1) and the LLP Agreement contains no general notice provision (and in particular no provision deeming notice to have been given at any specific point in time). Even if the communication is sent by, say, email, several hours may elapse between it being sent and it being read by the Equity Partner (e.g. because the Equity Partner is asleep at the time it is sent because they are located in a different time zone). </p>

Although counsel for Mr Joseph initially appeared to accept this, subsequently he submitted that this was not sufficient and that withdrawal of the Notice was not effective unless and until it was agreed to by the Equity Partner. In my view this is an impossible submission. Withdrawal will be a response to the Partner’s request that the Notice be withdrawn. It will be effective once communicated to the Partner. No acceptance or agreement by the Partner is required to make it effective (unless, of course, the withdrawal is conditional, in which case it may be necessary for the Partner to accept the condition).  </p>

In that context, the grievance is occasioned by the “decision of the Board to give him or her a Notice of Retirement”. Counsel for Mr Joseph submitted that the Equity Partner could not be “still aggrieved” where they were awaiting the outcome of the Board meeting and did not know whether or not the Board had decided to withdraw the Notice.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The fifth question is whether the Equity Partner is, as counsel for Mr Joseph submitted, precluded from exercising their right to demand that a partners’ meeting be convened until they have been informed of the Board’s decision not to withdraw the Notice of Retirement. In my judgment there is nothing in the wording of clause 16.2(b) to support this contention. I accept, however, that this potentially leads to some odd consequences. Clause 16.2 does not empower the Board to cancel the partners’ meeting once it has been convened even if the Board has decided in the meantime to withdraw the Notice of Retirement. Although the Board has a general power to convene partners’ meetings (clause 3.1), it has no express power to cancel such meetings even if they subsequently turn out not to be necessary. No doubt such a power is to be implied; but as counsel for Mr Joseph pointed out, damage may already have been done by the time the meeting is cancelled. The notice convening the partners’ meeting must contain details of the matter to be discussed, together with any written representations submitted by the aggrieved Equity Partner (clause 16.2(c)). Thus if the Equity Partner demands that a partners’ meeting be convened prior to knowing what the Board had decided, the full partnership may be informed of the details of the dispute, only for the partners’ meeting to be cancelled. That may well be damaging to the Equity Partner’s reputation, and burdensome and disruptive for the partnership as a whole. Moreover, the partners’ meeting may be required by virtue of the 14-day notice period to take place before the Board has decided whether or not to withdraw the Notice of Retirement (unless, perhaps, there is an implied requirement that the Board’s decision be communicated prior to the date of the partners’ meeting).  </p>

As noted above, it is common ground that the function of the partners’ meeting is to consider the Board’s original decision to issue the Notice of Retirement (as is clear not just from the wording of clause 16.2(b), but also from clause 16.2(e) and (f)). But what happens if a large number of partners conclude that the Board’s original decision to issue the Notice of Retirement was correct, and disagree with its decision to withdraw the Notice? If the partners’ meeting has not been cancelled in time, can the partners countermand the withdrawal of the Notice of Retirement? If the partners’ meeting has been cancelled, can the partners call a meeting for this purpose pursuant to clause 3.2? It is not necessary to try to answer these questions for the purposes of the appeal; it is sufficient to note that they potentially arise.  </p>

I consider that both parties are right; but that, to the extent that the two purposes conflict, the former predominates, because time runs from the date of the Board meeting and not from the date on which the Board’s decision is communicated to the Equity Partner. Although it may, for the reasons explored above, be uncertain at the expiry of the seven-day period whether the Equity Partner needs to exercise the right to demand that a partners’ meeting be convened, and although it may have adverse consequences for both parties if the Equity Partner is forced to exercise the right when it subsequently turns out that they need not have done, I do not consider that either of these considerations detracts from the conclusion that the deadline provides certainty.  </p>

First, it afforded the Equity Partner protection against the Board delaying its decision as to whether or not to withdraw the Notice of Retirement. Secondly, it gave the Equity Partner “leverage” to press for the Board’s decision to be reached and communicated swiftly. These seem to me to be different ways of making the same point, rather than different points. More importantly, it appears that the judge’s attention was not drawn to clause 7.2(a)(x), which as noted above requires the Board’s decision to be communicated in a timely and effective manner. Thus it is not necessary for clause 16.2(b) to require this. Furthermore, as discussed above, there may be perfectly good reasons why the Board cannot make and communicate its decision swiftly. </p>

These provide that the Equity Partner may call for a partners’ meeting “within seven (7) days of the date of such Board meeting”. To add “or (if later) within seven days of the date when the decision of the Board at or following such meeting is communicated to the Equity Partner” is not merely, as counsel for Mr Joseph argued, to qualify or limit the express words, but to re-write clause 16.2(b) to provide a different rule. This is particularly so given that clause 16.2(a) specifies a time limit of “seven (7) days after receipt of such Notice”: as the judge noted, this highlights the fact that it would have been easy for clause 16.2(b) to specify that the time limit was seven days from receipt of the Board’s decision as to whether or not to withdraw the Notice of Retirement, but that is not what it says.

One was that for all its length and detailed provisions, the LLP Agreement was not, on analysis, a well crafted document but contained a number of practical difficulties which showed, as Arnold LJ has demonstrated, that it was very far from being well thought through.  The second was that one would naturally expect a partner, such as Mr Joseph, who had exercised their stage 2 right to ask the Board to reconsider the decision, to know what the outcome of that exercise was before being required to choose whether to take the step, potentially damaging to themselves and undoubtedly disruptive to the partnership as a whole, of invoking the stage 3 right to require the convening of a special meeting of all the Equity Partners.  In those circumstances it is tempting to try and fashion a remedy for Mr Joseph.  But as Sir Thomas Bingham MR said in <span style="font-style:italic">Philips Electronique Grand Public SA v British Sky Broadcasting Ltd </span>[1995] EMLR 472 at 482: “Tempting, but wrong”.  The role of the Court, whether in interpreting the terms the parties have expressly agreed, or considering what they have impliedly agreed, is not to make a better contract for the parties but to ascertain what their contract is.  Here the parties agreed that Mr Joseph should have 7 days from the date of the Board meeting to invoke his stage 3 right, and no amount of implication can convert that into 7 days from his being told the outcome of such meeting.   </p>

The most usual inference in such a case is that nothing is to happen. If the parties had intended something to happen, the instrument would have said so. Otherwise, the express provisions of the instrument are to continue to operate undisturbed. If the event has caused loss to one or other of the parties, the loss lies where it falls.”   </p>

But that is not enough to enable the court to imply a term to the effect for which Mr Cohen QC contended. First, any implied term along the lines that he suggested would conflict with the express term in clause 16.2 (b). Second, as the court probed the contents of the suggested implied term, it became clear that it would take a good deal of thought to formulate. In his ultimate formulation, Mr Cohen argued that time for the stage 3 process should not begin to </p>

If he were away on holiday or a business trip, there might be an indefinite time lag between the decision and the start of the period within which stage 3 rights could be exercised.
