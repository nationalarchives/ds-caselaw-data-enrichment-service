	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">This second appeal concerns the service charge provisions in a tenancy agreement of a one-bedroom bungalow in a sheltered housing scheme in Bristol. Although the amount involved in this case is small, we are told that the same issues arise in over 3,400 other tenancy agreements, as regards properties on the same and other housing schemes of which the appellant is the landlord. We are told that the overall financial impact is in excess of Â£300,000 pa and will amount cumulatively, as at the end of the appellantâs current financial year on 31 March 2021, to nearly Â£1.16 million. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The tenancy agreement, dated 18 August 2008, was made between the appellant (the landlord) and the respondent (the tenant). The bungalow is one of 32 residential units set in communal grounds with lawns, trees and paths. It is common ground that the landlord maintained the communal grounds at the time of the tenancy agreement and had done so for some years before then. Until 2017, the landlord did not seek to levy a charge for this maintenance (grounds maintenance) on tenants whose tenancies commenced before the end of April 2010 (when a change to the standard tenancy terms was made, expressly to cover grounds maintenance).  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In January 2017, the landlord gave a written notice to the tenant, seeking to add grounds maintenance to the services under the tenancy agreement for which it could charge, and to charge Â£77.98 pa (or Â£1.50 per week) for grounds maintenance for 2017/18. The tenant objected. In circumstances where grounds maintenance had been provided without charge since he became a tenant in 2008, he argued that the landlord had no power under the terms of the tenancy agreement to add it as a service for which it could charge. Further, he contended that, if the tenancy agreement did permit its addition, the term was not binding on him by virtue of the Unfair Terms in Consumer Regulations 1999 (the 1999 Regulations).  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In June 2017, the tenant applied to the First-tier Tribunal (Property Chamber) (the FTT) for a determination under section 27A of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 of his liability to pay the service charge in respect of grounds maintenance. Although the tenant raised both the issue as to the terms of the tenancy agreement and the issue under the 1999 Regulations, the FTT decided only the issue of construction, ruling in favour of the tenant. It did not consider or rule on the application of the 1999 Regulations. The Upper Tribunal granted permission to appeal. In a Decision dated 18 April 2019, the Upper Tribunal (Lands Chamber) (HH Judge Nicholas Huskisson) (the UT and the UT judge) dismissed the appeal on the construction point. The UT judge gave the appellant permission to appeal to this court.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">A preliminary point arose as to whether this court should deal with the issue under the 1999 Regulations, if we were to hold in favour of the landlord on the construction of the tenancy agreement. The landlord wished us to do so, and advanced submissions on it in its skeleton argument. The tenant opposed this course, submitting that, should it arise, it should be remitted to the FTT for determination.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.00in;text-indent:0.08in">In the grant of permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal it was recognised that the only issue in this appeal concerns the interpretation of the document.  Neither party at the hearing before me had prepared any argument regarding unfair contract terms.  Also I was told that there are other cases raising a similar point to that raised by the respondent which are pending before the FTT, being cases in which it is intended to argue (if necessary) the points regarding unfair contract terms.  In these circumstances I was asked by both the appellant and the respondent not to consider the question of unfair contract terms.  If my decision was favourable to the respondent the point would not arise.  If my decision was favourable to the appellant then I was asked to remit to the FTT the question of whether clause 2.10.1(iii) was unenforceable by reason of being an unfair contract term.â </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Having invited and received a written submission from the landlord as to whether this court should deal with the issue, we ruled before the start of the hearing that we would not do so. We did not consider it appropriate that such a point should be considered for the first time on a second appeal, particularly (though not exclusively) because it requires evaluation of evidence and of whether the term is, in all the relevant circumstances, unfair, and there may be a need for more evidence. Further, this appeared to have been the position adopted by both parties before the UT. The submissions before us were therefore directed only to the issue of construction. </p>

However on the facts of the present case the preaddition position (i.e prior to the purported exercise of clause 2.10.1(iii)) is exactly the same as regards ground maintenance to the post addition position.  There is no way in which the operation by the appellant of clause 2.10.1(iii) can be said to be useful save only the use to the appellant of being able to charge money for something it was not previously charging money for.

Likewise, in my view, sub-paragraph (iii) entitles the landlord to vary the agreement by adding services if it believes this would be useful.

Additional protection is provided by the landlordâs statutory status as a registered provider of social housing, and the internal complaints procedure and the right to take complaints to an ombudsman: see clauses 6.5.1 and 6.6.1.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0.00in">To read these sub-paragraphs, or just sub-paragraph (iii), as referring instead to the services in fact provided by the landlord is to introduce a point of reference for which there is, in my view, no warrant in the terms of clause 2.10.1 or in any other part of the agreement. It would have the effect of making these provisions depend on a factual investigation of the position prevailing at the relevant time. I use the term ârelevant timeâ advisedly, because there seems to be some confusion as to what would constitute the relevant time. At [41], the UT judge referred to the position as at the time in 2008 that the tenancy agreement was made. At [48], he emphasised the position at that time. However, at [44], he stated his view that sub-paragraph (iii) refers to services that are âextra to services that as a matter of fact are being provided by the appellant <span style="font-style:italic">prior to the purported reliance upon clause 2.10.1(iii)</span>â (emphasis added). This is repeated at [45] as the relevant time. If the relevant time is the date of the tenancy, it would foreseeably produce inconsistent results for different tenancy agreements with identical provisions, depending on their commencement dates, and require a factual investigation of the precise extent of the services being provided without charge at those dates. If the relevant time is the position prior to the purported reliance on sub-paragraph (iii), there could be no objection to invoking the subparagraph in respect of services which had once been provided by the landlord but which it had ceased to provide.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0.00in">In support of his reading of sub-paragraph (iii), the UT judge said at [45] that his view was strengthened by the words âif it believes this would be usefulâ, which he read as requiring the position of the estate after the addition of the extra service to be, in fact, better than its pre-addition state. On the facts of the present case, the pre- and postaddition positions of the estate would be the same as regards grounds maintenance and the addition of grounds maintenance could not therefore be said to be useful, save for the purposes of the landlord who could then charge for it. This, as it seems to me, ignores that, as regards this tenancy agreement, the landlord would have been entitled at any time to stop providing grounds maintenance. By adding it as an extra service under sub-paragraph (iii), the landlord becomes contractually bound to provide it, unless and until âit reasonably believes that it is no longer practicable to do soâ under sub-paragraph (i). Mr Bates supported the UTâs reasoning by submitting that âusefulâ in sub-paragraph (iii) governs the service; it cannot be said to be useful to provide a service if it is already being provided. As a matter of the language used, this is not in my view correct. Sub-paragraph (iii) states that âit may provide extra Services if <span style="font-style:italic">this </span>would be usefulâ (emphasis added). âServicesâ is plural, so as a matter of grammar âthisâ cannot refer to the extra services.

In its context, however, the word âmayâ refers to the discretion of the landlord to add extra services to the listed services. Once the discretion is exercised those extra services form part of the services which it is obliged to provide under the agreement. If the purpose of sub-paragraph (iii) were to enable the landlord voluntarily to provide extra services, it is hard to see why it should be included at all, still less why there should be a requirement for prior consultation with the tenants.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0.00in">For these reasons, I am unable to agree with the decisions of the tribunals below, and I would accordingly allow the appeal. It follows from what I said at the start of this judgment, that I would remit to the FTT the issue concerning the application of the 1999 Regulations. </p>
