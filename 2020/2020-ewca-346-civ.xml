A and his siblings and their parents had been involved with the local authority social services for some time. The children had previously been placed on the Child Protection Register due to concerns about neglect, poor home conditions, inadequate supervision and an incident between the parents in March 2017. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Following the fire, the local authority started care proceedings in respect of A. An interim care order was made and A was placed in foster care where he remains. Initially, he struggled to settle into the placement and demonstrated a high level of trauma and distress, but with the steady and loving care provided by his foster carers he has now settled down in that placement. We were told, however, that his current carers are unable to offer A a home in the long term. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">A’s mother has been assessed as having a mild to moderate learning disability and the impact of this on her cognitive abilities has been compounded by the post-traumatic stress disorder she has suffered following the fire. She is therefore represented in these proceedings by the Official Solicitor. An assessment of the parents concluded that it was unlikely that they would be able to meet A’s needs even after undergoing therapeutic work. They accept that the chance of A being rehabilitated to their care is very remote. The local authority, as it was obliged to do, looked at the options of placing A with members of his extended family. A “viability” assessment of the paternal grandparents was completed with a positive recommendation, but at that stage the grandparents indicated that they did not wish to put themselves forward as potential carers. Having completed its assessments, the local authority concluded that A should be placed for adoption, and filed evidence and a care plan setting out its reasons and proposals for giving effect to that conclusion. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The final hearing of the care proceedings was listed to start on 24 February 2020. At the pre-trial review on 31 January 2020, the Official Solicitor on the mother’s behalf applied under Part 25 of the Family Procedure Rules 2010 for a child psychiatric assessment to be undertaken by Dr Martin Newman, to report on the impact on A of placement for adoption. This application was supported by A’s father but opposed by the local authority and the child’s guardian. It was refused by the judge for reasons summarised below. On 7 February, the mother filed a notice of appeal to this court against that decision.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">At about the same time, the paternal grandparents informed the social worker that they had changed their minds and now wished to put themselves forward as long-term carers for A. As a result, the proceedings were listed for a further case management hearing before the judge on 14 February. Two matters fell to be considered: (1) an application to adjourn all or part of the final hearing, and (2) a renewed application on </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">behalf of the mother for the instruction of Dr Newman. The judge dealt with the second matter first, and again dismissed the application, for reasons also summarised below. She then considered the future of the proceedings. The local authority proposed that the hearing listed on 24 February be retained to enable the court to determine whether the threshold criteria under s.31 of the Children Act were satisfied and to rule out the parents as carers on the principles articulated in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">North Yorkshire v.</span><span style="font-style:italic"> </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">B</span> [2008] 1 FLR 1645. In the event, however, the judge decided to adjourn the whole of the final hearing to a date in July 2020. The judge made a series of further case management directions, including an order for the local authority to file its full assessment of the paternal grandparents by 14 April 2020, with a timetable for the filing of further evidence thereafter.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Following this decision, the mother’s lawyers submitted a supplemental skeleton argument indicating that they wished to extend the application for permission to appeal to include an appeal against the refusal of the renewed application under Part 25. On 20 February, I granted permission to appeal against both orders and listed the appeal for an urgent hearing today, with ancillary directions. We are very grateful to the parties’ representatives for the work they have done to ensure that the appeal can be determined today. </p>

Adoption involves traumatic loss, of what are often valuable significant and ongoing relationships for children. Assessing the impact of that and how it feeds into the placement needs of the child is a task required of the court in every case where adoption is involved. Of course the court must be acutely aware of the tragic consequences is which the loss for A has occurred pre-adoption and in such traumatic circumstances. The court is profoundly concerned with how that will continue to impact on A in the short, medium and long term. … Every case requires the child’s individual needs to be carefully and forensically examined.

In the present case, the court will need to assess the impact of his siblings’ death on A, if adopted, in both the short and long-term. It is submitted that, for all their acknowledged professional experience, neither the local authority social worker nor the guardian have sufficient expertise to address that issue. Counsel submit that the social worker’s “child impact analysis”, whilst acknowledging the likely need for therapy at some point in the future, fails to consider how the trauma experienced by A may affect the choice of placement. A similar criticism is made of the children’s guardian’s final analysis. Both reports contain an analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of adoption on the one hand and long term fostering on the other, but counsel submit that in each case the analysis is no more than a generic assessment of the pros and cons. It is submitted that exceptional facts require a bespoke approach. Given the lack of analysis by either the social worker or the guardian on this critical area, it is submitted that the judge was wrong to rule that each had sufficient expertise to address it. </p>

As to the third ground, it is submitted that the judge was wrong to indicate that the focus would be on an assessment of the prospective carers. It is submitted that a comprehensive assessment of A’s needs, including an expert analysis of the impact of trauma, is necessary as a preliminary step in deciding the appropriate placement. With regard to the fourth ground, it is contended that, insofar as the judge was proposing that a report from CAMHS would meet the need for any psychiatric or psychological input into her decision, she was overlooking the fact that CAMHS involvement in the case has been to advise the foster carers rather than carry out any direct work with A. Furthermore, there is no evidence that the CAHMS psychologist has any particular experience of working with children suffering this level of bereavement. </p>

Furthermore, in this case the issue goes beyond the question of attachment. It relates also to the impact of the successive losses which A has experienced, and will continue to experience, throughout his life. In oral submissions, Mr Rowley identified various strands of trauma and loss which would be likely to impinge on A in the years ahead – the impact and effect of direct trauma from his experiences of the fire, the indirect trauma of witnessing the aftermath, the trauma of separation from his parents, the trauma of coming to understand the loss of his siblings, the possibility of “survivor’s guilt” which Mr Rowley described as a recognised phenomenon of post-traumatic stress disorder, and the possible effect later on of holding his parents responsible for the loss of his siblings, with a consequential impact on his sense of identity. All these strands are matters which are plainly relevant to the decision whether A should be placed within his family, with long-term foster carers in circumstances which would facilitate ongoing contact with some family members, or for adoption which would result in an almost complete fracture of his relationships with his birth family. </p>

They reject the description of the social worker’s analysis as generic. They contend that the evidence filed by the local authority has carefully weighed in the balance the impact of loss and trauma in so far as it can be known at this stage. The extent to which A may suffer in the future as a result of his lived experiences is entirely unknown at this stage and would not be resolved by the proposed expert’s report. It is submitted that the appellant has failed to identify precisely how an expert in psychiatry could fill any perceived gap in the social worker’s evidence. Any report prepared by psychiatrists will be based on one short interview and would be no more than a snapshot of A. The judge was therefore entitled to conclude that Dr Newman’s opinion would be no more than speculation. They add that the appellant has misrepresented the court’s treatment of the proposed report from CAMHS. It was never intended to be an expert assessment of A, but merely confirming advice given to the social worker. </p>

It is her case that both the social worker and the guardian have the relevant experience to address the court on issues relating to A’s history, his attachment with his parents and carers and the impact of breaking that attachment if he is moved to an adoptive placement. It is submitted that previous traumatic experiences of children and the impact of future loss of the birth family through adoption are not uncommon features of public law care proceedings. In some cases, those traumatic experiences involve the loss of a parent or sibling. Identifying future placement needs, and weighing up the pros and cons of each option, will inevitably involve consideration of the losses experienced to date and any future losses involved under the various options. Such considerations frequently lie within the remit of experienced social workers and guardians, albeit with advice and guidance from specialist professionals involved with the child, such as has occurred with CAMHS in this case. Ms Moody endorses the submission on behalf the local authority that the judge was right to query how any psychiatric assessment at this stage would provide the court with any additional evidence since it cannot be known with any certainty how or when A’s trauma will manifest itself or what impact it will have on his placement. The balancing of losses against benefits from each placement falls within the remit of the social worker and guardian. </p>

Given my clear view as to the necessity for a psychiatric opinion, I would have allowed the appeal even though it would have led to a delay in the final hearing in the circumstances of this case, but, by 14 February, that factor had fallen away. As the local authority conceded that the final hearing would have to be adjourned to accommodate the assessment of the grandparents, the instruction of Dr Newman would have no impact on the timetable for the proceedings. Indeed, it can be accommodated easily within the revised timetable, so that the parties, including the local authority and guardian, can take his conclusions into consideration when formulating final care plans and recommendations to the court on the crucially important and potentially difficult question of A’s future placement. </p>
