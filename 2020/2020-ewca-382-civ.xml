	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The nature of the underlying proceedings can be shortly stated.  The parties are in dispute, amongst other things, about the beneficial ownership of a valuable property in which they lived before their separation.  The property is owned by a company of which PA is the sole director and MM the sole shareholder.  On 22 March 2019, a freezing order was made, restraining the parties from disposing of or dealing with the company income or assets except to enable the company to meet its tax or other liabilities.  In November 2019, a further order required PA to produce the company bank statements.  These showed that he had used the company bank account to make payments amounting to over £25,000 in respect of his personal living expenses and legal fees, some £18,000 of which post-dated the freezing order.  PA did not dispute that he had caused the company to make the payments but claimed that they were made in respect of the company’s liabilities, namely in paying him a salary, in repaying loans he said he had made to it, and in discharging the company’s alleged liability for legal fees. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">On 13 January 2020, MM applied for PA’s committal for contempt of court.  The hearing of the summons took place before Lieven J on 3 February 2020, on which occasion MM was represented by counsel, Mr Weale.  PA represented himself, as he had done at a number of previous hearings.  The evidence before the judge consisted of two affidavits from MM and an unsigned 12-page document from PA entitled “Notes”, which contained a statement of truth at the end.  This was a quite sophisticated document, dealing in some detail with the allegations and raising procedural objections by reference to the relevant rules of court.  MM’s case was that she was seeking findings in respect of breach of the order but not seeking an order for committal at that hearing; rather she asked for the matter to be adjourned to a further hearing once findings had been made.   </p>

She carefully satisfied herself that the proceedings had been brought in a regular manner and directed herself in relation to the mental element in contempt.  She then recorded the parties submissions before stating her detailed conclusions.  In summary, she rejected PA’s explanation that each of the categories of payment were ones to which he was entitled as being proper liabilities of the company.  She noted the absence of any corroborative documentation.  She concluded that his arguments were not credible and found that he was in knowing breach of the order to the criminal standard of proof.  He was in her view “making matters up as he went along as excuses for using the money in the account as he wished and then hoping to persuade a court there was no breach of the order.”  She observed that he is an intelligent man who has considerable familiarity with the law and with business affairs.  He was an unreliable witness who had breached the order in deliberate and full knowledge that he was in breach of it.  A draft order provided for the question of sanction to be decided at another imminent hearing and for PA to pay costs of some £8000 on an indemnity basis.  </p>

He makes the simple case that a defendant in criminal proceedings and a respondent in contempt proceedings has a right to remain silent and that this right lies at the heart of the notion of fair procedure.  It is an important right and a failure to protect it is not a merely technical default.  It is of particular importance where a litigant is unrepresented and it does not matter that the litigant may be relatively able: the safeguard is available to all, as it is in criminal proceedings.  In this case, the judge, though evidently concerned to ensure a fair hearing, erred by suggesting to PA that he should give evidence despite there being no obligation upon him to do so.  PA then gave evidence that was used to his detriment.  </p>

However, the right is implicit in Rule 37.27(2) of the Family Procedure Rules 2010, and CPR 81.28, which provides that at a committal hearing the respondent is entitled to give oral evidence, whether or not s/he has filed or served written evidence and, if doing so, may be cross-examined.  He points out that this rule was mentioned in his skeleton argument for the committal hearing.  Accordingly, his first submission is that PA was informed of his rights and that there has been no procedural breach in this case.  He argues that there is a tension between informing the respondent of the right to be silent and warning him or her of the potential consequences </p>

Where an application is made to commit a defendant for contempt of court, it is obviously important that great care is taken by the applicant to ensure that all the procedural requirements in this Section of Pt 81 are met. However, committal orders ought not to be set aside on purely technical grounds which have nothing to do with the justice of the case, because that would have the effect of undermining the system of justice and the credibility of court orders.

That approach, which is common across all subject jurisdictions, is reflected in FPR PD37 13.2 and CPR PD81 16.2 which permit, but do not require, the court to waive any procedural defect in the commencement or conduct of a committal application if satisfied that no injustice has been caused.  Accordingly, while it is of great importance that the procedural rules are complied with, the process will not be invalidated on (to borrow from the White Book) purely technical grounds that have nothing to do with the justice of the case.  As was said in <span style="font-style:italic">Yaxley-Lennon</span>, a balance must be struck where the relevant rules have not been followed to the letter.    </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The starting point when striking the balance in this case is the duty upon a court hearing committal proceedings to ensure that the accused person is made aware that they are not obliged to give evidence and also warned that adverse consequences or inferences may arise from exercising the right to silence.  Those messages may indeed contain a tension, but what matters is that the choice of how to proceed belongs to the litigant and not to the other party or to the court.  This is of particular importance when the litigant is unrepresented, and it does not apply any the less to the seasoned litigant in person, or to the litigant who appears eager to enter the witness box.  The last mentioned individual may be the one who most needs to be reminded of his or her rights.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I therefore do not accept the argument that there was no procedural defect in what occurred in this case.  I reject the submission that PA can be taken to have been informed of his rights by the reference to the rules in the skeleton argument.  Even if that went some small way to informing him of where he stood, it was undone by the events at the hearing, as described at paragraph 5 above.  Likewise, I cannot accept the description of this breach as being a purely technical one.  The right to silence is a core element in criminal proceedings and proceedings of a criminal character.          </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">That being the case, the decision can only stand if we are satisfied that no injustice has been caused.  There is a temptation to reason that the case brought by MM was on the face of it a strong one, that in the absence of a good explanation from PA it was likely to be proved, that PA is an able litigant in person who accepted the suggestion that he give evidence with alacrity, and that the outcome may well have been the same whether or not he gave oral evidence.  I am not persuaded by these arguments.  The injunction allowed for proper payments to be made from the company account, so the mere making of payments did not establish the alleged breaches.  MM had to prove that PA made the payments knowing that they were not proper liabilities of the company.  There can be no doubt that the judge’s conclusions on that matter owed much to her assessment of PA’s oral evidence.         </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">As it was, PA had provided a document setting out his case which, but for a signature, could be received as a witness statement.  He did not need to give oral evidence for it to have been treated as evidence: he could simply have been asked whether he wished to sign it.  The court would then have had written evidence from both parties.  At that point, PA would have had the choice of giving evidence or not.  Had he chosen to give evidence, he could have had no complaint about the consequences.  Had he chosen not to give evidence, the court would have dealt with the matter on the evidence before it.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">As appears above, we have considered a range of reported decisions.  They establish the general principles that I have outlined and they show how the balance was struck in the circumstances of each case.  In some instances the procedural defects were more numerous and florid than they are here.  Others concerned more technical matters concerning paperwork and service.  In the end, each case has to be decided on its own facts and in the present case I am driven to conclude that this court cannot be satisfied that no injustice has occurred.  Had PA been informed that he was not obliged to give evidence, it is not possible to be sure that he would have done so, and had he not done so the judge’s findings might not have been the same.  Put another way, there has been a serious procedural irregularity that justifies the grant of permission to appeal and the allowing of the appeal on this ground.  In the circumstances the other grounds of appeal fall away and I say nothing about them.   </p>
