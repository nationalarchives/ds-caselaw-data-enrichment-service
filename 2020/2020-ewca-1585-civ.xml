That order was not in substance opposed. However, a week later, on 13 December 2019, the judge allowed an application by the respondent (“FAAN”) to reconsider her order of 6 December, and she rescinded AIC’s right to enforce the Award. She also granted FAAN relief from sanctions. AIC now seek to appeal the reconsidered order of 13 December.</p>

There was also a secondary issue, raised by FAAN for the first time on this appeal, to the effect that the judge’s earlier order did not contain any sanction, so that (despite the fact that FAAN originally made the application for relief from sanctions in accordance with the test set out in <span style="font-style:italic">Denton v TH White</span> [2014] EWCA Civ 906, [2014] 1 WLR 3926) this was not a case of relief from sanctions in any event.  </p>

Little else in this unedifying story is deserving of the same approbation.</p>

Although that challenge was upheld at first instance by Buba J, it was overturned on appeal (albeit on a jurisdictional issue). FAAN sought to appeal again, this time to the Supreme Court of Nigeria. Unhappily, ten years after the promulgation of the Award, the appeal in respect of the application to set aside has still not been resolved, and no-one can say when it might even be considered. Indeed, the gloomy view was expressed that resolution of the matter in Nigeria could still be many years away.  </p>

On 28 February 2019, an order giving such permission was made by Mrs Justice O’Farrell (“the O’Farrell Order”). This provided that, pursuant to sections 101(2) and 66(1) of the Arbitration Act 1996, AIC had permission to enforce the operative part of the Award and to enter judgment against FAAN. The O’Farrell Order also stated that FAAN was entitled to apply to the Technology and Construction Court to set aside the Order within 22 days of service of the order on FAAN and that, in accordance with CPR r.62.18(9)(b), the Award must not be enforced by AIC until after the expiry of that period.  </p>

This is because it is perfectly clear when one reads the Award that the Arbitrator made a finding of fact on the issue of mitigation and that it was only because he found that it was not reasonable to expect AIC to develop a different site some 1.5 miles from the airport terminal, and in that context, that he went on to state that AIC was entitled to "<span style="font-style:italic">unmitigated damages</span>". He was not suggesting that there was no duty on the part of AIC to mitigate its loss. </p>

Based on my review of the Award and the reasons set out in the judgment of Justice Buba to justify the setting aside of the Award, I would not consider the Set Aside Application to have a real prospect of success on appeal. However, the fact remains that on the one occasion on which the Set Aside Application has come before the Nigerian Courts (that is before a Nigerian Federal High Court Judge applying Nigerian law) for consideration on the merits, the application was allowed and the Award was set aside. Similarly, the fact also remains that if FAAN's appeal on the Preliminary Objection succeeds the immediate consequence will be to reinstate the decision of Justice Buba setting aside the Award. I am also mindful of the fact that it is not only FAAN that has challenged the validity of the Award. AIC has also taken issue with the Award since it has sought to challenge the Arbitrator's refusal to order specific performance of the Deed of Lease.”  </p>

However, those factors must be balanced against the matters set out in paragraph 44 of my judgment and in particular the fact that on the only occasion on which the Set Aside Application did come before the Nigerian Courts on its merits the Award was set aside.

Although Mr Hussain QC, on behalf of FAAN, argued that, because the form of the security had not yet been fixed, there was nothing that FAAN needed to do until that had happened, I do not agree. Security is traditionally provided either by the payment of money into court, or the provision of a guarantee or bond. Either way, FAAN had to start making the arrangements to provide that security from 13 August 2019. If (which I do not accept has been demonstrated by the evidence) these arrangements somehow necessitated FAAN’s interaction with the respective Ministers of Finance, Justice and Aviation, then there was all the more reason for FAAN not to delay until the precise form of security had been fixed. </p>

One was that the Guarantee should be provided by a first-class Nigerian bank, not a European bank.

She gave them six weeks (or ten weeks from when she handed down her judgment) which expired on 29 October. It appears to have been her view, knowing as she did the details of FAAN’s funding arrangements, that that was quite long enough for a State Agency to provide the Guarantee. Yet, as we shall see, FAAN did indeed take three months from mid-September to provide the Guarantee. As I put to Mr Hussain during argument, it might fairly be said that FAAN took as long as it had always intended to take to provide the Guarantee, irrespective of the orders of the court. </p>

This was despite the fact that the substantive judgment was already seven weeks old. Moreover, that letter made no attempt to obtain assistance with the provision of the Guarantee. Indeed, as was correctly pointed out at paragraph 35 of AIC’s skeleton argument for the hearing on 6 December, there was no evidence that FAAN’s Governing Board had then (or later) decided to provide the Guarantee. Its focus seems instead to have been on the application for permission to appeal, which, if successful, would have avoided the need to provide the Guarantee at all. </p>

The change was eventually made because FAAN said that the existing lawyers “had no immediate/proactive solution to the present and urgent problem at hand”. Since that present and urgent problem could only have been the order to provide the Guarantee, the logical inference is that, in some way, there was a belief at FAAN that Curtis may be able to help them avoid complying with that obligation altogether.

No details of these difficulties were (or have ever been) given. A three-week extension was requested to enable FAAN to secure a guarantee, alternatively an extension to 5 December 2019. Mr Balogun further stated that, “should the Applicant be unable to finalise the Bank Guarantee within the short period of time requested, then the Respondent would be at liberty to enforce the Award”.

In similar vein, a skeleton argument prepared by FAAN’s leading counsel, Mr Alun Jones QC, also dated 5 December 2019, referred to the ongoing arrangements with the CBN and JP Morgan Chase and said at paragraph 3: “The parties are now in a position where the claimant will have some form of security and the defendant is not prejudiced.” </p>

It made many of the same points noted above concerning FAAN’s dilatory (and in some instances, non-existent) attempts to comply with the First Buehrlen Order. It set out how and why FAAN should never have had any difficulty in providing the Guarantee; that there was no evidence that the Governing Board of FAAN had ever decided to provide the Guarantee; how the costs payable by 15 October had still not been paid; and, importantly, it set out how and why FAAN’s application for an extension of time should be refused. </p>

	      <span style="color:#3D3D3D">There are then further relevant factors which favour a reconsideration of the order. Firstly, there was no substantive consideration of the Parties' respective applications at the hearing on 6 December 2019. Rather, not having had the confirmation he expected of the guarantee having been issued, leading counsel for FAAN took the view that he could not properly in that moment maintain or renew FAAN's application for an extension of time. Second, there has been no detrimental reliance on the part of AIC on the order. Third, obtaining the guarantee clearly did involve FAAN, because of its parastatal status, in having to take a number of steps to obtain all the requisite authorisations from the various Nigerian ministries, as well as the cooperation of the Nigerian Central Bank. Although there clearly were delays, the fact that FAAN has obtained a valid and enforceable guarantee evidences the fact that it has </span>

	      <span style="color:#3D3D3D"> sought to comply with paragraphs 2 and 3 of the order of 17 September 2019. I have also taken into account the difficulties that Mr Balogun (the solicitor instructed by FAAN) explains he had, having travelled to Nigeria to assist FAAN in obtaining the guarantee, and then communicating with FAAN, the bank, and leading counsel on 5 and 6 December 2019, as explained in his witness statement.  </span>

	      <span style="color:#3D3D3D">Further, I am particularly mindful of the consequences of not revisiting the Order for the purposes of the Overriding Objective and dealing with cases justly. The purpose of the guarantee was to provide AIC with security whilst its application for enforcement of the Award was adjourned pending a final and unappealable decision of the Nigerian courts as to the setting aside of the Award. In effect, it was the price FAAN had to pay for the adjournment. It was not intended for immediate enforcement. However, having been provided with a copy of the guarantee through Mr Jones's email sent at 5.17 pm on 6 December 2019, by letter dated the very same day AIC made demand on Standard Chartered for payment of the sum of some US$24 million. I regard that demand as inappropriate, both because it was never intended that the guarantee should be called upon in these circumstances, and because, as Mr Jones's email made plain and AIC were therefore well aware, FAAN were in the process of preparing the requisite applications and supporting material to come back before the Court.”</span>

Firstly, he [Mr Collett QC, on behalf of AIC] submits that FAAN's application is not really concerned with a reconsideration of the order dismissing FAAN's 14 November 2019 application but rather a fresh application for relief because, as at 6 December, FAAN had failed to provide a guarantee within the extension time sought by its 14 November 2019 application. It is correct that FAAN's 14 November application sought an extension of time until 5 December 2019. However I have no doubt that had the guarantee been available at 2.00 pm on 6 December, I would have exercised my discretion to allow FAAN the requisite extension of time pursuant to its 14 November application, and I would have dismissed AIC's enforcement application. </span></p>

	      <span style="color:#3D3D3D">23.  Secondly, Mr Collett submits that the power to reconsider an unsealed order has not previously been exercised to give effect to something done by the applicant after the decision in question has been made. As to this submission, firstly the categories of case in which a judge may revisit his or her order are not closed. Secondly, I do not regard this case as an instance of a party having done something after the decision was made. In my judgment this is a case in which the fruits of FAAN's efforts to obtain the guarantee, and to comply with the Order, finally culminated in the issue of the guarantee by the bank shortly after the decision had been made. It was not a question of FAAN taking some new step following the making of the Order. To the extent that it is a case in which new evidence became available shortly after the hearing, the fact that the guarantee had been issued was not evidence FAAN could have adduced at the hearing. I do not doubt that if it could have done, it would have done so. The evidence of Mr Balogun is clear in this regard. He had even made arrangements with leading counsel for FAAN on a way to communicate the availability of the guarantee during the 6 December 2019 hearing itself. Although there is no evidence as to precisely when Standard Chartered issued the guarantee, all the indications are that it was not until shortly after the hearing that the guarantee became available. Accordingly, evidence of compliance with the Order of the 17 September 2019, albeit late, could not be put before the </span>

Fourthly, Mr Collett submits that to allow reconsideration of the Order on the grounds that the guarantee was provided within some two hours of the hearing would be contrary to the principle of finality of orders, and encourage litigants to delay the sealing of orders in the hope that " </span>
	      <span style="font-style:italic;color:#3D3D3D">something will turn up</span>
	      <span style="color:#3D3D3D"> ". I do not accept that submission. Finality (subject of course to appeal) is obtained upon the order being sealed. Further, it is inherent that where there is a power for a judge to reconsider an order, that power will inevitably erode, albeit only to a very limited extent, the principle of finality. It is to my mind a question of balance. The circumstances of this case are highly unusual, and I would not expect them to encourage litigants to think that they can delay the sealing of orders in the hope that " </span>

It seems to me that whilst FAAN's evidence has not been as comprehensive as the Court would wish to see, and there are matters that certainly ought to have been better explained, for instance why CBN does not appear to have been approached until as late as 2 December, as well as the involvement of different third party banks, it does seem to me that on balance, and looking at the evidence as a whole, FAAN has provided sufficient, as well as good, reason for the delays:”</span></p>

Lastly, I must evaluate all the circumstances of the case, to enable me to deal justly with the application. Militating against my exercising my discretion in favour of FAAN is the fact that litigation should be conducted efficiently, and at proportionate cost, and the Court's orders are made to be obeyed. FAAN's delays have certainly impacted the amount of Court time that has had to be devoted to this matter. I am also mindful of the fact that FAAN did not comply with the order for costs that I made on 17 September 2019. However, whilst I have taken that factor into account, I have balanced it against the fact that the costs have now been paid, and the fact that it would in my view be disproportionate to refuse FAAN relief from sanctions on this ground.”</span></p>

Parties who receive a judgment in open court are entitled to act on that judgment, because an order takes effect from the moment it is made by the court, not when it is sealed: <span style="font-style:italic">Holtby v Hodgson</span> (1890) 24 QBD 103; <span style="font-style:italic">Ashman v Thomas</span> [2016] EWHC 1810 (Ch). The successful party should not have to worry that something will subsequently come along to deprive him or her of the fruits of victory. The unsuccessful party cannot treat the judgment that has been handed down as some kind of rehearsal, and hurry away to come up with some new evidence or a better legal argument. As identified below, there is a particular jurisdiction which permits a judge to change his or her order between the handing down of the judgment and the subsequent sealing of the order. But in most civil cases, the latter is an administrative function, and it would be wrong in principle to allow parties <span style="font-style:italic">carte blanche </span>to take advantage of an administrative delay to go back over the judgment or order and reargue the case before it is sealed.

The court has a jurisdiction, at least before the order is drawn up, to entertain an application of this kind as in here. The principle to be applied generally is the overriding objective to deal with cases justly and at proportionate cost. This involves dealing with cases expeditiously and fairly and allocating an appropriate share of the court's resources to a dispute. In a case like this one, in which the application is to amend the statement of case, call fresh evidence and then have a further trial, the principles relevant to amending pleadings have a role to play but the <span style="font-style:italic">Ladd v.

As Neuberger J noted in <span style="font-style:italic">Charlesworth v Relay Roads </span>[2000] RPC 9, [2000] 1 WLR 230, those factors were likely to be in the forefront of the mind of the court when considering an application to admit new evidence after judgment has been handed down but before the order has been drawn up, although he stressed that “the court must be somewhat more flexible” to reflect the fact that the order had not yet been sealed.</p>

	      </authorialNote>. The first is whether the application to reconsider should be entertained <span style="font-style:italic">in principle</span>: is there a reasonably arguable basis for the application? If the court answers that question in the negative, that is the end of the matter. If on the other hand the court concludes that reconsideration is appropriate in principle, then it becomes an open-ended matter of discretion, to be exercised in accordance with the overriding objective, as to whether the order should be changed, or not. </p>

In my view, the court should be looking for a sufficiently compelling reason that may justify reconsideration; something which might outweigh the importance of finality and justify the opening up of a question or questions which, following the pronouncement of the order in open court, appeared to have been finally answered. Of course, it is quite right to say, as the authorities stress, that those categories of case are not closed. But, assuming that the request to reconsider comes from the parties and not the court, the court should instinctively be looking for something which has been missed or otherwise gone awry: a mistake or a fundamental misapprehension; a fundamental piece of evidence or a point of law that was overlooked. The Court’s undoubted jurisdiction to reconsider its earlier order cannot be permitted to become a gateway for a second round of wide-ranging debate.</p>

To put it more starkly: the defaulting party would be relying on its own breach to seek reconsideration. In my view, such a practice would generally be contrary to the overriding objective and the principle of finality.

The purpose of the hearing on 6 December was to deal with the two outstanding applications, with any consideration of FAAN’s extension application inevitably coming before AIC’s application to enforce the Award. But FAAN chose not to make its own application for an extension of time or to seek its adjournment. In consequence, FAAN was not in a position to resist enforcement of the Award. The judge erred in somehow using that as a point in FAAN’s favour: it instead demonstrated the major difficulties that FAAN had created for itself in failing to grapple with the clear terms of the First Buehrlen Order. </p>

In this way, the judge looked at the question of delay through the wrong end of the telescope, focussing just on the last few days before the provision of the Guarantee. I identify below eight factors relating to delay and FAAN’s application for an extension of time which the judge should have considered, but wholly failed to address, in her judgment on 13 December.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">First, there was the delay between the handing down of the judgment on 13 August, which made plain that security for US$24 million was required, and the consequential hearing on 17 September, which identified the form of the order. For the reasons set out at paragraphs 13 - 14 above, although FAAN knew that it would either have to find the money or a guarantee/bond, there was no evidence that any steps were taken to set this in train. That was a delay of 1 month for which FAAN was responsible.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly, at the hearing on 17 September, FAAN argued that it needed three months to provide the security. The judge rejected that submission, and gave it until 29 October (which was six weeks from the hearing, or 10 weeks from the judgment). In my view, that was generous. By the time of the hearing on 13 December, the judge should have considered whether, on all the evidence, FAAN had always acted on the basis of its own 3 month period, and paid no regard to the orders of the court (paragraph 17 above).</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Thirdly, the judge should have noted that there was no evidence that any steps were taken by FAAN to do anything about the guarantee between 17 September and early October 2019. That delay was and is unexplained: see paragraph 18 above. Although the date for compliance expired on 29 October, FAAN took no steps to ensure even potential compliance before that date. The correspondence with the Ministers was desultory and did not make plain the urgency of the judge’s order (paragraphs 18-22 above).</p>

The court dealt with that the following day. Plainly, it had no real option but to make the order it did. But the order meant that, if permission to appeal was refused, FAAN would only have a very short period in which to obtain the Guarantee. Yet no steps were taken in consequence of that order either (paragraphs 23-26 above).</p>

This one was due to expire on 5 December. The judge should have noted that nothing had been done between 29 October and 14 November to comply with the order, save for the desultory correspondence referred to at paragraphs 27 - 29 above. It is not the sort of correspondence one would expect from a State Agency like FAAN, facing a clear and unequivocal order of the court.</p>

It was not advanced on 6 December, and neither was any application made for an adjournment. Accordingly, the due date for compliance with the order was 14 November 2019, and even that was based on a mechanical rather than meritorious extension from 29 October. The judge should have noted that 14 November was 3 months after judgment requiring the provision of security had been handed down.</p>

Any sense of urgency was still hard to find, and the increase was doubtless the result of the fact that 6 December had been fixed for the hearing of AIC’s application to enforce. The judge should have noted that there has never been any explanation as to why the CBN was not involved prior to 2 December 2019, since it now seems that the necessary guarantee could not be provided without their involvement (paragraphs 2831 above).</p>

She did not note the fact that, by the time of the reconsideration hearing, it was four months after FAAN had first become aware of the need to provide security, more than 5 weeks after her date of 29 October had expired and more than 3 weeks after the extended date of 14 November had also expired. As I have said, she wrongly assumed (without any explanation whatsoever) that FAAN had an entitlement to an extension to 5 December. On my analysis, set out above, they had no such thing.</p>

They plainly should have been. Had they been, they would have provided a clear basis for exercising the court’s discretion against FAAN’s application for reconsideration.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Further and in any event, it is now clear that AIC have potentially suffered detriment. Once it knew that the Guarantee was in existence, and being the beneficiary of the Second Buehrlen Order of 6 December, AIC made a demand on the Guarantee. At the time of the reconsideration hearing, the relevant bank, SCB, had said that the demand was compliant with the Guarantee and seemed to be on the point of paying out (see paragraph 38 above) Accordingly, as at 13 December, it may be that AIC would not have suffered any detriment as a result of reconsideration because it appeared that they were going to be paid the security that they had long sought. </p>

AIC is now concerned that, because the Guarantee limited their rights to make “one valid demand” only, and if the Third Buehrlen Order is allowed to stand, it would be said that they had made their one demand and could have no further recourse under the Guarantee. Although SCB have indicated that they would not take that point, the relevant letter is hedged with qualifications. On that basis, AIC maintain that they have suffered a real and potentially fatal detriment as a result of the reconsideration. </p>

Moreover, as I have said, at the hearing on 13 December, the demand was deemed by SCB to be compliant and so it may have been thought that there had not been any detriment.

The application had already been decided in their favour, subject to one condition which FAAN had then failed to fulfil. Moreover, AIC had applied to enforce the Award on 21 November 2019, and it was that application on which the judge ruled on 6 December.

It would also mean that FAAN’s wholesale failures to comply with the orders of the court would be accepted, at least to the extent that no effective sanction would have resulted from their repeated breaches. That would not be a result that accorded with the overriding objective, and in particular r.1.1(2)(f): the court must deal with a case justly and at proportionate cost, including “enforcing compliance with rules and orders”.</p>
