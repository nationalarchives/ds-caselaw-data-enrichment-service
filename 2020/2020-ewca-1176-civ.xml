	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in">These two appeals have been listed together because they raise similar issues.  The Appellants are non-British nationals – both, though this is coincidental, from Iraq – who came to this country many years ago and have lived here ever since.  Both are in settled relationships with women of British nationality and have young children who are likewise British citizens.  Both committed criminal offences for which they were sentenced to terms of imprisonment of sixteen and twelve months respectively.  Those sentences attracted the automatic deportation provisions of section 32 of the UK Borders Act 2007.  In both cases the Secretary of State made a deportation order but the Appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal (“the FTT”).  The appeals are subject to the terms of Part 5A of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (in particular section 117C), and Part 13 of the Immigration Rules, of which I give more details below.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in">In both cases the appeals were successful, but the Secretary of State in her turn appealed to the Upper Tribunal (“the UT”).  Both appeals were allowed and the decisions directed to be re-made by the UT at a further hearing.  That hearing took place in RA’s case on 13 February 2019 before Lane J (the President of the Immigration and Asylum Chamber), UTJ Gill and UTJ Coker.  The hearing in HA’s case was two days later, before Lane J and UTJ Gill.  The decisions in both cases were likewise promulgated only a few days apart – <span style="font-style:italic">RA</span> on 4 March and <span style="font-style:italic">HA</span> on 8 March.  The two appeals, together with two others (one of which was <span style="font-style:italic">MS (Philippines) </span>[2019] UKUT 122 (IAC)), were listed on successive days in order for the UT, in constitutions chaired by the President, to give authoritative guidance on various issues about section 117C arising out of the then recent decision of the Supreme Court in <span style="font-style:italic">KO </span>(<span style="font-style:italic">Nigeria</span>)<span style="font-style:italic"> v Secretary of State for the Home Department</span> [2018] UKSC 53, [2018] 1 WLR 5273.  The decision in <span style="font-style:italic">RA</span> was the principal vehicle for that guidance, though some points of general application are dealt with in the other decisions. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in">In both cases the UT allowed the Secretary of State’s appeal.  In September last year I gave permission to appeal to this Court.  I considered that there were arguable grounds of appeal in both cases, but the main reason why I thought that the second appeals test was satisfied was that I believed that this Court should have the opportunity to consider the guidance given by the UT on the issues of general application.   </p>

I confess to some concern about the over-use of anonymisation in this field, and I am not entirely persuaded that the mere fact that a foreign criminal has minor children is sufficient to justify not using his or her full name.  However, it seems that most of the appeals concerning deportation of foreign criminals have been anonymised, not only in the UT but in this Court and the Supreme Court; and in all the circumstances I am content not to seek to go behind the order of the UT.   </p>

That obligation is subject to various exceptions set out in section 33.

Paragraph 2 provides that there shall be no interference with that right “except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others” – for short, save where it is justified by the public interest. </p>

It held that it was necessary to read sub-section (6) as applying equally in the case of medium offenders governed by sub-section (3): see paras. 25-27 of its judgment given by Jackson LJ.

It will be seen that, whereas section 117C (5) refers simply to “the effect of C’s deportation on the partner or child [being] unduly harsh”, the equivalent provisions of paragraph 399 (that is, points (a) and (b) under the parent case and points (ii) and (iii) under the partner case) identify two distinct scenarios – the scenario where the child/partner would go with the deportee (“the go scenario”) and the scenario where they would stay behind without him (“the stay scenario”).   It will be seen (as italicised by me) that the two scenarios in both the parent and the partner case are linked by an “and”.  There is an issue before us about the effect of this wording which I consider at paras. 70-76 below: in short, my conclusion is that “and” means “and”. </p>

Anyone applying these tests (as required by our own rules and legislation) should heed the guidance contained in the Strasbourg authorities. As we have stated above, the scheme of Part 5A of the 2002 Act and paras. 398-399A of the 2014 rules is to ensure compliance with the requirements of Article 8 through a structured approach, which is intended to ensure that proper weight is given to the public interest in deportation whilst also having regard to other relevant factors as identified in the Strasbourg and domestic caselaw.

Further the word ‘unduly’ implies an element of comparison. It assumes that there is a ‘due’ level of ‘harshness’, that is a level which may be acceptable or justifiable in the relevant context. ‘Unduly’ implies something going beyond that level. The relevant context is that set by section 117C (1), that is the public interest in the deportation of foreign criminals. One is looking for a degree of harshness going beyond what would necessarily be involved for any child faced with the deportation of a parent.  What it does not require in my view (and subject to the discussion of the cases in the next section) is a balancing of relative levels of severity of the parent’s offence, other than is inherent in the distinction drawn by the section itself by reference to length of sentence.  Nor (contrary to the view of the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">IT (Jamaica) v Secretary of State for the Home Department </span>[2016] EWCA Civ 932, [2017] 1 WLR 240, paras 55, 64) can it be equated with a requirement to show ‘very compelling reasons’. That would be in effect to replicate the additional test applied by section 117C (6) with respect to sentences of four years or more.”  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in">The starting point is that the question to which the reasoning is directed is whether the word “unduly” imports a requirement to consider “the severity of the parent’s offence”: that, as I have said, was the actual issue in the appeal.  Lord Carnwath’s conclusion is that it does not: see the sentence beginning “What it does not require …”.  The reason why there is no such requirement is that the exercise required by Exception 2 is “self-contained”.  I should note at this point that it follows that it is irrelevant whether the sentence was at the top or the bottom of the range between one year and four: as Lord Carnwath says, the only relevance of the length of the sentence is to establish whether the foreign criminal is a medium offender or not.  </p>

That is what he does in the first part of the paragraph.  The effect of what he says is that “unduly” is directed to the <span style="font-style:italic">degree</span> of harshness required: some level of harshness is to be regarded as “acceptable or justifiable” in the context of the public interest in the deportation of foreign criminals, and what “unduly” does is to provide that Exception 2 will only apply where the harshness goes beyond that level.  Lord Carnwath’s focus is not primarily on how to define the “acceptable” level of harshness.  It is true that he refers to a degree of harshness “going beyond what would necessarily be involved for any child faced with the deportation of a parent”, but that cannot be read entirely literally: it is hard to see how one would define the level of harshness that would “necessarily” be suffered by “any” child (indeed one can imagine unusual cases where the deportation of a parent would not be “harsh” for the child at all, even where there was a genuine and subsisting relationship).  The underlying concept is clearly of an enhanced degree of harshness sufficient to outweigh the public interest in the deportation of foreign criminals in the medium offender category.   </p>

The preserved finding of fact is that, although it would not be unduly harsh for the four younger children to move to Nigeria, the reality of the situation is that they will remain here and, as the family relationships cannot be maintained by modern means of communication, there will be a complete fracture of these family relationships. The claimant is not authorised to work and so has been unable to provide financial support for his family but his role within the household has meant that his wife has been able to work, which she would find hard or impossible if she had to care on a daily basis for the children without her husband's assistance. Thus it is said that if the claimant is removed, the main household income will be lost and the children would be subject to economic disadvantage. But, again, that is not an experience that can, in my judgment, be categorised as severe or bleak or excessively harsh as, like any other person lawfully settled in the United Kingdom, the claimant's wife and family will have access to welfare benefits should they be needed. </p>

It does so by providing that those interests should, in the case of a medium offender, prevail over the public interest in deportation where the effect on the child would be unduly harsh.  In other words, consideration of the best interests of the child is built into the statutory test.  It was not necessary for Lord Carnwath to spell out that in the application of Exception 2 in any particular case there will need to be “a careful analysis of all relevant factors specific to the child”; but I am happy to confirm that that is so, as Lord Hodge makes clear in his sixth proposition in <span style="font-style:italic">Zoumbas</span>.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in">The second point focuses on what are said to be the risks of treating <span style="font-style:italic">KO</span> as establishing a touchstone of whether the degree of harshness goes beyond “that which is ordinarily expected by the deportation of a parent”.  Lord Carnwath does not in fact use that phrase, but a reference to “nothing out of the ordinary” appears in UTJ Southern’s decision.  I see rather more force in this submission.  As explained above, the test under section 117C (5) does indeed require an appellant to establish a degree of harshness going beyond a threshold “acceptable” level.  It is not necessarily wrong to describe that as an “ordinary” level of harshness, and I note that Lord Carnwath did not jib at UTJ Southern’s use of that term.  However, I think the Appellants are right to point out that it may be misleading if used incautiously.  There seem to me to be two (related) risks.  First, “ordinary” is capable of being understood as meaning anything which is not exceptional, or in any event rare.  That is not the correct approach: see para. 52 above.  There is no reason in principle why cases of “undue” harshness may not occur quite commonly.  Secondly, if tribunals treat the essential question as being “is this level of harshness out of the ordinary?” they may be tempted to find that Exception 2 does not apply simply on the basis that the situation fits into some commonly-encountered pattern.  That would be dangerous.  How a child will be affected by a parent’s deportation will depend on an almost infinitely variable range of circumstances and it is not possible to identify a baseline of “ordinariness”.  Simply by way of example, the degree of harshness of the impact may be affected by the child’s age; by whether the parent lives with them (NB that a divorced or separated father may still have a genuine and subsisting relationship with a child who lives with the mother); by the degree of the child’s emotional dependence on the parent; by the financial consequences of his deportation; by the availability of emotional and financial support from a remaining parent and other family members; by the practicability of maintaining a relationship with the deported parent; and of course by all the individual characteristics of the child. </p>

As regards the meaning of “unduly harsh”, that exercise is carried out at Section B of the judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">RA</span> (paras. 9-17).

I consider the equivalent submissions later in this judgment (see paras. 127-9 below): I need only say at this point that they raise no issue of general significance about the meaning of “unduly harsh”.  Beyond that, the UT says only that Lord Carnwath’s approval at para. 27 of his judgment of the self-direction by the UT in <span style="font-style:italic">MK</span> must be followed.

The appellant relied only on section 117C (5) and did not contend that there were in his case very compelling circumstances over and above Exception 2 which outweighed the public interest in his deportation.  It is unsurprising therefore that there is in Lord Carnwath’s judgment no discussion of section 117C (6) and no reference to <span style="font-style:italic">NA (Pakistan)</span>; but it is also slightly unfortunate.  There is a risk that, in cases involving a medium offender, tribunals who are directed only to <span style="font-style:italic">KO</span> may think that if a potential deportee cannot bring himself within either Exception that is the end of the story.  As will be clear from my discussion of <span style="font-style:italic">NA (Pakistan)</span> – see in particular paras. 29-30 above – that is not the case: it remains necessary in principle to conduct a full article 8 proportionality assessment, albeit one in which the public interest in deportation will only be outweighed in very compelling circumstances.

There may be cases where a tribunal is satisfied that there is a combination of circumstances, including but not limited to the harsh effect of the appellant’s deportation on his family, which together constitute very compelling reasons sufficient to outweigh the strong public interest in deportation, but where it may be debatable whether the effect on the family <span style="font-style:italic">taken on its own</span> (as section 117C (5) requires) is unduly harsh.  (An equivalent situation could arise in relation to Exception 1: there might, say, be significant obstacles to the appellant’s integration in the country to which it is proposed to deport him, but it might be questionable whether they were <span style="font-style:italic">very</span> significant.)  In such a case, although the tribunal will inevitably have considered whether the relevant Exception has been satisfied, it is unnecessary for it to cudgel its brains into making a definitive finding.  The Exceptions are, as I have said, designed to provide a shortcut for appellants in particular cases, and it is not compulsory to take that shortcut if proceeding directly to the proportionality assessment required by article 8 produces a clear answer in the appellant’s favour. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in">That submission, as so formulated, is plainly ill-founded.  In the first place, I can see no inconsistency between paragraph 399 (a) and section 117C (5).  In my view it is clear that the separate identification of the stay and go scenarios in the Rules is an elaboration of Exception 2 and not a departure from it.  The assessment required by section 117C (5) must in principle involve a consideration of any scenario in which the deportation could affect a partner or child; and paragraph 399 simply recognises that fact expressly.  And in any event HA’s suggested construction would make no sense having regard to the statutory purpose.  The purpose of Exception 2 is to preclude deportation where that would have an unduly harsh effect on the foreign criminal’s partner or child.  HA’s reading would mean that it applied in circumstances where such an effect would not be suffered at all.  It would be absurd if the fact that it would be unduly harsh for HA’s children to relocate to Iraq – where in practice noone was suggesting that they would go (no doubt for that very reason) – meant that he could not be deported, leaving them behind, even though (on the UT’s finding) the separation would not involve any unduly harsh effect.  Indeed if HA’s submission were right he could not be deported even if the UT had found that separation from the parent would be positively beneficial for the child, as occasionally (though not here) it might be.  The paragraphs referred to in <span style="font-style:italic">Jeunesse</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">MM (Lebanon) </span>have nothing to do with this issue, and I need not set them out here. </p>

In oral argument we canvassed with Mr Pilgerstorfer (whose submissions I wish to say were throughout conspicuously clear and thoughtful) the possibility of a situation where, although if the partner and child stayed in the UK the effect on them would not be unduly harsh, the established likelihood was that they would in fact not stay but would relocate with him and suffer an unduly harsh effect in consequence<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="7">

	      </authorialNote>: such a situation might occur where the parents failed to appreciate the harshness of the effect on the partner and/or her child, or where one or both did appreciate it but the potential deportee insisted nonetheless and the partner felt obliged to put her loyalty to him first.  If we were only concerned with the partner, that might be unobjectionable, because as an adult she could be treated as free to make her own choices; but the child would have no such choice.  In such a case a rule that Exception 2 was only satisfied if <span style="text-decoration:underline">both</span> scenarios were unduly harsh would produce an outcome that gave no weight to the actual best interests of the child: it would mean that the Exception was unavailable only because of an acceptable alternative which was purely theoretical.

That was not only what the words said, it made sense as a matter of policy and principle.  The public interest in deportation should not be outweighed where there was a realistically available option in which the deportation would not have an unduly harsh effect.  If the parents nevertheless chose an option which did have such an effect that ought not to be treated as resulting from the Secretary of State’s decision.  He added that if the law were otherwise there would be an obvious incentive on foreign criminals, and their partners, to claim, and perhaps even genuinely to intend, that the family would go with them if they were deported, however harsh the effect might be on the children: it would be very unsatisfactory for decision-makers to have to base their decisions on an assessment of whether such threats were genuine or tactical.  He pointed out that the “real world” line of cases was concerned with different provisions of the Rules and directed to a different issue.   </p>

I think it is clear that paragraph 399 (a) means what it says and that it accords with principle and policy for the reasons given by Mr Pilgerstorfer.  The Secretary of State cannot be said to be acting contrary to the best interests of the child in circumstances where an option was available which would not be unduly harsh for him or her, even if the parents decline to avail themselves of it.  In fact parents can generally be expected to avail themselves of the option which is best for their child.  I dare say there may be rare cases where it does seem likely – though of course at the point of decision it will never be knowable – that the deportee and his partner will try to take their child with them to a country where life for it will be unduly harsh.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="8">

In theory a less absolute approach might be appropriate in the context of the overall article 8 proportionality assessment; but there too I think it very unlikely that a tribunal would allow the strong public interest in deportation to be outweighed by the deportee’s threat to take a course that was seriously harmful to his family.<span style="font-size:10pt"> </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in">My starting-point is that this is a case in which a finding of undue harshness, as regards HA’s children at least, might quite readily have been made.  We were not shown all the materials that were before the UT, but it seems from the Tribunal’s own findings that his relationship with his children was particularly close.  This was a household in which the mother worked full-time and the father (perforce) did not.  It may go rather beyond the Tribunal’s findings to describe him, as Mr de Mello did, as the “primary and constant carer of the children” (a phrase taken from para. 119 of the judgment of the ECtHR in <span style="font-style:italic">Jeunesse</span>); but the Tribunal itself described him as “very much a hands-on father”, who undertook all the responsibilities described in para. 68 of its decision.  He had been at home throughout the lives of all three children: because of the delay between his conviction and the decision under challenge, there had been no period (such as there often is in deportation cases) when he was separated from them by imprisonment.  That being so, it would not be surprising if the emotional and psychological impact of his deportation on some or all of his children would go significantly beyond that which (using Lord Carnwath’s phrase, in the sense discussed above) any child would necessarily suffer from the deportation of a parent – in other words, for it to be not only harsh but unduly harsh.  The impact would of course be all the greater given the finding that his children would not be able to visit him in Iraq.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in">What, therefore, was the reason why the UT reached the contrary conclusion?  The answer appears from para. 71 of its decision, where it says that there was no evidence that the effect of HA’s deportation on NT and his children “would be anything other than that which is ordinarily to be expected by the deportation of a partner/parent”.  I note also the UT’s statement at para. 75 that the difficulties that NT would face if HA were deported were “no more than the difficulties faced by many single parents working part-time or full-time”.  That language is in the danger area which I have described at para. 56 above.  Against the background of different facts, it might well be appropriate to read it as representing a considered judgement that the degree of harshness that HA’s family would suffer from his deportation was insufficient to outweigh the public interest in the deportation of medium offenders.  But in the context of the primary facts which I have summarised I think that on balance it is more likely that the Tribunal has proceeded on the basis that it is sufficient to say that the situation in HA’s case is of a kind which is quite commonly encountered in deportation cases.  For the reasons I have given, that is not the correct approach.   </p>

I hope that HA and his advisers will ensure that the tribunal has the fullest possible information for the purpose of that exercise.  As I have said, we were not shown all the material that was before it on the last occasion; but I have the impression that it was not as full as it might have been. </p>

I have already rejected the submission that Lord Carnwath’s formulation of the test ignores section 55 of the 2009 Act; and the submission about the approach of the Tribunal would in any event be hard to reconcile with its express reference to the best interests of the children at para. 78.   </p>

The fact that it reached a different conclusion from the FTT on essentially the same facts and evidence goes nowhere, save perhaps to reinforce the conclusion that this is a case where a finding of undue harshness could well have been made.  </p>

At para. 108 of its decision the UT refers to <span style="font-style:italic">MS (Philippines)</span>), which was, as noted above, another of this quartet of post-<span style="font-style:italic">KO</span> cases.  The potential deportee in that case had committed particularly serious offences of violence for which he had been sentenced to ten years’ imprisonment: the sentencing judge described him as a highly dangerous man.  It was argued on his behalf that the seriousness of his offending was relevant only to whether he could rely on either of the Exceptions, and that it could not be put into the balance against him in conducting the necessary assessment under section 117C (6).  That might seem a surprising submission, but it was rendered at least superficially plausible by some general observations made by Lord Carnwath at paras. 20-22 of his judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">KO (Nigeria)</span>.  The UT rejected that argument: see paras. 4-20 of its decision.  It held that Lord Carnwath’s observations were directed only to the application of the Exceptions in the case of medium offenders: for the reasons which he gave in <span style="font-style:italic">KO</span> the exercise involved under those Exceptions is wholly self-contained.  It said that it would be extraordinary if, for the purposes of the ultimate proportionality exercise which has to be performed where the Exceptions do not apply, no distinction fell to be made, between, say, an offender who had committed offences attracting a term of four years’ imprisonment and a multiple murderer.  </p>

The question then arises whether it cuts both ways – that is, whether in principle a potential deportee can rely, as part of the overall proportionality assessment, on the fact that his offence was at or near the bottom of the scale of seriousness.  It seems to me that that must indeed be the case.  There can be no principled reason for treating the two arguments differently.  That conclusion is also in accordance with the Strasbourg jurisprudence, to which, as is confirmed both by <span style="font-style:italic">NA (Pakistan)</span> and by <span style="font-style:italic">Hesham Ali</span>, we are obliged to have regard.  In <span style="font-style:italic">Boultif</span> the ECtHR held in terms that it was necessary in the assessment of the proportionality of deportation to take into account “the nature and seriousness of the offence committed by the applicant” (para. 48); and it is clear from para. 51 of its judgment that in coming to the conclusion that the applicant’s deportation was disproportionate it took into account the fact that his sentence was comparatively low.  Since it was established in <span style="font-style:italic">KO</span> that the relative seriousness of the offence cannot be taken into account in considering Exception 2 (see para. 43 above), it must be capable of being deployed by the potential deportee at the second stage.  </p>

Instead, what they do is to explain why offences of the kind which HA committed are serious.  I do not, with respect, think that that was entirely satisfactory.  The Tribunal is of course right that the offences are serious, for the reasons which it gives.  But their seriousness is reflected in the sentence which the Court imposed.  Generally, for the purpose of the proportionality balance that falls to be struck in a deportation case the seriousness of the relevant offending is established by the level of sentence: see <span style="font-style:italic">Secretary of State for the Home Department v Suckoo </span>[2016] EWCA Civ 39, per Simon LJ at para. 43.  It is true that this Court has since made it clear that that is not an absolute rule, to the extent that a tribunal may be entitled to take into account aggravating or mitigating factors: see<span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'"> </span><span style="font-style:italic">Secretary of State for the Home Department v Barry </span>[2018] EWCA Civ 790, per Singh LJ at paras. 56-57); but I do not think that that qualification has any relevance to the present case.

The Supreme Court held that the removal of the mother would constitute a disproportionate breach of the article 8 rights of the children, having regard also to the requirements of article 3.1 of the UNCRC.  An important element in its reasoning was the fact that the children were British citizens.  The importance of that factor is explained at paras. 29-32 of Lady Hale’s judgment.

It carries with it a host of other benefits and advantages, all of which Lady Hale has drawn attention to and carefully analysed. They ought never to be left out of account, but they were nowhere considered in the Court of Appeal's judgment. The fact of British citizenship does not trump everything else. But it will hardly ever be less than a very significant and weighty factor against moving children who have that status to another country with a parent who has no right to remain here, especially if the effect of doing this is that they will inevitably lose those benefits and advantages for the rest of their childhood.” </p>

However, the degree to which a tribunal needs to spell out its thinking must be sensitive to the circumstances of the particular case.

It is clear from the country guidance that conditions in the IKR are safer and more settled than in the rest of Iraq, and although we were shown, in support of element [c], warnings in the FCO guidance about some continuing risk to visitors from remnants of Daesh, I can understand why the Tribunal did not find that residual risk a significant factor in the assessment of whether relocation would be unduly harsh for Y.   </p>

I must say that I too would have expected that to be a significant factor, particularly as the assistance of the grandparents was treated at para. 58 of the decision as a factor mitigating the impact on KI and Y in the stay scenario.  But Mr Pilgerstorfer pointed out that that was not a matter on which any reliance had been placed in the grounds of appeal or the joint skeleton argument; and he also told us, without demur from Mr Bazini, that it had not been relied on in the Tribunal. </p>

Both children are at a critical stage of their development.   The Appellant is a father figure in the life of his biological daughter.  We readily infer that there is emotional dependency bilaterally.  Furthermore, there is clear financial dependency to a not insubstantial degree.  There is no evidence of any other father figure in this child’s life.  The Appellant’s role has evidently been ever present, since her birth.  Children do not have the resilience, maturity or fortitude of adults. We find that the abrupt removal of the Appellant from his biological daughter’s life would not merely damage this child.  It would, rather, cause a gaping chasm in her life to her serious detriment. We consider that the impact on the Appellant’s step son would be at least as serious.  Having regard to the evidence available and based on findings already made, we conclude that the effect of the Appellant’s deportation on both children would be unduly harsh.  Accordingly, within the matrix of section 117C of the 2002 Act, ‘Exception 2’ applies.”  </p>

Even if that is regarded as an implicit endorsement, the conclusion which he had just quoted related to only one element in the UT’s decision, being its conclusion that it would be unduly harsh for the children to have to relocate to Sierra Leone: see para. 46 above.  But the relevant question for our purposes is about the stay scenario.

I am not so austere as to say that a tribunal may not sometimes find it useful to consider the outcomes in other apparently similar cases as a cross-check on a conclusion which it is minded to reach.  But the exercise can only ever be valuable up to a point.  Ultimately the tribunal has to make its own evaluation of the particular facts before it.

It pointed out at para. 62 that he had come here without any lawful basis (he is not a refugee) and that he remained in this country unlawfully between the expiry of his leave to remain as a minor until he was granted discretionary leave in 2016, which was only shortly before his conviction.

Most sex offenders who are sentenced to substantial terms of imprisonment are offered courses designed to help them avoid re-offending in future and in many cases the risk of doing so is reduced. It must be borne in mind, however, that the protection of the public from harm by way of future offending is only one of the factors that makes it conducive to the public good to deport criminals. Other factors include the need to mark the public's revulsion at the offender's conduct and the need to deter others from acting in a similar way. Fortunately, rehabilitation of the kind exhibited by the appellant in this case is not uncommon and cannot in my view contribute greatly to the existence of the very compelling circumstances required to outweigh the public interest in deportation.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in">That passage clearly accepts that rehabilitation is in principle a relevant consideration.  However it makes it equally clear it will not generally be a factor carrying  great weight – “it may be that in a few cases it will amount to an important factor”.  One reason given is that rehabilitation of the kind exhibited by the appellant – i.e. the successful completion of a sex offender’s course – was “not uncommon”.  MooreBick LJ’s other reason is that the prevention of the risk of offending is only one element in the public interest in deportation.  His reference to “the need to mark the public's revulsion at the offender's conduct and the need to deter others from acting in a similar way” is plainly derived from such well-known cases as <span style="font-style:italic">N (Kenya) v Secretary of State for the Home Department</span> [2004] EWCA Civ 1094, <span style="font-style:italic">OH (Serbia) v Secretary of State for the Home Department</span> [2008] EWCA Civ 694, and <span style="font-style:italic">DS (India) v </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in">What those authorities seem to me to establish is that the fact that a potential deportee has shown positive evidence of rehabilitation, and thus of a reduced risk of reoffending, cannot be excluded from the overall proportionality exercise.  The authorities say so, and it must be right in principle in view of the holistic nature of that exercise.  Where a tribunal is able to make an assessment that the foreign criminal is unlikely to re-offend, that is a factor which can carry some weight in the balance when considering very compelling circumstances.  The weight which it will bear will vary from case to case, but it will rarely be of great weight bearing in mind that, as Moore-Bick LJ says in <span style="font-style:italic">Danso</span>, the public interest in the deportation of criminals is not based only on the need to protect the public from further offending by the foreign criminal in question but also on wider policy considerations of deterrence and public concern.  I would add that tribunals will properly be cautious about their ability to make findings on the risk of re-offending, and will usually be unable to do so with any confidence based on no more than the undertaking of prison courses or mere assertions of reform by the offender or the absence of subsequent offending for what will typically be a relatively short period.  </p>

I do not think that it properly reflects the reason why rehabilitation is in principle relevant in this context, which is that it goes to reduce (one element in) the weight of the public interest in deportation which forms one side of the proportionality balance.  It is not generally to do with being given credit for being a law-abiding citizen: as the UT says, that is expected of everybody, but the fact that that is so is not a good reason for denying to an appellant such weight as his rehabilitation would otherwise carry. </p>

Mr Bazini’s submission before us was that the offence which led to RA’s imprisonment was unusual and committed in extenuating circumstances.  He did in fact have the right both to enter Iraq and, following the recent grant of leave to remain, to re-enter the UK, so he was not seeking to use the forged passport to obtain a benefit to which he was not entitled.  He only sought to use it because he wanted to visit his mother and was unable to do so in any other way.  Mr Bazini pointed out that a tribunal was entitled to take into account mitigating circumstances of that kind even though they will have been taken into account in arriving at the sentence: see para. 94 above.   </p>

In any event the UT does not address the point.  In those circumstances I prefer to say nothing more about it, save to observe that I doubt if it can add much to the fact that is in any event available to RA, namely that his offence is at the very bottom of the scale of seriousness.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in">There is, however, another criticism of the UT’s reasoning as regards the seriousness of the offence which emerged during the oral argument.  It says at para. 62 that it gives due weight to the fact that RA’s sentence “is at the bottom of the range covered by section 117C (3)”.  It was right to do so: see para. 92 above.  But it then notes as countervailing factors (a) that the Judge gave credit for a guilty plea and (b) that “as the sentencing judge pointed out, the offence was a serious one”.  It was submitted that it was wrong to treat those points as diminishing such weight as RA could otherwise put on the shortness of the sentence.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in">As to (a), I appreciate the logic of the UT’s point.  If the importance of the sentence is as an indicator of the seriousness of the offence, then that is more accurately reflected in the level of sentence pre-discount.  On the other hand, the statutory provisions themselves make no distinction between discounted and undiscounted sentences, which suggests that this degree of refinement is rather out of place.  It might also be thought wrong that the fact that RA had acted responsibly and acknowledged his guilt was not allowed to be put into the proportionality balance.  I think the UT should have proceeded without qualification on the basis that his sentence was at the very bottom of the relevant range.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in">As to (b), I think that the observation that the offence was “serious” was inappropriate for the reasons given at para. 94 above: of course offences of this kind are serious, but the authoritative measure of the degree of seriousness is the sentence imposed.  I would add that the Tribunal was also wrong to say that the sentencing judge had himself described the offence as serious.  We have seen the sentencing remarks, in which he says simply that an immediate custodial sentence is appropriate because travelling on false documents undermines “the immigration and travel pillars upon </p>

Section 117C of the Immigration Act 2014 enshrines the public interest in the deportation of foreign criminals.  Section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009 requires the Secretary of State to make arrangements to ensure that in her immigration functions she has regard to the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of children, which translates into a duty to make the best interests of the child a primary consideration.   The decision-maker must bring both of these elements into play in accordance with the complete statutory code, applying (as may be appropriate in the individual case) the fulcrum of undue harshness, or of very compelling circumstances or of proportionality.  A resulting decision to deport a parent may produce hugely detrimental consequences for a child but, provided his or her best interests have been adequately identified and weighed in the balance as a primary consideration, the decision will be lawful.

By their nature, commentaries on the tests may be illuminating, but they are not, as Underhill LJ has shown at [56], a substitute for the statutory wording.  For example, Lord Carnwath’s reference in paragraph 23 of <span style="font-style:italic">KO (Nigeria) </span>to undue harshness to “any child” cannot have been intended to set up a notional comparator, if only because it is not possible to know what the circumstances of such a child might be.  For some children the deportation of a largely absent parent may be a matter of little or no real significance.  For others, the deportation of a close caregiver parent where face to face contact cannot continue may be akin to a bereavement.  A decision that gives primary consideration to the best interests of the child will instead focus on the reality of that child’s actual situation and the decision-maker will be more assisted by addressing relevant factors of the kind identified by Underhill LJ at the end of [56] than by making generalised comparisons.   Likewise, as explained in the footnote to [48], the aphorism “That is what deportation does” is an important truth, but it is not a substitute for a proper consideration of the individual case.

Section 31(9) of the Children Act 1989 defines harm as ill-treatment or the impairment of health or physical, intellectual, emotional, social or behavioural development.  Reflecting our contemporary understanding of the importance of emotional development and mental health, there is no hierarchy as between physical and nonphysical harm.  It must therefore always be recognised that <span style="font-style:italic">for the child</span> the consequences of going with both parents may be experienced as far less harsh than staying with one parent.  Despite this, it may be easier for decision-makers to envisage the harm that may be done by expecting a family to experience precarious or even dangerous physical conditions than to factor in at full worth the lifelong emotional harm of terminating the relationship between a child and a close parent during the child’s minority and possibly forever.  Both situations are grim but for the child neither is intrinsically grimmer than the other.  Provided the decision-maker faces up to the reality of the child’s situation and gives it primary consideration, the public interest in deportation may prevail, but it will not do to minimise the emotional impact on the child of the severing of ties by reference to the doubtful prospect of maintaining relationships over many years by indirect means only, or by reciting the fact that this is what deportation does.   </p>

In the event of your deportation, it is considered that although your children will not have the same level of contact with you, they will be able to remain in contact through modern methods of communication such as telephone, email and letter.  No evidence has been provided that would suggest that you would be unable to maintain the parental relationship with your children from abroad.  As the children currently reside with their mother, it would not be unduly harsh for them to be separated from you, their father.  It is considered that as British citizens, the children will continue to benefit from all the rights and privileges during the British system bestows and they will also benefit from the support of their mother and her wider family network. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in">The Tribunal was less sanguine about the maintenance of the parental relationship from abroad.  It found that if their father was deported it would have “a significant impact” on the children, they would be separated from him “for at least 10 years, if not permanently” and that maintaining contact by Skype or telephone was “far from ideal”.  I agree with Underhill LJ when he says at [82] that the “any child” approach taken by the Tribunal at paragraph 71 was not correct.  I also agree, for the reasons given above, that the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">KO </span>itself is not to be treated as factual precedent.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.01in">The difficulty with the Tribunal’s conclusion, stated at paragraph 78, is that there is no indication of how primary consideration was given to these children’s best interests and it was not explained how the effective termination of their relationships with their father, at least during their childhoods, was outweighed by the public interest in his deportation.  It will now be a matter for the Tribunal conducting the rehearing to carry out that exercise in the manner described above at [84].  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in">The decision therefore turned on matters of physical care, financial support, community ties and parental deserts (“You have, through your offending behaviour, effectively exempted yourself from forming part of your child's day-to-day life.”)  There is no reference to the real losses to the child of her father’s deportation, whether or not they turned out to be outweighed by the public interest.  The Upper Tribunal’s decision itself has little to say about Y’s situation, beyond the fact that it would be hard but far from unduly harsh.  It is said that there would be serious adverse effects on her, but these are not explored.  It is said that opportunities to meet may be possible, but that she would clearly miss her father’s daily presence in her life.  I agree that this reasoning is insufficient to underpin the conclusion.  It is also interesting to note that whilst the Tribunal felt some hesitation about the “go scenario”, it did not feel the same about the “stay scenario”.  Returning to my discussion about emotional harm, it is not possible to understand why it held these differing views about Y’s best interests.  When taken alongside the emphasis given to the seriousness of the offence (see [145] to [147] above), I am clear that RA’s underlying appeal must also be reheard.  </p>
