The appeals are brought by the Secretary of State for the Home Department and the boy’s mother. The order under appeal requires the mother to disclose to the solicitors acting for the father and the child redacted copies of certain documents contained in the mother’s asylum file. The order was made following two judgments delivered by the judge – the first, dated 18 November 2019, in which he set out the principles he proposed to apply in reaching his decision on the father’s application for disclosure of the documents, and the second, dated 4 May 2020, in which he set out his reasons for ordering disclosure.  </p>

In February 2016, the mother and child left that country without the father’s knowledge and travelled to London. On arrival, the mother claimed asylum, including the child as a dependent, alleging that she had fled her home countrybecause of chronic domestic and sexual abuse inflicted on her by the father in the child’s presence and sexual abuse of the child. She said that were she to return to her country of origin there was a substantial risk that the father and/or his family and associates would kill her or inflict further physical abuse. </p>

By letter, dated 24 April 2017, the Secretary of State accepted the mother’s account of abuse perpetrated by the father, but refused the claim for asylum on the grounds that she could relocate within her country of origin away from the danger posed by the father and his family. The mother appealed to the First-tier Tribunal which, on 11 September 2017, allowed her appeal, as a result of which she was granted leave to remain and refugee status as a recognised refugee. In her determination, the tribunal judge stated that the mother’s claims, including her claim that she could not safely relocate within her country of origin, were credible and that she had established that her fears of persecution were well founded. </p>

That application was refused by HH Judge Corbett, sitting as a judge of the High Court.

In the course of determining the application, the judge read all of the documents which the Secretary of State and the mother sought to withhold, in accordance with the procedure set out in FPR 21.3(6). </p>

It remains the fact that all such cases require the most anxious, rigorous and vigilant scrutiny. It is for those who seek to restrain the disclosure of papers to a litigant to make good their claim and to demonstrate with precision exactly which documents or classes of documents require to be withheld. The burden on them is a heavy one. Only if the case for non-disclosure is convincingly and compellingly demonstrated will an order be made. No such order should be made unless the situation imperatively demands it. No such order should extend any further than is necessary. The test, at the end of the day, is one of strict necessity. In most cases the needs of a fair trial will demand that there be no restrictions on disclosure.

Hayden J held that the cumulative effect of the Geneva Convention, immigration legislation and rules, and the two Council Directives cited above was that the determination of the refugee status of any adult or child fell entirely within an area entrusted by Parliament to the Home Secretary so that the court in family proceedings could not intervene.

In addition, in considering proportionality under Article 8 the Court will need to attach particular weight to the wider powerful public interest in protecting the confidentiality of the asylum process. This is particularly so where the applicant for disclosure is the alleged persecutor. Against these considerations the Court will need to weigh, in the case of an application made by a family member, any adverse Article 6 and/or 8 impact of disclosure not being provided to the person making the application.

First (at paragraph 34), he declared that, whilst it would not be appropriate for disclosure to take place until such time as the child’s asylum application had been determined, he was satisfied that the balancing exercise could fairly be carried out prior to that determination. In so deciding, he had regard to the overriding objective in Part 1 of the FPR, in particular the duty to deal with issues expeditiously and saving expense, and the need to avoid a further hearing on the disclosure issue. Secondly, he declared (at paragraph 35) that he was satisfied that the documents identified met the test of relevance: </p>

If the court is satisfied that the interests of the child point towards non-disclosure, the next and final step is for the court to weigh that consideration, and its strength in the circumstances of the case, against the interest of the parent or other party in having an opportunity to see and respond to the material.

He noted that the tribunal had concluded that, if the mother and child returned to their country of origin, there was a risk that they would be located by the father via family members, but concluded that, as they were now residing in this country, no such risk arose. Similarly, no evidence had been adduced as to the risk to third parties, and the judge observed that any such risk could be ameliorated by redaction of the documents. He reached a similar conclusion about the risk of harm to the child (paragraph 39).

In these proceedings under Part II of the Children Act 1989 the mother levels against the father allegations of the utmost seriousness, asserting that he is the perpetrator of domestic abuse and child sexual abuse. The father strongly disputes the allegations made by the mother (and indeed positively asserts they are fabricated). The nature of the allegations is such that if found proved they are likely to have a very significant impact on the future determination of H's welfare and, in particular, the extent to which the father and son are able to enjoy a relationship with each other. The mutual enjoyment by father and H of each other's company constitutes a fundamental element of family life within the meaning of Art 8(1) of the Convention and, subject to the provisions of Art 8(2), domestic measures hindering such enjoyment amount to an interference with the right protected by Art 8(1). </p>

The same principles apply with respect to procedural elements of Art 8. A failure to disclose relevant documents to a parent within a process for determining contact arrangements between that parent and their child will not afford the requisite protection of the parent's interests as safeguarded by Art 8 unless that failure to disclose is justified by reference to Art 8(2) (see <span style="font-style:italic">McMichael v United Kingdom </span>(1995) 20 EHRR 205).

The starting point must be that the father is entitled to consider all evidence that is relevant in that context, pursuant to his cardinal rights under the ECHR and the common law principles of fairness and natural justice, as is H. Given the gravity of the allegations in issue and the evidence before the court regarding the contended for risk of harm to the mother and H of disclosure, I am satisfied that these considerations outweigh the risk of harm to the mother and H and that the same is not, in this case, a clear and proper objective justifying withholding relevant evidence from a parent facing allegations of physical and sexual assault and child sexual abuse. Further, I am likewise not satisfied in this case that the public interest in maintaining the confidentiality of the asylum system generally is sufficient to justify the grave compromise of the fair trial and family life rights of father and H which non-disclosure of relevant corroboratory and contradictory evidence concerning allegations of domestic abuse and child sexual abuse of the utmost seriousness would entail on the facts of this particular case. For the reasons I have given, it would be an exceptional course for a parent in family proceedings, facing serious allegations of this nature, to be disadvantaged in comparison to other parents in a similar position simply by virtue of the fact that evidence relevant to the determination of those allegations had been the subject of prior consideration in the asylum process. In these circumstances, I am not satisfied that the accepted need to safeguard integrity of asylum process generally justifies in this specific case undermining the operation of cardinal rights that are one of the very reasons this jurisdiction is considered a safe haven for those seeking asylum. </p>

However, for the reasons I set out in my previous judgment, the fact that the person seeking disclosure is considered within the context of the asylum process to be a persecutor does not mean that, at the outset, the scales are weighted against disclosure and inspection following a successful claim for asylum. Whether documents from the asylum process will be provided to an alleged persecutor who is a party to proceedings under the Children Act 1989 following a successful (or unsuccessful) claim depends on all of the facts of the individual case and the balance that is struck between the various competing rights and interests on the basis of those facts. It is the balancing of those rights and interests on the facts of the particular case, and not the application of a general policy, that properly leads to the conclusion of whether disclosure should or should not take place in a given case. Within this context, this judgment constitutes no more than a decision on the particular facts of this case.” </p>

During the currency of the asylum claim the father has no right to know the allegations against him, no right to answer those allegations and cannot see the information that is said to evidence the conduct alleged.  By contrast, during the currency of the subsequent proceedings under the Children Act 1989 the father has a cardinal right to know those same allegations against him, a cardinal right to answer those allegations and, ordinarily, is entitled to see the information that is said to evidence the conduct alleged. </p>

In this case, that balancing exercise comes down in favour of disclosure of the documents I have listed. In other cases, the balancing exercise will produce a different result on the facts.  As I have stated, and repeat, this decision does not signal any change in the general approach to disclosure into family proceedings of asylum documentation.

By saying, as set out in paragraph 56 of the second judgment, that the balancing exercise “depends on all of the facts of the individual case and the balance that is struck between the various competing rights and interests on the basis of those facts”, the judge ignored the increased harm to the public interest in the confidentiality of the asylum process arising from an order for disclosure to a persecutor. </p>

This was evident, in particular, from the observations at the conclusion of the second judgment in paragraph 55 that “it would be an exceptional course for a parent in family proceedings, facing serious allegations of this nature, to be disadvantaged in comparison to other parents in a similar position simply by virtue of the fact that evidence relevant to the determination of those allegations had been the subject of prior consideration in the asylum process.” The Secretary of State contends that the terms in which this observation was couched illustrates the minimal significance the judge attached to the confidentiality of the asylum process. Under the judge’s principles, the mere fact that material is <span style="font-style:italic">prima facie</span> relevant suffices to displace the public interest in maintaining confidentiality of the asylum process. Mr Payne submitted that the fact that material is <span style="font-style:italic">prima facie</span> relevant should be the starting point, as opposed to the endpoint, in the balancing exercise. As this Court observed in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Dunn v Durham County Council</span>, relevance is a matter of fact, degree and proportionality. Consequently, when carrying out the balancing exercise, judges are required to assess the degree of relevance and the prejudice arising from nondisclosure in order to determine the extent to which a party’s Article 6 rights are compromised. Similarly, without a proper assessment of the degree of relevance, any conclusion about the impact on the child’s best interests from non-disclosure is flawed. Furthermore, in this context the judge was wrong to decide that it was not relevant that significant aspects of the factual basis of the asylum claim were available to the father from material already disclosed. </p>

She never considered that material of a highly distressing and personal nature would be disclosed to the very person responsible for that distress. A further reason for opposing disclosure was that she feared the consequences for the third parties who had helped in her country of origin. Even the heaviest redaction of the documents would leave them vulnerable.

In the first judgment, the judge carefully analysed the Procedures Directive and rightly concluded that it did not have the reach or impact contended for by the Secretary of State. There was no justification for ring-fencing a class of documents in the manner she proposed. Whilst acknowledging the importance of giving appropriate weight to the confidentiality of the asylum process, the judge correctly identified that Article 22 of the Procedures Directive is of narrow ambit. He adopted and confirmed the approach, set out by Hayden J in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">F v M</span>, that the court had to undertake a balancing exercise of the engaged ECHR rights, where no one might have preference over another, having regard to the particular facts of the individual case.

That approach is to be followed whenever a party or person asserts exemption from disclosure. Faced with such an assertion, the judge must conduct a balancing exercise, having regard to the competing ECHR rights, in particular the fair trial rights of the party seeking disclosure or inspection and the privacy or confidentiality rights of the other party and any person whose rights may require protection, bearing in mind that the denial of disclosure or inspection is limited to circumstances where such denial is strictly necessary. </p>

As my Lord Phillips LJ observed during the hearing, all contested applications for disclosure involve private information. If the information was publicly available, no application would be needed. The weight to be attached to the confidentiality of the information varies from case to case, but the approach to the balancing exercise is the same. As this Court emphasised in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Dunn v Durham County Council</span>, the denial of disclosure or inspection is limited to circumstances where such denial is strictly necessary because, as Munby J observed in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Re B</span>, in most cases the needs of a fair trial will demand that there be no restrictions on disclosure. It follows that the judge was right to say, at paragraph 55 of the second judgment, that the starting point in any analysis must be that a party to family proceedings is entitled to consider all evidence that is relevant, pursuant to his cardinal rights under the ECHR and the common law principles of fairness and natural justice. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">For my part, I am not persuaded that the confidentiality of information relied on by an asylum applicant should be treated any differently from other categories of confidential information. The fact that the information was provided to the asylum authority on a confidential basis, and the public interest in maintaining the confidentiality of the asylum process, are both factors which the judge must take into account. The fact that, if disclosed, the information would be seen by the person accused of persecuting the applicant is manifestly a factor which carries weight in the balancing exercise. It is not, however, determinative. It is true that both Article 22 of the Procedures Directive and paragraph 339IA of the Immigration Rules impose a prohibition on the disclosure of information to the alleged persecutor but the preliminary words of both the Directive and the paragraph qualify that prohibition. In both instruments, the prohibition is expressed as applying “for the purposes of examining individual applications for asylum”. As my Lord Phillips LJ pointed out during the hearing, these words indicate that the provisions of the Article in the Directive and the paragraph in the Rules are intended to give instructions as to how to deal with the information when considering applications for asylum. They do not prevent a court from ordering disclosure. Mr Payne sought to draw support from Lord Kerr’s comment in paragraph 22 of his judgment in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">McGeough</span>. But in the next paragraph, Lord Kerr observed that the stipulation in Article 22 “is that it should not be disclosed to alleged actors of persecution and the injunction against its disclosure is specifically related to the process of examination of individual cases”. The Supreme Court decision therefore provides no support for the Secretary of State’s submission to us. On the contrary, it is a very strong indication that the judge’s approach was correct. In my judgment, he was right to conclude that “neither the Refugee Convention, the EU Charter and Directives [n]or the Immigration Rules provide for blanket confidentiality with respect to any alleged persecutor.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I would start by putting the legal issues into their factual context.  In February 2016, when the mother and child came to this country, the child was aged 4½.  He is now 9 and has not seen his father since.  The father’s Hague Convention proceedings seeking the child’s return to the country of origin were withdrawn in June 2019, with HHJ Corbett  having refused disclosure from the asylum file in May 2019.  They were replaced seamlessly with Children Act proceedings in which the father seeks contact and out of which these appeals arise.  Some indirect contact has been taking place, but no substantive progress has been made with the proceedings themselves.  A 5 day fact-finding hearing was finally due to begin before MacDonald J on 15 June (the week following the hearing of the appeals), but we are told that it was adjourned because the mother wishes to consider a further appeal. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In this way the father’s application for disclosure from the asylum file has, I am afraid, become a cuckoo in the nest, severely delaying the resolution of important welfare issues.  It has led to the judge giving one very substantial judgment of principle in November 2019 and another substantial disposal judgment in May 2020, followed by these appeals.  As yet, the proceedings have no end date. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">How then did the disclosure issue come about?  The mother came to the UK, having managed to leave her country of origin by using a forged affidavit, which she readily admitted when she arrived here.  She claimed asylum and was interviewed in August 2016.  Her account was accepted but her claim was refused on the basis that she could relocate internally.  The FTT disagreed and allowed her appeal in September 2017.  When the father issued his Hague Convention summons in December 2018 (he had approached the authorities in his home country in July 2016, but they had taken over two years to forward his application), the mother exhibited the refusal letters and the FTT decision to her statement.  The position was summarised in this way by HHJ Corbett: </p>

He has the detailed refusal letters and the full unredacted ruling by the independent judicial tribunal describing the mother’s consistent account.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in">The question at that point was whether the child was settled in this country.

It is common ground that documents can be withheld from a litigant where necessary without breaching the right to a fair trial, and also that documents can be disclosed from an asylum file where necessary without imperilling the integrity of the confidential asylum system.  The court’s task is to identify which interest should prevail in the case before it and the answer is not to be found in legal generalities or contestable adjectives but in a close study of the individual circumstances. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It was in my view open to the judge to determine the father’s application by a relatively swift application of established principles, particularly as there had just been a dress rehearsal of the arguments in the child abduction proceedings.  As it was, he reached a considered decision with which we should be slow to interfere, particularly where he was so familiar with the issues and where he had read the asylum file, which we have not. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I nevertheless feel some hesitancy about the outcome.  Taking the judge’s description of the material at paragraph 35, quoted above, the existence of ‘potential lines of forensic inquiry relevant to credibility’ in the midst of an otherwise consistent account might have persuaded me that the grounds for withholding this disclosure had been made out.  I may have given more weight to the importance of confidentiality for the asylum system, which resonates beyond the end of each individual application.  That is particularly so where the father knows the case against him, the mother is not relying on the material to support her case, and the court will have a full opportunity to assess the witnesses.  It was open to the judge to refuse disclosure for these reasons, but he reached a different conclusion after careful consideration.  That was a judgement for him to make and it is not in my view open to us to say that his decision was wrong. </p>
