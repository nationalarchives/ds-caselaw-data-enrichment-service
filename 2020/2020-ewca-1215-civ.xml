	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Hale QC questioned whether the husband’s conduct meant that we should not hear his appeal.  This was on the basis that the alleged transfer was in breach of the February 2020 order, and possibly also an earlier freezing order, and that it appeared clearly designed to seek to, at least, impede if not frustrate the wife’s ability to enforce the lump sum order in the event of the appeal being dismissed.  However, after taking instructions from his client, he invited us to continue to hear the appeal, which we did. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The sole ground of appeal was that the judge failed to assess or take into account the husband’s needs and only considered the wife’s needs.

The husband said in evidence that “he gets offered business opportunities on a daily basis”.  The judge summarised, at [68], the husband’s position as follows: “He is completely confident of his own abilities and says that, if the court does not permit him to resume control of AM, he will set up a business in competition.  Provided proper safeguards are put in place to protect AM, W, in my view rightly, does not object to such a course.  I am satisfied that he will start off again, in a new enterprise and will prosper”. </p>

In simple terms, he submitted that the outcome could not be fair because the husband is left with no capital and, at present, has no income.  Further, Mr Chamberlayne questioned why it was fair for the wife to be awarded the business outright rather than for the husband to retain a share to be realised once the children were adult and the income was no longer required to meet their and the wife’s needs.

The husband’s costs must also have been substantial but, because he provided no Form H, the extent of them was not clear.  The total costs, which Mr Hale put at well in excess of £1 million, reflected the destructive impact of the husband’s conduct on the matrimonial assets which had been depleted by, what Mr Hale described as, the husband’s “egregious” approach to litigation.  This was “ruinous expense”, as stated by the judge, at [50], which had had a dramatic impact on the parties’ assets.

It was submitted: (a)  that the judge had been entitled to find that the husband’s conduct had “caused a huge and unnecessary haemorrhage of money” because of <span style="font-style:italic">all </span>the various litigation costs incurred by the parties; (b) that, although the judge did not disregard this, it did not “ultimately, influence the award” which above all was influenced by the needs of the children; and (c) that, the judge’s treatment of conduct had been correct because, by analogy with <span style="font-style:italic">Beach v Beach</span>, the husband had dissipated the family money so significantly that the division effected by the judge was justified. </p>

This had severely reduced the resources available for distribution between the parties and had justified the imbalance in the outcome effected by the judge’s award.  Mr Hale further submitted that this was not as stark as portrayed by Mr Chamberlayne.  The husband would have approximately £630,000 and the further sum due from PJM which was not less than £120,000.  In addition, the judge had been entitled to find that the husband would “start off again, in a new enterprise, and prosper”.

His solicitor and own client costs throughout were just less than £200,000.  Therefore this was as a matter of classification one of those rare cases where the litigation misconduct could not be the subject of full compensation to the victim simply by the adjustment of orders that would otherwise have been made for costs.  Ancillary relief procedures are currently undergoing complete reform.  Case management by the judges will help to curb litigation misconduct.  But if costs are wasted it will be easier to quantify the waste.  That gives the court the opportunity to ensure that the litigant responsible bears the cost of waste in full.  Unless there are exceptional mitigating circumstances, that should be the objective of the court's order.  In my opinion the judge was right to proceed on the basis that he would make no order for costs either way in the light of the reality that the husband had effectively funded both sides.  It was obviously sensible to reflect both the marital misconduct and the litigation misconduct in quantifying the wife's award.  Otherwise the husband would in effect be funding the wife partly in order to meet costs orders in his own favour.” </p>

A Mesher order was not appropriate, taking into account not only the contributions of the parties, particularly the wife's ongoing contribution to the care of the child, but also the parties' conduct.  The wife was entitled to rely on various aspects of the husband's conduct, including: his litigation conduct in not disclosing the removal of moneys from the jurisdiction; his actual conduct in preventing the court from having any meaningful say in the disposition of those moneys; the reality that the burden of maintaining the child was likely to rest with the mother alone; and the husband's abduction of the child.  The husband's conduct was particularly relevant when considering the court's duty to give first consideration to the welfare of the child.  Although it was appropriate for the court to look at the question of equality, and to depart from equality only if there was good reason for doing so, the court's overriding duty was to reach a solution which, in all the circumstances, was fair.  Applying the s 25 criteria to the facts, the conduct and contributions of the parties, together with the desirability of a clean break order, provided good reasons for departing from equality.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Another critical factor is the judge’s conclusion as to the children’s needs.  Their needs included that it was “plainly” in their interests to remain in their current schooling.  He also decided that their needs and the wife’s needs “must be met … out of the business” because he had “no confidence” that the husband would make any provision.  This is reflected in the terms of the order referred to in paragraph 45 above. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Taking all the above into account, does the judgment sufficiently explain the judge’s reasons for his award and is that award justified?  Even though, as I have said, it would have been better if the judgment had contained more detail, I am not persuaded either that the judgment is defective or that the award was not justified by the circumstances of this case. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It is plain, as referred to above, that the judge was entitled to take the husband’s litigation conduct into account.  Even just taking the figures as they appear from the judgment, the parties had spent at least £800,000 on litigation in England.  I say, at least £800,000, because the wife’s debt of £613,000 plus the husband’s debt of £170,000 were clearly not the only sums spent on costs as some assets had been sold to pay costs during the proceedings.  As Mr Hale submitted, in my view correctly, the amount spent on legal costs would have been a modest fraction of this but for the husband’s conduct.  The excess amount spent on costs of, say, £600,000 (or if the costs were, as Mr Hale told us, in excess of £1 million, at least £800,000) would have been available to be distributed between the parties.  This summary is just to provide some additional context to the judge’s decision and demonstrate the extent of the resources lost to the family through the husband’s conduct. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Further, I do not accept Mr Chamberlayne’s submission that the disparity in outcome cannot be justified in this case.  First, I do not accept that conduct cannot lead to a party receiving less than their needs.  This depends on the circumstances of the case and, as referred to above, can be justified.  This must, of course, be justified having regard to <span style="font-style:italic">all </span>the s.25 factors but it plainly can be justified.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Secondly, the disparity between the parties would self-evidently have been very substantially less if there had been a further £600,000 or more in available resources.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Fourthly, the judge was entitled to conclude that the resources allocated to the wife were no more than sufficient to meet her needs both in the short term and the long term.  He was equally entitled to conclude that the amount allocated to the husband, also taking into account the husband’s prospects, and the other material factors such as his conduct, was a just proportion of the assets and was sufficient to meet his needs at a level which was fair to him in the circumstances of this case.  To address another of Mr Chamberlayne’s submissions, in my view, the judge’s observations, at [106] and [124], did make clear that the resources available to the husband as a result of his order, even if not sufficient to meet his needs, fairly reflected the s.25 factors.  For the avoidance of doubt, I also do not accept Mr Chamberlayne’s submission that the judge’s consideration of the husband’s needs was inadequate. </p>
