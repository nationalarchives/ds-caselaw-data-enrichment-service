	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The background is that the parents lived together for twelve years.  Since their separation the father has brought three sets of proceedings.  The first, in 2015, was resolved by mediation.  The second ended with an order in January 2017 for the children to live with their mother and spend time with their father in accordance with an agreed schedule.  During those two sets of proceedings, which were heard by magistrates, both parents were legally represented.  The mother made allegations of harm and domestic abuse by the father towards herself and towards a woman (LM) with whom the father had a later relationship.  However, neither party then asked the court to make findings of fact about that. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In June 2018, the father committed a serious assault on another girlfriend, HH. In October 2018, he pleaded guilty to assault and was sentenced to 18 weeks imprisonment suspended for 18 months with a requirement for 35 days of rehabilitation activity and a 12 week curfew.  A restraining order for 4 years was also imposed.  </p>

The mother’s response included allegations that he had engaged in a pattern of abusive, violent and aggressive behaviour within his personal relationships and that he had behaved in this way towards her and towards LM in 2016 and towards HH in 2017/18.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">At some point in 2019, District Judge Wylie became the allocated judge.  In February 2020, the matter finally came before her for a three-day fact-finding hearing.  The mother, who was represented by counsel, sought findings in relation to nine incidents.  The father, who had been represented throughout the proceedings, was now in person.  Evidence was given by both parents.  Neither LM nor HH was willing to attend to give evidence and neither parent took steps to compel them to attend.  The mother did seek to issue a witness summons for HH but the summons was later withdrawn.  However, the court had the police files, which contained their contemporaneous statements, the father’s police interview in June 2018, and statements made by other witnesses, including the father’s sister.   </p>

She analysed contemporaneous statements made by LM and by her parents.  She noted that the father completely denied any assault on LM and that he attributed her allegations to a personality disorder with which she had indeed been diagnosed.  However, having reviewed the evidence, she found that the allegations were very detailed and that it was simply not credible for the father to dismiss them.  She found two allegations proved, one allegation proved in part, and one allegation too vague to form the basis for a finding. </p>

Next, the parties should have been put in possession of the facts so that they could have made representations about the appropriateness of whatever action was being considered.  As to the substance, the very tenuous connection between the District Judge and the mother could not be a reason for recusal.

This made it hard to believe that the District Judge did not know about the family connection much sooner, particularly as the mother had made mention of the hockey club in her original statement in the proceedings.  The findings concerning LM represented a real obstacle for him, because he had done work arising from his assault on HH and this acknowledgement of responsibility had led CAFCASS to recommend contact with the children.  However, the position had changed in a supplemental report because of his lack of acceptance of having assaulted LM. </p>

He became aware that LM had been taking anti-psychotic medication and this might have impacted on the District Judge’s findings.  He accepted that the statement now made by his sister was in the same terms as one that appeared on the police files, which were read by the District Judge, and that the statement from his mother reflected her questions after the trial, along the lines of “What about X, Y or Z?”  His skeleton argument for the hearing before the Judge covered these questions, but they were not dealt with at all. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It is rare for findings of fact to be varied.  It should be emphasised that the process of reopening is only to be embarked upon where the application presents genuine new information.  It is not a vehicle for litigants to cast doubt on findings that they do not like or a substitute for an appeal that should have been pursued at the time of the original decision.  In<span style="font-style:italic"> Re E </span>at [16] I noted that some applications will be no more than attempts to reargue lost causes or escape sound findings. The court will readily recognise applications that are said to be based on fresh evidence but are in reality old arguments dressed up in new ways, and it should deal with these applications swiftly and firmly.  They must not be allowed to derail ongoing proceedings, or to revive past proceedings in a way that wastes resources and is unfair to other parties.  So, while it may be appropriate to refer a possibly meritorious application to the judge who made the original finding, that step, with its inbuilt delay, will not be necessary where the application is tenuous or worse.  Meanwhile, the findings will remain in full effect unless and until they are varied; the mere fact that an application to reopen has been made will not alter that.  </p>

But as it was, they were left in the dark and both parties asked the obvious question “Why?”, the father ahead of the hearing before the Judge and the mother afterwards. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It is understandable that the Judge was troubled by this odd position and clear that he was acting with the best of intentions.  At the same time, it was necessary for him to approach the matter systematically.  The starting point was that the listed application was the father’s application to reopen certain findings of fact.  There had been no regular process of recusal by the District Judge and there was no appeal before the Judge.  In these very unusual circumstances, the fact that a party had not appealed was not a bar to the Judge raising the issue himself, but in doing so he needed to acknowledge that a decision to set aside findings on the basis of apparent bias was one that could only be taken in an appellate capacity.  Procedural steps could have been taken to achieve this, but the issue was not addressed and it is not clear what capacity the Judge was acting in. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.00in">The Judge was not in a position to take a decision about apparent bias: the decision calls for an informed observer, which supposes knowledge of the basic facts.  He should have put himself in a position to inform the parties about the District Judge’s reasons for wishing to recuse herself so that they were in a position to respond.  He instead referred only to the existence of a family connection, which they were in no position to assess.  Consequently, they were not only unable to put their case about the District Judge’s withdrawal but, more seriously, they had no meaningful way of addressing the new and radical proposal to set aside her findings altogether.  This process was not fair to either party.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.00in">As to the legal test for apparent bias, the Judge was right to say that one must put oneself in the position of a reasonable observer who is not involved in the case.  However, he was mistaken in stating that the test is whether the observer would be concerned that justice had not been seen to be done, when the correct question is whether the observer would conclude that there was a real possibility that the judge was biased, which is a stronger thing.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.00in">Finally, the Judge’s conclusion that the District Judge’s findings were infected by apparent bias is not supported by any sound reasoning.  This was the sort of happenstance community tie that should be disclosed to parties by a judge who is aware of it, but would not ordinarily lead the reasonable and informed observer to conclude that the judge could not try the case fairly.  In this case the matter was put beyond argument by the fact that the District Judge did not discover that her son and the mother knew each other until months after she had made her decision.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The result is that the decision to set aside all of the District Judge’s findings cannot stand, and I would accordingly restore the findings.  On the question of recusal, matters have moved on since the hearing before the Judge.  The parties are now aware of the District Judge’s reasons for recusal and neither of them suggests that she should have any further involvement; in the mother’s case, that is a pragmatic response to the procedural history.  That issue is therefore closed. </p>

This court has the power to make any order that they could have made.  We have all the necessary material to decide the application and in my view it is in the interests of the family that we should do so. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The father explained his position to us with moderation (see paragraph 25) and I accept that the findings in relation to LM may represent a disadvantage for him because, unlike the findings in relation to HH, he does not accept them.  However, his application is on examination no more than an attempt to relitigate findings of fact that were regularly made.  They were not appealed and there is no new information of any significance that could now persuade the court to review them.  The father’s sister’s statement is not new material.  His mother’s statement, insofar as it contains anything of relevance, could have been produced at the trial.  The information about the impact on LM of any medication she may have been taking is pure speculation.  Looking at the matter overall, there are no solid grounds for believing that the earlier findings require revisiting nor any reason to think that a rehearing will result in any different finding.  I would therefore dismiss the father’s application. </p>
