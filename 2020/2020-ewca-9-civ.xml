	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">On 3 September 2019 His Honour Judge Pelling QC, sitting as a judge of the High Court, made an order committing the three appellants to prison for contempt of court.  Their contempt consisted in deliberately disobeying an earlier court order, which I will refer to as “the Injunction”, made on 11 July 2018 with the aim of preventing trespass on the claimants’ land, unlawful interference with the claimants’ rights of passage to and from their land and unlawful interference with the supply chain of the first claimant (“Cuadrilla”).  As punishment for two deliberate breaches of the Injunction, the judge committed one of the appellants, Katrina Lawrie, to prison for two months plus four weeks.  The other appellants, Lee Walsh and Christopher Wilson, were both committed to prison for four weeks.  In each case execution of the committal order was suspended on condition that the appellant obeys the Injunction for a period of two years. </p>

	  <num style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000;background-color:auto;margin-left:0.50in">2.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The appellants have exercised their rights of appeal against the committal order.  They appeal on the grounds (1) that the relevant terms of the Injunction were insufficiently clear and certain to be enforceable by committal because those terms made the question whether conduct was prohibited depend on the intention of the person concerned; and (2) that imposing the sanction of imprisonment (albeit suspended) was inappropriate and unduly harsh in the circumstances of this case.  Relevant circumstances include the facts that the Injunction was granted, not against the appellants as named individuals, but against “persons unknown” who committed specified acts, and that the acts done by the appellants in breach of the Injunction were part of a campaign of protest involving ‘direct action’ designed to disrupt Cuadrilla’s activities.  This context is one in which the appellants’ rights to freedom of expression and assembly are engaged. </p>

It is not in dispute that all Cuadrilla’s activities have been carried out in accordance with the law.  Equally, there is no dispute that Cuadrilla’s activities are controversial and that a significant number of people, including the appellants, have sincere and strongly held views that fracking ought not to take place because of its impact on the environment.  It is also common ground that the appellants, like everyone else, have the right to express their views and to protest against an activity to which they object subject only to such restrictions as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society for (amongst other legitimate aims) the prevention of disorder or crime or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.  The right of protest is protected both by the common law of England and Wales and by articles 10 and 11 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (the “Human Rights Convention”) which is incorporated into UK law by the Human Rights Act 1998. </p>

The evidence adduced by the claimants when they applied for a further injunction in May 2018 showed that, since January 2017, Cuadrilla and its employees, contractors and suppliers had been subjected to numerous ‘direct action’ protests, designed to obstruct works on the site.  The actions taken by some protestors included ‘locking on’ – that is, chaining oneself to an object or another person – at the entrance to the site in order to prevent vehicles from entering or leaving it; ‘slow walking’ – that is, walking on the highway as slowly as possible in front of vehicles attempting to enter or leave the site; and climbing onto vehicles to prevent them from moving.</p>

Of the many actions taken by protestors during that month to attempt to disrupt transport to and from the Preston New Road site, one particularly disruptive incident involved criminal offences and led to sentences which were the subject of an appeal to the Criminal Division of the Court of Appeal: see <span style="font-style:italic">R v Roberts</span> [2018] EWCA Crim 2739; [2019] 1 WLR 2577.  That incident began on the morning of 25 July 2017, when two protestors managed to climb on top of lorries approaching the site along the Preston New Road, forcing the lorries to stop to avoid putting the safety of the two men at risk.  Two more men later climbed on top of the lorries.  Each of the protestors stayed there for two or three days and the last one did not come down until 29 July 2017.  For all this time the lorries were therefore unable to move, with the result that one carriageway of the road remained blocked.  Substantial disruption was caused to local residents and other members of the public.   </p>

This action, coupled with an already tense atmosphere amongst the RTP activists, anti-fracking activists and local protestors, resulted in confrontation with police and they arrested two protestors.  During the evening the protestors then became aware of a convoy <span style="font-style:italic">en route</span> to the drill site resulting in four protestors deploying in two pairs with arm tube lock-ons and blocking the A583.  Further confrontation and aggression towards police ensued, with one of the locked-on protestors also assaulting a police officer.

In doing so she stood in the path of the lorry, raising her arms above her head.  To avoid hitting her, the lorry had to veer across the centre line of the carriageway into the opposite lane.  These facts were proved by video evidence from a camera on the dashboard of the lorry cab.     </p>

As the judge observed, that evidence only made sense on the basis that she was aware of its terms.  There were also photographs showing Ms Lawrie placing decorations on the fence around the site “in such close proximity to the notices summarising the effect of the [Injunction] as to make it virtually impossible for her not to have read the information in the notice unless she was deliberately choosing not to do so”.  In the case of Mr Walsh, the relevant evidence included social media posts that he had shared with others that referred to or summarised the main effects of the Injunction.  The third appellant, Mr Wilson, accepted that he was aware of the Injunction and that it affected protests at the site entrance.  There was also video evidence of Cuadrilla’s security guards seeking to draw the Injunction to the attention of the appellants by providing them with copies of it, which they refused to take. </p>

The judge also had regard, by analogy, to the Sentencing Council guideline on sentencing for breach of a criminal behaviour order.  This guideline identifies three levels of culpability, where level A represents a very serious or persistent breach, level B a deliberate breach falling between levels A and C, and level C a minor breach or one just short of reasonable excuse.  Harm – which includes not only any harm actually caused but any risk of harm posed by the breach – is also divided into three categories.  Category 1 applies where the breach causes very serious harm or distress or “demonstrates a continuing risk of serious criminal and/or anti-social behaviour”.  Category 3 applies where the breach causes little or no harm or distress or “demonstrates a continuing risk of minor criminal and/or anti-social behaviour”.  Category 2 applies to cases falling between categories 1 and 3. </p>

The guideline indicates that the starting point in sentencing for breach of a criminal behaviour order in category 2B is 12 weeks’ custody, with a category range between a medium level community order and one year’s custody.  A community order is not an available sanction for contempt of court.

That case concerned a demonstration by a group of farmers complaining about a fall in prices of agricultural products and seeking increases in state subsidies for the agricultural sector.  As part of their protest, some farmers including the applicants used their tractors to block three main roads for approximately 48 hours causing major disruption to traffic.  The applicants were convicted in the Lithuanian courts of public order offences and received suspended sentences of 60 days imprisonment.  They complained to the European Court that their criminal convictions and sentences violated articles 10 and 11 of the Convention.  In examining their complaints, the Grand Chamber first considered whether the case fell within the scope of article 11 and concluded that it did.  The court noted (at para 97) that, on the facts of the case, “the disruption of traffic cannot be described as a side-effect of a meeting held in a public place, but rather as the result of intentional action by the farmers, who wished to attract attention to the problems in the agricultural sector and to push the government to accept their demands”.

Nor is there any such prohibition on granting a ‘<span style="font-style:italic">quia timet</span>’ injunction to restrain such persons from committing a tort which has not yet been committed.  Nonetheless, Longmore LJ (with whose judgment David Richards LJ and I agreed) warned that a court should be inherently cautious about granting such injunctions against unknown persons since the reach of such an injunction is necessarily difficult to assess in advance (see para 31). </p>

While it is undoubtedly desirable that the terms of an injunction should correspond to the threatened tort and not be so wide that they prohibit lawful conduct, this cannot be regarded as an absolute rule.  The decisions of the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Hubbard v Pitt</span> [1976] QB 142 and <span style="font-style:italic">Burris v Azadani</span> [1995] 1 WLR 1372 demonstrate that, although the court must be careful not to impose an injunction in wider terms than are necessary to do justice, the court is entitled to restrain conduct that is not in itself tortious or otherwise unlawful if it is satisfied that such a restriction is necessary in order to afford effective protection to the rights of the claimant in the particular case.  In both those cases the injunction was granted against a named person or persons.  What, if any, difference it makes in this regard that the injunction is sought against unknown persons is a question which does not need to be decided on the present appeal but which may, as I understand, arise on a pending appeal from the decision of Nicklin J in <span style="font-style:italic">Canada Goose UK Retail Ltd v Persons Unknown</span> [2019] EWHC 2459 (QB); and in these circumstances I express no opinion on the point.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In the <span style="font-style:italic">Ineos</span> case the judge had proceeded on the basis that the evidence adduced by the claimants of protests against other companies engaged in fracking (including Cuadrilla) would, if accepted at trial, be sufficient to show a real and imminent threat of trespass on the claimants’ land, interference with the claimants’ rights of passage to and from their land and interference with their supply chain.  On that basis he granted an injunction in similar – although in some respects wider and more vaguely worded – terms to the Injunction granted in the present case.  The Court of Appeal allowed an appeal brought by two individuals who objected to the order made on the ground that the judge’s approach – which simply accepted the claimants’ evidence at face value – did not adequately justify granting a <span style="font-style:italic">quia timet</span> injunction which might affect the exercise of the right to freedom of expression, as it did not satisfy the requirement in section 12(3) of the Human Rights Act 1998 that the applicant is “likely” to establish at trial that such an injunction should be granted.  The Court of Appeal also held that the parts of the injunction seeking to restrain future acts which would amount to an actionable nuisance or a conspiracy to cause loss by unlawful means should be discharged in any event, as the relevant terms were too widely drafted and lacked the necessary degree of certainty.  I will come back to one aspect of the reasoning on that point when discussing the first ground of appeal.  </p>

Another is that a term may be vague in so far as there are borderline cases to which it is inherently uncertain whether the term applies.  Except where quantitative measurements can be used, some degree of imprecision is inevitable.  But the wording of an injunction is unacceptably vague to the extent that there is no way of telling with confidence what will count as falling within its scope and what will not.

Where legal knowledge is needed to understand the effect of a term, its clarity will depend on whether the addressee of the injunction can be expected to obtain legal advice.  Such an expectation may be reasonable where an injunction is granted in the course of litigation in which each party is legally represented.  By contrast, in a case of the present kind where an injunction is granted against “persons unknown”, it is unreasonable to impose on members of the public the cost of consulting a lawyer in order to find out what the injunction does and does not prohibit them from doing. </p>

They are also relevant where an application is made to enforce compliance or punish breach of an injunction by seeking an order for committal.  In principle, people should not be at risk of being penalised for breach of a court order if they act in a way which the order does not clearly prohibit.  Hence a person should not be held to be in contempt of court if it is unclear whether their conduct is covered by the terms of the order.

Words which are clear enough in one factual situation may be unclear in another.  This can be illustrated by reference to the ground of appeal which was abandoned.  The argument advanced was that paragraph 2 of the Injunction was insufficiently clear to form the basis of a finding of contempt of court because the “PNR Land” was described by reference to a Land Registry map and such maps are, so it was said, only accurate to around one metre.  Assuming (which was in issue) that there is this margin of error, the objection that the relevant term of the Injunction was insufficiently clear would have been compelling in the absence of proof that Ms Lawrie </p>

In the judgment given on 28 June 2019 in which he made findings of contempt of court, the judge referred to the maxim that a person “is presumed to intend the natural and probable consequences of his acts”, citing a passage from the speech of Lord Bridge in <span style="font-style:italic">R v Maloney</span> [1985] AC 905, 928-9.  Ms Brimelow submitted that a person with no legal knowledge or training would not understand that, even if they do not have in mind a particular consequence of their action, they will be held to intend any natural and probable consequence of it.  Such a person might reasonably consider that their intention was, for example, to prevent fracking, or to protect the environment, or to protest, rather than, say, to cause inconvenience and delay to Cuadrilla, even if such inconvenience and delay was a natural or probable consequence of what they did. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">This was the point that Lord Bridge was making in the <span style="font-style:italic">Maloney</span> case in the passage to which HHJ Pelling QC referred.  The House of Lords made it clear in that case that juries should no longer, save in rare cases, be given legal directions as to what is meant by intention.  Lord Bridge described it (at 926) as the “golden rule” that, when directing a jury on intent, a judge should avoid any elaboration or paraphrase of what is meant by intent and should leave it to the jury’s good sense to decide whether the person accused acted with the intention required to be guilty of a crime.  Just as no elaboration of the concept of intention is required for juries, so equally its meaning does not need to be explained to members of the public to whom a court order is addressed.  It is not a technical term nor one that, when used in an injunction prohibiting acts done with a specific intention, is to be understood in any special or unusual sense.  It is an ordinary English word to be given its ordinary meaning and with which anyone who read the Injunction would be perfectly familiar.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">That is not to say that proof of an intention is always straightforward.  Often it causes no difficulty.  A person’s immediate intention may be obvious from their actions.  Thus, when the appellants and three others lay across the Site Entrance on 24 July 2018 in pairs linked by arm tube devices, it was obvious that they were intending to stop vehicles from entering or leaving the site.  Had that not been their intention, they would not have positioned themselves where they did.  Similarly, when in the incident on 3 August 2018 Ms Lawrie stood in the road in front of a lorry, waving her arms, there could be no doubt that her intention was to cause the vehicle to stop.  To determine whether less direct consequences or potential consequences of a person’s actions are intended may require further knowledge of, or inference as to, their plans or goals.  In so far as there is evidential uncertainty, however, a person alleged to be in contempt of court by disobeying an injunction is protected by the requirement that the relevant facts must be proved to the criminal standard of proof.  Hence where the injunction prohibits an act done with a particular intention, if there is any reasonable doubt about whether the defendant acted with that intention, contempt of court will not be established. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In deciding what sanction to impose for a contempt of court, a judge has to assess and weigh a number of different factors.  The law recognises that a decision of this nature involves an exercise of judgment which is best made by the judge who deals with the case at first instance and with which an appeal court should be slow to interfere.  It will generally do so only if the judge: (i) made an error of principle; (ii) took into account immaterial factors or failed to take into account material factors; or (iii) reached a decision which was outside the range of decisions reasonably open to the judge.  It follows that there is limited scope for challenging on an appeal a sanction imposed for contempt of court as being excessive (or unduly lenient).  If, however, the appeal court is satisfied that the decision of the lower court was wrong on one of the above grounds, it will reverse the decision and either substitute its own decision or remit the case to the judge for further consideration of sanction.

First, it is argued that the judge made an error of principle and/or failed to take into account a material factor in treating as irrelevant the fact that, when they disobeyed the Injunction, the appellants were exercising rights of protest which are protected by the common law and by articles 10 and 11 of the Human Rights Convention.  Secondly, it is argued that, in having regard (as the judge did) to the guideline issued by the Sentencing Council which applies to sentencing in criminal cases for breach of a criminal behaviour order, the judge misapplied that guideline and, in consequence, reached a decision that was unduly harsh. </p>

It is the mark of a civilised community that it can accommodate protests and demonstrations of this kind.  But there are conventions which are generally accepted by the law-breakers on one side and the law-enforcers on the other.  The protesters behave with a sense of proportion and do not cause excessive damage or inconvenience.  And they vouch the sincerity of their beliefs by accepting the penalties imposed by the law.

After quoting the statement that intentional disruption of activities of others is not “at the core” of the freedom protected by article 11 of the Convention (see paragraph 44 above), the Divisional Court identified one reason for this as being that the essence of the rights of peaceful assembly and freedom of expression is the opportunity to persuade others (see para 53 of the judgment).

It is notable that in the <span style="font-style:italic">Kudrevičius</span> case and in the earlier cases there cited in which custodial sentences were held by the European Court to be a proportionate restriction on the rights of protestors, in all but one instance the sentence imposed was a suspended sentence.

Where these conditions are met, such acts represent a form of political protest, both in the sense that they are guided by principles of justice or social good and in the sense that they are addressed to other members of the community or those who hold power within it.  The public nature of the act – in contrast to the actions of other law-breakers who generally seek to avoid detection – is a demonstration of the protestor’s sincerity and willingness to accept the legal consequences of their actions.  It is also essential to characterising the act as a form of political communication or address.  Eschewing violence and showing some measure of moderation in the level of harm intended again signal that, although the means of protest adopted transgress the law, the protestor is engaged in a form of political action undertaken on moral grounds rather than in mere criminality.    </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">It seems to me that there are at least three reasons for showing greater clemency in response to such acts of civil disobedience than in dealing with other disobedience of the law.  First, by adhering to the conditions mentioned, a person who engages in acts of civil disobedience establishes a moral difference between herself and ordinary lawbreakers which it is right to take into account in determining what punishment is deserved.  Second, by reason of that difference and the fact that such a protestor is generally – apart from their protest activity – a law-abiding citizen, there is reason to expect that less severe punishment is necessary to deter such a person from further lawbreaking.  Third, part of the purpose of imposing sanctions, whether for a criminal offence or for intentional breach of an injunction, is to engage in a dialogue with the defendant so that he or she appreciates the reasons why in a democratic society it is the duty of responsible citizens to obey the law and respect the rights of others, even where the law or other people’s lawful activities are contrary to the protestor’s own moral convictions.  Such a dialogue is more likely to be effective where authorities (including judicial authorities) show restraint in anticipation that the defendant will respond by desisting from further breaches.  This is part of what I believe Lord Burnett CJ meant in the <span style="font-style:italic">Roberts</span> case at para 34 (quoted above) when he referred to “a bargain or mutual understanding operating in such cases”. </p>

Of course, if the defendant does not comply with that condition, he or she must expect that the order for imprisonment will be implemented. </p>

The latter aim is specifically identified in article 10(2) as a purpose capable of justifying restrictions on the exercise of freedom of expression.

As the court noted, however, the guideline does not apply to proceedings for committal.   There is therefore no obligation on a judge to follow the guideline in such proceedings and I do not consider that, if a judge does not have regard to it, this can be said to be an error of law.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">A further material difference is that, in proceedings for contempt of court, a community order is not available as a lesser alternative to the sanction of imprisonment.  There may therefore be cases where, although the sentencing guideline for breach offences might suggest that a community order would be an appropriate sentence, it is necessary to punish a contempt of court by an order for imprisonment because the contempt is so serious that neither of the only alternative sanctions of a fine and/or an order for costs could be justified.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In relation to the first incident on 24 July 2018 involving all three appellants, there is no basis for saying that the judge’s assessment of culpability and harm by reference to the sentencing guideline for breach offences, or his decision on sanction in the light of that assessment, was wrong on any of the grounds listed in paragraph 85 above.  The judge was right to start from the position that a deliberate breach of a court order is itself a serious matter.  He was entitled, as he also did, to treat the appellants’ culpability as aggravated by the element of planning involved in their use of lock-on devices and to take account of (i) the number of hours of disruption and delay caused by their conduct, (ii) evidence that the incident caused Cuadrilla additional (and irrecoverable) costs of around £1,000, and (iii) the fact that the incident only ended when police were deployed to cut through the arm lock devices and remove the appellants.  It was also relevant that the appellants expressed no remorse and gave no indication that they would not commit further breaches of the Injunction.  Nor were they entitled to any credit for admitting their contempt, as they declined to do so, thereby necessitating a trial at which evidence had to be called. </p>

As it is, it cannot be said that the judge’s decision to impose suspended terms of imprisonment of four weeks was wrong in principle or outside the range of decisions reasonably open to him. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In relation to the second incident on 3 August 2018 involving Ms Lawrie alone, somewhat different considerations apply.  Although Ms Lawrie’s action in standing in the path of a lorry to try to stop it was also found to be a deliberate breach of the court’s order, there was no evidence of planning and the incident was far shorter in duration lasting only a few seconds.  In assessing the harm caused or risked by Ms Lawrie’s breach of the Injunction, the judge emphasised the danger of injury or death to which </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">her action had exposed Ms Lawrie herself, the driver of the lorry and other road-users.  However, as David Richards LJ pointed out in the course of argument, in approaching the matter in this way the judge seems to have lost sight of the fact that the purpose of paragraph 7 of the Injunction, which he was punishing Ms Lawrie for disobeying, was not to protect the safety of road-users but was to protect Cuadrilla from suffering economic loss as a result of conspiracy to disrupt its supply chain by unlawful means.  In assessing the seriousness of the breach, the judge should have focused on the extent to which the breach caused, or was intended to cause or risked causing, harm of the kind which the relevant term of the Injunction was intended to prevent.  Had he done this, the judge would have been bound to conclude not only that no harm was actually caused but that the amount of economic loss intended or threatened by delaying a lorry on its way to collect rainwater from the site was slight. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The judge was, I consider, entitled to take into account as aggravating Ms Lawrie’s culpability the nature of the unlawful means used and the fact that, on his findings, it amounted not merely to a public nuisance through obstruction of the highway but to an offence of causing danger to road-users contrary to section 22A of the Road Traffic Act 1988.  To be guilty of an offence under that statutory provision, it is not necessary that the person concerned should have intended to cause, or realised that they were causing, danger to life or limb, and the judge made no such finding in relation to Ms Lawrie.  It is sufficient that it would be obvious to a reasonable person that their action would be dangerous – a matter of which the judge was clearly satisfied on the evidence. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Ms Lawrie was not prosecuted, however, and the judge was not sentencing her for a criminal offence under the Road Traffic Act.  In the circumstances, giving all due weight to the nature of the unlawful means used, the fact that this was Ms Lawrie’s second deliberate breach of the Injunction and her complete lack of contrition, I do not consider that the term of imprisonment of two months which the judge imposed was justified.  In my judgment, although the judge was right to conclude that the custody threshold was crossed, the appropriate penalty for this contempt of court was the same as that imposed for the earlier contempt committed by all three appellants – that is, a suspended term of imprisonment of four weeks. </p>

The courts attach great weight to the right of peaceful protest, even where this causes disruption to others; but it is also important for the rule of law that deliberate breaches of court orders attract a real penalty, and I can see nothing wrong in principle in the judge's conclusion that the appellants' conduct here merited a custodial sentence, albeit suspended. </p>
