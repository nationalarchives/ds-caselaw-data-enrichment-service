	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.00in">The appellant local authority, Nottinghamshire County Council, appeals an order made by Upper Tribunal Judge Wright on 13 August 2019 which upheld a decision of the deputy President of the FtT, Health Education and Social Care Chamber, Judge Tudur, sitting with two specialist members, which was made on 10 December 2018.  The proceedings concern the special educational needs and disability jurisdiction of that tribunal.  The core question is whether the tribunals wrongly construed the meaning of ‘necessary’ in section 37(1) of the Children and Families Act 2014 [‘CFA 2014’]. Although the appeal is pursued as a question of law, the answer in this particular case is a question of fact. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.00in">The error of law that is said to have been made concerned the FtT’s decision that it was necessary for special educational provision to be made for a child known in the proceedings as ‘HD’.  That had the effect that the local authority was obliged to make special educational provision for HD in accordance with an Education Health and Care Plan [‘the EHC plan’] formerly known as a ‘Statement of Special Educational Needs’.  The circumstancse that gave rise to the question are said to arise out of agreed facts, namely that HD’s school had successfully identified his needs and was meeting them and that HD was making progress at the school. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.00in">By section 66 CFA 2014, children who do not have an EHC plan are owed a statutory duty by the governing body of their school to use its “best endeavours” to secure the special educational provision that they need. This duty is not absolute so that resource constraints may be taken into account. By contrast, children with an EHC plan are owed an absolute duty by the Local authority to make the provision specified in the EHC plan. Resource constraints are irrelevant once special educational provision has been identified in the EHC plan. By section 37(1) CFA 2014, an EHC plan will only be made for a child if it is necessary for special educational provision to be made in accordance with an EHC plan.  A decision not to make an EHC plan can be appealed to the FtT but the tribunal has no jurisdiction in relation to section 66 arrangements. </p>

To say otherwise, they submit, would be to go against the fact that most children being given special educational provision do not have an EHC plan. Further, they submit, it would go against the Code of Practice issued to schools and local authorities in relation to children with special educational needs, which at para 9.55 provides that “a local authority should only consider what further provision may be needed” if “despite appropriate assessment and provision, the child or young person is not progressing, or not progressing sufficiently well”. </p>

Rather, “special educational provision” is defined in the CFA 2014 comparatively by reference to educational provision generally available for a child of the same age in mainstream schools in England, i.e. nationally. If the special educational provision made by HD’s school is not educational provision that would be made generally for children of HD’s age in mainstream schools in England, then the FtT is entitled to find that it was necessary for an EHC plan to be made for that child. As to the Code of Practice, the parents submit that the Code of Practice is not binding on the tribunal or this court.  </p>

It says nothing about the adequacy of provision or progress.  Both are relevant considerations but neither is exclusive of other considerations that may be relevant on the facts and which may arise, for example, out of the statutory assessment.  The range of likelihoods and risks that the statutory scheme has to provide for is as broad as the factual circumstances that give rise to them.  It is entirely possible that the fact that an existing  school is able to make special educational provision where others would not, may be relevant to the likelihood that over time resources may impact on that provision or that a change to a different school or the change to teaching and support resources may lead to different provision in the absence of an EHC plan.  Greater divergence from the national norm may increase the likelihood of the breakdown of provision. Judge Wright had regard to this at [16] in the Upper Tribunal when he commented that the evaluative judgement of a specialist tribunal had to look <span style="font-style:italic">at the extent to which</span> the provision made differed from that made nationally.  Where, as in HD’s case, the school is providing more than would be expected nationally, there may be a real risk that as the child’s needs become even more complex, the school will find itself at the end of its ability or resources to meet them without an EHC plan.   </p>

HD had been experiencing anxiety at school for the first time and was under investigation for another diagnosis in what was already a complex situation.  He required constant monitoring and adaptation and according to the tool used to demonstrate these matters, the provision map, the school was not resourced for that.  The provision map is a tool designed to help Special Education Need Coordinators [SENCOs] as part of their recording function that is described in para 6.76 of the Code of Practice.  The Code of Practice is neither binding nor intended to be exhaustive.  The flexibility of the statutory scheme should not be limited only to those situations described in the Code of Practice.  Furthermore, the review and re-assessment provisions do not address the reality of the impact on parents and children of those processes and the time that they can take which will sometimes, as it did in this case, extend beyond statutory time limits. </p>

No-one seriously questioned the conclusions of the Upper Tribunal in the cases to which I made reference in paragraphs [20] to [27] above, with which I respectfully agree.  Necessary is a word in common use and its plain meaning has caused no difficulty in the tribunal.  The function of the FtT in these cases is to find facts and to exercise an evaluative judgment by using its specialist expertise about whether an EHC plan is necessary.  That is a deduction from the facts and it will depend on the nature and extent of the provision required for the child concerned.  It is a fact specific conclusion. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.00in">It is equally not in issue that the provision that is made for the child has to be compared with that which is available nationally in mainstream education.  That is the effect of section 21(1).  The tests to be applied by the tribunal are not constrained.  The wording of the statutory scheme encompasses both the circumstances suggested by the local authority (for example in their reliance on the Code of Practice) and those suggested by the parents and no doubt other circumstances that may arise out of different fact specific contexts.  An EHC plan is necessarily prospective and to that extent a prediction based on the skill and expertise of the decision maker. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.00in">Focusing on the question that remains, it is whether the value judgment of the FtT in this case is wrong.  Given that there is no challenge to the findings of fact, that question is in this case limited to whether a reasonable tribunal properly directed could conclude that an EHC plan is necessary on the facts of this case.  It is apt to recollect that the test formulated by the Supreme Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Re B (a child) (care order: proportionality: criterion for review) </span>[2013] UKSC 33, [2013] 2 FLR 1075<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>in relation to family proceedings is just as applicable to tribunal proceedings.  At [53] in the judgment of Lord Neuberger PSC the principle is described in the following way: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.00in">Given that (i) and (ii) would be a challenge to the facts, this court would only be entitled to interfere on (iii). That manifestly cannot be a successful argument. The local authority came close to conceding as such when they submitted that this was not a perversity appeal.  The FtT cited the relevant legislation and case law, it made findings of fact and it used its specialist experience to come to the conclusion that in HD’s case there was sufficient reason for an EHC plan to be necessary. It reasoned its conclusion. The elements identified may well have been marginal and another court or tribunal may have come to a different judgment on the facts but that is not a sufficient reason for this court to interfere on a second appeal. </p>
