Asturion’s claim was struck out by Deputy Master Cousins (“the Master”) on the ground that Asturion had abused the process of the court by “warehousing” its claim, that is to say, unilaterally placing the proceedings on hold for a substantial period of time without either the agreement of Ms Alibrahim or an order of the court. His Honour Judge David Cooke sitting as a Judge of the High Court (“the Judge”) allowed an appeal against that decision by Asturion. Ms Alibrahim now appeals to this Court with permission granted by Asplin LJ. The appeal raises an issue of principle as to what amounts to an abuse of process in this context. </p>

It is said by Asturion that Ms Alibrahim knew or ought to have known of these alleged irregularities by reason of her alleged knowledge of Shari’a law.

Through an oversight on the part of the court, however, the court did not either make an order embodying those directions or list a case management conference (“CMC”). This oversight was fatal to the court’s ability to exercise active case management in respect of this claim, as is required by the Civil Procedure Rules (“CPR”). Moreover, it meant that neither party was subject to any deadline embodied in a court order for taking the subsequent steps in the proceedings. It is clear that this was a significant factor in what happened (or did not happen) subsequently. </p>

For the most part, the history of these proceedings does not matter for present purposes. The one point which is of some relevance is that on 5 September 2016 Ms Alibrahim applied for a statement of nullity in respect of Asturion’s claim in France on the basis that its representative had not been properly authorised by Asturion’s board to file the claim and, in the alternative, claimed that the board’s lack of authority meant that the proceedings should be stayed pending the outcome of her Liechtenstein proceedings. In its written submissions, Asturion opposed both these applications on the basis that its representative did not lack authority and the stay proposed was moot, as the Liechtenstein proceedings would not affect the position in France. Nevertheless, Asturion indicated to the judge in charge of the French proceedings that it would be happy to postpone the French proceedings for a couple of months pending the Liechtenstein proceedings, as this would make the situation more straightforward, and asked for a longer period of time for written submissions so as to give the Liechtenstein Supreme Court time to make its judgment before the French Court had to rule on Ms Alibrahim’s application for a statement of nullity.  </p>

He submitted that it was necessary to distinguish between four classes of case. The first was where the claimant had no intention ever to pursue the claim to trial (or other proper resolution, such as a settlement). The second class was where the claimant had no current intention to pursue the claim, but might pursue it in the future depending on contingencies which were extraneous to the claim (such as the claimant’s pursuit of other claims against other defendants). The third class was where the claimant always intended to pursue the claim, but decided temporarily to pause its progress for reasons legitimately connected with the claim. The fourth class was where the claimant always intended to pursue the claim, but failed to do so through incompetence (whether the claimant’s or its lawyers’). He submitted that the first and second classes of case would generally constitute abuse of process, but not the third and fourth. He further submitted that the present case fell into the third class. </p>

The claim was struck out for alleged noncompliance by the lenders with an unless order for discovery even though the lenders had served in time a list of documents listing over 2,500 documents. Unsurprisingly, the Court of Appeal allowed the lenders’ appeal. The valuers had also applied to strike out the claim as an abuse of process, but the judge had dismissed that application and this was the subject of a cross-appeal. The valuers argued that there was an abuse of process because the lenders had taken a deliberate decision not to pursue the litigation, and to ignore the timetable laid down by the court in an order dated 24 July 1996 which was designed to lead to a trial which was later fixed for 2 June 1998. The lenders had taken no step after that order until they served a notice of intention to proceed on 21 November 1997. The lenders’ evidence was to the effect that the reasons for the delay were, first, a concern as to the valuers’ professional indemnity insurance, secondly, the fact that the valuers were placed into administrative receivership on 28 January 1997, and thirdly, the failure of the administrative receivers to respond to a query about the insurance position at a creditors’ meeting on 14 May 1997. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In <span style="font-style:italic">Braunstein v Mostafazan</span> (unreported, 12 April 2000) the plaintiff was a solicitor who claimed for fees for work done for the defendant. The defendant denied that the plaintiff had acted as its solicitor. The writ was issued on 8 October 1992. After service of Further and Better Particulars of the Defence in November 1995, the plaintiff took no steps until service of notice of intention to proceed on 8 April 1997. The plaintiff’s evidence was that, during this period, he was negotiating a settlement with a Mr Jafari who he believed was acting on behalf of the defendant, although it subsequently transpired that Mr Jafari was not, and Mr Jafari had told him on several occasions that the defendant had requested that the action should not be progressed whilst negotiations were continuing. </p>

This contention was based on what Harrison J described at [26] as “the deliberate decision of the plaintiff to put his action on ice, or to ‘warehouse’ the proceedings, from mid-1995 to April 1997” while negotiating with Mr Jafari. </p>

The length of time for which the negotiations were carried on by the plaintiff without progressing the action from mid-1995 to April 1997 was less than half the time involved in the case of <span style="font-style:italic">Cooperative Retail Services Ltd v Guardian Assurance plc</span>, and the overall period of inordinate and inexcusable delay in that case was 5 years and 5 months compared to the period of 3½   years in this case. Furthermore, it is implicit in the findings of the judge that the plaintiff believed that Mr Jafari was acting on behalf of the defendant, albeit that he can quite properly be criticised for failing to check the authenticity of Mr Jafari's authority to negotiate, either with the defendant or with the defendant's solicitor. Looking at the matter in the round, however, I do not consider that, as a matter of fact and degree, this is a case where it can be said that the plaintiff's conduct was such as to amount to an abuse of process so that it should be struck out without prejudice having to be shown.” </p>

It depends on the reason why the claimant decided to put the proceedings on hold, and on the strength of that reason, objectively considered, having regard to the length of the period in question. A claimant who wishes to obtain a stay of proceedings for a period of time should seek the defendant’s consent or, failing that, apply to the court; but it is not the law that a failure to obtain the consent of the other party or the approval of the court to putting the claim on hold automatically renders the claimant’s conduct abusive no matter how good its reason may be or the length of the delay. </p>

The authority which comes closest to supporting the contention advanced by counsel for Ms Alibrahim is <span style="font-style:italic">Société Générale v Goldas Kuyumculuk Sanayi </span>[2017] EWHC 667 (Comm), in which Popplewell J (as he then was) held that the claimant’s conduct was an abuse of process for three reasons, one of which was that it had decided to recover the sums it claimed were due from the defendants not in the English proceedings, but in proceedings in Turkey, leading to a delay of some eight years which was only brought to an end by the defendants’ strike out applications. In that context (which is unaffected by the subsequent decision of the Court of Appeal [2018] EWCA Civ 1903, [2019] 1 WLR 346) Popplewell J stated at [63]: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Finally on the law, I should address a more minor dispute between the parties. Counsel for Ms Alibrahim suggested that an application to strike out on the ground of abuse of process by “warehousing” fell to be analysed in three stages. The first stage was to consider whether the claimant’s conduct was an abuse of process. The second stage, if an abuse of process was found, was to consider whether the abuse was sufficiently serious to entitle the court to strike out the claim. The third stage, if the abuse was sufficiently serious, was for the court to exercise its discretion as to whether in all the circumstances striking out was the appropriate remedy. In the course of argument, however, he accepted that an alternative view was that there were only two stages to the analysis: first, the court should determine whether the claimant’s conduct was an abuse of process; and if so, secondly, the court should exercise its discretion as to whether to strike out the claim. Counsel for Asturion supported a two-stage analysis. In my judgment the better reading of the authorities is that the analysis falls into two stages, and not three. Furthermore, this is supported by the structure of CPR rule 3.4(2)(b), which provides that the court “may” strike out a statement of case if it “is an abuse of the court’s process” (it is perhaps worth noting </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In my judgment it is clear from the Master’s reasons that he did misdirect himself as to the law in three linked respects. The first is that in [36(1)] he held that Asturion’s unilateral decision not to pursue the claim during the period between 24 November 2016 and 15 August 2017 amounted to an abuse of process without at that stage considering the reason for that decision or the strength of that reason objectively considered. Nor indeed did he consider the length of the delay at that stage. Thus he proceeded on the basis that any decision by a claimant unilaterally to put proceedings on hold for a significant period of time is <span style="font-style:italic">ipso facto</span> an abuse of process. For the reasons explained above, that is not the law.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The second respect is that, when he did come to consider the reason at [36(8)], he appears only to have done so for the purposes of exercising his discretion as to whether to strike the claim out. Although this is a factual rather than a legal matter, it is convenient to add at this point that he also mischaracterised the reason. Asturion did not suggest that “the Defendant was somehow at fault in issuing the proceedings in Liechtenstein”. Asturion’s explanation for its conduct was that (a) if Ms Alibrahim’s case in Liechtenstein was well founded, then it necessarily followed that Asturion had no authority to pursue this claim, (b) it was Ms Alibrahim’s own position in the Liechtenstein proceedings that Asturion should not be wasting large sums of money in the pursuit of this claim and (c) in those circumstances Asturion had assumed that she would be content for it not to pursue the claim for the moment. </p>

Asturion also attacks this as a finding by the Master that Asturion had no intention ever to bring its claim to trial which was not open to him on the evidence, but, like the Judge, I do not consider that the Master made any such finding. Rather, the Master treated the two types of case as being the same, which is legally erroneous. As I understand it, this is the point which the Judge made at [67].   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The secondary basis upon which the Judge held that he was entitled to intervene was on Asturion’s grounds three and four. The Judge held that the Master’s exercise of his discretion was flawed for two reasons, one of which I have addressed in the preceding paragraph. The other point which the Judge relied upon was that in [36(4), (5) and (6)] the Master had taken into account, when exercising his discretion, Asturion’s failure to provide information about its assets. Indeed, it can be seen from the passage I have quoted from the Master’s judgment on consequentials that he considered that this weighed “strongly” in the balance. The Judge held that this was irrelevant to the question of whether, even if it was an abuse of process, Asturion’s conduct in putting the proceedings on hold for 10 months warranted striking out the claim. I agree with the Judge on this point. Asturion was not obliged to disclose any information about its assets, although its failure to do so might well have assisted Ms Alibrahim to obtain an order for security for costs: see <span style="font-style:italic">Sarpd Oil International Ltd v Addax Energy SA </span>[2016] EWCA Civ 201, [2016] CP Rep 24<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>at [19]. Moreover, Asturion’s failure to provide such information has nothing to do with the alleged abuse of process. Furthermore, the Master failed to recognise that it took Ms Alibrahim a long time to make her threatened application for security or that, when she did so, Asturion agreed to provide security. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It is convenient next to deal with three additional matters relied upon by Asturion in this Court by way of respondent’s notice. First, Asturion contends that the Master was wrong to find that Asturion unilaterally decided not to pursue this claim pending the outcome of the Liechtenstein proceedings unless Ms Alibrahim pressed it to do so and that the Judge was wrong to hold that the Master was entitled to make that finding. Counsel for Asturion did not press this point. In any event, in my judgment the Master was fully entitled to draw that inference from what Asturion’s solicitors said in their letter dated 23 August 2017 and from Mr Shear’s evidence. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Secondly, Asturion contends that the Master was wrong, when exercising his discretion as to whether to strike out the claim, to take into account Asturion’s service of the Notice and its effect. Asturion argues that he should not have done so, because it merely prevented transfers of the Property and there was no evidence from Ms Alibrahim that it had inhibited any dealings in the Property by her. I do not accept this argument. In my judgment the Master was entitled to take the Notice into account. It was a relevant consideration because it inhibited Ms Alibrahim’s freedom to deal with the Property while the claim was pending. Given that the pendency of the claim was increased by Asturion’s unilateral decision not to pursue it for a period, her freedom was inhibited for a longer period. The weight to give this factor was a matter for the Master, but in any event there is nothing to suggest that the Master gave this factor undue weight. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Thirdly, Asturion contends that in [36(2)] the Master wrongly treated Asturion as having been solely responsible for the claim having made “virtually no progress” for “almost 2½ years”. I accept this point. In my view the procedural history demonstrates that both parties were slow to progress the claim down to 24 November 2016. Moreover, the Master failed to take into account the court’s oversight in failing either to make an order for directions or to list the CMC. He also ignored the fact that it took Ms Alibrahim 3½ months from 23 August 2017 to issue her strike out application.   </p>

The Judge’s assessment, in brief summary, was that Asturion’s reason for not pursuing the claim for 10 months was an objectively reasonable one, namely that the authority of the board of Asturion to bring the proceedings was under attack by Ms Alibrahim in Liechtenstein and in that context she had complained about the costs being incurred by Asturion in these proceedings. In my view that was an evaluative assessment which the Judge was fully entitled to make. As has been emphasised in a number of decisions now, Asturion should not have proceeded unilaterally. It should have sought Ms Alibrahim’s consent to a stay and, in the absence of consent, applied to the court. (If it had done so, it would have been very likely to succeed in obtaining a stay.) Nevertheless, the fact that Asturion did not take the proper course does not, in the circumstances of this case, necessarily lead to the conclusion that its conduct was an abuse of process. </p>

The Judge held that, even if there was an abuse, it was of a relatively minor nature and did not justify the sanction of striking out. In my judgment the Judge was fully entitled to take that view. Although neither the Master nor the Judge gave any detailed consideration to alternatives to striking out, there were lesser sanctions available to the court which were more proportionate to the abuse, if abuse there had been. For example, the court could have imposed tight directions to trial, including unless orders against Asturion, and it could have imposed a costs sanction. Striking out was a disproportionate response. </p>
