	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The Attorney General appeals from the decision of Williams J to pronounce a decree nisi of nullity.  The ceremony which he determined entitled the Petitioner to a decree took place at a restaurant in London on 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 1998 (“the December 1998 ceremony”).  It was an Islamic marriage ceremony, a Nikah, which the parties knew was of no legal effect and which they intended would be followed by a civil marriage ceremony compliant with English law. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The judge rejected the submission advanced on behalf of the Petitioner that the presumption in favour of marriage applied in this case because, as explained below, he rejected her evidential case that the court could presume that a second ceremony of marriage had taken place in Dubai when the parties were living there.  As no party sought to argue that the December 1998 ceremony had created a valid marriage under English law, the judge said, at [6], that this left the issue of whether it created “what has become termed a non-marriage”, or alternatively a void marriage which entitled the Petitioner to a decree of nullity under s. 11 of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 (“the 1973 Act”).   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">As to the former, a non-marriage, the judge said, at [52], that it was “beyond argument that the concept of a form of marriage which was neither valid according to English law nor void has been accepted by the courts in … 11 cases … spanning a period of some 50 years”.  He decided, however, that the current approach, as applied in those cases, to the question “of whether what the parties did can properly be evaluated as an attempt to comply with the formalities required in English law to create a valid marriage”, and was therefore “a ceremony within the scope of the” legislation, must “be supplemented” by his “conclusions in relation to some of the human rights arguments” which had been advanced on behalf of the Petitioner: see the judgment at [56], [92(a)] and [93].  He said, at [94] and [94(a)], that this required an approach which was “more flexible in particular to reflect the Article 8 rights of the parties and the children”, and justified the court taking “a holistic view of a process rather than a single ceremony”.

	    <p style="text-align:left;margin-right:-0.01in;text-indent:0.00in">“more flexible interpretation of s.11” of the 1973 Act, Williams J decided, at [96], that the December 1998 ceremony came within the scope of that section so as to entitle the Petitioner to a decree of nullity.  It was “a marriage entered into in disregard of certain requirements as to the formation of marriage” and therefore void under s. 11(a)(iii). </p>

The status of marriage creates a variety of rights and obligations.

It is, therefore, of considerable importance that when parties decide to marry in England and Wales that they, and the state, know whether what they have done creates a marriage which is recognised as legally valid.

The Law Commission is currently conducting a review of the law governing how and where couples can marry, announced in July 2019, having concluded in <span style="font-style:italic">Getting Married, A Scoping Paper</span>, December 2015 (“<span style="font-style:italic">The Scoping Paper</span>”), at [1.33], that there was a need for law reform for a number of reasons including “the perceived rise in religious-only marriages, that is marriages conducted in accordance with the rites of a particular religion but without legal status”.  The Law Commission said, at [1.35], that this was a “serious issue” because they “will usually be classified as a ‘non-marriage’ in English law [with the] result that the parties to it have no legal status, are not counted as married, and have no protection in the event of the relationship breaking down and no automatic rights if the other party dies”.  That this is a serious issue is supported by the submission we have heard on behalf of Southall Black Sisters that the “total non-recognition … operates to the detriment of women and children”.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Given the nature of the ceremony in the present case, we would emphasise that the above routes enable parties to have a religious ceremony of their choosing by taking the “route into marriage”, referred to in the quoted paragraph (3)(c) above.  Section 44 of the 1949 Act provides that a marriage in a registered building “may be solemnized … according to such form and ceremony as [the parties] may see fit to adopt”.  There are some additional formal requirements, in particular that the ceremony must take place in the presence of a registrar or an authorised person and two witnesses and that at “some part of the ceremony” the parties must state that they are legally free to marry and the “words of contract” (i.e. that they are marrying each other), as set out in ss. 44(3) or (3A).  The section makes clear, however, that the marriage ceremony can take any form, which would obviously include an Islamic religious ceremony.  An “authorised person” is a person authorised by the trustees or governing body of the registered building to be present at the solemnisation of marriages: ss. 43 or 43B.  In saying that it is not difficult, we recognise, as highlighted by <span style="font-style:italic">The Scoping Paper</span>, at p.49, and in the article <span style="font-style:italic">The Legal Treatment of Islamic Marriage Ceremonies</span>, at p.382, </p>

This is demonstrated by the existence of offences, now under the 1949 Act, which can be committed by those who solemnize a marriage (s. 75) and by authorised persons (s. 77) when they act contrary to certain of the required formalities.  Although, as explained below, these offences only apply to ceremonies of marriage within the scope of the 1949 Act, their existence emphasises the important role those responsible for ceremonies of marriage have in ensuring that the parties know the legal effect of the ceremony in which they are participating. </p>

The Imam had informed the Petitioner’s father that because the Nikah was not “registered” there would need to be a civil ceremony so that the marriage would be legally recognised.  The Petitioner was aware of this and, as set out in the judgment below, “was concerned that her rights were not protected … and told the (Respondent) that they would be treated as cohabitees”.

This meant that the issue of whether the court could grant a decree of nullity depended on whether what had taken place in this case amounted to a non-marriage or was a marriage which (as expressed by the judge at [94(a)]) “purports to be of the kind contemplated by the” 1949 Act and, therefore, “within section 11” of the 1973 Act.

In summary these were that: (a) “Unless a marriage purports to be of the kind contemplated by the [1949 Act] it will not be within section 11”; (b) “What brings a ceremony within the scope of the Act or at what stage the cumulative effect of the failures is to take the ceremony wholly outside the scope of the 1949 Act has to be approached on a case by case basis”; and (c) the court should take various factors into account.  We set out, in paragraph 27 below, the specific factors referred to by the judge, as adapted by him following his conclusions as to the effect of the “human rights arguments” advanced by the Petitioner. </p>

This meant, he said at [94(a)], that “[w]hen considering the question of a marriage the court should be able to take a holistic view of a process rather than a single ceremony”.

Hyams) v Kelly</span> (1932) 49 TLR 99, at p. 101.  Its importance as a matter of law derives from the significant legal rights and obligations it creates.  It engages both the private interests of the parties to the marriage and the interests of the state.  It is clearly in the private interests of the parties that they can prove that they are legally married and that they are, therefore, entitled to the rights consequent on their being married.  It is also in the interests of the state that the creation of the status is both clearly defined and protected.  The protection of the status of marriage includes such issues as forced marriages and “sham” marriages. </p>

This interest is reflected in the statutory system of regulation designed to ensure that both the parties and the state know what is necessary to contract and when a valid marriage has been contracted.  As referred to below, the statutory regulation of the prescribed formalities required to effect a valid marriage was first introduced in 1753 to create certainty in response to the difficulties being caused by what were known as “clandestine” marriages.  Certainty remains in the public interest because, as again identified in <span style="font-style:italic">The Scoping Paper</span>, at [1.2], “it should … be clear when [a marriage] has come into being”. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Upholding the status of marriage, where possible, is also a matter of public policy.  This can be seen, for example, from <span style="font-style:italic">Vervaeke (formerly Messina) v Smith</span> [1983] AC 145, in which it was held that the upholding of the status of marriage is a doctrine of English public policy law.  One of the issues in that case was the effect of the parties’ intentions, namely that they did not intend to live together as husband and wife, on the validity of the marriage.  The facts of that case were very different from the present case but they provide the context for some general observations made by Ormrod J (as he then was) at first instance which were quoted with approval by Lord Hailsham of St. Marylebone LC, at p. 151H – p. 152E, as being “a correct statement of English law”, as follows: </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:0.58in;text-indent:0.00in">"Where a man and a woman consent to marry one another in a formal ceremony, conducted in accordance with the formalities required by law, knowing that it is a marriage ceremony, it is immaterial that they do not intend to live together as man and wife.  It is, of course, quite otherwise where one of the parties believes that the ceremony is something different, e.g., a formal betrothal ceremony as in <span style="font-style:italic">Kelly (Orse. Hyams) v. Kelly</span> (1932) 49 T.L.R. 99 ... or as in <span style="font-style:italic">Mehta (Orse. Kohn) v. Mehta</span> [1945] 2 All E.R. 690, a ceremony of religious conversion.  In such cases the essence of marriage, the mutual exchange of consents accompanied by the formalities required by law, is missing and such marriages are, therefore, void or perhaps voidable.  On the other hand, if the parties exchange consents to marry with due formality, intending to acquire the status of married persons, it is immaterial that they intend the marriage to take effect in some limited way or that one or both of them may have been mistaken about or unaware of some of the incidents of the status which they have created.  To hold otherwise would impair the effect of the whole system of law regulating marriages in this country, and gravely diminish the value of the system of registration of marriages upon which so much depends in a modern community.  Lord Merrivale in <span style="font-style:italic">Kelly (Orse. Hyams) v. Kelly</span>, 49 T.L.R. 99, 101 said: 'In a country like ours, where the marriage status is of very great consequence and where the enforcement of the marriage laws is a matter of great public concern, it would be intolerable if the marriage of law could be played with by people who thought fit to go to a register office and subsequently, after some change of mind, to affirm that it was not a marriage because they did not so regard it.'  See also the observations of Hodson J. in <span style="font-style:italic">Way v. Way</span> [1950] P. 71, 79, approved by the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Kenward v. Kenward</span> [1961] P. 124, 133 and <span style="font-style:italic">Silver v. Silver</span> [1955] 2 All E.R. 614."

Williams J recorded, at [51], Mr Le Grice QC’s acknowledgement that “there is no residual inherent power in the High Court to grant a decree of nullity save under statute”.  Further, as set out above, s. 11(a)(iii) is clearly referring to non-compliance with those formalities which the 1949 Act expressly stipulates will make a marriage void.

They do not contain any provisions setting out when a ceremony will not be within the scope of the Act at all. It has long been recognised, however, that there must be some ceremonies or acts which do not create even a void marriage and which, therefore, do not entitle a party to a decree of nullity.  For example, in <span style="font-style:italic">Risk (otherwise Yerburgh) v Risk</span> [1951] P 50, Barnard J decided, at p. 53, that the court had no jurisdiction to grant a decree because, under English law, the marriage ceremony which had taken place in Egypt was “no marriage”.The circumstances of that case were very different in that the basis of the decision was that the marriage was polygamous, the law in respect of which has since changed, but the issue of principle is the same.

That is the natural meaning and scope of the word 'marriage' when used in this context.  Far from needing to use words of limitation or exclusion to limit 'marriage' to a valid or void marriage, Parliament would have needed to use express words of inclusion if it had intended to enlarge and include within the word 'marriage' even what is characterised here as a non-marriage.  That is particularly so in the case of a marriage which was actually contracted in England.  If the marriage relied upon is a ceremony which took place here but which was so irregular and altogether outside the scope of the Marriage Acts as not to be a marriage at all, not even a void one, then in my view it would require clear words from Parliament before it could fall within the scope of s </p>

That would clearly not be an acceptable dividing line especially as a marriage solemnized in approved premises can take any form (other than a religious service) the parties choose.  It would then, equally, be questioned why any such ceremony wherever performed should not also be included within the scope of the 1949 Act.  It would clearly not be acceptable to exclude such ceremonies and to give them a different legal effect to a religious ceremony for that reason alone.  The current legal position has been neatly summarised in <span style="font-style:italic">The Scoping Paper</span>, at [2.71], namely that: “Faced with the prospect of effectively deregulating marriage … the courts developed the concept of the ‘non-marriage’”. </p>

In summary, in some cases the extent of non-compliance with the formal requirements stipulated under the 1949 Act means that the manner in which the marriage has been “solemnized” (to use the word from the 1949 Act, including s. 29), is such that the parties have not intermarried <span style="font-style:italic">under</span> the provisions of Part III or, when relevant, <span style="font-style:italic">according</span> to the rites of the Church of England. </p>

This is for a number of reasons.  First, the Law Commission is conducting a comprehensive review of the law governing how and where couples can marry, which would seem likely to include consideration of this issue.  Secondly, we doubt whether it is possible or, indeed, sensible, to seek to delineate when the cumulative effect of the failure to comply with the required formalities will result in a non-qualifying ceremony and when it will result in a void marriage.  Rather, we would suggest that the focus of the parties who want to marry and of those officiating at a ceremony of marriage, should be on complying with the required formalities so that they can be confident that they have contracted a valid marriage.  Thirdly, although there may be ceremonies, such as in <span style="font-style:italic">A v A</span>, when the cumulative effect of compliance with the required formalities is to create a valid or, alternatively, a void marriage, we would not want to encourage parties who want to </p>

It should be reiterated in this regard that the essential object of Article 8 is to protect the individual against arbitrary interference by the public authorities. There may in addition be positive obligations inherent in effective “respect” for family life. In both contexts regard must be had to the fair balance that has to be struck between the competing interests of the individual and the community as a whole, and in both contexts the State is recognised as enjoying a certain margin of appreciation (see <span style="font-style:italic">Hokkanen v. Finland</span>, 23 September 1994, § 55, Series A no. 299-A). Furthermore, in the sphere of the State's planned economic, fiscal or social policy, on which opinions within a democratic society may reasonably differ widely, that margin is necessarily wider (see, <span style="font-style:italic">mutatis mutandis</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">James and Others</span>, cited above, § 46).

She and Ö.K. were able to live peacefully as a family, free from any interference with their family life by the domestic authorities. Thus, the fact that they opted for the religious form of marriage and did not contract a civil marriage did not entail any penalties – either administrative or criminal – such as to prevent the applicant from leading an effective family life for the purposes of Article 8.

For that reason the fact that the applicant does not have the status of heir, in accordance with the provisions of the Civil Code governing inheritance and with the domestic social security legislation, does not imply that there has been a breach of her rights under Article 8.” </p>

We would not agree, for the reasons outlined in this judgment,  if “intended to effect a legal marriage” was a reference by the judge to the parties’ expressed intention at the date of their Nikah also to go through a civil ceremony in due course, that any such intention would suffice to undermine the approach in<span style="font-style:italic"> Serife Yigit</span> and change the legal effect of what they in fact undertook<span style="font-style:italic">.</span>  Other than in the context of consent, mere intention cannot change the legal effect of a ceremony of marriage. </p>

As a consequence of looking, as the judge put it, at the matter from a “holistic view”, he found, at [95]-[96], the failure to have a civil ceremony amounted, not to a deliberate failure to attempt to comply with any of the necessary formalities required under the 1949 Act resulting in a non-marriage, but only a failure to comply with certain formalities under s. 11(a)(iii), allowing the court to hold that the marriage was void. </p>

The judge’s view, that Article 8 supports an interpretation and application in favour of a void rather than invalid marriage, depended upon the couple having “sought to effect” or having “intended” to effect a legal marriage.  The difficulty with the judge’s approach is that, as referred to above, at no time did the parties in fact seek to effect a legal marriage.  As there is no question of the couple having ever sought to effect a legal marriage, the judge has, instead, relied upon the continuum argument, namely the parties’ agreement at the date of the Nikah that they would have a civil ceremony at some future date with the intention to effect a legal marriage.  The judge’s analysis in this respect would also, again, fall foul of s. 1 of the 1970 Act. </p>

A marriage either is or is not void and either is or is not within the scope of the 1949 Act at the date of its alleged solemnization.  The determination of whether a marriage is void or not cannot, in our view, be wholly (or in part) dependent on future events, such as the intention to undertake another ceremony or whether there are children.  We return to this below but, putting it more broadly, it cannot be the case that the legal effect of a ceremony of marriage can depend on whether the parties have children either at the date of the ceremony or subsequently.  There is no basis, under Article 8 or by virtue of the impact of Article 3 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child 1990 (“UNCRC”), by which the legal effect of the same ceremony could be converted including from a non-marriage to a void marriage.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">With respect to the judge, we disagree.  In our view the decision before the court cannot properly be described as an action concerning children and we cannot see how it can be said that the best interests of a child can turn what was neither a void nor valid marriage, into a void or valid marriage. In our judgment, the action in question relates solely to the status of the adult applicant. </p>

The judge referred to the two different routes as being “of a quite different character”.  That is inevitable given that a claim under the 1973 Act is in relation to the freestanding claim made in the capacity of wife as well as in the capacity of mother, whereas a claim under Children Act 1989 is an application made on behalf of a child alone; each route however provides for all the same essential elements necessary in order properly to provide for that child. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">We have reached the clear conclusion that the December 1998 ceremony did not create a void marriage because it was a non-qualifying ceremony.  The parties were not marrying “under the provisions” of Part III of the 1949 Act.  The ceremony itself would have been permitted under s. 44 if it had been performed in a registered building,  but it was not. In addition, no notice had been given to the superintendent registrar, no certificates had been issued, and no registrar or authorised person was present at the ceremony.  It was not, therefore, a marriage within the scope of, in particular, the provisions of s. 26 of the 1949 Act.  We would also add that the parties knew that the ceremony had no legal effect and that they would need to undertake another ceremony which complied with the requirements of the 1949 Act if they were to be validly married.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">We also see no scope, as referred to above, for the nature and effect of a ceremony to change over time, other than in the case of a voidable marriage as expressly provided for by s. 12 of the 1973 Act.  Whether a ceremony created a valid marriage or a void marriage or was of no legal effect at all must be determined at the date of the ceremony.  It would make no sense for its legal effect to fluctuate depending, as was submitted by Mr Hale, on future events such as whether the parties did or did not have children.  There is no support for this approach to the determination of the legal effect of a ceremony either in our domestic legislation or in the ECHR or in any case to which we were referred.  Further, to adopt this approach would also fundamentally undermine the need for the parties and the state to know, as from the date of the ceremony, whether the parties are or are not validly married.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">We would agree, as Mr Hale submitted, that the formalities of marriage could be described as a “process”.  This does not justify, however, treating the civil ceremony which the parties intended to undertake as having in fact taking place.  It did not.  The effect of what happened cannot, in our view, depend on whether the parties might have agreed to undertake a further step or steps.  This might result in a party being married even when they had changed their mind part way through the process.  This proposed development of the law would also fundamentally undermine the manner in which the status of marriage is created and the necessary degree of certainty which underpins the required formalities.  In addition, as Mr Nagpal submitted, this would be inconsistent with the express abolition of the right to sue for breach of an agreement to marry by section 1 of the 1970 Act.   </p>
