In colloquial terms, he is a ticket tout. The tickets in question are usually subject to strict conditions which prohibit or restrict their transfer or onward sale, and typically provide that they will at all times remain the property of the issuing body. If such a ticket is sold on the black market in breach of the conditions, usually for a sum greatly in excess of its face value, the vendor is likely to incur various forms of civil liability in tort and/or contract. He may also expose himself to the risk of criminal proceedings, particularly if he has acted in concert with others. The purchaser of the ticket, meanwhile, has no valid right of entry to the event, his ticket is void and worthless in his hands, and he is at risk of being refused admission, or required to leave the premises, once the infringement has been detected. </p>

The claimants, and respondents to the appeal, are The All England Lawn Tennis Club (Championships) Limited (“AELTC”), which conducts the annual lawn tennis championships (“the Championships”) in the grounds at Church Road, Wimbledon, and The All England Lawn Tennis Ground PLC, which owns the grounds. I will refer to the respondents together as “Wimbledon”. </p>

Mr McKay appeared in person on that occasion, although (as I shall relate) there had been earlier hearings of the committal proceedings at which he had been given every opportunity to obtain legal representation, and he had indeed instructed a firm of solicitors which initially acted for him, but shortly before the hearing found itself unable to continue doing so. The Committal Order recited that the judge was satisfied that Mr McKay was guilty of contempt of court in failing to comply with sub-paragraphs 3(c)(i), (ii) and (iii) of Nicklin J’s order of 9 July 2019, and ordered him to be imprisoned for a term of 26 weeks. This sentence was, however, suspended until a further return date on 13 December 2019, in order to give Mr McKay a final opportunity to purge his contempt. The order expressly stated that, if he failed to purge his contempt, the suspension would be lifted on the return date. </p>

The order went on to provide that if a notice of appeal was filed before that deadline, together with a request that this court should deal with the appeal on an expedited basis, there should then be a further stay of the lifting of the suspension until the determination of the appeal, subject to any further order which this court might make. </p>

No doubt because the combined effect of both orders was to commit Mr McKay to prison for an immediate term of six months, subject only to the stay imposed by Nicol J pending the outcome of this appeal, no point has been taken that Mr McKay might arguably have required permission to appeal against either order viewed in isolation. </p>

Wimbledon appear, as they did below, by Mr Edward Rowntree and Mr Charles Raffin of counsel, instructed by Kerman &amp; Co. In addition, the Secretary of State for Justice has been joined to the appeal, at a very late stage, as an interested party, in order to assist the court in relation to an application for a declaration of incompatibility under section 4 of the Human Rights Act 1998 raised for the first time on Mr McKay’s behalf by an application notice dated 26 February 2020 but not sealed until 19 March 2020. As I shall explain, the declaration sought was that section 13 of the Fraud Act 2006 is inconsistent with Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights (“the ECHR”). The application was made at such a late stage, and with so little in the way of supporting argument, that the only realistic course, particularly in view of the grave difficulties occasioned by the Covid-19 pandemic, was to adjourn it to be heard together with the appeal, so that the Secretary of State for Justice would have sufficient time to consider and respond to it. In the event, Ms Sasha Blackmore of counsel was instructed by the Government Legal Department, and under considerable time pressure she was able to produce detailed written submissions in advance of the hearing. We are very grateful for her written and oral submissions, which made it abundantly clear that the application is wholly misconceived. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.21in">The Championships have never been run as a purely commercial venture with profit as the foremost motive. After the expenses of maintaining the premises have been defrayed, the financial surplus is used for the general benefit of British tennis. Tickets available to the general public have always been priced at a reasonable level, and distributed through a carefully controlled ballot which is designed to offer equality of opportunity to purchase them. Other tickets are distributed to members, officials and various affiliated organisations, both at home and abroad. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.21in">Each year two types of tickets for the Championships are issued by AELTC. Debenture tickets do not show a price, and they are fully transferable without restriction. These tickets are issued to debenture holders of AELTC. All other tickets have since 1991 been issued at a face value shown on the ticket, and are subject to conditions of the general nature I have already indicated: they may not be purchased or obtained from or through any person other than AELTC or its authorised agents; they are strictly nontransferable; they remain the property of AELTC at all times; and any ticket obtained in violation of the restrictions is to be treated as void. These tickets are referred to in the evidence as Non-Transferable Wimbledon Tickets, or “NTWTs”. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.21in">Despite these conditions, and despite the sustained efforts of AELTC to enforce them, every year there are individuals and organisations which acquire a number of NTWTs (either legitimately or from third parties) and seek to sell them on, usually at grossly inflated prices, either outside or near the grounds, or increasingly over the internet. Part of the work carried out by AELTC includes monitoring the internet for tickets to the Championships which are advertised for purchase or sale, and carrying out further investigation into such advertisements. Mr Glasson describes how, in July 2017, an agent acting on behalf of AELTC became aware that Mr McKay, using the alias Peter Raven, was operating a private group on Facebook for tickets to the 2017 Championships. The group was kept under observation, and at least two agents of AELTC were accepted as members of it. Mr McKay was seen to be advertising to buy and sell tickets for both the 2017 and the 2018 Championships. </p>

Mr McKay replied saying “OK I’ll buy them”, without asking whether they were debenture tickets or NTWTs. The agent informed Mr McKay that the face value of each ticket was £108, and he suggested a price of £350 for the pair. At this point Mr McKay asked to see a picture of the tickets, which was duly supplied and from which it was apparent that the tickets were not debenture tickets. Mr McKay then raised this problem with the agent, and asked for a price reduction. After further negotiation, a price of £225 for the pair was accepted and arrangements were made for the parties to meet at a public house in Central London.  </p>

A second agent acting on behalf of AELTC was instructed to deliver the tickets to Mr McKay. After they had contacted and introduced each other, each using a false name, a discussion ensued in the course of which Mr McKay (calling himself “Luke”) made repeated references to his “boss”, and also made or received a call on his mobile phone which identified the other party to the call as “Greg Shep”. For reasons which I need not elaborate, Wimbledon believes that this was a Mr Greg Shepherd, who had applied for tickets in the 2011 ballot using the same phone number. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.21in">The upshot of the discussions was that the second agent gave the tickets to Mr McKay in exchange for a cash payment of £250. On 5 July, two individuals were found to be in possession of the tickets within the grounds, and it eventually transpired that they had been purchased through a website controlled by a Spanish company which has been associated with many unauthorised sales of NTWTs over the years. </p>

The application was supported, as I have said, by Mr Glasson’s first witness statement, in which he identified the relevant causes of action as (a) procuring breaches of contract by those to whom the NTWTs are issued, (b) inducing those to whom such tickets are sold by Mr McKay to trespass on the premises, and (c) being party to an unlawful means conspiracy against Wimbledon. Orders were sought for delivery up of any NTWTs that Mr McKay might hold, and for the provision of information identifying those from whom Mr McKay had bought, or to whom he had sold, such tickets. Wimbledon were represented on the application by Mr Rowntree, who has much experience of applications of this type. Apart from Mr Glasson’s evidence, the judge was also provided with a claim form and draft particulars of claim, which fleshed out the causes of action adumbrated by Mr Glasson in his statement, albeit in rather generic terms in the absence of specific information about other transactions in which Mr McKay had been involved. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.21in;text-indent:0.00in">Apart from the absence of a separate numbered ground of committal, no indication is given of the date on which Mr McKay was alleged to have been in contempt by reason of his failure to comply with paragraph 3(c) of the 9 July Order. This is not a triviality, because Mr McKay could hardly have been alleged to be in contempt before the expiry of the last of the informal extensions for compliance agreed between him and Kerman &amp; Co, on 27 August 2019. Furthermore, on a strict view, Mr McKay could not fairly be at risk of committal for failure to comply with the 9 July Order before the deadline of 4.30pm on 11 July contained in paragraph 3(c), because the order was not served personally on Mr McKay until 16 July. By that date, the order of which Mr McKay was in breach was paragraph 1 of the Continuation Order, but that order was never served personally on Mr McKay, nor was any time ever fixed by the court for him to comply with it: see generally CPR rule 81.5(1) and 81.6 (the latter of which requires personal service of “copies of judgments or orders and any orders or agreements fixing or varying the time for doing an act”). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.21in">Secondly, the alleged contempt was that Mr McKay had failed to “swear” a witness statement, but there was no requirement in the 9 July Order for the relevant information to be provided by way of affidavit. The only formal requirement was that the witness statement should be verified by a statement of truth in the usual way. </p>

That wording does not sit easily with the long-established right of an alleged contemnor not to give evidence, and to require the alleged contempt to be proved against him to the criminal standard. Like the defendant in a criminal trial, a person accused of contempt has the right to remain silent: see <span style="text-decoration:underline">Comet Products UK Limited v Hawkex Plastics Limited</span> [1971] 2 QB 67 (CA). It is the duty of the court to ensure that the accused person is made aware of that right, and also of the risk that adverse inferences may be drawn from his silence: see <span style="text-decoration:underline">Inplayer Limited v Thorogood</span> [2013] EWCA Civ 1511, unreported, at [40], per Rupert Jackson LJ, noted in the White Book (2019 edition) at para 81.28.4.  </p>

Such evidence should identify the medical attendant and give details of his familiarity with the party’s medical condition (detailing all recent consultations), should identify with particularity what the patient's medical condition is and the features of that condition which (in the medical attendant’s opinion) prevent participation in the trial process, should provide a reasoned prognosis and should give the court some confidence that what is being expressed is an independent opinion after a proper examination. It is being tendered as expert evidence. The court can then consider what weight to attach to that opinion, and what arrangements might be made (short of an adjournment) to accommodate a party’s difficulties. No judge is bound to accept expert evidence: even a proper medical report falls to be considered simply as part of the material as a whole (including the previous conduct of the case).” </p>

Mr Rimer informed the court that Mr McKay would be entitled to legal aid without any assessment of means or of the merits of the case, and that such applications were normally determined within 48 hours.

Counsel for Mr McKay initially objected to this court seeing the letter, on the ground that it was privileged. Since the letter had been addressed to the court, this was an unpromising contention; but it led Wimbledon to issue an application on 13 March 2020 seeking permission for it to be placed before the court. We adjourned this application to be heard with the appeal. In the event, we indicated that we could see no possible grounds upon which the letter might be privileged, as it did not refer to the content of any legal advice given to Mr McKay, and Mr van Dellen withdrew his objection.  </p>

The hearing began with Mr Rowntree, for Wimbledon, introducing Mr McKay and referring to the bundles and skeleton arguments, all of which the judge said he had read. Mr Rowntree then explained the legal aid position, and referred to HJA’s letter of 27 November. Mr Rowntree then said: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.21in">There was then some discussion between Mr Rowntree and the judge about the need for a further hearing in the event of continued non-compliance by Mr McKay, followed by a brief discussion of the authorities on sentence for civil contempt which Mr Rowntree had included in the bundle and the judge said he had read. Reference was made to the recent decision of this court in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Corrigan v Chelsea Football Club</span> [2019] EWCA Civ 1964, [2019] Costs LR 2097, where Kerman &amp; Co and Mr Rowntree had acted for Chelsea Football Club in a case with some similarities to the present one. The defendant in that case, Mr Corrigan, had arranged to sell to an agent of the football club a ticket with a face value of £23.50 for £125, payable in cash, for a home game that evening against West Ham United. The transaction took place near to the football club’s ground at Stamford Bridge. After Mr Corrigan had been identified as the vendor, civil proceedings were commenced against him in the High Court, and on a without notice application by Chelsea, Stewart J granted wide ranging relief by way of negative injunctions and mandatory orders for disclosure. Mr Corrigan then failed to comply with the mandatory orders, and took no part in the proceedings. On the second occasion when he failed to appear, Murray J made an order committing him to prison for six months, suspended for a short period to give him a final opportunity to comply. He still did not do so, and on the return date Murray J lifted the suspension. At a further hearing, after Mr Corrigan had been arrested under a bench warrant, the immediate term of imprisonment was confirmed. Mr Corrigan appealed to this court, but his appeal was dismissed. The leading judgment was delivered by Davis LJ, with shorter concurring judgments by McCombe and Asplin LJJ.  </p>

Mr Rowntree added, quite properly, that the length of sentence was a matter for the judge’s discretion, and he would not seek to persuade the judge one way or the other. The judge then proceeded to deliver his judgment. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.21in">A number of concerns arise from the way in which the hearing was conducted by Judge Freedman, apart from those which I have already mentioned in connection with his judgment. This was the first fully effective hearing of the committal application, after an adjournment to enable Mr McKay to obtain legal aid; but he was still unrepresented, in circumstances where the solicitors whom he had instructed (HJA) had very recently said that they were no longer able to act for him. HJA’s letter to the court of 27 November did not reveal the reason for the breakdown, presumably because they could not do so without revealing privileged information. However, the judge knew from the letter that HJA had helped Mr McKay to prepare a witness statement for use in the proceedings, and that he had attended a conference with counsel. Furthermore, the letter envisaged that the witness statement would be filed and served by Mr McKay so that he could rely upon it at the hearing, although if he chose to do so he would then be liable to cross-examination. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.21in">In those circumstances, a careful and cautious approach was clearly called for. Regrettably, however, the judge descended almost immediately into the arena by engaging in the lengthy dialogue with Mr McKay which I have recounted. At no stage was Mr McKay informed of his absolute right to silence, or of his privilege against selfincrimination. Nor did the judge seek to find out whether he was content to proceed without legal representation, or whether he might wish to apply for a further adjournment. Instead, the judge proceeded, through the use of leading questions, to extract from Mr McKay admissions that he had not done what he was ordered to do, and that he was thereby in contempt of court. Furthermore, the judge seems to have treated it as a foregone conclusion that the appropriate penalty would be a sentence of imprisonment, albeit suspended in order to give Mr McKay one last opportunity to comply with the order. Mr McKay’s concerns about grassing on his friend were brushed aside on the basis that the judge was “not interested in any excuses”, and this was “last chance saloon”. The judge was equally unimpressed by Mr McKay’s mental health issues, saying they could not exonerate him from being involved in ticket touting. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.21in">I have no doubt that the judge was acting with the best of intentions in proceeding as he did. I also have no doubt that, as Mr Rowntree assured us when we raised our concerns with him, he would have intervened if he thought that there was any risk of unfairness or injustice to Mr McKay in the way the hearing was being conducted. Nevertheless, I am bound to say that in my view, as disclosed by the transcript, the conduct of the hearing fell far short of the high standards expected in an application for the committal of an unrepresented litigant in person. Where the liberty of the subject is at stake, procedural fairness is of cardinal importance; and if the defects in an application for committal are material, in the sense of rendering the process unfair or unjust, this court will have no option but to allow the appeal, regardless of the underlying merits, on the simple ground that the defendant was denied a fair trial. Whether the process is unfair or unjust is a quintessentially fact-specific question; and whether the process in this case was in fact unfair or unjust such that this appeal must be allowed is a question which has caused me much anxiety.  I shall return to that issue (see paragraph 107 and following below); but before considering it I will complete the narrative of events and deal with the specific grounds of appeal which are advanced on Mr McKay’s behalf. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.21in">As the hearing before Nicol J on 13 December, Mr van Dellen appeared with Harry O’Sullivan for Mr McKay and Mr Raffin appeared for Wimbledon. Mr van Dellen and his junior produced a skeleton argument for the hearing which took a number of points as to why Judge Freedman ought not to have found Mr McKay to be in contempt of the 9 July Order, but in argument Mr van Dellen accepted that most of those points could only be pursued in an appeal against the order of 29 November. No notice of appeal against that order had yet been filed, but time for doing so would not expire until 20 December. There were, however, two arguments which Mr van Dellen said he could properly pursue. The first argument was that Mr McKay could not be required to incriminate himself, and that this principle would be violated if action were now taken against him because of his failure to make a witness statement in compliance with the condition of suspension of Judge Freedman’s order. Nicol J rejected this submission, because once Mr McKay had been found to be in contempt of court, the privilege against self-incrimination was no longer relevant when the only issue was whether he had complied with the suspension condition. In so concluding, the judge referred in his judgment to the decision of this court in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Phillips v Symes</span> [2003] EWCA Civ 1769 at [50(7)] and [54 (iv)]: see [2019] EWHC 3874 (QB) at [4]. </p>

In short, the suspension was lifted, but the order lifting the suspension was itself stayed until 20 December 2019, to allow Mr McKay to file a notice of appeal against the committal order; and if such an appeal was lodged, a further stay was ordered until the determination of the appeal by this court. </p>

I have already referred to the short letter of 29 October 2019 from NHS Bromley, which Chamberlain J rightly regarded as inadequate at the first hearing before him on 30 October 2019: see [34] and [36] above. It is unclear, on the available evidence, whether Judge Freedman also had sight of a longer letter which exists in two apparently identical versions, dated respectively 1 November and 27 November 2019. The former of these was in the possession of HJA, but there is no evidence that it was ever supplied to the court by HJA, or that it was sent by them to Kerman &amp; Co. The latter version was eventually provided to Kerman &amp; Co on 7 January 2020, but it was presumably unknown to both Kerman &amp; Co and Mr Rowntree at the hearing on 29 November.  It seems reasonable to infer that the letter was obtained by Mr McKay on 1 November in an effort to comply with the directions given by Chamberlain J on 30 October 2019, but, if so, it still fell considerably short of the guidance in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Levy v Ellis-Carr</span>.

Even making those assumptions, however, the medical evidence seems to me to fall far short of establishing any real risk of unfairness to Mr McKay. Although the medical letter of 1 November 2019 was fuller than its predecessor of 29 October, it still lacked the requisite particularity to justify an adjournment or the taking of any other measures to accommodate Mr McKay’s mental health difficulties. Moreover, it was wholly unclear what an adjournment might be expected to achieve, given Mr McKay’s refusal to engage with his drug misuse and the lack of any concrete prognosis. </p>

There might be legal arguments to justify his refusal, but as to the fact of his failure to comply there could be no doubt. Thus, the outcome of the committal application was likely to turn on legal arguments, not on a factual enquiry into whether Mr McKay had produced a witness statement. Even if the judge had not seen the 1 November 2019 letter, I do not accept that his decision would or should have been any different if he had seen it.  In those circumstances, I cannot accept that the judge’s exercise of his discretion to proceed with the hearing was in any material respect unfair to Mr McKay because of his mental health issues. </p>

The court went on to hold that, although civil contempt proceedings are subject to article 6 of the ECHR, the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights shows that a flexible approach to the admission of hearsay evidence is appropriate, rather than its exclusion on principle, and that in a committal application the decision is one for the judge, giving reasons for the admission or rejection of the evidence: see the discussion in the judgment of Lloyd LJ at [52] to [59]. </p>

The evidence of the anonymous agents who were employed by Wimbledon to sell and deliver the tickets to Mr McKay was relevant only to the underlying claim against Mr McKay, and to the making of the 9 July Order and the Continuation Order by Nicklin J. Those were purely civil proceedings and they have resulted in a default judgment against Mr McKay from which he has not appealed. The committal application, by contrast, was based exclusively upon his failure to comply with the disclosure orders made by Nicklin J. The evidence of the agents is completely irrelevant to the question whether Mr McKay had complied with those orders, and its only relevance is as part of the general background which led to the making of the orders in the first place. On no view could it be said that the evidence of the agents was the sole or decisive evidence against Mr McKay <span style="font-style:italic">in the committal application. </span>Mr van Dellen had no answer to this simple objection, and in my view there is none. Furthermore, in the absence of any appeal against the 9 July and Continuation Orders, it is clearly not open to Mr McKay to mount a collateral challenge to the evidence which led Nicklin J to make those orders, by way of a defence to the committal application. The general rule is that court orders must be obeyed, unless and until they are set aside; but no attempt has been made by Mr McKay to set aside the orders, or indeed the default judgment. </p>

Law 22, where he held that in the context of wardship proceedings in the High Court, a location order which placed an obligation on the relevant family members to “inform the tipstaff of the whereabouts of the child, if such are known to him or her”, and also in any event to “inform the tipstaff of all matters within his or her knowledge or understanding which might reasonably assist him in locating the child”, gave rise to an obligation of both an immediate and continuing effect which satisfied the requirement in CPR rule 81.4 that a time must be fixed for a mandatory order to be enforceable by committal: see his judgment at [36] to [40]. That decision is not binding on us, but it is cited in the notes to rule 81.4 in the White Book, and I would not wish to cast doubt on it, particularly in a case such as the present one where a specific time for compliance is fixed by an order made without notice on an urgent application, and the order is then continued (in the absence of compliance) on the return date. As a practical matter, any defendant who is personally served with both the original order and the continuation order made on the return date can be under no misapprehension about the need for him to comply immediately with the relevant requirement, subject only to any extensions of time for compliance which he may be able to agree with the claimant or obtain from the court. That was in substance the position in the present case, in which Mr McKay clearly understood that he had a continuing obligation to make a witness statement in accordance with the order originally made by Nicklin J on 9 July 2019 and continued by him on 11 July – hence the extension of time for compliance sought by him, and </p>

Nor was the court asked to dispense with personal service under rule 81.8(2)(a), and I am certainly not prepared to infer that Judge Freedman intended to make such a dispensation in the absence of the slightest indication that he gave any consideration to questions of service at the hearing on 29 November. I am therefore satisfied that there was a breach of the requirement for personal service of the Continuation Order.  </p>

I have no hesitation in concluding that we should do so, since it is clear from the evidence that Mr McKay knew perfectly well what he had been ordered to do. His defence has always been that he did not wish to incriminate his boss or other third parties with whom he had dealings, not that he was in any doubt about the terms of the 9 July Order or its continuation on 11 July. Furthermore, it is clear beyond reasonable doubt that he had notice of the terms of the 9 July Order when it was inserted in his letter box on 10 July, even if strictly speaking that did not constitute personal service. I am therefore satisfied that granting the necessary dispensation would occasion no unfairness or injustice to Mr McKay.  </p>

As I have pointed out, the notice did not fully comply with rule 81.10(3)(a), because there was no separate numbered ground setting out the alleged act of contempt and the date on which Mr McKay was said to have committed it, having regard to the extensions of time agreed between him and Wimbledon. Moreover, the ground in the application notice failed to refer to the Continuation Order. In a context where accuracy and clarity should be at a premium, these breaches evidence an unfortunate degree of carelessness by Wimbledon and their legal advisers in complying with the requirements of CPR Part 81, even though these particular points have not been relied on as grounds of appeal. Nevertheless, I am satisfied that in the context of the present case they may be classified as technical breaches which caused no unfairness or injustice to Mr McKay.

Secondly, the affidavit evidence was defective because it did not name the agent who sold the test tickets to Mr McKay, in breach of CPR rule 32.16, which requires an affidavit to comply with the requirements of PD32, and paragraph 4.2 of that Practice Direction, which says that an affidavit must indicate: </p>

The evidence was therefore adduced by affidavit, albeit as hearsay evidence contained in an exhibit to the affidavit. I do not consider that to be objectionable, in circumstances where Mr Glasson’s evidence described the factual background to Wimbledon’s claim against Mr McKay, and was not directly relevant to the alleged contempt of court, which (as I have already pointed out) consisted of his failure to comply with the disclosure obligations in the 9 July Order. The primary evidence in support of that allegation was duly contained in the body of Ms Shaw’s first affidavit. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.21in">As to the second objection, Ms Shaw’s summary of Mr Glasson’s evidence made it clear that the test tickets were offered for sale by “an agent acting on behalf of” Wimbledon, and the fuller account in Mr Glasson’s statement explained that the agent used the adopted name of John Denning. Where Mr Glasson relied for his information on “John Denning”, he said so: see, for example, paragraphs 44 to 50 of his statement. Similarly, where Mr Glasson relied on evidence from the second agent who met Mr McKay at the Monument public house, this was also explained by him. On analysis, therefore, the real complaint is not that Ms Shaw and Mr Glasson failed to disclose the source of their information, but rather that they maintained the anonymity of their sources. This was in my view acceptable, and did not lead to any risk of unfairness, where the evidence in question did not go to the contempt of which Mr McKay was accused, but rather to the general background which led to the making of the 9 July Order.  I would therefore dismiss this ground of appeal. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.21in">The first point which needs to be made, however, is that paragraph 3(d) of the 9 July Order expressly recognises the existence of the privilege, and makes provision for what is to happen if Mr McKay wishes to invoke it.   He “must set this out fully in the witness statement”, and “is recommended to take legal advice before refusing to provide any information referred to in” the order. He is also warned that “[w]rongful refusal to provide the information is contempt of court”. It is implicit in these provisions that the nature and grounds of the claim to the privilege must be fully set out in the witness statement, with the purpose of enabling the court (if necessary) to rule on the question whether it has been validly claimed. If it has, the privilege prevails, and Mr McKay cannot be compelled to disclose the relevant information; but if the claim fails, and he still refuses to provide the information required, he will be in contempt of court. What Mr McKay is not entitled to do is to refuse to engage with the machinery of paragraph 3(d) at all. The requirement for him to set out the claim fully in his witness statement is mandatory, and forms part of a court order which has never been appealed or set aside. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.21in">In essence, however, that is the stance which Mr McKay has chosen to adopt. At the beginning of the hearing before us, Mr van Dellen confirmed, in answer to a question from the court, that his client’s position was still one of complete refusal to produce a witness statement. But that is not an option open to him under the 9 July Order or the Continuation Order, and on the face of it his refusal to engage with the machinery of paragraph 3(d) is itself a contempt of court, and (perhaps more importantly) also renders his continuing refusal to provide the information required by paragraph 3(c) of the 9 July Order (as continued) a contempt of court. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.21in">It also needs to be stressed that paragraph 3(d) is a standard form provision of a type commonly found in court orders for the disclosure of information ancillary to the grant of an injunction, particularly where the order is made on an urgent without notice application by the claimant. That form of order lawfully caters for any plea of selfincrimination, and is often appropriate.  If compliance with such orders were to become optional, not only would the authority of the court be flouted, but the crucial role of such orders in combatting fraud would be gravely impaired. The necessary protection for the defendant lies in the express recognition of his ability to claim the privilege against self-incrimination, but he must do so, not by merely making an assertion of the risk of self-incrimination, but  by setting out in a witness statement backed by a statement of truth a full account of the circumstances and the nature of his claim in respect of that risk, so that it may be considered by the claimant and the court can (if necessary) rule upon it. </p>

The removal of the privilege is confined to incrimination of offences of fraud under the 2006 Act or related offences of a kindred nature, including conspiracy to defraud. Protection for the defendant is provided, however, by subsection (2), which states without qualification that any statement or admission made by him in answering such a question, or complying with such an order, is not admissible in evidence against him (or his spouse or civil partner) for an offence under the Act or a related offence. In other words, a balance is struck. The defendant is no longer to be excused from (relevantly) complying with any order made in proceedings relating to property on the ground that doing so may incriminate him, but no statement or admission made by him in complying with the order is admissible in evidence against him in criminal fraud proceedings. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0.21in">Lord Neuberger’s judgment in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Gray</span> was in effect the judgment of the court, because the other two members of the court (Lord Judge CJ and Maurice Kay LJ) simply agreed with it. The judgment establishes, with force and clarity, that statutory enactments in the general form of section 13 of the Fraud Act 2006 are fully compatible with article 6, and that the question of self-incrimination would in any event only arise at the stage of any future criminal proceedings. It follows, in my judgment, that Mr McKay cannot in the present case rely on either the privilege against self-incrimination or his rights under article 6 to excuse him from providing the information required by the 9 July Order. The proceedings brought against him by Wimbledon are clearly “proceedings relating to property” within the meaning of section 13, because the tickets sold to Mr McKay were and remained the property of Wimbledon. If, therefore, Mr McKay were to provide a witness statement, as ordered, but sought to take advantage of paragraph 3(d) by claiming the privilege against self-incrimination, I find it hard (as presently advised) to see how the claim could have any chance of success, for the reasons so clearly stated by Lord Neuberger in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Gray</span>. However, that stage has not even been reached. Mr McKay’s stance, maintained down to and including the hearing before us, has been that the privilege and his article 6 rights make it unnecessary for him to comply with the 9 July Order at all.  </p>

There is accordingly no scope for the principle stated by Laws LJ in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Thoburn</span> to operate. Furthermore, as I have explained, section 13 of the 2006 Act is fully compliant with article 6.

The application appears to have been made almost as an afterthought, because there was no elaboration of it in the application notice which merely averred that section 13 of the Fraud Act 2006 was “inconsistent with Article 6 (the right of an individual suspected of a criminal offence not to self-incriminate)”. Nor was any application made to amend the grounds of appeal. The short supplementary skeleton argument which Mr van Dellen eventually provided on 15 April 2020 did finally acknowledge the difficulties posed for the argument by section 13(2), but again made no reference to <span style="text-decoration:underline">Gray</span>, and sought instead to introduce for the first time an argument which had nothing but novelty to recommend it, namely that Mr McKay has the right under article 6 not to incriminate <span style="font-style:italic">others.</span> It is enough to say that, despite repeated requests, Mr van Dellen has been unable to provide any authority for this supposed extension of the reach of article 6, nor does </p>

It is unnecessary for me to deal with this argument in any detail, because the short and conclusive answer to it is that Mr McKay’s right to silence, as a defendant to the committal application, was a right to silence in relation to the alleged act of contempt, namely his failure to comply with paragraph 3(c) of the 9 July Order. Mr McKay had admitted his failure to comply with that order at the hearing on 29 November 2019, and he maintained that refusal in the instructions which he gave to his lawyers for the hearing before us. I return to the simple point that Mr McKay has chosen to defy a court order, and it is that defiance which constitutes the alleged contempt, not his refusal to incriminate third parties. </p>

For my part, I fully accept that assurance, and on balance I do not consider that an apology was needed, although I think Mr van Dellen was quite right to offer one. He was also right to accept that the matter should have been raised at a much earlier stage, and that it would have been preferable to deal with it by an application to amend the grounds of appeal. In those circumstances, permission to amend would doubtless have been refused without the need to involve the Secretary of State, and in good time before the onset of the current coronavirus crisis. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.21in">It remains to consider whether the shortcomings which I have identified in the conduct of the hearing on 29 November 2019 should lead to the conclusion that Mr McKay’s first appeal must be allowed, even though I would dismiss his grounds of appeal as formulated. As I have already indicated, the transcript of the hearing on 29 November has caused me much anxiety. The failure of the judge to remind Mr McKay of his absolute right to silence, and of his privilege against self-incrimination, combined with the judge’s readiness to descend into the arena and extract admissions from Mr McKay, certainly had the potential to cause real injustice; and if I were satisfied that there was any significant risk of such an injustice having occurred, it would in my view be our duty to allow the appeal on that basis, whether or not the deficiencies were reflected in the grounds of appeal. But the fact that, with the benefit of legal representation, Mr McKay has chosen not to take these points in his grounds of appeal should give us pause for thought. It may well be the case, for example, that Mr McKay was well aware, from his attendance at the second hearing before Chamberlain J (of which we do not have a transcript) and/or from legal advice given to him by HJA, of his right to silence, and the need for the alleged contempt to be proved to the criminal standard. Furthermore, the substance of the privilege against self-incrimination lies at the heart of Mr McKay’s grounds of appeal, even if the judge’s failure to remind him of it does not feature as a separate ground.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.21in">Again, the judge’s well-intentioned enthusiasm to question Mr McKay and elicit his failure to comply with the 9 July Order must be seen in the context of the very limited nature of the alleged contempt, namely Mr McKay’s failure to produce a witness statement in compliance with paragraph 3(c) of the 9 July Order. The general nature of that obligation was clearly well understood by Mr McKay, as the narrative in Ms Shaw’s first affidavit shows.  Once the judge had elicited that Mr McKay did not wish to file or rely upon the witness statement prepared for him by HJA, following a conference with counsel, the fact of Mr McKay’s continued non-compliance with the 9 July Order all but spoke for itself. Furthermore, in the absence of a witness statement, it was clear that Mr McKay had not taken advantage of the machinery for making a claim to privilege provided by paragraph 3(d) of the 9 July Order. Thus, although in my respectful opinion the judge ought not to have pressed Mr McKay to admit that he was in breach of the 9 July Order and thus in contempt of court as he did, a hearing conducted with appropriate caution and circumspection could not realistically have led to a different outcome. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.21in">I have also been concerned by the judge’s apparent failure to give consideration to any sentence falling short of a suspended term of imprisonment, combined with his failure to give Mr McKay an opportunity to make a plea in mitigation. In many contexts, these failures could have been productive of real injustice; and the importance of procedural safeguards for a person accused of contempt of court must not be whittled away, even if he admits his guilt. But there is no separate appeal against sentence, and the courts have often emphasised that a deliberate and sustained refusal to comply with a court order will normally merit a custodial sentence, particularly if it is suspended to allow a final opportunity for compliance. Furthermore, the judge was well aware of the recent case of <span style="text-decoration:underline">Corrigan</span>, in which a similar sentence in not dissimilar circumstances had been upheld by this court. Moreover, although the judge was in my view wrong to extract from Mr McKay what was, in effect, a guilty plea as he did, any potential injustice thus caused has been removed by the opportunity for Mr McKay to advance the grounds of appeal which we have considered, and to have them determined by us, before the sentence imposed by the judge is activated.  That consideration has shown that this defect in the procedure before the judge was not material. </p>

This ground is supported by the same substantive arguments as those which I have already considered and rejected in relation to the first appeal. Moreover, the question for the court on 13 December was simply whether Mr McKay had complied with the condition upon which the sentence imposed by Judge Freedman had been suspended. It was clear beyond argument that he had not so complied, because no witness statement had been forthcoming.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.21in">By an Order of 9 July 2019, continued on 11 July 2019, Mr McKay was required to give disclosure of (amongst other things) those with whom he had unlawfully traded Wimbledon Championship tickets, in the form of a signed statement supported by a statement of truth.  In making that statement, his right not to self-incriminate was expressly catered for in the order.  He has been aware of that obligation since 10 July 2019, and certainly since he was personally served with the 9 July 2019 Order on 16 July 2019.  It is a continuing obligation which he himself acknowledged when he sought extensions of time in which to comply with it.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.21in">The obligation to make that statement was lawfully imposed by way of order of the High Court.  Despite being given every opportunity, Mr McKay has steadfastly refused to comply with that order and, even before this court, made clear that he has no current intention of complying.  Although the procedural deficiencies below identified by Henderson LJ are unfortunate, in the event, they clearly gave rise to no unfairness or injustice to Mr McKay.   </p>
