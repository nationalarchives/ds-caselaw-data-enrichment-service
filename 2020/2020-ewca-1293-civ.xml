	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Senior contends that the judge fell into error in concluding, first, that Celgard had established a serious issue to be tried assuming that English law applies to its claims and, secondly, that England is the proper forum to try the claims. The first conclusion involved an assessment of extensive factual and expert evidence served by the parties, while the second involved a multi-factorial evaluation of the factors connecting the claims to England rather than China. At first blush, these are unpromising conclusions for a party to seek to challenge on appeal. Senior contends, however, that the judge made three errors of principle which require this Court to intervene: first, he failed to recognise that Celgard had not identified the alleged trade secrets it alleged had been misused; secondly, he wrongly accepted that, by limiting its claims to remedies in respect of acts in the UK, Celgard could establish the requisite degree of connection to England; and thirdly, he wrongly concluded, as part of his consideration of the proper forum, that the law applicable to Celgard’s claims was English law when he should have concluded that it was Chinese law. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Both Celgard and Senior make battery separators. Celgard does so in the USA, while Senior does so in China. Battery separators are used in lithium-ion batteries to separate the anode and the cathode of the battery. They can be classified as wet separators or dry separators, depending on the way in which they are made. Dry battery separators, which are the type with which these proceedings are concerned, are highly engineered sheets of microporous polymer which may be coated on one or both sides. They are critical to the performance, product life and safety of batteries, because they allow ions to flow between the electrodes, but prevent the electrodes coming into contact, which can cause the cell to short circuit and overheat. Both companies supply their separators to battery manufacturers, including manufacturers of batteries for electric vehicles. </p>

In addition, Dr Zhang has admitted that, although he told Mr Shi of the possibility of a move to GE in August 2016, he did not at the same time say that he was also thinking of a return to his native China, a step which he took when he accepted an offer from Senior in January 2017.  </p>

His evidence is that he was told that nobody of that name worked for Senior. It is Senior’s case that their employees were approached by Mr Shi with a request for a meeting with Dr Zhang; they simply told him that Dr Zhang was not there. Afterwards, Dr Zhang contacted Mr Shi and said that he was not working on battery separators, but on reverse osmosis. Celgard contends that the untruthfulness of this became apparent when a picture was published of Dr Zhang at a visit made by Senior employees to Panasonic.  </p>

The UK Customer makes batteries for a well-known manufacturer of electric vehicles. During the course of the negotiations for that contract, Celgard learnt that the UK Customer might be starting the process of evaluating the suitability of a battery separator manufactured by Senior. This could lead to Senior becoming “qualified” for the purpose of supplying its separator to the UK Customer. Celgard is concerned that qualification can only be achieved by Senior with the assistance of Celgard’s trade secrets, the misuse of which will facilitate the ability of Senior to enter the UK market by undercutting Celgard. Its case is that, if it then loses the contract with the UK Customer, it will suffer damage that will be very difficult to quantify.  </p>

Battery Separator was defined to mean all battery separator film to be supplied to the UK Customer. At the time this application was made, Celgard understood that the shipment was about to be made. It subsequently transpired that the shipment had in fact been delivered to the UK Customer before the injunction was granted. The judge found that the impression given by Senior’s correspondence prior to the application was wholly misleading. Fortunately, no damage was done, because the UK Customer agreed to deliver the shipment into the custody of Celgard’s solicitors, where it remains. </p>

The principal distinguishing characteristic of trade secrets, as opposed to other forms of confidential information, was that a former employee could be restrained from using or disclosing their former employer’s trade secrets after the termination of the employment: see in particular <span style="font-style:italic">Faccenda Chicken Ltd v Fowler</span> [1987] 1 Ch 117 and <span style="font-style:italic">Lancashire Fires Ltd v SA Lyons &amp; Co Ltd</span> [1996] FSR 629.

Thus this requirement is common to both of Celgard’s applications, assuming for this purpose that English law is the applicable law as Celgard contends.

But it is well recognised that breach of confidence actions can be used to oppress and harass competitors and exemployees. The courts are therefore careful to ensure that the plaintiff gives full and proper particulars of all the confidential information on which he intends to rely in the proceedings. If the plaintiff fails to do this the court may infer that the purpose of the litigation is harassment rather than the protection of the plaintiff's rights and may strike out the action as an abuse of process.

This is not only for the reasons set out by Edmund Davies L.J.in<span style="font-style:italic"> John Zink</span> [namely, that an allegation of misuse of trade secrets is a serious allegation] but for at least two other reasons. First, the plaintiff usually seeks an injunction to restrain the defendant from using its confidential information. Unless the confidential information is properly identified, an injunction in such terms is of uncertain scope and may be difficult to enforce: …. Secondly, the defendant must know what he has to meet. He may wish to show that the items of information relied on by the plaintiff are matters of public knowledge. His ability to defend himself will be compromised if the plaintiff can rely on matters of which no proper warning was given. It is for all these reasons that failure to give proper particulars may be a particularly damaging abuse of process.” </p>

The defendant must be told what it is he is accused of misusing. He must be told precisely what it is that he will be prevented from doing or using by the injunction sought. This does not mean that the plaintiff is locked into his case at the interlocutory stage. He may find that additional information has been taken or misused by the defendant in which case he will be able to amend his claim to include additional material. He may find that some of the information which he had thought was confidential is not or has not been used by the defendant. In that case he can restrict his claim.

Counsel for Celgard submitted that this did not comply with Article 9(2) of the Trade Secrets Directive (implemented by regulation 10(6) of the Regulations), which made it clear that at least one representative from each party had to be included in any confidentiality club (and such a confidentiality club had been established for this case).

The case on the binder is adequately pleaded, and I do not accept either of the arguments advanced by counsel for Senior in relation to it. In the first place, neither is strictly open to Senior since neither was the subject of a ground of appeal. Secondly, neither argument is a good one anyway. Counsel for Senior rightly accepted that he could not ask this Court to review the judge’s assessment of the evidence. That being so, there is no basis for impeaching his conclusion that it established serious issues to be tried in relation to the binder. As for the breadth of the injunction, as counsel for Senior accepted, the form of the injunction was plainly intended to ensure that Senior knew what it could not do and not to require the determination of issues arising at trial in order to establish whether or not it had been complied with (see <span style="font-style:italic">Staver Co Inc v Digitext Display Ltd</span> [1985] FSR 512).

In my opinion, however, the argument has merit. I do not wish in any way to diminish the importance of proper particulars of trade secrets being provided in cases of this nature. What amounts to sufficient particularisation must depend on the circumstances of the individual case, however. Furthermore, a lesser degree of particularisation may be acceptable at the outset of a case than at later stages of the case. Still further, I accept that it is relevant to take into account the claimant’s ability to provide further particulars, and the extent to which the claimant has been hampered by obstructiveness, or at least non-cooperation, on the part of the defendant. In the circumstances of the present case, I consider that Celgard has done enough for now, although it will undoubtedly have to give further particulars at a later stage. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I would add by way of a footnote that, as Popplewell LJ pointed out during the course of argument, Celgard does not appear to have a real of prospect of success in obtaining an injunction to restrain importation of infringing goods, or damages or an account of profits in respect of such importation, by virtue of its Vicarious Claim, as opposed to its Direct Claim, for a completely different reason. This is because, as presently formulated, the Vicarious Claim is solely concerned with Dr Zhang’s disclosure of Celgard’s trade secrets to Senior in China, and not with the subsequent use of those secrets by Senior to manufacture infringing goods, let alone to import them into the UK. Counsel for Senior sensibly accepted, however, that if Celgard was given permission to serve out in respect of the Direct Claim, it should also have permission in respect of the Vicarious Claim.                        </p>

In such circumstances, Article 6(2) provides that “Article 4 shall apply”. Article 4 applies even though it is concerned with the law applicable to a non-contractual obligation arising out of a tort/delict, and, as a matter of English law, claims for breach of equitable obligations of confidence are not claims in tort: see <span style="font-style:italic">Kitechnology BV v.

Moreover, it is precisely for this reason that Article 6 of the Rome II Regulation applies, and hence Article 4 applies the <span style="font-style:italic">lex loci damni</span>. (If trade secrets were intellectual property, Article 8 of the Regulation would apply the <span style="font-style:italic">lex loci protectionis</span>.)  </p>

This was the legislative intention: the European Commission’s Explanatory Memorandum accompanying the proposal for the Rome II Regulation stated at page 11 that the rule in what is now Article 4(1) “entails, where damage is sustained in several countries, that the laws of all the countries concerned will have to be applied on a distributive basis, applying what is known as ‘Mosaikbetrachtung’ in German law”. Similarly, it stated at page 16 what is now Article 6 “provides for connection to the law of … the market where competitors are seeking to gain the customer’s favour”. It went on to state that it was important that “only the direct substantial effects of an act of unfair competition” should be taken into account in international situations “since anticompetitive conduct commonly has impact on several markets and gives rise to the distributive application of the laws involved”. </p>

This makes importation of infringing goods an unlawful use of a trade secret “where the person carrying out such activities knew, or ought, under the circumstances, to have known that the trade secret was used unlawfully within the meaning of paragraph 3”. One of the possibilities embraced by paragraph 3 is (a), the person “having acquired the trade secret unlawfully”.

Counsel for Celgard submitted that “unlawfully” must be given an autonomous interpretation, since these provisions did not refer to national law, and therefore the applicable law was EU law (which also amounts to treating them as implicit choice of law rule). In the alternative, he submitted that the applicable law for this purpose was that determined by the Rome II Regulation, here English law.

Fortunately, it is not necessary at this stage of the proceedings to reach a conclusion as to the correct answer. My provisional view is that the applicable law is that determined by the Rome II Regulation. There is nothing in the Trade Secrets Directive to indicate that it is intended to include a choice of law rule; but that is the function of the Regulation. I am doubtful that EU law can be the applicable law given that (i) Article 1(1) of the Directive is explicit that national law may, up to a point, confer more far-reaching protection, (ii) Article 3(2) provides that the acquisition of a trade secret shall be considered lawful if it is required or allowed by national law and (iii) Article 5(d) requires exceptions to protect interests recognised by national law. I am also doubtful, for the reasons explained above, that it is consistent with the objectives of the Directive to apply the law of the country of acquisition if that is different to the law which would be applied by the Regulation. </p>

Given the way this claim is formulated, it is difficult to escape the conclusion that the law applicable to it is Chinese law, because the direct damage caused by Dr Zhang’s disclosure of trade secrets to Senior, in so far as there was any, was sustained in China.

Senior submits that it should be characterised as a dispute concerning the manufacture of battery separators by Senior in China, allegedly using Celgard’s trade secrets disclosed by Dr Zhang in China. Senior argues that the judge was distracted by Celgard’s limitation of its claim to remedies for acts done in the UK, when those acts were a minor part of the alleged wrongdoing, the principal part of which occurred in China, and involved Chinese witnesses and documents. Celgard could and should bring a claim for unfair competition in China. That would give Celgard substantial justice because, if that claim was successful, Celgard could obtain both an injunction to restrain manufacture in China, which would cut off the supply of infringing goods at source, and damages.  </p>

By statutory rules the English company was a necessary party to the proceedings. The registrar having given permission pursuant to RSC Order 11 rule 1, the petition was served on Intercomfinanz out of the jurisdiction. Intercomfinanz applied for orders that the registrar’s order and service of the petition be set aside and that the petition be stayed on the ground that Argentina was a more appropriate forum for the trial of the issues raised. Harman J held that it was “blindingly obvious” that England was the proper forum for the claim, because it concerned the regulation of an English company.

When one considered the dispute, however, it was all about what had been done in Argentina, and that was where the witnesses (who mainly spoke Spanish) and the documents (which were in Spanish) were. Thus the connecting factors pointed overwhelmingly to Argentina being the appropriate forum. The remedies available to Ladenimor in Argentina went to the question of whether it could obtain substantial justice there.

As he correctly concluded, that is a dispute about whether Celgard’s UK market for battery separators has been (or would be, if not restrained) damaged by the importation into, and marketing in, the UK of what are alleged to be infringing goods. Thus the location of the wrongful acts and of the loss, as well as the probable applicability of English law, point to England as being the appropriate forum. It is quite true that, as the judge recognised, the question of whether the goods are infringing goods depends on what was done in China, which involves Chinese documents and witnesses, although the judge considered it probable that Dr Zhang himself had good enough English to give evidence without the assistance of an interpreter. But the dispute also involves American documents and witnesses, because they will speak to whether the information relied upon by Celgard qualifies as trade secrets. Moreover, Senior had chosen to use two English-speaking expert witnesses based outside China (one in Massachusetts and one in Paris). </p>

The Supreme Court held that, where the court would otherwise have jurisdiction over claims concerning the infringement and validity of European patents (UK) which are essential to compliance with a telecommunications standard (“standard-essential patents”), it makes no difference that the claimant seeks an injunction to restrain infringement of the patents unless the defendant enters into a global (as opposed to United Kingdom) licence of an international portfolio of patents (including the UK patents) which is compliant with the claimant’s undertaking to the relevant standards setting organisation to license the patents on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory (FRAND) terms. The Supreme Court rejected a similar argument to that advanced by Senior in the present case for the following reasons: </p>

The question how the dispute should be defined has been the main bone of contention between the parties, both in this court and in the courts below. Is it, as the appellants say, in substance a dispute about the terms of a global FRAND licence, or is it, as the respondent maintains, both in form and in substance about the vindication of the rights inherent in English patents, and therefore about their validity and infringement, with FRAND issues arising only as an aspect of an alleged contractual defence? Thus far the respondent has had the better of that argument, both before the judge and the Court of Appeal. At the heart of the analysis which has thus far prevailed is the recognition that the owner of a portfolio of patents granted by different countries is in principle entitled to decide which patents (and therefore in which country or countries) to seek to enforce, and cannot be compelled to enforce patents in the portfolio granted by other countries merely because a common FRAND defence to the enforcement of any of them raises issues which might more conveniently be determined in another jurisdiction than that which exclusively regulated the enforcement of the chosen patents. </p>

But we think, like the judge, that there is a compelling reason why the appellants must fail on this issue which would apply even if the appellants' characterisation had been correct, so that the dispute was in substance about the terms of a global FRAND licence. A challenge to jurisdiction on forum conveniens grounds requires the challenger to identify some other forum which does have jurisdiction to determine the dispute. Even in a case where permission is required to serve out of the jurisdiction, so that the burden then shifts to the claimant to show that England is the more appropriate forum, that still requires there to be another candidate with the requisite jurisdiction. In the present case, China is the only candidate which the appellants have put forward. … </p>

Even in the event of such an agreement, he described the prospect that the Chinese courts would embark on the exercise as no more than speculative. Notwithstanding the admission of fresh evidence on this issue, the Court of Appeal reached the same conclusion. … </p>

I do not accept this submission. It is quite true that information not only is not property, but also has no <span style="font-style:italic">situs</span>. It does not follow that legal rights to control information have no <span style="font-style:italic">situs</span>. Celgard’s claims in the present case, and in particular the Direct Claim, involve its rights under the applicable law, which I have concluded is probably English law. Those are distinct legal rights from any rights which Celgard may have under Chinese law. I accept that rights in respect of trade secrets do not stand in precisely the same position as patents, because patents are registered rights which are inextricably connected with the country in which they are registered, whereas that is not true of rights in respect of trade secrets. Furthermore, I accept that that is a difference which may well be relevant to questions of jurisdiction, just as the difference between rights in respect of trade secrets and intellectual property rights is relevant to which provision of the Rome II Regulation is applicable. What I do not accept is that this difference means that the judge erred in his characterisation of the dispute for the purposes of considering the proper forum. <span style="text-decoration:underline">Conclusion</span></p>
