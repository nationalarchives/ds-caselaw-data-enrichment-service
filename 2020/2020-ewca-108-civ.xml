The case for the respondent, the National Crime Agency (the ‘NCA’), was founded on her connection with identified property in London SW3 (‘the Property’). The Property was purchased on 22 December 2009 by Vicksburg Global Inc, a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands. The price which was said to have been paid for the Property was £11,500,000. Vicksburg Global Inc was, and remains, registered as the sole proprietor. On the same day that the Property was purchased, a mortgage was secured against it in favour of Barclays Bank (Suisse) SA. The charge was executed in relation to a loan facility for ‘up to £7,475,000’. On 23 December 2014, Vicksburg Global Inc applied to the Land Registry to discharge the charge against the Property; and Barclays Bank (Suisse) SA confirmed that the Property was no longer charged as security.  </p>

At all material times the Bank was the largest bank in the country; and the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic (the ‘State’) had a controlling shareholding of not less than 50.2%. Mr Hajiyev resigned from the Bank in March 2015. On 5 December 2015, he was arrested in Azerbaijan and subsequently charged with various offences in connection with his employment at the Bank. These included charges of misappropriation, abuse of office, large-scale fraud and embezzlement. On 14 October 2016, he was convicted after a trial in the Serious Crimes Court in Baku and sentenced to a term of 15 years' imprisonment. In addition, he was ordered to pay to the Bank a sum of approximately US$39m.  </p>

The judge rejected all these grounds in his judgment of 3 October 2018 and refused leave to appeal. The appellant’s application for leave to appeal was accompanied by an urgent application for permission to appeal an order, also made on 3 October, revoking the anonymity order which had been made on the first day of the hearing. On 9 October, Sales LJ refused permission to challenge the revocation of the anonymity order. On 29 March 2019, Haddon-Cave LJ granted permission to appeal the substantive order on five grounds, on the basis that the appeal raised issues in relation to what was the first UWO case to come before the courts; and that it would be beneficial to have guidance from the Court of Appeal on the scope of statutory powers underlying UWOs. </p>

Measures adopted solely at national or even at Union level, without taking into account international coordination and cooperation, would have very limited effect. The measures adopted by the Union in that field should therefore be compatible with, and at least as stringent as, other actions undertaken in international fora. Union action should continue to take particular account of the FATF Recommendations and instruments of other international bodies active in the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing.

Mr Lewis suggests that, adopting the NCA approach, directors of the Dorchester are PEPs (Brunei being a non-EEA state with a majority shareholding). In the UK Channel 4 is a publicly owned corporation whose board is appointed by Ofcom, in agreement with the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport. Does it follow, Mr Lewis asks, that Channel 4 would be considered to be a SOE and the Chairman of the Board a PEP for the purposes of Article 9(g) of the 2015 Directive.  </p>

There was, he submitted, a distinction between an enterprise that was state-owned and a company whose shares were owned in part by a government body. The Bank was simply a commercial bank substantially owned by the government of Azerbaijan. The mischief that was intended to be covered by the statutory provisions related to corrupt state officials and not what may, or may not, have occurred in a company in which a government had a shareholding. While the judge was right to conclude that the test for deciding whether an enterprise was state-owned involved a fact-dependant enquiry, see his judgment at [35], it followed that he was wrong to conclude that an institution was ‘state-owned’, simply because the State had a majority stake in it: a shareholding, even a majority shareholding, was not sufficient to establish that the enterprise was state-owned. He gave various examples, as he had given to the judge, of commercial enterprises in this country whose shares were owned by overseas entities which could not properly be described as ‘state-owned’ enterprises. He also submitted that section 362B was an intrusive power which should be construed narrowly. </p>

Although the appellant had asserted both privileges in her witness statement, she did not identify what elements of the requested information would give rise to the alleged risk.

Mere assertion of the privilege against self-incrimination was not sufficient (see <span style="font-style:italic">JSC BTA Bank v.

The judge noted that, although the appellant was not entitled to invoke the privileges as of right, any risk of prosecution in the United Kingdom or abroad could, in principle, be relevant when deciding whether to exercise the discretion to make a UWO under section 362A(1) POCA 2002 (see <span style="font-style:italic">R (River East Supplies Ltd) v.

However, in the judge’s view the disclosure of information under the UWO about the Property would not give rise to a real or appreciable risk of prosecution of Mr Hajiyev or the appellant in either the United Kingdom or Azerbaijan, even on the unlikely assumption that the appellant would return there. In any event, there was no evidence that they would be at risk of further criminal proceedings. Further, the judge bore in mind that any information which was provided by the appellant would be provided to the NCA which, as a public body, had a duty to act consistently with the European Convention on Human Rights, and was bound to comply with the Overseas Security and Justice Assistance guidance which included specific processes for deciding whether disclosure to a third party would give rise to an impermissible risk. There was no suggestion that the NCA would use or disclose information sought otherwise than for the purposes of the statute (see <span style="font-style:italic">Bank of England v.
