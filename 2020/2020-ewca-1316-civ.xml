	      </a>at [28-34] I sought to set out the proper approach at the first stage.  I recalled that there is no strict rule of issue estoppel in children cases, but that a decision to allow past findings to be relitigated must be a reasoned one and that the considerations identified by Hale J in <span style="font-style:italic">Re B (Children Act Proceedings: Issue Estoppel)</span> [1997] Fam 117 at 128 provide a useful framework: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.00in">“(1) The court will wish to balance the underlying considerations of public policy, (a) that there is a public interest in an end to litigation – the resources of the court and everyone involved in these proceedings are already severely stretched and should not be employed in deciding the same matter twice unless there is good reason to do so; (b) that any delay in determining the outcome of the case is likely to be prejudicial to the welfare of the individual child; but (c) that the welfare of any child is unlikely to be served by relying upon determinations of fact which turn out to have been erroneous; and (d) the court's discretion, like the rules of issue estoppel, as pointed out by Lord Upjohn in <span style="font-style:italic">Carl Zeiss Stiftung v Rayner &amp; Keeler Ltd </span>(No.2) [1967] 1 AC 853, 947, "must be applied so as to work justice and not injustice." </p>

By this I mean something more than the mere fact that different judges might on occasions reach different conclusion upon the same evidence. No doubt we would all be reluctant to allow a matter to be relitigated on that basis alone. The court will want to know (a) whether the previous findings were the result of a full hearing in which the person concerned took part and the evidence was tested in the usual way; (b) if so, whether there is any ground upon which the accuracy of the previous finding could have been attacked at the time, and why therefore there was no appeal at the time; and (c) whether there is any new evidence or information casting doubt upon the accuracy of the original findings.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">At the second stage the court makes case management decisions governing the arrangements for the rehearing.   This is also an important discipline to ensure that the hearing does not become a free-for-all in which evidence is repeated and issues reopened without good reason.  Sometimes (the present case is an example) the court may need to rehear all aspects of the evidence, but in other cases a particular aspect of the case will need to be reheard while leaving the rest of the evidence undisturbed.  An example is <span style="font-style:italic">F v Cumbria County Council &amp; M (Fact-Finding No. 2) </span>[2016] EWHC 14 (Fam) where I reheard only the medical evidence and then placed it together with unaffected lay evidence: see paragraphs 109 and 110 for a description of the process.  A similar approach was taken by Cobb J in <span style="font-style:italic">Re AD and AM (Fact-finding: Rehearing)</span> [2016] EWHC 2912 (Fam) and by me in <span style="font-style:italic">St Helens Council v M and F (Baby with Multiple Fractures: Rehearing)</span> [2018] EWFC 1.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The importance of framing the rehearing correctly at the second stage can be seen in the decision of this court in <span style="font-style:italic">D (A Child) (Fact-Finding Appeal)</span> [2019] EWCA Civ 2302.  The court found that a child had been injured by her mother’s boyfriend.  The injury was of a kind that was not inevitably the result of abuse, though the medical evidence pointed that way.  The boyfriend later produced a solid alibi and at a rehearing limited to the issue of the identity of the perpetrator the judge made an amended finding that the child had been injured by an unidentified man known to the mother.  The mother’s appeal was allowed on the basis that the judge was wrong to have confined the ambit of the rehearing when the fresh evidence was relevant not only to the identification of a possible perpetrator but also whether the injuries had been inflicted at all.  Similarly, an appeal was allowed in the related field of child abduction where a judge had refused an application to set aside a return order without carrying out a full reconsideration of all the evidence: <span style="font-style:italic">Re B (A Child) (Abduction: Article 13(b))</span> [2020] EWCA Civ 1057 at [96]. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The third stage is the rehearing itself.  At this stage the issues are determined afresh on the basis of the whole of the evidence.  The description of the event as a rehearing rather than a review is deliberate: once a decision has been taken to reopen the case the court approaches the task of fact-finding in the conventional way and reaches its own conclusions.  It does not give presumptive weight to the earlier findings, as that would risk depriving the exercise of its fundamental purpose of doing justice and achieving the right outcome for the child.  The burden of proof remains throughout on a party seeking findings of fact to prove them to the civil standard in the normal way.  The court assesses the evidence on its merits, without privileging earlier evidence over later evidence, oral evidence over written evidence, or contentious evidence over uncontentious evidence.  At all events, a rehearing is quite distinct from an appeal, in which findings stand unless they are shown to be wrong. </p>

Issues of public policy relating to the priority to be given to earlier court decisions is in play at 'stage one' of an application to review a finding, when the question of estoppel is considered. Once that stage is passed, and the court is involved in evaluating the evidence itself, it would be wrong to afford some sort of priority to the evidence given and findings made at the earlier hearing that are to be considered within the review. Indeed it would be difficult to do so in any formal way. The starting point will be that a finding has been made. <span style="font-style:italic">In a case such as this, that result can only have occurred because there already exists 'strong' evidence in support of it.

Of course the product of the rehearing will be that the earlier finding should or should not to be changed, but it is only in that very limited sense that the original finding is the starting point.  Likewise, the original evidence was clearly strong enough to justify the original findings, but to describe evidence as strong before it is reconsidered is to beg the question that has to be decided.  Lastly, concepts of ‘making the running’ and of an ‘evidential burden’ apply at the first stage (when securing a rehearing) and may do at the second stage (when persuading the court that a particular issue needs to be revisited).  By the time of the rehearing itself the applicant will already have made the running by successfully adducing evidence to persuade the court to carry out an appropriate kind of rehearing and there is no need for further safeguards against unwarranted challenges to settled findings.   </p>

The practical arrangements for the hearing may well be influenced by what occurred in the earlier proceedings, but insofar as the concepts mentioned in the previous paragraph might suggest that a rehearing is in principle a different process to an ordinary factfinding hearing, that would be wrong.  In saying this, I am reassured that there is no indication that any of the concepts have played any noticeable part in the decisionmaking in the reported cases.  To take an example, in <span style="font-style:italic">Re Q (Fact-Finding Rehearing)</span> 2019 EWFC 60, Baker LJ (sitting as a judge of the High Court) carried out a rehearing of findings that he had made in relation to a father’s responsibility for injuries to a child in respect of which the mother was subsequently convicted at a criminal trial.

She concluded that all of the injuries were inflicted by AO and not by either parent. </p>

Whilst it is the case that the new evidence regarding the violent conduct of F towards C in the family home indicates F was eminently <span style="font-style:italic">capable</span> of fracturing C’s femur after she returned to the care of him and M on the evening of 7 September 2014, on her own statement before this court AO remains the more likely perpetrator of that injury. On AO’s <span style="font-style:italic">own</span> account to the police, [and] her own statement before this court, which I am satisfied she did not resile from successfully, and her own concessions in oral evidence, I am satisfied that there is no proper basis in the new evidence for amending the finding of Her Honour Judge Hughes with respect to the fracture to the femur. I am further reinforced in my conclusions by the new evidence that comprises statements by E and the transcript of E’s ABE interview. In this context, Her Honour Judge Hughes’ finding also remains consistent with the medical evidence as set out above. I of course note the points made by Mr Feehan and Ms Hobbs (which I must also observe are not, strictly, matters arising from the new evidence before the court) that the perception of swelling by a non-expert can be unreliable, that in cross-examination neither parent described swelling to any great extent, that C was returned to their care “whingeing” or “whimpering” rather than </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.00in">I am however satisfied that the finding of Her Honour Judge Hughes that AO was also the perpetrator of the earlier physical injuries to C requires amendment considering the new evidence... The finding made by Her Honour Judge Hughes followed the learned judge’s acceptance of the evidence of F and M regarding the circumstances in their home, which evidence was accepted. Within this context and having regard to her conclusions regarding the fractured femur, Her Honour Judge Hughes was satisfied that AO was responsible for all of the injuries. However, this position has significantly altered in light of the new evidence. The allegations made by the children regarding the violent conduct by F towards C are corroborated both by admissions on the part of F himself of physical abuse of the children, and evidence of other adults regarding what they saw or were told. The descriptions of violence given by the children are consistent with the type and level of violence the expert witnesses considered would be required to cause the earlier injuries. As set out above, I have made findings against F regarding his physical violence towards the children. This court has concluded that Her Honour Judge Hughes’ finding that AO was responsible for the fracture to C’s femur is sound notwithstanding the new evidence. However, I am also satisfied that the findings I have made with respect to F’s use of physical violence against the children alter the analysis in respect of the earlier injuries. Having considered the totality of the evidence that was not available to Her Honour Judge Hughes, I am satisfied that the learned Judge’s finding that the earlier injuries were caused by AO must be amended to a finding that the earlier injuries were caused by one or other or both of F and AO. The Schedule of Findings will be amended accordingly…” And the judge then listed injuries 1 to 4 above before concluding: </p>

Moreover, where the evidence suggests that there is a real likelihood or possibility that [that] <span style="font-style:italic">is</span> what occurred then that is the conclusion to which the court must come. In the circumstances, whilst I bear in mind the inherent improbabilities involved,  I am satisfied that the amended finding follows from the new evidence on the balance of probabilities. Whilst the new evidence provides [the] basis for revisiting findings in relation to the earlier injuries, it does not do so in relation to last injury. Sometimes, sadly, children are injured by more than one person.” </p>

He should have reconsidered all of the evidence but he instead restricted himself to a review of the previous findings in the light of the new evidence.  This first error led to a second one, namely that the judge privileged the old evidence over the new, effectively reversing the burden of proof and requiring AO to show that the previous finding was wrong, as if the court was engaged on an appeal and not on a rehearing. </p>

He submitted that while the judge recorded some of these arguments, he did not sufficiently analyse them and take them into account.  Specifically, he argued that it was impossible for AO to have been a possible perpetrator of Injury 3 because she did not have care of C during the relevant period.  The outcome is in that respect absurd and should have informed the assessment to be made of the other injuries.  On examination, this submission was modified to contend that it was not impossible but wholly implausible that AO caused that injury.   </p>

In any case, he carried out the required task in substance.  His conclusions were clearly open to him in the light of a number of serious difficulties with AO’s case, some of which the judge noted.  Mr Bagchi placed particular focus on the last injury, which is the only one in respect the judge made a formal finding with potential legal consequences.  His reasoning, based on AO’s own account of the child suffering a leg injury in her home, was clearly open to him.  Once that is accepted, there could be no purpose in a rehearing in relation to injuries in respect of which a ‘pool finding’ was made.  In any case, the evidence about the times when C was in AO’s care did not lead to the conclusion that she could not possibly have caused Injury 3.  Mr Bagchi also referred to the judge’s very negative credibility assessment of AO as being an unimpressive witness who had a marked habit of dissembling and obfuscating.   </p>

Having now heard the appeal, that is indeed my conclusion.  The judge’s description of his task as ‘not re-trying the issue <span style="font-style:italic">in toto</span>’ was not correct, but the judgment shows that this misdirection did not lead to any error of substance.  He fully reheard the case and factored in all of the evidence when reaching his conclusions.  He did not privilege the previous findings or discriminate against the later evidence.  He did not reverse the burden of proof.  I therefore reject the first basis upon which this appeal is brought. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Feehan’s further submission is that there was a failure to adequately address and act upon the many arguments made on behalf of AO in the changed circumstances where the parents had been revealed as serious child abusers.  In making this submission he faces the steep path that any appellant must climb when challenging findings of fact, a path that is all the steeper in this case, where the judge had a panoramic view of the two households arising from his conduct of the later proceedings.  I do not accept that he failed to address the arguments sufficiently.  The judgment shows that he fully grasped the issues and it was not necessary for him to set out every submission and response in full detail.  He was clearly alert to the significance of his findings about the parents and to the inherent probabilities.  But for him the key point related to the last injury.  Dependable evidence from these adults was in short supply, but it was undoubtedly the case that C suffered a significant injury in the care of AO and in the absence of the parents.  The medical evidence was supportive of, or at least consistent with, this being the injury that led to C’s admission to hospital the following day.  AO’s conduct in getting the parents to join her in lying about where the injury had occurred was also plainly relevant to the assessment of culpability, as was the judge’s unchallenged assessment of her credibility.  The conclusion that AO was responsible for this injury was based on a process of reasoning that cannot be successfully challenged. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Against this background it is also impossible to say that the judge was wrong to conclude that there was a real possibility that AO had caused the earlier injuries.  There was a lack of detailed evidence about C’s movements between these two abusive households, but in the light of the evidence about the last injury, it cannot be said that the case against AO rested solely on opportunity.  As to Injury 3, Mr Feehan did not establish that AO could not have caused this injury, or that the evidence about it should have led to a complete reassessment of the evidence overall.  I also agree with Mr Bagchi that if the appeal fails in relation to the last injury, there would be no purpose in remitting the ‘pool findings’ alone for rehearing, still less one individual ‘pool finding’.   </p>
