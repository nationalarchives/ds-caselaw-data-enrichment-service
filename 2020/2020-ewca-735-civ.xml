	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The issue arises in proceedings in the Court of Protection concerning a 36-year-old man with a complex diagnosis of autistic spectrum disorder combined with impaired cognition. The question before the judge at first instance, and in written submissions presented to this court before the hearing, was couched in different terms, namely whether a person, in order have capacity to <span style="font-style:italic">consent</span> to such relations, must understand that the other person must consent. Those are the terms in which the issue of capacity and sexual relations have been discussed in all reported cases up to now. None of those cases, however, directly concerned the specific issue arising in this case. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The issue is of great importance to people with learning disabilities or acquired disorders of the brain or mind. It requires the court to balance three fundamental principles of public interest. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The first is the principle of autonomy. This principle lies the heart of the Mental Capacity Act 2005 and the case law under that Act. It underpins the purpose of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 2006, as defined in article 1: </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The second is the principle that vulnerable people in society must be protected. As this court observed in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">B v A Local Authority</span> [2019] EWCA Civ 913 (at para 35): </p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:-0.50in"> Striking a balance between the first and second principles is often the most important aspect of decision-making in the Court of Protection.

	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.00in">“It is important to balance people’s right to make a decision with their right to safety and protection when they can’t make decisions to protect themselves.” </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">There is, however, a third principle that arises in this case. The Mental Capacity Act and the Court of Protection do not exist in a vacuum. They are part of a wider system of law and justice. Sexual relations between two people can only take place with the full and ongoing consent of both parties. This principle has acquired greater recognition in recent years within society at large and within the justice system. The greater recognition has occurred principally in the criminal and family courts, but it must extend across the whole justice system. The Court of Protection is concerned </p>

	</paragraph>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">first and foremost with the individual who is the subject of proceedings, “P”. But as part of the wider system for the administration of justice, it must adhere to general principles of law. Furthermore, as a public authority, the Court of Protection has an obligation under s.6 of the Human Rights Act 1998 not to act in a way which is incompatible with a right under the European Convention of Human Rights, as set out in Sch.1 to the Act. Within the court, that obligation usually arises when considering the human rights of P. But it also extends to the rights of others. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Throughout his life, JB has suffered from severe epilepsy. Repeated analysis over the years has concluded that his global intellectual functioning is not at a level which would lead to an overall classification of learning disability, although tests have shown that he has marked problems in several areas, including adaptive functioning and social interactions. In 2011, JB was assessed as having Asperger’s Syndrome, and this diagnosis has been confirmed in subsequent assessments.  He has been assessed as lacking capacity to make decisions in a number of areas, including making decisions about contact with others, making decisions as to his residence, making decisions about access to social media, consenting to arrangements about his care, and the conduct of legal proceedings.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">For the past six years, JB has lived in a supported living placement with a comprehensive care plan with restrictions on his ability to live independently. In particular, there are restrictions on his access to the local community, his contact with other people, and his access to social media and the internet. The restrictions on contact and access to the community have been imposed principally because of his tendency to behave inappropriately towards women. Under his care plan, he has 1:1 supervision when out in the community and, in particular, when in the presence of women. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">For many years, including during the course of this litigation, JB has said in clear terms that he has a strong desire to have a girlfriend and engage in sexual relations. He wishes to have less support and to have time unaccompanied in the community so that he can go on dates and have more unsupervised access to the internet. Unfortunately, he has consistently demonstrated disinhibited behaviour towards women, which has led those who care for him to conclude that he cannot safely have unsupervised contact with them. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The pattern of JB’s behaviour was described in the evidence put before the judge, in particular in reports from two clinical psychologists, Dr Susan Thrift and Dr Jillian Peters, instructed in the course of the proceedings. Dr Thrift examined the records relating to JB and found repeated references throughout the documentation describing how he became fixated on particular women, contacting them via social media or text messages, and making advances towards them that were sexualised or otherwise inappropriate. From her interviews with JB, Dr Peters concluded that he represented a moderate risk of sexual offending to women. Her report included the following passage (quoted by the judge at paragraph 53 of her judgment): </p>

	</paragraph>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.00in">“Based on descriptions of his previous and ongoing behaviours, this is most likely to take the form of sexual harassment through the form of repeated, unwanted sexually explicit messages to females whose numbers he has obtained or whom he contacts through social media or dating sites. [JB] has also been observed to have limited social boundaries around women, particularly those who are vulnerable but also women in pubs or clubs whom he has approached whilst dancing. Additionally, he acknowledges not being able to judge women's reactions to him and that he is unwilling to directly ask for clarification of these issues. In these and similar situations the risk is of [JB] sexually touching these women without consent. In terms of vulnerable women who do not have the capacity to consent to sexual relations, there is a risk of [JB] not recognising or respecting this fact, resulting in the potential for rape to occur.” </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">As a result of his behaviour, JB was stopped from taking part in a range of social activities, including clubs attended by persons with learning disabilities. On one occasion, JB’s behaviour led to a police investigation. Although there was an allegation that he had assaulted a woman, the police decided not to prosecute. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">On 25 April 2017, the local authority filed an application in the Court of Protection seeking declarations as to his capacity in various matters and “a decision that it is in [JB]’s best interests to receive care and support in the community with such arrangements to include restrictions on his contact with women and that such restrictions and any deprivation of liberty arising as a result is authorised by the court as a relevant decision”. The Official Solicitor accepted a request to act as JB’s litigation friend. After the proceedings had been continuing for eighteen months, during which time three reports were prepared by Dr Thrift, directions were given transferring the matter to be heard by a High Court judge and listed for hearing before Roberts J in July 2019. By the time of the hearing, the parties had reached agreement on the majority of issues about JB’s capacity, including that he lacked capacity to conduct the proceedings and to make decisions relating to his residence, care and support, contact with others and as to his use of the internet and social media. There remained an issue as to whether he had the capacity to consent to sexual relations. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In her initial report, Dr Thrift recorded that JB understood the mechanics of sexual acts and the risks of pregnancy and sexually-transmitted disease. She reported, however, that his “understanding of consent is lacking”. He defined consent as “one party allowing the other party to have sex without the other party complaining”. When asked about withdrawing consent, JB said: </p>

He thought that a woman who had got drunk at a party and had sex with a man was “fair game” for anyone else.   </p>

He lacked the ability to understand or weigh the importance of ensuring his partner was consenting as a pertinent factor in his decision making.  For those reasons, Dr Thrift concluded in her first report that, “despite the capacity test for sexual relations being low, JB does not understand and therefore weigh highly pertinent factors in relation to having consenting sexual relations”. She predicted that, if he were to be unsupported in the community and/or return to a club for people with learning disabilities, there was a high risk that he would commit a sexual assault in pursuit of a sexual relationship. </p>

She was informed that the understanding of consent was not part of the information relevant to the decision and invited to agree with the Official Solicitor’s view that, when applying the established legal test, JB had capacity to consent to sexual relations. In a short second report in reply to this letter, Dr Thrift concluded that, on the basis of the legal test as described in the supplemental letter of instruction, JB had the ability to consent to sexual relations. </p>

The local authority applied for permission to appeal against the ruling, which was refused by the judge on 24 October. The case proceeded to a further hearing at which the judge made final declarations as to JB’s capacity in those other areas and a number of further interim orders as to JB’s best interests in the light of those declarations. The care plan included provision for close supervision of JB in the community, and a programme for treatment and education “to improve his social awareness and to mitigate the risks posed to him by others”.

The declaration was granted and the application for an injunction resolved by way of undertakings given by the parents.

A psychiatrist gave evidence that, given the complainant’s impaired intellectual functioning and highly aroused state, she would not have had the ability to consent to sexual contact at the time of the alleged offence. The judge directed the jury that the complainant would have been unable to refuse sexual activity if she had lacked the capacity to choose whether to agree to it for any reason, including an irrational fear arising from her mental disorder. The defendant was convicted. The Court of Appeal allowed his appeal against conviction, stating, <span style="font-style:italic">inter alia</span>, that irrational fear which prevented the exercise of choice could not be equated with lack of capacity to choose and, relying on Munby J’s analysis in the two cases cited, that a lack of capacity to choose was issue-specific and not person- or situation-specific. </p>

Provided that the inability to refuse is ‘because of or for a reason related to a mental disorder’ (section 30(1)(c)), and the other ingredients of the offence are made out, the perpetrator is guilty.

Autonomy entails the freedom and the capacity to make a choice of whether or not to do so. This is entirely consistent with the respect for autonomy in matters of private life which is guaranteed by article 8 of [ECHR]. The object of the 2003 Act was to get away from the previous ‘status’-based approach which assumed that all ‘defectives’ lacked capacity, and thus deny them the possibility of making autonomous choices, while failing to protect those whose mental disorder deprived them of autonomy in other ways.” </p>

But it does not follow the capacity to marry is spouse- as opposed to status- specific. Far from it.

Although sharing physical similarities to sexual congress in the animal kingdom, that between human beings is qualitatively different. It has not just a physical but an emotional and moral component as well. Victims of sexual assault rarely refer to physical injury, their emphasis is on emotional damage and moral violation. Whether these concepts can be incorporated into a test of capacity is of course an important question but it is essential to acknowledge their significance in human relationships. </p>

That of itself tells one nothing of capacity itself which requires a quite separate consideration.” </p>

The difficulty in the Court of Protection is the need to determine capacity apart from specific persons or situations: H is in one sense a classic illustration of the problem. On the other hand one can see as a criminal lawyer the difficulties raised by a general finding in relation to a person who without knowledge of it embarks on what he thinks is consensual sexual activity. The focus of the criminal law must inevitably be both act and person and situation sensitive; the essential protective jurisdiction of this court, however, has to be effective to work on a wider canvas. It is in those circumstances that I find myself closer to the views expressed by Munby J (as he then was) and Mostyn J although I have reached that position by a more tortuous route.” </p>

The issues arising in that case did not include the capacity to consent to sexual relations. It concerned a woman with significant learning disabilities who cohabited with a man, whom she later married while he was imprisoned for sexual offences. The local authority, concerned that she would be at risk on his release, issued proceedings under the MCA seeking declarations that she lacked capacity <span style="font-style:italic">inter alia</span> in respect of making decisions about contact, residence and care. It was the local authority’s case that, despite having capacity to marry, the woman lacked capacity to decide whether to cohabit with her husband. The judge at first instance made declarations in line with the local authority’s case, but his decision was overturned on appeal. It was held by this Court (Richards, McFarlane and Lewison LJJ) that, since she had had the capacity to marry, and there had been no change in her capacity since her marriage, there was insufficient evidence for the judge to justify his finding that she lacked capacity in relation to cohabitation. </p>

Some decisions, for example agreeing to marry or consenting to divorce, are status or act specific. Some other decisions, for example whether P should have contact with a particular individual, may be person-specific. But all decisions, whatever their nature, fall to be evaluated within the straightforward and clear structure of MCA 2005, ss 1 to 3 which requires the court to have regard to 'a matter' requiring 'a decision'. There is neither need nor justification for the plain words of the statute to be embellished. I do not agree with the Official Solicitor's submission that absurd consequences flow from a failure to adopt either an actspecific or a person-specific approach to each category of decision that may fall for consideration. To the contrary, I endorse Mr Hallin's argument [on behalf of the local authority] to the effect that removing the specific factual context from some decisions leaves nothing for the evaluation of capacity to bite upon. The MCA 2005 itself makes a distinction between some decisions (set out in s.27) which as a category are exempt from the court's welfare jurisdiction once the relevant incapacity is established (for example consent to marriage, sexual relations or divorce) and other decisions (set out in s.17) which are intended, for example, to relate to a 'specified person' or specific medical treatments.” </p>

It is not an irrelevant consideration; indeed (as we have emphasised) the statute mandates that it be taken into account but the notional process of using and weighing information attributed to the protected person should not involve a refined analysis of the sort which does not typically inform the decision to consent to sexual relations made by a person of full capacity ….[T]he information typically, and we stress typically, regarded by persons of full capacity as relevant to the decision whether to consent to sexual relations is relatively limited. The temptation to expand that field of information in an attempt to simulate more widely informed decision-making is likely to lead to what Bodey J rightly identified as both paternalism and a derogation from personal autonomy.” </p>

NB is a woman suffering from a “general global learning difficulty” who at the time of the hearing had been married to her husband for 27 years. A safeguarding inquiry was instigated following comments made by NB which gave rise to concerns that she might be vulnerable to sexual exploitation. After she was provided with a programme of sex education, a psychologist undertook an assessment to establish her understanding of sexual matters. He concluded that she lacked an understanding of the association between sexual intercourse and pregnancy. The local authority brought proceedings seeking a declaration that she lacked capacity to consent to sexual relations. The evidence indicated that NB enjoyed being married, was affectionate towards her husband, and occasionally initiated sexual relations. After an initial hearing, the case attracted media coverage, and as a result NB’s husband, who had been frightened by the publicity, left the parties’ home and disengaged from the proceedings.   </p>

If judged incapacitous because he or she has no comprehension that his or her consent is required before engaging in acts of a sexual nature, he or she is potentially consigned to celibate abstention unless capacity is established at some point in the future. In my judgment, to argue that a full and complete understanding of consent (in terms recognised by the criminal law) is an essential component of capacity to have sexual relations is to confuse the <span style="font-style:italic">nature</span> or <span style="font-style:italic">character</span> of a sexual act with its lawfulness. </p>

In this respect, I agree with the Official Solicitor that section 3 of the MCA 2005 is designed to determine what is often referred to as the ‘functional test’. It does not look to outcome or to the fact that the absence of consent from a sexual partner may expose P to the rigours of the criminal justice system. Had protection per se of the potential incapacitous in this respect been a driving factor of the 2005 Act or its subsequent judicial interpretation, no doubt appropriate (but necessary) inroads could have been made into the non-paternalistic ethos of the legislation. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.89in;margin-right:0.00in">If these conceptual issues are difficult enough for the capacitous to grasp, it seems to me that very great care is needed before imposing on the potentially incapacitous the need to understand these quasi-criminal principles and the potential for consent to be withdrawn by the other party at any stage. In my judgment, importing into the test for capacity and/or the information which informs that test a requirement for an understanding of parallel and continuing consent in a sexual partner imposes a test which is set too high. I do not accept that it is appropriate to increase the bar for the potentially incapacitous and thus potentially deprive them of a fundamental and basic human right to participate in sexual relations merely because the raising of that bar might provide protection for either P himself or for any victim of non-consensual sex when those consequences are viewed through the prism of the criminal law. Whilst the ability to use and weigh information remains relevant to a capacity assessment in the domain of sexual activity, it should not involve a refined or nuanced analysis which would not typically inform any decision to consent to such relations made by a capacitous individual. The law in this context strives to assist a potentially incapacitous individual to participate in the fullest experience of life. JB has already made it abundantly clear that he wishes his experience of life to include sexual relations and the ability to find a partner. To require him to demonstrate as an aspect of his fundamental capacity in this context a full appreciation of both his own and a partner’s initial and ongoing consent throughout the course of that sexual activity would be to impose on him a burden which a capacitous individual may not share and may well be unlikely to discharge. It is true that knowledge of the absence of consent might expose either to the risk of criminal prosecution but in both cases each is entitled to make the same mistakes which all human beings can, and do, make in the course of a lifetime.” </p>

Including this factor in the information relevant to the decision was not discriminatory against people who lack capacity because whether the other party can consent and is in fact consenting is a strong, and probably determinative, factor in a decision by a person of full capacity to have sex.

In subsequent cases, however, the analysis has focused on the first question to the exclusion of the second. The word “consent” implies agreeing to sexual relations proposed by someone else. But in the present case, it is JB who wishes to initiate sexual relations with women. The capacity in issue in the present case is therefore JB’s capacity to decide to engage in sexual relations.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In response to my suggestion during the hearing that the decision should be expressed not as whether to consent to sexual relations but whether to engage in sexual relations. Mr Patel on behalf of the Official Solicitor maintained that, even if the decision was expressed in those terms, the relevant information should not include an understanding of the consensuality of sexual relations, for the reasons set out in his skeleton argument as summarised above. In my judgment, however, none of those arguments stands up to scrutiny. The inclusion of an understanding of the other person’s consent as part of the relevant information does not, as he asserted, recast the test as “person-specific” but, rather, ensures that the information is firmly anchored to the decision in question, as required by statute and confirmed by this court in the <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">York</span> case. I accept that it is important for the test for capacity with regard to sexual relations to be as simple and straightforward as possible but that cannot justify excluding information which is manifestly relevant to the decision. And if the consensuality of sexual relations is part of the relevant information, it plainly relates to capacity itself rather than the exercise of capacity. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Patel understandably relies on earlier judicial observations that sexual activity, and decisions made about such activity, are “largely visceral rather than cerebral, owing more to instinct and emotion than to analysis”. But it has never been suggested that decisions are <span style="font-style:italic">exclusively</span> visceral or instinctive. It is, of course, true that sexual desire is emotional rather than intellectual, but for human beings the decision whether or not to engage in sexual relations obviously includes a cerebral element. It involves thought as well as instinct. And amongst the matters which every person engaging in sexual relations must think about is whether the other person is consenting. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Patel also relies on the point made in earlier judgments that the focus of the MCA is different from that of the criminal law. It would, however, be wrong and unprincipled to exclude an understanding of the consensuality of sexual relations from the relevant information on the grounds that non-consensual sexual acts should be dealt with by the criminal justice system. As illustrated by the background history to this application, which includes an incident of alleged sexual abuse in respect of which the police decided to take no action, the criminal justice system does not necessarily deal with such cases and there may well be good reason for this, because the police and the prosecution authorities have a discretion whether or not to pursue every potentially available criminal charge and exercise that discretion in the public interest. But even if it could be guaranteed that such incidents were dealt with by the criminal courts, to leave such matters to the criminal justice system would be an abdication of the fundamental responsibilities of the Court of Protection, which include the duty to protect P from harm.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">As I said at the start of this judgment, striking a balance between the principle that vulnerable people in society must be protected and the principle of autonomy is often the most important aspect of decision-making in the Court of Protection. But I do not accept the argument that including an understanding of the consensuality of sexual relations as part of the information relevant to the decision about the capacity regarding sexual relations amounts to an unwarranted infringement of JB’s personal autonomy or of his rights. Insofar as it is a restriction of his autonomy and his rights, it cannot be described as discriminatory because it is a restriction which applies to everybody, regardless of capacity. As social beings, we all accept restrictions on our autonomy that are necessary for the protection of others. No man is an island. This principle is well recognised in the European Convention on Human Rights. For example, the rights in Article 8 are not absolute and must be balanced against other interests, including the rights of others.  Although the Court of Protection’s principal responsibility is towards P, it is part of the wider system of justice which exists to protect society as a whole. As I said at the outset of this judgment, the Mental Capacity Act and the Court of Protection do not exist in a vacuum. They are part of a system of law and justice in which it is recognised that sexual relations between two people can only take place with the full and ongoing consent of both parties.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I recognise that, by recasting the decision as the decision to engage in sexual relations, and by including an understanding of the consensuality of sexual relations as part of the information relevant to the decision, we are moving on from the previous case law. But that is because the issues arising in this case and the arguments presented to us have not been considered by this Court before. In my judgment, however, it is not inconsistent with the earlier authorities of this Court. As recognised by this Court in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">B</span><span style="font-style:italic"> </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">v A Local Authority</span>, “what comprises relevant information for determining an individual's capacity to consent to sexual relations has developed and become more comprehensive over time.” That development has continued in this case. The Court in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">IM v LM</span> stressed that “the notional process of using and weighing information attributed to the protected person should not involve a refined analysis of the sort which does not typically inform the decision to consent to sexual relations made by a person of full capacity”. But as already stated, the information which a capacitous individual must take into account in deciding whether to engage in sexual relations includes whether or not the other person is consenting. My decision in this case is therefore not inconsistent with earlier decisions of this Court. As for the decisions at </p>

In fairness to the judge, I think she was understandably led into this approach by dicta in previous reported cases and by submissions given to her by counsel, who in turn were influenced by the earlier cases. But in my view it is unnecessary and inappropriate to consider whether “a full and complete understanding of consent <span style="font-style:italic">in terms recognised by the criminal law</span>” (my emphasis) is an essential component of capacity to have sexual relations. What is needed, in my view, is an understanding that you should only have sex with someone who is able to consent and gives and maintains consent throughout. The protection given by such a requirement is not confined to the criminal legal consequences. It protects both participants from serious harm. </p>

There may be occasions, I suppose, where someone genuinely makes a mistake about whether their sexual partner is giving or maintaining consent. But that circumstance, if it ever arises, is very different from the situation where one person does not understand that the other person has to give and maintain consent. </p>
