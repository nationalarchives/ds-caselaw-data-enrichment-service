	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The judicial review claim brought by the appellant (and a number of affected individuals) contended that the removal of the congestion charge exemption unlawfully indirectly discriminated against certain groups of minicab drivers on grounds of race and gender and against some passengers on grounds of disability contrary to s.19 of the Equality Act 2010; and was in breach of articles 8 and 14 of the Human Rights Act 1998. The challenge was rejected on all grounds by Lewis J. The appeal (with permission granted by McCombe LJ on 1 November 2019) relates only to the claims pursued under the Equality Act 2010. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The claims proceeded before Lewis J, at least initially, on the accepted basis that the changes to the Scheme involve indirect discrimination against minicab drivers from minority ethnic backgrounds, with the centrally contested question being whether the disproportionate adverse impact was objectively justified. That may be thought unsurprising in circumstances where it was and remains common ground that 94% of licensed minicab drivers in London are from black and minority ethnic backgrounds, with 71% of minicab drivers living in the most deprived areas of London, with earnings of, on average, less than £23,000 (net) per annum. By comparison, 88% of drivers of hackney carriages (known colloquially as black cabs, or taxis) are white and as a group are wholly unaffected by the changes to the Scheme. This significant disparity of impact between black and minority ethnic minicab drivers on low incomes on the one hand and white taxi drivers on the other is stark and has raised legitimate questions about the measure adopted by the Mayor. It has made this appeal particularly troubling. </p>

The Scheme imposes a charge in respect of an area within Central London referred to as the Congestion Charging Zone (“the CCZ”). Article 4 of the scheme provides for a charge (known as the congestion charge) to be imposed in respect of each charging day on which a vehicle uses or is kept on a designated road, i.e. one in the CCZ, during charging hours. At the material time the charge was specified as £10.50 if a particular payment method (known as Auto Pay) was used, or £11.50 if any other payment method was used. The charges were payable for a vehicle which uses or is kept on a road within the CCZ between 7 am and 6 pm on any day except Saturday, Sunday or certain designated public holidays.

It seems that a reduction in congestion and traffic will result only if either fewer journeys are made into the CCZ or if a smaller number of vehicles carry out more journeys in the CCZ. If, for example, passengers are required to bear all or part of the cost of the congestion charge but considered that to be too expensive, they might switch to (cheaper) public transport or decline to travel into the CCZ. In relation to the second possibility, if, to use a theoretical and very simplified example, there were 20 private hire vehicles each completing one journey into the CCZ prior the congestion charge, but changes in behaviour mean that 10 no longer travel into the CCZ and the work into, within and out of the CCZ is carried out by the other 10 vehicles, there may be a similar amount of journeys made but the number of vehicles involved in making those journeys is reduced. That may result in fewer vehicles in the CCZ. Consequently, there could in theory be a reduction in congestion within the CCZ.  </p>

CEPA forecast, however, that some customers would switch from one private hire vehicle operator to an alternative operator in order to find a lower price. They also considered that some of the customers who switched would change from private hire vehicles to taxis. They did not forecast that most passengers who did change their behaviour would switch away from private vehicles or taxis to public transport such as buses or the tube. Rather, CEPA said that it would "assume most customers would remain in the PHV/taxi sector with 'switching' customers allocated to operators with low fares and a large existing CCZ presence". </p>

CEPA noted that specialisation could occur when journeys were undertaken with fewer vehicles entering the CCZ, for example, by designating certain private hire vehicles for work within the CCZ or allocating work to private hire vehicles already within the CCZ. CEPA assumed that only the largest operators (in effect, two of the current operators) would be able to specialise in that way.

Doing so would mean that a smaller number of vehicles specialise in taking bookings within the zone, potentially undertaking more trips in the zone than they would have previously.

In response, TfL commissioned further work from CEPA to consider Oxera's report. The further work by CEPA (Appendix E to the Report to the Mayor at Appendix 2) states that their view remains that some specialisation is likely to occur as a response to competitive pressure. It also clearly acknowledges that there are uncertainties with regard to the scale of specialisation; however, the impact on traffic is not dependent on their judgement of specialisation. CEPA also explained that the 1% reduction in traffic is a conservative estimate. TfL support CEPA's analysis and note that the reduction in traffic is more closely tied to the demand response than specialisation.

Removing the exemption for PHVs should reduce the number of vehicles in the zone and, therefore, help to improve air quality. The introduction of the CVD may further incentivise PHV drivers continuing to drive in the CCZ to do so in the cleanest possible vehicle. These will complement other initiatives including the introduction of the ULEZ Scheme in April 2019.”” </p>

The judge held as follows: </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.00in;text-indent:0.00in">“74. The measure adopted by the defendant does correspond to a real need. The need is to reduce the number of vehicles within the CCZ. The removal of the exemption from the congestion charge for private hire vehicles does reflect, or correspond, to a real need. The number of private hire vehicles had increased substantially since the Scheme was introduced in 2003. The number of private hire vehicles had increased from around 50,000 to over 87,000 and the number of licensed private hire vehicle drivers has more than doubled from around 55,000 to over 113,000 between 2008/2009 and 2017/2018. There was no similar increase in taxis or taxi drivers. The forecast was that the removal of the exemption could lead to a reduction of 6% in the number of private hire vehicles in the CCZ (which would amount to a reduction of 1% in traffic overall). The measure would, therefore, address the need to reduce the number of vehicles in the CCZ. Furthermore, where a measure is intended to operate, at least in part, by seeking to change the behaviour of individuals (here operators and drivers of private hire vehicles, and passengers) it is reasonable to rely on forecasts of the likely change. At the time that the measure was adopted, the forecast was of a reduction. The defendant was entitled to rely on those forecasts. It is also permissible to have regard to subsequent events to determine whether the forecast changes have materialised. As it happens, in the relatively short time since the amendments to the Scheme came into force, and bearing in mind there may be other factors at play, the evidence is that the reduction in traffic is broadly in line with the forecast. The evidence of Ms Calderato, in her second witness statement, is that private hire vehicles are making between approximately 3,000 and 6,800 fewer entries into the CCZ.  </p>

The removal of the exemption from private hire vehicles (other than the small number of wheelchair-accessible vehicles) was an appropriate and suitable method of reducing the number of vehicles in the CCZ. It could result either in fewer journeys into the CCZ or a more rational use of the road space within the CCZ with a smaller number of private hire vehicles performing the number of journeys previously undertaken by a larger number of such vehicles (and reducing the number of vehicles travelling empty within the CCZ). The method adopted was reasonably necessary for that end. Unless steps were taken to reduce the number of private hire vehicles in the CCZ there would remain a real problem of a large number of private hire vehicles driving into the CCZ. Taking steps by removing the exemption from congestion charge would have an impact on that as it was forecast to result in fewer trips into, and better use of private hire vehicles within, the CCZ.” </p>

Furthermore, the evidence showed that 19% of minicab passengers are registered disabled compared with 14% of taxi passengers, yet there was a failure to consider, quantify and assess the needs of those disabled passengers who prefer to travel whilst not sitting in a wheelchair or whose mobility impairment or disability does not require them to travel while sitting in a wheelchair, but who have a greater need for travel by minicab. </p>

As indicated above, he summarised that material at length at paragraphs 29 to 45 and plainly understood its import. He set out the nature and seriousness of the congestion problem as discussed in the Mayor’s transport strategy and in the Consultation Report. He expressly recognised that the CEPA forecast of a 6% reduction in the number of private hire vehicles in the CCZ amounting to a forecast reduction of 1% of traffic in the CCZ overall, was based on assumptions made by CEPA: see to that effect his observation at paragraph 30, “<span style="font-style:italic">Reading the CEPA Report, and the request for a decision, it seems that the forecast was based on a certain number of assumptions</span>”. These assumptions were identified by him from the material as including the likely behaviour of passengers in response to increased prices due to part or all of the congestion charge being passed on to them, resulting in lower demand for minicabs and fewer such journeys; and changes in behaviour by minicab drivers and operators, again resulting in fewer journeys into the CCZ. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly, Lewis J was plainly alive to the criticisms made in the Oxera Report and in particular, that Oxera took issue with the 1% assessment as unreliable and unlikely to be realised, and criticised the assumption that there would be specialisation in the use of private hire vehicles within the CCZ. These criticisms, together with the CEPA Reply to them are adequately reflected in the judgment and I reject Mr Collins QC’s criticisms to the contrary effect. It is not necessary for a judge to conduct a line by line analysis of all the evidence available, nor is there any duty on a judge, in giving reasons, to deal with every argument presented by counsel in support of his or her case. The judge’s function is to reach conclusions and give reasons to support those conclusions. That is what Lewis J did.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">It is implicit in the conclusions reached that the judge accepted CEPA’s forecast reduction of 1% overall as a conservative estimate that was not dependent on specialisation by PHV operators, but was more closely tied to the demand response. Having done so he expressly accepted that it was reasonable for the Mayor and Transport for London to rely on forecasts of the reduction in traffic overall in circumstances where the measure was intended to operate by seeking to change behaviours of operators, minicab drivers and passengers for the future. Finally, although considered in isolation divorced from its relevant context, a 1% reduction overall may be regarded by the appellant as very small, it is clear that Transport for London viewed a 1% reduction in traffic in the CCZ as meaningful, describing it as a not “<span style="font-style:italic">insignificant benefit where the potential for more radical change (during charging hours) was very limited but congestion is still   increasing</span>”. Moreover, the forecast of a 1% reduction must be set against the inevitability of future traffic increases overall caused by rising numbers of minicabs in the CCZ if nothing were done. The judge concluded that the measure corresponded to a real need to reduce traffic and congestion and on the evidence, he was entitled to do so. </p>

The judge referred to the evidence of Ms Calderato, Head of Transport Strategy and Planning for Transport for London, of a sustained decrease of between 3000 and 6800 (approximately) entries into the CCZ by minicabs in the short period after the changes were implemented. Ms Calderato acknowledged the fact that the simultaneous introduction of the ULEZ charge might be contributing to the reduction and recognised that the data could not determine the relative contribution of any one factor over another to the reduction in unique PHV entries into the zone. However she was able to identify the percentage of minicabs complying with ULEZ standards as at 31 May 2019 (72.6%) and who were therefore not required to pay the ULEZ charge when entering the zone and inferred as a consequence that the reduction in unique PHV entries into the CCZ was “<span style="font-style:italic">in large part due to</span>” the measure. She concluded that “<span style="font-style:italic">the reduction remains within or just below the range CEPA predicted on a monthly basis</span>”. The judge expressly recognised the limitations of the evidence about subsequent events and the fact that other factors might be at play, but in light of the evidence was entitled to reach the conclusions he did in this regard. </p>

There was evidence from Ms Calderato who referred to surveys conducted by Transport for London showing this to be the case. Nor did the judge assume, as the appellant suggests, that minicab drivers would be able to recall every postcode in London in order to avoid driving into the zone by refusing to accept jobs with postcodes in the CCZ. Rather, he identified Transport for London’s expectation that drivers would become more adept over time at using the destination postcode system to avoid journeys into the CCZ; or alternatively if that did not occur, that Uber would adapt the system in order to enable drivers to choose whether or not to enter the zone. </p>

If that were, the case, the evaluation of whether the measure was appropriate might have been skewed. Put simply, we wondered whether stating the maintenance of the existing level of wheelchair accessible vehicles as a second part of the aim could be regarded as a device designed to achieve a pre-determined outcome whereby taxi drivers were preferred over PHV drivers. Secondly, it seemed to us that the first aim of reducing congestion could be regarded as having been inaccurately stated: our concern was that the real aim was simply to reduce or stem the increase in the number of minicabs in the CCZ. As Singh LJ observed in the course of argument, if on a true analysis, the true aim was simply to reduce the number of minicabs, there would be real concern about the legitimacy of such an aim bearing in mind the close correlation between minicab drivers and people from black and minority ethnic communities on the one hand, and the stark contrast with the predominantly white taxi driver workforce. These matters were raised with the parties who were given time and an opportunity to respond to our concerns. </p>

The question of removing the congestion charge exemption for taxis was raised during the consultation process but was rejected for a number of legitimate reasons. First, taxis are subject to different regulatory rules that legally oblige them to be wheelchair accessible and to provide a range of other accessibility features for disabled passengers. Secondly, they are compelled to accept any hire within a 6 mile radius of Charing Cross of up to one hour in duration or 12 miles long. This means they must accept a hire where the destination is the CCZ and refusing to do so amounts to a potential offence. Thirdly, they are expected to take the shortest, most direct route to fulfil a hire. Fourthly, there is no ability for taxi drivers to set their own fares which are regulated by Transport for London. Taxis could not therefore recoup the charge from passengers under the current regulations. Accordingly, a different scheme involving removing the exemption for taxis would have required changes to the regulations governing taxis and would, inevitably, have involved a far more complicated scheme. As Ms Demetriou was entitled to emphasise, it is legitimate for a decision maker to consider the ease with which a measure can be administered and its simplicity; and open to a decision maker to reject a potential alternative as too complicated. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">So far as the first aim of reducing traffic congestion is concerned, Ms Demetriou concedes that if the aim was not to reduce congestion but was in fact simply to reduce the number of minicabs, it would not be legitimate. There was and is no power to cap the number of minicabs licensed by Transport for London and to seek to achieve this result by means of the congestion charging scheme would be ultra vires its purpose. However, for the reasons which follow, I accept that the reduction in the number of minicabs in the CCZ was not an aim in itself for some extraneous reason unrelated to congestion but was the means by which the Mayor’s aim of reducing congestion was and is to be achieved. Transport for London’s advice in the Request for a Mayoral decision set out an analysis of the way in which exemptions from payment of the congestion charge were having a direct impact on the effectiveness of the Scheme. The evidence demonstrated that the number of cars in the CCZ was reducing, the number of taxis was stable, but the number of minicabs, all exempt from payment of the charge, was increasing to a degree that was never envisaged. In those circumstances, there were sound and legitimate factual reasons for concluding that the most effective mechanism for reducing congestion was to reduce or stem the number of minicabs entering the CCZ. While it is true that the measure removes the PHV exemption from the congestion charge (while leaving the taxi and wheelchair accessible minicab exemptions in place), that is only because on the analysis of the experts and the decision maker, that was regarded as the best means of achieving the aim of reducing congestion in the CCZ. </p>

The mere fact that the aim here is to reduce congestion while maintaining the existing level of wheelchair accessible passenger vehicles does not make it an illegitimate aim. Instead, the extent to which there is an adverse impact on some disabled people is an issue to be addressed at the proportionality stage. </p>

He dealt with this aspect of the evidence as part of his assessment of whether the measure was a proportionate means of achieving the aim, rather than whether it was appropriate and therefore legitimate.  I agree with his approach. The fact that a measure achieves benefits for one group of disabled people but disadvantages another group of disabled people does not by itself render the measure inappropriate or unsuitable to achieve the aim (although I can see that there might come a point where a measure is so incoherent or inconsistent in relation to its impact on different groups with the same protected characteristic that it might be said to be an irrational way of seeking to do so). That is however not this case. In my judgment the impacts, both positive and negative, for different groups of disabled people and others, fell properly to be considered at the proportionality stage of the analysis when considering whether the measure is a proportionate means of achieving the aims identified as legitimate.

I am satisfied by the evidence of Ms Calderato that those measures were not available measures. There was a suggestion that the congestion charge could be increased for all those presently liable to the charge (but private hire vehicles remaining exempt) and that might result in a reduction in traffic of 1% overall. First, that would not, in fact, address the increase in the number of private hire vehicles in the CCZ, nor the fact that a large number circulate without passengers. The aim is to reduce the number of such vehicles in the CCZ, by making changes which will either encourage fewer journeys into the CCZ or which will result in more efficient and better utilisation of private hire vehicles within the CCZ (fewer vehicles undertaking the journeys required, and fewer vehicles present in the CCZ without passengers). Measures aimed at producing a 1% reduction in traffic overall would not, of themselves, address the particular problems of the increase in the number of private hire vehicles in the CCZ. Furthermore, the evidence of Ms Calderato is that even a large increase in the congestion charge for those currently liable to pay it is unlikely to yield substantial reductions in the number of vehicles in the CCZ. Ms Calderato points out that an increase from £5 to £8 (more than 50%) in 2005 did not lead to any discernible reduction in traffic.” </p>

Rather, Lewis J recognised, as do I, that the expert analysis and evidence showed that a measure aimed at producing a 1% reduction in traffic overall would not by itself, address the particular congestion problem caused by the dramatic and unforeseen increase in the number of exempt minicabs in the CCZ at a time when the number of private cars in the CCZ was in fact falling, and the number of taxis was relatively stable.  In other words, if minicabs were not deterred from entering the CCZ in the particular circumstances, the overall traffic reduction or congestion reduction benefits were not likely to be achieved. In those circumstances it is unsurprising that Lewis J referred interchangeably to reduction of traffic and reduction in the number of minicabs.

This was part of a package of temporary measures (that included extending the operating hours for the congestion charging scheme each day to 10pm and to cover Saturdays and Sundays) to incentivise vehicles not to enter the CCZ following the lifting of lockdown and in circumstances where there was strong evidence of a reluctance among the public to use public transport. In the circumstances, I do not consider that the adoption of this package of temporary measures casts any doubt on the decision reached by Lewis J on the material then before him. Moreover, there was no other clear or obvious alternative that would achieve the desired reduction in a less intrusive way and nobody suggests that the Mayor was bound to consider every possible alternative, including those never identified or suggested.

Ms Demetriou submitted that the application of the proportionality test itself imported a stringent standard of scrutiny and no more was required. Furthermore she submitted that the Mayor enjoys a margin of appreciation as to both “the level of protection of the public interest in question” and his “selection of an appropriate means by which that protection can be provided”: see <span style="font-style:italic">R (Lumsdon) v Legal Services Board</span> [2015] UKSC 41, [2016] AC 697 at [66].  So far as the balance between competing interests under the Equality Act 2010 is concerned, she submits that there is a wide margin of discretion to be accorded to the Mayor for four reasons. First, he is democratically elected and accountable. Secondly, he has undertaken to keep the congestion charging scheme under review. Thirdly, the decision-making process involved a predictive and evaluative judgment for which the Mayor and Transport for London repeatedly sought and relied on expert assistance from CEPA. It was objectively reasonable to conclude on the basis of the CEPA analysis and the other material available to the Mayor, that the measure would have the effects predicted. The margin of discretion extends to the judgment in choosing the means by which the object is achieved. Finally, she relies on the fact that a lack of regulation would be harmful to road users. </p>

Even where there is a question of social policy involved, that does not remove the requirement on the court to conduct the necessary careful balancing exercise. That is particularly so in circumstances where the discrimination involved is on a suspect ground so that greater scrutiny is required. Here, the context is drivers and passengers with protected characteristics of race, sex and disability, and the interference goes to aspects of their personal integrity, affecting their status as citizens in London.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">I start with the asserted inconsistency between the approach identified by Lewis J at paragraph 77 and the statement made by Baroness Hale in <span style="font-style:italic">UNISON</span>. In my judgment there is no inconsistency: they were referring to different, albeit to some extent overlapping, stages of the relevant enquiry. As s.19(2)(d) of the Equality Act 2010 makes clear, the putative discriminator must show that the PCP is a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim in order to justify what would otherwise be unlawful indirect discrimination. That involves determining first whether the measure (or PCP) is directed at achieving a legitimate aim; in other words, an aim that corresponds to a real need, is appropriate to achieving the objective in question and reasonably necessary to achieve the aim. Secondly, the measure adopted must be a proportionate means of achieving that aim. Although the terms proportionate and justified are often used interchangeably (as indeed appears from the guidance derived from the case law in <span style="font-style:italic">Lockwood</span> as set out at paragraph 36 above), they are different. Justification involves two stages, the second of which involves the application of the proportionality principle. Once that is appreciated, it seems to me to be clear that when Baroness Hale referred to the requirement that the PCP be justified, she was referring to the overall approach in s.19(2)(d); whereas, Lewis J had dealt with the first aspect of justification, namely the legitimacy of the aim in earlier paragraphs of his judgment (paragraphs 74, 75 and 76 in particular) and was turning (at paragraph 77) to address the second stage, namely the proportionality stage of the justification enquiry. Further, as is well settled, the test of proportionality is in essence, a balancing exercise between the discriminatory effect of the measure (or PCP) on the disadvantaged group, and the needs of (or benefit to be achieved by) the putative discriminator on the other. As Mummery LJ put it in <span style="font-style:italic">Elias </span>at [151] “it is necessary to weigh the need against the seriousness of the detriment to the disadvantaged group.” In other words, the judge had to evaluate the extent of the adverse impact of the measure adopted by the respondent on individuals with the protected characteristics of race, sex and disability, weigh that against the benefits and importance of the measure and determine where the balance lay. For these reasons the approach set out by Lewis J at paragraph 77 reflects no error of law on his part. </p>

The judge recognised that the extent to which such a levy reduces the impact on a driver depends on the number of times the driver carries a passenger within the CCZ. There was also evidence that another large operator (Addison Lee) with a different operating model, pays the charge as registered keeper of their vehicles but has introduced an increased rental fee of £15 a week charged to its drivers for leasing the vehicle. The reduced impact on those drivers will be about £15 a week (rather than £52.50). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">Thirdly, there was evidence of some operators modifying their operating practices so as to enable drivers to avoid going into the CCZ if they wish and thereby to avoid having to pay the congestion charge. For example, there was evidence that ViaVan allows drivers to indicate willingness to drive into the CCZ, and those choosing not to are not affected by the congestion charge. There was evidence that the provision by Uber of postcodes for the destination enables drivers to decide if they wish to accept the fare and, if the postcode is known to be within the CCZ, they can decide not to accept it. Again, and accepting that it may take time for postcodes to be recognised by minicab drivers as within or outside the CCZ, this was a legitimate factor to consider. The judge also recognised that some drivers may continue to go into the CCZ because, some at least, will calculate that they can do enough journeys in the CCZ with the levy to cover the cost, or a sufficient part of the cost, of the congestion charge to make it worthwhile. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The position of disabled passengers was separately addressed both by the Mayor and the judge. The evidence anticipated an increase in the cost for them of journeys into the CCZ (where, for example, all or part of the congestion charge is passed on to customers) or there might be a reduction in the availability of PHVs willing to travel into the CCZ. The likely increase was thought to be £1 to £2 a journey. The Request recognised that an increase of even £1 or £2 would not be an insubstantial amount for some disabled people. The contemporaneous material suggested some of the impact could be mitigated by schemes offering subsidised taxi and PHV journeys. However, for disabled people whose disabilities do not include mobility issues (or disability issues relating to transport), they may be forced to use less convenient but cheaper public transport. There was a likely adverse impact on disabled people in consequence. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Before coming to his assessment of proportionality, and as part of it, Lewis J had regard to the fact that the Mayor is elected and accountable for the decisions taken in relation to the management of road user charging systems within London. He was informed of the potential effect of the removal of the exemption on drivers from minority ethnic backgrounds and part-time drivers who were likely to be women. He considered that the importance of the aim – the reduction of traffic and congestion in Central London – did justify the potential impact on the drivers concerned. His approach is challenged as wrong in law because it is said that Lewis J allowed the public nature of the respondent to determine the question of proportionality rather than doing so himself. Mr Collins contends that at paragraph 85 the judge, in effect, deferred to the Mayor and found it sufficient that the Mayor had turned his mind to the matters in issue. That was to misunderstand his role and to afford too wide a discretion to the respondent.  </p>

Although this is a case in which an increased level of scrutiny is called for, that does not mean no margin of discretion is to be accorded to the decision maker. To the contrary, in my judgment the Mayor had some margin of discretion both as to the aims and as to means adopted to achieve them. It was for Lewis J to determine the breadth of the margin in each case because of the fact sensitive nature of this issue. That is precisely what he did. He identified the features of the case that led him to conclude that some weight was to be accorded to the democratically accountable decision maker who determined the appropriate balance to be struck between the competing interests in this case. Those were both relevant and legitimate factors that Lewis J was entitled to consider, although I echo the caution expressed by Singh LJ at paragraph 94 below as to the importance of the Mayor’s democratic accountability in the present stark context.  The judge did not accept the Mayor’s views uncritically. Instead, he conducted his own proportionality assessment that had regard, as a relevant but not a determinative factor, to the margin of discretion to be accorded to the Mayor. </p>

I accept that this balancing exercise was not expressly stated. However, it is clear from the analysis as a whole, that this is precisely what he did. In the earlier parts of his judgment, the judge accepted the scale of the growing congestion problem for London and that there were good reasons to focus on the increasing numbers of minicabs in London. He grappled with the 1% traffic reduction forecast, and accepted its reliability. He found that the measure corresponded to a real need and would achieve a not insignificant benefit and that there were no other less intrusive measures which could realistically achieve the same aim. It is entirely unrealistic to suggest that he overlooked that side of the balance when he came to assess proportionality, having critically assessed the negative impact of the measure in the way that I have summarised above. </p>

The appellant argues that Lewis J wrongly considered the position of black and minority ethnic minicab drivers (and female drivers) relative to all other minicab drivers, whereas he should have considered their position relative to all minicab and taxi drivers. The failure to identify the correct comparator pool infected the rest of the judge’s analysis. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The first topic is the question of the aims of the measure under challenge.  I accept that a measure can have more than one legitimate aim.  The difficulty in the present case is that the second aim relied upon does not, on objective analysis, appear to be an aim at all.  If the Respondent did not have the first aim, that is of reducing congestion, the second aim would not exist independently of it, that is to maintain the current level of wheelchair-accessible transport vehicles in London.  As a matter of objective analysis, it is arguable that the second aim is in truth a design feature of the means by which the first aim was to be achieved.  In that sense it was a non-negotiable way of achieving the first aim.  It could be argued that, when assessing whether there is objective justification for what is on the face of it indirect discrimination, all aspects of the design features employed need to be subjected to appropriate scrutiny.  Otherwise, there is a risk that the inclusion of a design feature as one of the aims will preclude proper scrutiny of whether that design feature is a justified one.  Ultimately, however, I am persuaded that, even if the second aim is properly to be regarded as part of the means rather than an aim in itself, there were legitimate reasons for distinguishing between minicabs and taxis.  This is essentially for the reasons set out by Simler LJ at paragraph 50 above. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The second topic is the issue of whether there were less restrictive means available to the Respondent.  I find it surprising that no consideration appears to have been given early on to the question whether the congestion charge should have been increased for all those presently liable to the charge (but with minicabs and taxis remaining exempt).  It seems to me that that was an obvious possible alternative solution to the perceived problems that the measure was intended to resolve.  Nevertheless, once this suggested alternative was raised by the Appellant, in its skeleton argument in the High Court, it was addressed by way of evidence in Ms Calderato’s second witness statement.  I agree with Simler LJ that Lewis J was entitled to accept her evidence that even a large increase in the congestion charge generally was unlikely to yield substantial reductions in the number of vehicles in the CCZ.  This Court, sitting as an appellate court, cannot say that the judge was wrong to accept that evidence. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The third topic is the question of the appropriate margin of discretion or judgement to be afforded to the Respondent.

This is particularly because the impact on drivers from black, Asian and other minority ethnic (“BAME”) communities as compared with white drivers is striking.  As Simler LJ has mentioned, 94% of minicab drivers are from BAME communities, whereas only 12% of taxi drivers are.  What is in issue in the present case is alleged discrimination, in particular on racial grounds.  Whatever may be the position generally when reviewing the acts of public authorities in the context of social and economic policy, in my view, a more stringent scrutiny is required when the alleged ground of discrimination is race.   </p>

The democratic nature of our society is of vital importance and must be respected by the courts.  But the premise of equality law is that every person is entitled to be treated in an equal way irrespective of whether they are part of the majority or in a minority.  In a democracy there is a danger that the majority (perhaps unconsciously) will override the interests of the minority because the price of a measure will be paid not generally by the community but only, or substantially, by a minority.   </p>

Secondly, it became clear that the only effective way of doing so would be to address the exponential rise both in the absolute number of minicab drivers operating in London and in those entering the zone. Fewer private cars and taxis were doing so, but minicabs continued to increase. Thirdly, there was no purpose in interfering with the exemption accorded to taxis, because taxis provide unique advantages to Londoners. They allow wheelchair bound passengers to travel and are required to carry passengers under a raft of regulations that do not affect minicabs. </p>
