	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The appeal raises issues as to the scope of the obligation imposed upon a shipowner by Article III rule 1 of the Hague/Hague Visby Rules to exercise due diligence to make the vessel seaworthy before and at the beginning of the voyage. The central issue in the appeal is whether defects in the vessel’s passage plan and the relevant working chart rendered the vessel unseaworthy because neither recorded the necessary warning derived from the Notice to Mariners 6274(P)/10 that depths shown on the chart outside the fairway on the approach to the relevant port, Xiamen in China, were unreliable and waters were shallower than recorded on the chart. The judge found that these defects did render the vessel unseaworthy, that the Owners had failed to exercise due diligence, so that they were in breach of Article III rule 1, that that breach was causative of the grounding of the vessel and the claim in general average failed.  </p>

The course line then took the vessel to the port side of the fairway so as to pass a danger area off buoy 14-1 to starboard. The course line showed the vessel as within the fairway at all times passing buoy 14 also to starboard. The judge found at [33] that there were no “no go” areas, marked with hatched lines on the chart, on either side of the fairway.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The judge’s detailed findings about the actual navigation of the vessel are at [34] to [43]. In summary, she left the quayside at 01.33 on 18 May 2011, a little after high water, but with sufficient UKC in the channel. The second officer was on the bridge with the master. As the vessel approached buoy 15, she was on the starboard side of the fairway and aimed to pass a dangerous shallow area to port, which brought her to a position on the chart just outside the magenta pecked line of the fairway, but still within the fairway. </p>

On passing buoy 15, the helm was put gradually to port. As the judge found at [39], the master must have been intending to cross over to the port side of the fairway. However, he then ordered the helm further over to starboard through almost 40 degrees with the consequence that the vessel passed buoy 14-1 and the danger area around it to port. This took the vessel out of the buoyed fairway.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">As the judge said at [41], the master then ordered the helm hard to port, presumably to return to the fairway before buoy 14, but this attempt did not last long and he ordered hard to starboard, evidently with the aim of passing the rocks and shallow water at Jiujie Jiao to port. The second officer marked the vessel’s position on the chart at 02.32 as about 2 ½ cables to the west of the fairway, shaping to pass buoy 14 to port. Various helm and engine movements were ordered but by 02.35 the master concluded the vessel had run aground. She was in an area where there were charted depths of over 30 metres.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Having made the findings as to the circumstances in which the vessel had grounded which I have just summarised, the judge went on, in what was a meticulous and pellucid judgment, to consider in detail from [44] onwards the master’s evidence as to why he decided to pass buoy 14 to port and the expert evidence, with a view to determining whether the master’s decision to do so and to leave the buoyed channel was negligent. At [50] he concluded that there was a formidable case that it had not been prudent for the master to rely upon the charted depths of 30 metres of water which the master had said he considered there would be if he left buoy 14-1 to port. The principal reason for this (and of relevance to the current appeal) was that: “Notice to Mariners NM 6274(P)/10, issued in December 2010, advised mariners at paragraph 2 that "numerous depths less than charted exist within, and in the approaches to Xiamen Gang". It is true that the "most significant" which were listed were not in this location but the warning was nevertheless clear that in the approaches to Xiamen there were “numerous depths less than the charted depths”. The judge also noted that NM 6274(P)/10 informed mariners that the least depth within the fairway was 14 metres.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">He referred to the conflict of expert opinion and said at [53] that he preferred the evidence of Captain Hart, the expert for the Cargo Interests. He concluded at [54] that the master’s decision to part from the passage plan and navigate outside the buoyed fairway was negligent. As he said at [55] there could, however, only be actionable fault within the meaning of the York-Antwerp Rules if the grounding was caused by a failure by the owners to exercise due diligence to make the vessel seaworthy. He noted that, although the case of the Cargo Interests had developed during the course of the litigation, the focus at trial had been upon whether the passage plan had been defective and, if so, whether those defects were causative of the grounding and, if they were, whether there had been failure to exercise due diligence to make the vessel seaworthy. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The judge considered the issue of the burden of proof in relation to unseaworthiness, noting at [56] the conventional view that the burden was on the Cargo Interests to establish that the vessel was unseaworthy and that this was causative of the grounding and that, if those matters were established, the burden was on the Owners to establish that due diligence was exercised to make the vessel seaworthy. At [57], the judge rejected an argument by Mr John Russell QC on behalf of Cargo Interests that, in the light of the decision of the Supreme Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Volcafé Ltd v Cia Sud Americana de Vaporesi SA</span> [2018] UKSC 61; [2019] AC 358, the burden lay on the Owners under Article III rule 1 of the Hague Rules to prove that the vessel was seaworthy. He considered that that case concerned only Article III rule 2 and was not concerned with the burden of proof in cases of unseaworthiness. The judge considered that the conventional view of the burden of proof in relation to unseaworthiness remained good law. Although the Respondents’ Notice sought to challenge that conclusion, on the basis of <span style="font-style:italic">Volcafé</span>, at the hearing of the appeal, Mr Russell QC indicated that this argument was not pursued.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The judge went on to consider the criticisms of the passage plan. He noted at [64] that the IMO Guidelines on Passage Planning 1999 stated that the passage plan should include “all areas of danger”. Whilst the working chart had been updated with a note placed on the fairway between buoys 15 and 18 advising the mariner to “see” NM 6274(P)/10, the judge said that the note did not in terms remind the mariner of the warning within the Notice to Mariners that charted depths outside the buoyed fairway may be unreliable.  </p>

This is particularly so where the defect in question is an absence from the passage plan and chart of a warning that numerous depths outside the fairway are less than those charted and where the Owners had advised their masters of the difficulty of navigating in Xiamen waters because of, amongst other matters, "shallow waters" and urged "utmost care and diligent caution".

The document or documents in which it is recorded are for the benefit of the officers in fact navigating the vessel during the voyage. That circumstance does not remove passage planning from the scope of seaworthiness. Similarly, the ordering of sufficient engine room spares by the chief engineer is necessary for the safe management of the vessel during the voyage.

This proposition was founded upon a statement in <span style="font-style:italic">Cooke on Voyage Charters </span>at 85.100 that: “the relevant want of due diligence must be by someone performing the functions undertaken in the capacity of carrier and not in some other capacity."

However, the use which the crew then made of it went to navigation or seamanship. There was a fundamental distinction between having everything necessary on board, which was part of the Owners’ responsibility to make the vessel seaworthy under Article III rule 1, and the actual navigation by the crew (of which the passage plan formed part) where any failure would be within the exception in Article IV rule 2(a).  </p>

The House of Lords concluded, upholding the arbitrators, that the choice of route was a matter of employment of the vessel not navigation, and that the owners were in breach of both aspects of clause 8. </p>

However, the case was not concerned with seaworthiness at all, nor is it in any sense authority for the proposition that, because the acts of the master and crew which would otherwise render the vessel unseaworthy are acts of navigation, the exception in Article IV rule 2(a) is available to the owners. Likewise, there is nothing in the decision which touches on the question whether a so-called act of navigation bears on the attributes of the vessel. As I have already said, it is well-established that acts of the master and crew which, if committed during the course of the voyage, would attract the exception, do not do so if committed before or at the commencement of the voyage, thereby rendering the vessel unseaworthy. In such cases the overriding obligation under Article III rule 1 comes into play. </p>

In that case, during the course of a voyage, because he was behind schedule, the vessel’s master changed course and took a passage through a narrow channel, grounding the vessel. Any contention that the vessel was unseaworthy was rejected by the judge at first instance and the argument in the appellate courts was essentially as to the scope of the exception in Article IV rule 2(a). The judge at first instance and the Court of Appeal concluded that the exception did not apply because of the master’s outrageous conduct in bad faith after the grounding. The Supreme Court reversed that decision holding that the exception in Article IV rule 2(a) did not import a requirement of good faith and, absent a plea of barratry, which the cargo interests had not made, the owners could rely upon the exception.  </p>

The references to “at the commencement of the voyage” and “during the voyage” cannot be explained away as loose language, as Mr Hill QC sought to do.

As Mr Russell QC submitted, it is well-established that an aspect of the vessel’s seaworthiness is that she has the appropriate, up-to-date charts on board. Mr Hill QC accepted that a failure by the vessel’s master and crew to update a chart by reference to a notice to mariners, so that she sailed with an out of date and defective chart, would render the vessel unseaworthy. However, when it was suggested by the Court during the course of argument that it must follow that a failure to record the warning in NM 6274(P)/10 on the working chart made the vessel unseaworthy, Mr Hill QC submitted that this was not so because how the warning was placed on the chart would involve an exercise of judgment (for example whether to write the words: “numerous depths less than charted exist within, and in the approaches to Xiamen” on the chart or to draw on the chart hatched “no go” areas either side of the fairway). Therefore, this was passage planning, not updating of the chart.  </p>

First, although Mr Hill QC sought to contend that the judge had dealt with the matter as defective passage planning, the working chart was part of the passage plan and the relevant defect in the passage plan encompassed the defect in the chart, namely that it did not contain the warning.  The judge was clearly deciding that the working chart was defective in that sense. Second, in each case, the effect of the relevant omission by the master and crew is that the chart is defective and unsafe. Mr Hill QC was constrained to accept that if NM 6274(P)/10 had contained a specific instruction to write the warning on the chart, failure to do so would render the vessel unseaworthy, because the master and crew would have failed to update the chart. However, there is no rational distinction between that case and the case where, without an instruction on the chart, the master and crew simply fail to record the warning on the chart. The distinction which Mr Hill QC sought to draw between charts which are defective because they are not updated or corrected and charts which are defective, as in the present case, because they do not record the necessary warning in a notice to mariners, is an unprincipled and wholly artificial one. As I have said, in each case, the chart is defective and unsafe and the vessel is therefore unseaworthy. </p>

The Court of Appeal reversed the judge, finding that the cargo interests had failed to prove that welding was a more probable cause of the fire than a discarded cigarette, so that the damage to cargo was not attributable to actionable fault by the owners.

The Judge rejected that contention, and I think that he was right to do so. For a ship to be unseaworthy, or more strictly uncargoworthy, there must be some attribute of the ship itself which threatens the safety of the cargo. If a hold is dirty, that is properly considered as an attribute of the ship. But the fact that a hold contains cargo which threatens damage to other cargo stowed in proximity is not an attribute of the ship and does not render the ship unseaworthy.” </p>

Given that, as he also concluded in that paragraph, having charts which are not up-to-date is an “attribute” of the vessel, it is implicit in his reasoning that having a defective passage plan is equally an “attribute” of the vessel. This must be all the more so where one of the reasons why the passage plan is defective is because the working chart which forms part of that passage plan is defective because it does not contain the necessary warning. In my judgment, both an out of date uncorrected chart and a passage plan and working chart which are defective because they fail to contain the warning in NM 6274(P)/10 are defects which are “attributes” of the vessel and render her unseaworthy. </p>

The judge said at [108] that the master had not expected that the vessel would transit via the Patagonian Channels until the pilots came on board with their own charts, on which a passage plan had been marked, and noted that the allegation that the master should not have relied upon that plan had been abandoned.  </p>

The Court noted that the district court, whilst determining that the vessel was not in an unseaworthy condition, found that none of the alleged unseaworthiness had caused the grounding. The Court of Appeals upheld that finding on causation. It noted that the appellant had initially argued that the master’s failure to discuss the manoeuvre with the pilot was an unseaworthy condition, but the owners relied upon an earlier decision of the Court of Appeals of the Fifth Circuit that failure to discuss the manoeuvre with the pilot was a navigational error not unseaworthiness. The appellant’s response was to argue that the owners’ lack of a company policy, requiring the master to discuss routine manoeuvres with the pilot, constituted an unseaworthy condition. However, as the Court said, first the appellant had to show that the district court had been incorrect in rejecting a failure to discuss as a cause of the grounding. The Court of Appeals went on to conclude that because they upheld the district court’s finding that the alleged unseaworthy conditions were a cause of the grounding, they did not need to address the appellant’s contention that the district court erred in finding that the owners exercised due diligence in preparing the vessel for the voyage.  </p>

It is necessarily implicit in the judge’s reasoning that he considered that the working chart had not been appropriately corrected or updated to contain that warning (see [116] of the judgment) and that this constituted a defect in the chart, which was an attribute of the vessel. Even if that analysis were wrong, the Cargo Interests would be correct in the first ground of their Respondents’ Notice, that the judgment should be upheld on the ground that the working chart was defective because it did not contain the warning in NM 6274(P)/10 and that defect, which was an attribute of the vessel, rendered her unseaworthy.  </p>

It identifies four stages, namely (1) appraisal (i.e. gathering all relevant information), (2) detailed planning of the whole voyage from berth to berth, (3) execution of the plan and (4) monitoring of progress in the implementation of the plan. Strictly speaking, only the first two of these constitute passage planning, as the remaining two consist of executing (and modifying as necessary) the plan which has been made before the voyage begins. The guidelines require that, as part of the appraisal stage, account should be taken of “appropriate scale, accurate and up-to-date charts to be used for the intended voyage or passage, as well as any relevant permanent or temporary notices to mariners and existing radio navigational warnings”. The passage plan should then be prepared “on the basis of the fullest possible appraisal”; the intended route should be plotted on “appropriate scale charts” with an indication of “all areas of danger”; and the plan should be “approved by the ship’s master prior to the commencement of the voyage or passage”. </p>

There is no case in which a failure of due diligence by the master and officers has been held to be outside the “orbit” of the shipowner’s responsibility and it is hard to think that there could be. </p>

The signatories to the Convention agreed to divide the allocation of risk for maritime cargo adventures into two separate regimes.  The first regime imposes a non-delegable duty on carriers to exercise due diligence to make the ship seaworthy “<span style="font-style:italic">before and at the beginning of the voyage</span>” (Article III rule 1).  The second regime excuses carriers from liability for loss or damage caused by errors of crew or servants “in the navigation or in the management of the ship” <span style="font-style:italic">thereafter</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">i.e. </span>during the voyage (Article IV rule 2(a)). </p>
