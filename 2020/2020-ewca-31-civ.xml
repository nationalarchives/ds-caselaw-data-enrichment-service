	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">This appeal by the second defendant (to which I will refer as “AIGFP”) against the order of Andrew Baker J dated 9 November 2018 concerns two deferred compensation plans operated by AIGFP which were designed to allow its employees to share with the seventh defendant (“AIG”), as the shareholder of AIGFP, in the “risks and rewards” of AIGFP’s business by means of deferred compensation accounts to which part of its distributable profits would be credited if AIGFP was profitable but which would provide auxiliary base capital to absorb losses if the company was loss-making. The claimants (respondents to the appeal) were 23 individuals who were employees of AIGFP in London.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The central issue in the trial before the judge was whether the plans required AIGFP to restore deferred account balances which were wiped out by massive losses suffered by AIGFP during the 2008 financial crisis. AIGFP had been engaged in derivatives trading, specifically in so-called credit default swaps (“CDSs”). At the time of the financial crisis, AIG faced a short term liquidity crisis as a result of its exposure to losses via AIGFP’s CDS book and its securities lending business, all of which nearly caused the collapse of AIG. Unlike Lehman Brothers, AIG was considered by the US Government as “too big to fail” and it was bailed out by a loan from the US Government of US$85 billion. That sum has since been repaid. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">AIG in turn advanced a US$65 billion facility to AIGFP to enable it to close out its worst loss-making open derivatives positions. Under the plans, AIGFP applied a proportion of the losses to the plan participants’ account balances, the scale of those losses wiping out the balances. Since late 2008 AIGFP has ceased trading for profit and has engaged in an orderly wind-down of its business. AIGFP has made a net loss in every year since 2008. Notwithstanding this, it has been kept afloat by AIG as a </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The respondents’ case at trial was that the restoration provisions in the deferred compensation plans required AIGFP to restore their account balances to the prefinancial crisis level and pay them the balances in full. AIGFP’s case was that the plans did not require this and the balances were wiped out unless and until AIGFP stopped being loss-making and once more had positive Distributable Income from which to make the restoration. By his judgment the judge held that, applying Connecticut law, which governed the plans, there was an obligation on AIGFP to restore the balances and repay them to the respondents by the end of 2013, notwithstanding that AIGFP remained loss-making. </p>

In common with many others employed in the financial services sector at the time, their basic pay was relatively modest but they received large bonuses which were paid out of AIGFP’s Distributable Income as defined. Prior to 1995, Distributable Income was paid out in full each year to AIG (AIGFP’s 100% shareholder) and to AIGFP’s employees on a 70%/30% basis. In 1995, the first plan, the Deferred Compensation Plan (“DCP”), with which this appeal is principally concerned, was introduced. It has been amended on a number of subsequent occasions, most recently, for present purposes, in December 2008.  </p>

In 2007, it was required to book unrealised losses derived from a mark-to-market revaluation of the portfolio. This requirement coincided with intensification of the credit crunch, so that the mark-to-market value of the credit derivative portfolio fell sharply and substantial unrealised losses were sustained. As a consequence, in the 2007 compensation year there was significantly reduced Distributable Income under the DCP. In response AIGFP introduced the Special Incentive Plan (“SIP”) whose purpose was to mitigate the shortfall on sums that would have otherwise been paid or deferred by way of Distributable Income but for the unrealised losses. It did this by crediting sums equivalent to the shortfall to new “SIP” accounts. These were due to be paid in January 2013. The SIP contained materially the same reduction/restoration provision as Section 4.01(b) of the DCP, so that if “any losses” were incurred in excess of reserves and current year income, SIP credits would fall to be reduced as with balances under the DCP. </p>

To stabilise its financial position, in November and December 2008, a substantial proportion of the unrealised losses of AIGFP on its CDS portfolio were crystallised in a series of transactions known as “Maiden Lane III”. The CDS contracts were terminated allowing the counterparties to retain collateral posted by AIGFP, leading to realised losses of about US$30 billion in November and about US$10 billion in December 2008.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Those realised losses eliminated AIGFP’s credit and market reserves and resulted in a debt of more than US$30 billion under the loan facility. When those realised losses were applied to the deferred compensation accounts, they reduced those accounts to nil. In fact AIGFP recorded that the losses reduced the balances below nil. The judge held that it was impermissible to apply negative balances and there is no appeal against that finding. AIGFP has had no positive Distributable Income since, but has made a loss every year (after excluding unrealised gains) principally because the interest due on the loan has exceeded any residual revenues from realising gains on unwinding remaining transactions.  </p>

Connecticut law appears to have a somewhat more generous approach to the admission of extrinsic evidence to resolve an ambiguity than the parol evidence rule under English law. As the appeal was ultimately argued orally, only limited reliance was placed by either party on extrinsic evidence. Nonetheless, to the extent that both parties invited this Court to consider evidence from witnesses who were not involved in the negotiation of the plans about what they thought the plans meant or how they applied them in practice, it seems to me that such evidence was inadmissible, even under the more generous approach of Connecticut law, in construing the plans.  </p>

Accordingly, the unexpected way in which AIGFP has incurred catastrophic losses yet survived as a going concern albeit not profit-seeking, rather than being put into insolvency, should not influence the proper construction of the contract. At [76] he said that most of Section 4.01(a) was of no relevance to the construction of Section 4.01(b). However, at [77] he said that the first sentence was important, recording as it did that the balance in favour of an employee or AIG represented a debt owed by AIGFP.  </p>

He submitted, in other words, that if reserves are nil and no new annual reserves are taken, then under the DCP, annual revenues less expenses, if positive, is Distributable Income capable of generating <span style="font-style:italic">inter alia </span>new DCA credits; and the same, if negative, is the excess loss to be absorbed by the outstanding balance remaining of old DCA credits (to the extent it can absorb it, as I would add). There is thus a complete symmetry, on Mr Hunter’s argument, between the (positive) Distributable Income that generates DCP bonus amounts and the “ <span style="font-style:italic">losses </span>” to be absorbed by deferred bonus amounts. But there is no <span style="font-style:italic">a priori </span>need for such symmetry; and the most obvious way to create it, if that were the intention, has not been used, namely drafting Section 4.01(b)[1] by reference to Distributable Income as a defined term. The question is what the language actually used means, with no assumption or presumption as to whether the symmetry proposed by Mr Hunter’s argument was intended. Thus, Mr Hunter’s particular submission that the defendants must be right about restoration because “ <span style="font-style:italic">the [Plan] accounts are in essence retained earnings accounts [that] can and should only be restored from future net earnings </span>” to my mind just begged the question.” </p>

On the judge’s construction, there was no sharing of risks and rewards, but the executive and employee participants will have been paid in full through funding by the other participant AIG, the 100% shareholder, even though Section 4.01(a) provides explicitly that there is no guarantee from AIG of AIGFP’s obligations. </p>

Whilst it was not disputed that losses were limited to realised losses (in the light of Section 3.07(b) of the ERP) there was no justification whatsoever for the judge’s conclusion (in [90] and [108(iv)]) that, after 1 December 2007, “losses” meant only “realized losses as defined by Schedule 2 to the ERP”. There was nothing in either the ERP or the DCP which limited realised losses in this way. Section 3.07(b) referred to “Realized Losses from the CDO Portfolio or otherwise” and made no mention of realised losses being limited to those set out in Schedule 2. The words: “or otherwise” were general, not transactional, let alone referring only to losses on transactions set out in Schedule 2.   </p>

Mr Oudkerk QC sought to contend in his submissions before this Court that Mr Hunter QC had abandoned in oral submissions what he had said at [87] of the written closing submissions, but this is a false point. The passage in the transcript to which he referred us was one where Mr Hunter QC was making the alternative submission set out in footnote 33 to [87] of the written closing submissions, that if one took the view that “losses” was confined to losses arising from transactions (which was the respondents’ rather than AIGFP’s case) then the only tenable construction of “current year income” would be profits arising from transactions less expenses because this would lead to the same result as that for which Mr Hunter QC was contending as his primary case.</p>

First, where it was intended by the DCP to qualify “income” as meaning net income rather than gross income, the draftsman said so, as in the definition of “Distributable Income”. Second, the effect of the judge’s analysis was that, since he concluded that “losses” meant only realised losses on transactions as set out in Schedule 2 to the ERP and that “current year income” was in effect capped at zero (which seems to be what the judge was saying at [93]), he left out of account items of expense or “loss” such as interest on the bail-out facility, which in profit and loss terms produced a substantial loss. Lord Goldsmith QC submitted that such expenses have to be brought into account somehow: if they are not within losses because those are limited to transactional realised losses, they must come into the equation on the income side, reducing the net income to a negative figure. </p>

The judge accepted that the restoration of a DCA balance would create a fresh DCP debt, but held that that did not create a loss.

Lord Goldsmith QC submitted that, contrary to what the judge said at [97], the word must be given a meaning. In Connecticut law, as in English law, there is a presumption against surplusage. He submitted that “subsequently” meant “subsequently to losses ceasing”, not necessarily by reading in words, but because that was the natural meaning of the word in its context in the DCP as a whole and in Section 4.01(b). In other words, it was “subsequent” to when losses have ceased exhausting reserves and income.  </p>

If, as the judge found, the obligation arose notwithstanding that there was no Distributable Income, then this would be an unlawful distribution of capital or an unlawful dividend prohibited  under general principles of company law. Whilst restoration of balances to the Participants would not be illegal, the effect of this on the judge’s construction was that whilst restoration and payment could be made to the Participants, it could not be made to AIG, which was hardly sharing in the risks and rewards. </p>

That argument was this: AIG Inc also participates, so any restoration and payment of previously reduced balances should apply to AIG Inc’s balances as well as to Participants’ balances; restoration and payment of AIG Inc’s previously reduced balances would be an unlawful distribution to the shareholder by an insolvent company; it cannot have been the intention to require that; therefore, it cannot have been the intention to require restoration of Participants’ balances. In my judgment, no question arises of an unlawful distribution to AIG Inc. The recognition of Plan debts to Participants, by restoring balances, would carry with it the recognition of a corresponding Plan debt to AIG Inc. Discharging that Plan debt to AIG Inc by drawing on the AIG-FP facility would leave AIG-FP’s position neutral, the Plan debt to AIG Inc simply being re-constituted as increased indebtedness under the facility. If the Plans otherwise required restoration and payment of Participant balances previously reduced, then it would be no more improper for AIG-FP to discharge those obligations than for it to discharge, as it continues to do, all its other ongoing obligations, e.g. to employees or otherwise by way of overheads and to trade creditors, all with the support of AIG Inc (if required) via the bail-out facility.” </p>

Although AIGFP was a Delaware corporation and there was no evidence before the Court of Delaware law on this issue, Lord Goldsmith QC relied upon the common law rule that a company cannot pay dividends out of capital as a universal principle of company law.

First, there is nothing in the wording of the DCP or the ERP which suggests such a limitation or which suggests that the DCP was amended by the ERP. On the contrary, the wording of Section 4.06 of the ERP makes it clear that, apart from the exceptions in the proviso (which do not include any reference to Section 4.01(b) of the DCP), the terms and operation of the DCP were not affected by the ERP. If it had been intended to limit “losses” in Section 4.01(b) of the DCP to Realized Losses as set out in Schedule 2 of the ERP then the proviso to Section 4.06 of the ERP would have been the obvious place to say so. There is no hint of such an intention which is, in any event, negatived by the clear opening words of Section 4.06. The judge appears to have proceeded on the false premise (see [74] of the judgment) that the DCP was amended by the ERP, but that is contradicted by Section 4.06 of the ERP. The judge’s conclusion at [90] cannot be justified. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Third, that these Sections of the ERP did not have the limiting effect on the meaning of “losses” beyond excluding unrealised losses, is borne out by the words in Section 3.07(b) of the ERP: “will remain subject to reduction as a result of Realized Losses from the CDO Portfolio or otherwise in accordance with the terms of the [DCP]”. The words “or otherwise” are quite general and cannot be confined to realised transactional losses on business other than that in the CDO Portfolio. In any event, even if “or otherwise” were limited to other realised transactional losses than those on the CDO Portfolio, there is nothing in Section 3.06 or Section 3.07 to suggest that the only losses which can be brought into account under Section 4.01(b) of the DCP are realised transactional losses. The ERP is completely silent on that point.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Fourth, the reference to “any losses incurred” is a pointer to this being a wide definition, not a narrow one limited to transactional losses as found by the judge. Just as Distributable Income is revenues less expenses and reserves, so there is no reason not to take the same matters into account in assessing what losses have been incurred, rather than artificially limiting the word “losses” in the way which the judge’s construction does.  If it had been intended to limit “any losses incurred” to transactional losses, it would have been very straightforward to say so in terms. In any event, even if the phrase was intended to be limited to realised transactional losses, there was no justification for limiting it further to what Lord Goldsmith QC described as the sub-set of transactional losses set out in Schedule 2 to the ERP, given the wide range of other types of business and transactions in which AIGFP engaged (see [44] above).   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Fifth, in my judgment the judge placed too much emphasis on the fact that the deferred bonus payments were to be repaid in instalments over a period related to the profile of the CDS book. He referred to this at [88] of the judgment and it appears to have been critical to his conclusion, at the beginning of [89], that “losses” were limited to losses incurred under the financial product transactions entered in that book or portfolio. Contrary to the submissions of Mr Oudkerk QC, I do not consider that Section 3.05(b) relating to instalment payments of deferred compensation, with its reference to instalments being payable on a pro-rata annual basis over the approximate life of the CDS portfolio, provides the answer to what is meant by “losses” in Section 4.01(b). Section 4.01(b) is dealing with the different issue of reductions from DCAs by reason of losses and there is no reason to limit such losses to only one aspect of AIGFP’s business, namely the CDS transactions, however important a part of the business they were. Furthermore, and in any event, as the amendment to Section 3.05(b) makes clear, in the years after 2008, the instalment payments were no longer made by reference to the approximate life of the CDS portfolio, but over a period of six years, no doubt because AIGFP had stopped entering such transactions. This also suggests that the linkage which the judge found between “losses” and the CDS portfolio was not there.  </p>

Thus, the interest liabilities of AIGFP to AIG have come about because the decision to close out all the transactions in Maiden Lane III leading to massive losses necessitated the bail-out facility so that, in a broad sense, the interest liabilities are transactional losses. Likewise the deductions from the DCA balances were made because of the massive losses on the transactions so that, in a broad sense again, any restoration obligation is also a transactional loss. </p>

We were told by Mr Oudkerk QC that there was no relevant expert evidence at trial, but he referred us to a passage in the witness statement of Mr Mark Balfan, the chief financial officer of AIGFP, from which it emerged that AIGFP had two lines of business, credit business which was mainly CDSs and market business which was non-credit derivatives and other financial transactions, including interest rate, foreign exchange and equity products. This demonstrates that the reserves being referred to in Section 4.01(b) related to all of AIGFP’s business not just its CDSs or the CDO Portfolio. That suggests that whatever else “losses” means, it is not limited to losses on credit derivatives as set out in Schedule 2 to the ERP.   </p>

However, if it were necessary to determine that issue, I prefer Lord Goldsmith QC’s submission that it is a gross figure. One of the difficulties with the contrary case that it is net is that, whilst Mr Oudkerk QC accepted that items such as rent and interest payments on loans would be deducted from gross income to arrive at the net figure, he of necessity (given the meaning of “losses” for which he contends) has to say that transactional losses are not deducted from the gross income. However, in accounting terms, if one were assessing the annual income of a company on a net basis, one of the debit items one would always deduct from gross income to arrive at net income would be trading or realised transactional losses. It follows that the respondents’ net “current year income” is a hybrid, not entirely net, which is an unlikely interpretation, suggesting that it is more likely to be assessed on a gross basis. </p>

It follows that it is only when AIGFP has Distributable Income and is in profit again that there can be any obligation to make restoration.          </p>

It may be that, as Mr Oudkerk QC contended, the backstop date was included because without it the plan would have failed, with serious tax consequences under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, but this does not affect what the amendment means on its correct construction. If, as the respondents contend, there was an unqualified obligation to restore the deducted balances irrespective of profitability, it is difficult to see why the backstop date would have needed to be set at five years distance rather than on, say, 31 December 2008. In my judgment, the correct construction of the amendment is that the company would have five years in which to turn itself around, but if, by 31 December 2013, it had not been possible to restore the balances because the company had not returned to profitability, any restoration rights permanently lapsed and that was an end of the matter. This is all wholly inconsistent with there being an unqualified obligation on AIGFP to make restoration notwithstanding that losses were continuing or to devise a plan with a schedule for repayment the moment the deduction was made, which is the construction the judge placed upon the provision. If that construction were correct, the amendment would make no sense, since the obligation to restore and to pay would have arisen when the deduction from balances was made in 2008 in the light of the massive losses and, on the judge’s construction would be an unqualified obligation, presumably to pay long before the end of 2013. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Furthermore, the fact that the provision contemplated that a plan should be adopted with a schedule which presumably, even before the 2008 amendment, would have set out dates for restoration and payment, seems to me to be inconsistent with the judge’s conclusion that there was an absolute obligation to make restoration and payment irrespective of whether the company had returned to profitability. If there was such an absolute obligation, why was it necessary to have a schedule at all? The provision for a schedule is far more consistent with AIGFP’s case, in other words it contemplates the plan setting out a schedule of when it is expected that restoration and, in turn, payment can be made, which is surely linked to when it is expected that the company will return to profitability in order to make restoration and payment. I am not sure Mr Oudkerk QC really had a satisfactory answer to this point when it was raised during the course of argument. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The words of the 2008 amendment: “Any such restoration plan shall provide that any restored amounts shall be paid in 2013” seem to me to contemplate first that there may not be a plan at all and second that there may not have been any amounts restored by the end of 2013. That latter point is borne out by the next phrase: “to the extent amounts have not been restored by December 31, 2013 all restoration rights shall permanently lapse” which contemplates that balances may not have been restored by 31 December 2013 and that, if they have not been, all restoration rights permanently lapse. There is no suggestion in any of this wording that failure to restore by 31 December 2013 was a breach by AIGFP of its unqualified obligation to restore and pay balances even though it remained loss-making, which would be the case if the judge’s construction were correct. It would be odd, to say the least, if AIGFP was in breach of contract for not having restored and paid balances by 31 December 2013, for the amendment not to say so in terms and even odder if, by reason of that breach, restoration had not occurred by that date but <span style="text-decoration:underline">all</span> restoration rights (my emphasis) permanently lapsed. The word “all” points to the rights that lapse being not just future rights but any accrued ones. </p>

Even if any such rights did then lapse, Participants would still be entitled in principle to claim damages for deductions wrongfully made or for failure to adopt a restoration plan when deductions were made.” The first sentence of that sub-paragraph of the judgment is simply flatly contrary to the clear words: “all restoration rights shall permanently lapse”. The suggestion, in the second sentence of that passage in the judgment, that a right would subsist to claim damages for deductions wrongfully made (by which the judge presumably means deductions made but not restored by 31 December 2013) is also inconsistent with <span style="text-decoration:underline">all</span> restoration rights permanently lapsing. </p>

Similarly, a right to claim damages for failure to adopt a restoration plan at the time when the deductions were made such as the judge contemplates would be inconsistent with the restoration rights having permanently lapsed, since if they had permanently lapsed, any claim could only be for nominal damages. The reality is that, for the reasons I have given, the wording of the 2008 amendment is inconsistent with the judge’s construction that a plan has to be drawn up when deductions are made (i.e. in 2008) and that balances deducted have to be actually restored and paid by 31 December 2013 at the latest. </p>

If, as he submitted, there were an absolute unqualified obligation to make restoration and payment irrespective of the fact that the company remained loss-making, then prior to any insolvency, on that case the respondents ranked at the same level as the unsubordinated creditors, and yet, if an insolvency occurred before any restoration and payment took place, the respondents would have an unsecured claim to recover the unrestored balances, but that claim is subordinated and junior to all other claims, it comes at the bottom of the queue. As David Richards LJ pointed out in the course of argument, if the judge is right, there is a mismatch in that normally a subordinated debt will remain subordinated whether the company is a going concern or in liquidation. If it is subordinated after the insolvency intervenes, that would suggest that it did not have some greater status prior to insolvency, which supports AIGFP’s analysis. The judge failed to deal with this issue of mismatch in [101] where he found that <span style="font-weight:bold">[7]</span> supported the respondents’ case.  </p>

In my judgment, when these provisions are read together they provide a coherent scheme. There will only be an obligation to restore balances deducted because of losses if and when the company is once again profit-making so that there is Distributable Income from which to restore balances. The 2008 amendment, made at a time when the company had suffered massive losses, contemplated a five year period in which it was hoped that its fortunes would turn around enabling deductions to be restored, but if the company did not make any Distributable Income in that five year period and remained loss-making, there would be no restoration and any rights to restoration permanently lapsed at 31 December 2013. Contrary to Mr Oudkerk QC’s submissions, none of that analysis requires any reading of words into the DCP.

Of course the board of AIGFP did not do this. However, it is not necessary to decide this point, because even if AIGFP had adopted some forward-looking plan setting out when it hoped to make restoration and payment, it could not be under any obligation actually to make restoration, let alone payment, unless it had returned to profitability in the relevant Compensation Year. Since it never did so, the failure to adopt a plan or a schedule cannot be said to have caused the respondents any loss and damage. </p>

As Patten LJ and I pointed out during the course of argument, a massive loss was suffered during the course of 2008 which wiped out the existing bonus entitlement and, although the judge had held AIGFP could not go below zero and say that there were negative balances on the Bonus Pool going forward, the fact remains that, in every subsequent year, (irrespective of any carrying forward of negative balances) there were no profits whatsoever in that particular year which would have created any bonus entitlement or which could have given rise to any obligation to restore balances. Mr Oudkerk QC sought to say the position was more nuanced because in subsequent years, at least US$6 million was paid out under the plans. This was a false point. The payments made were of interest on accrued balances, not in any sense restoration of balances deducted and there were no profits in subsequent years such as could have given rise to an obligation to restore.  </p>
