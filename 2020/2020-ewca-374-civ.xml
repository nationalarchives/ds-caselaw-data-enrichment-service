	      <p style="margin-left:0.48in;margin-right:0.04in">This appeal concerns an oil painting on a wood panel, with measurements of 116 x 69 cm, entitled "<span style="font-style:italic">Madonna con Bambino</span>".  It is presently situated in London and is attributed to Giotto di Bondone ("<span style="font-style:italic">Giotto</span>") (1266-1337).  It was purchased in 1990 for a relatively nominal sum as a 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> century imitation.  Its subsequent authoritative attribution to Giotto means that it has a present value of about £10million and unsurprisingly it is now treated by the Italian authorities as of exceptional cultural and historical importance.  </p>

But it is common ground in this appeal that under the law of Italy that export was unlawful. This was because an earlier licence held by Mrs Simonis, the Appellant, had expired before the date of export and consequently the dispatch of the painting from Italy was unauthorised under the extant licensing regime.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.48in;margin-right:0.04in">The Appellant wishes to remove the painting to Switzerland, which is outside of the EU.  She sought an export licence to this effect from the Arts Council, the relevant competent authority in this jurisdiction.  By a decision of 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2017, the Arts Council decided that it had no power in law to grant a licence for the export from the EU of the painting since it was not the relevant competent authority under the applicable EU law.  The Arts Council could only acquire jurisdiction to grant such a licence following the <span style="font-style:italic">lawful</span> dispatch to the United Kingdom of the painting; but since the dispatch had been in violation of Italian law, and was hence not “<span style="font-style:italic">lawful</span>”, the Arts Council had no power to grant a licence for removal of the painting out of the EU. That power lay with the Italian authorities.   In short it was the wrong competent authority to grant any such licence. However, the Arts Council did confirm that it could grant a licence to Mrs Simonis to return the painting to Italy.  The competent authority in Italy is the <span style="font-style:italic">Ministero dei Beni e delle Attività Culturali e del Turismo</span> (“<span style="font-style:italic">MIBAC</span>”) </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.48in;margin-right:0.04in">At the outset of this appeal there were two quite discrete grounds of appeal.  The first involved the Appellant arguing that the law which governed the legality of the “<span style="font-style:italic">dispatch”</span> of the painting from Italy was EU law which attributed an autonomous meaning to that phrase and which led to the conclusion that the competent authority was not MIBAC.  But in the alternative <span style="text-decoration:underline">if</span> this was wrong and “<span style="font-style:italic">dispatch”</span> was governed by Italian law then the second argument was that the relevant Italian law was unlawful, at least in so far as it applied to the facts of the present case. </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.48in;margin-right:0.04in">The first ground concerns the identity of the competent authority empowered to govern the “<span style="font-style:italic">dispatch</span>” of a cultural item from a Member State.  The Appellant originally argued that since the painting is situated in the United Kingdom the competent authority is the Arts Council which has statutory responsibility in this jurisdiction over the export of cultural items from the EU.  The Arts Council, and the Italian competent authority, disagree and say that it is the Italian authority that has jurisdiction.  Resolution of this dispute turns primarily upon the construction of the expression “<span style="font-style:italic">lawfully and definitively dispatched</span>” contained in an EU Regulation.  What is the body or corpus of law that is implicitly referred to in the word “<span style="font-style:italic">lawfully</span>” which then governs the lawfulness of dispatch? There are three alternatives.  This could be a reference back to national law (by a form of <span style="font-style:italic">renvoi) </span>which would in this case make the relevant law and the governing competent authority either the UK or Italy.  Alternatively, the applicable law governing dispatch could be some provision of EU law, in other words the phrase could have an autonomous meaning operating independently of any corpus of national law.   </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.48in;margin-right:0.04in">Subsequently, the position has changed.  As developed fully in oral submissions the thrust of the Appellant’s case was that the phrase “<span style="font-style:italic">lawfully</span>” <span style="font-style:italic">is</span> a reference to national law <span style="font-style:italic">but</span> with a powerful EU and international law overlay in the form of the EU rules on freedom of movement of goods (Articles 35 and 36 TFEU), Article 52 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights on the principle of legality, and A1P1 of the European </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.00in">Convention on Human Rights.  Mr O’Neill QC argued that, on the facts of this case, the Italian law requiring notice to be given to the Italian authorities prior to removal of the painting from Italy was an impediment to the free movement of goods (contrary to Article 35 TFEU) and was disproportionate and was not justified under Article 36 TFEU; it was also a violation of the principle of legality set out under Article 52(1) of the Charter; and, it adversely affected the property rights of Mrs Simonis and accordingly fell afoul of A1P1 of the Convention. As such its application to the facts of this case was unlawful and whilst these violations did not result in the Italian law being <span style="text-decoration:underline">generally</span> unlawful, they did have the consequence that the Italian law was inapplicable in the case of Mrs Simonis.  It followed that since Italian law did not apply and the painting was located in the United Kingdom it was the Arts Council that was the competent authority here and its refusal to accept that status was wrong in law. It will be seen that the way in which the argument was ultimately developed merged the first and second grounds of appeal. The argument is that “<span style="font-style:italic">lawfully</span>” (as the governing law of dispatch) was regulated by a combination of national (Italian) law combined with EU and international law.</p>

The third is where the primary legislative competence lies with the Member States and where that of the Union is to support, coordinate or supplement.

As with the Export Regulation it has little to say about the substantive content of national laws on the protection of cultural items. If an item is found to have been unlawfully removed, then a duty of return arises and the state of the location of the item does not have the power to grant an export licence from the EU.

That would make the law wholly unpredictable and random.  Why for instance would the law of (say) Latvia be allocated the right under EU law to adopt rules governing the legality of dispatch from Malta?  The answer is that it would not, and the language of the Export Regulation is inconsistent with any such conclusion as is the purpose and intent behind Articles 6 and 167 TFEU which concerns states having the right to determine their own cultural values. The Appellant’s arguments would, if correct, lead to the unpalatable conclusion that the possessor of an item smuggled out of a country could, by virtue of the success of that unlawful and clandestine conduct, evade the law of the state whose laws have been flouted.  If, then, the domestic law of the state of receipt was silent as to the consequences of such unlawful dispatch the clandestine smuggling would go unrecognised and unsanctioned.  This is by no means an extreme scenario and applies, in pith and substance, to the present case. It is common ground that (subject to her argument that the Italian law is unlawful) Mrs Simonis dispatched the Giotto unlawfully from Italy but she now argues that this illegality counts for nought in the analysis of her present rights, which she says are to compel the Arts Council to grant an export licence to remove the painting from the EU.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">First it is said (by reference to the fourth recital of the Export Regulation - see paragraph [42] above) that “…<span style="font-style:italic">the implementation of the system should be as simple and efficient as possible</span>”. It is said that “… <span style="font-style:italic">it has taken a hard-fought claim for judicial review and the services of a joint Italian law expert to enable the English courts to grapple with the question of whether or not the transfer of the Painting to the United Kingdom from Italy on 14 February 2007 could be said to be lawful as a matter of Italian law</span>.”  It is argued that the present case is an example of complexity and amounts to strong evidence that the Export Regulation should be construed to avoid such a situation arising which is achieved if it is the state of the location of the item that becomes the competent authority.  I do not agree. The reference to simplicity in the recital is merely an exhortation to Member States to adopt straightforward national implementing laws; it is not a lodestar by which to measure the language of the Regulation.   But in any event, it is the conduct of the Appellant that has given rise to the complexity.  Her decision to refrain from seeking a licence from the Italian authorities in advance of removal and her persistence in this approach across the years has been the cause of this protracted litigation.  The system under the Export Regulation is straightforward; the alternative advanced by the Appellant is not.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">Second, in written submissions the Appellant relied upon the approach of the Court of Justice to phrases such as “<span style="font-style:italic">direct descendant</span>” which was construed by the Supreme Court to have a discrete meaning in EU law in <span style="font-style:italic">SM (Algeria) v Entry Clearance Officer (SC(E))</span> [2018] UKSC 9 at paragraph [25]. It was argued that cases such as these showed how phrases in a measure of secondary EU law could have autonomous meanings.   I disagree. The jurisprudence of the Court is clear that a term can have an autonomous meaning where there is no explicit or implicit reference to national law.  In the present case the reference is implicitly to national law both because “<span style="font-style:italic">lawful</span>” concerns the dispatch from a Member State, and because there are no rules on “<span style="font-style:italic">dispatch”</span> in the Export Regulation which could serve to regulate removal of a cultural item from a Member State.  It is significant, as the Respondent points out, that the Appellant has not identified what, in the absence of rules <span style="text-decoration:underline">in</span> the Export Regulation, the content of an autonomous EU test for lawfulness of dispatch would be.  </p>

The legal bases for the Export Regulation and the Return Directive were harmonising powers directed at harmonising national laws to a common standard across the Union.  The assumption sitting behind the argument is that because the measures are harmonising, they necessarily <span style="text-decoration:underline">fully</span> occupy the field and therefore leave no space for national law.  This is a false premise.   In the field of cultural goods, the opposite applies (see paragraphs [29] – [38] above) and leads to the conclusion that there is a major and indeed primary role in the field of cultural goods for national law.    </p>

It was not the function of the Export Regulation to afford protection against removal from one Member State to another Member State in breach of the former’s laws or administrative requirements.   Instead: (i) the function was simply to provide a uniform, EU wide, approach to the issuing of licences for export outside the EU; and (ii), it was the Return Directive which provided remedies against the “<span style="font-style:italic">mischief</span>” of the unlawful removal of national treasures from one Member State to another. The Appellant argued in her written submissions: “…<span style="font-style:italic"> if the object was unlawfully removed as a matter of national law, the Member State from which the object originated will be notified under the [Export] Regulation and will then be able to secure its return using the mechanism provided by the [Return] …Directive. In those circumstances, there is simply no need for the [Export] … </span></p>

Prevention is better than cure.  The existence of the Return Directive is not a reason to deny the state of dispatch the ability to regulate export of items of cultural importance to it, in accordance with its own law, rather than in effect subcontract that protection to a third state with no cultural connection to the item in issue.  Allocating legal control to the state with the cultural interest in the item is the quickest, easiest and most effective way of ensuring that cultural goods are properly regulated and national heritage is protected and is consistent with the objectives behind Article 6 and 167 TFEU.   </p>

This is not a proposition that Mr Jaffey QC, for the Respondent, quibbled with.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.58in;margin-right:0.04in">The Appellant explains how the argument came about in the Court below.  The conclusion of the joint expert on Italian law (Professor Lenzerini) was that obtaining a <span style="text-decoration:underline">new</span> certificate of free movement was a mere formality because the Italian authority would have been obliged to grant it. The Appellant states that neither she nor the Respondent had anticipated that evidence. However, the Lenzerini report post-dated the parties’ original pleadings and accordingly, neither the original pleadings nor supporting evidence addressed the implications of the requirement to obtain a licence being a formality.  The Appellant therefore sought permission to rely upon a new ground: that a purely formal requirement to obtain a certificate was an unjustified restriction on intra-Union trade. The Appellant relied on the well known case law of the Court to the effect that even a purely formal obligation to obtain an export licence would violate Article 35 TFEU (see e.g. Case 68/76 <span style="font-style:italic">Commission v France – re export licences for potatoes</span> [1977] ECR 5151, at paragraph [14]). The Judge granted permission to raise the ground on the condition that if she concluded that evidence was needed to justify the restriction the First Interested Party (the Italian competent authority) would be afforded a reasonable opportunity to adduce it.  </p>

It is correct that under EU law national export licensing regimes are a restriction upon the free movement of goods, even where the grant of a licence is routine.  However, the judge was (rightly) wary of accepting the Appellant’s invitation to opine on the compatibility of the Italian law with EU law (Judgment paragraph [84]). Not to exercise such caution would undermine the system of mutual trust inherent in the EU regime: See, e.g. Case C399/11 <span style="font-style:italic">Melloni v Ministerio Fiscal</span> (EU:C:2013:107) at paragraphs [57] - [59] and <span style="font-style:italic">Opinion 2/13 on EU Accession to the ECHR </span>(ECLI:EU:C:2014:2454) at [191] - [192].

That is precisely what the Italian regime does. Such a scheme is permitted and envisaged by Article 36 TFEU.

The prohibition in Article 35 TFEU has direct effect (also preserved during the IP) and is therefore capable of being relied upon before the courts to set aside inconsistent national law.  In the ordinary course such powers are exercised by the courts of the state whose legislation is being challenged. In the present case the invitation is to declare inapplicable a foreign law.  Since all the courts of the EU are competent to apply the supremacy doctrine there is nothing in principle which precludes such an outcome. Nonetheless, the prospect is potentially controversial for obvious reasons. The courts in Member State A might be ill equipped to understand the intricacies of the law of Member State B.  They might not have before them representatives of the authorities from Member State B to give evidence about their laws.  They might not understand applicable legislative procedures in Member State B which might hinder their ability to measure its lawfulness or proportionality.  They might apply principles of interpretation alien to the foreign system of law which leads to a different conclusion about the scope and/or effect of the foreign law.

It would need to be astute to the risk or possibility that the appellant was seeking to deploy the good offices of the court for the purpose of a collateral challenge to a foreign law that should by rights have been brought in the foreign court in issue.

Mr O’Neill QC, for the Appellant, argues that this conclusion suffices and that there is no further burden upon his client. The burden now shifts to the Respondent to justify the restriction with full and comprehensive evidence.  In this regard Mr O’Neill QC was insistent that there was no duty on his client to spell out, with full particulars, the exact provisions of Italian law that were being objected to - that task fell to the state seeking to justify the restriction as part of its burden and standard of proof. I do not agree with this analysis.  It is a point of some significance because specification of the restrictive measure in question is central to the Respondent state knowing exactly what it must defend.  In this case it is relevant that the Appellant does not challenge the basic Italian law on export control.  It is acknowledged that there needs to be a system of export controls to protect the artistic and cultural heritage of the Italian state. So, there is <span style="text-decoration:underline">no</span> challenge to the system as a whole and the Respondent does not have to adduce evidence to meet that challenge.  Equally, there is no challenge to the modalities of the licence application system.  For instance, it is not said that the process of applying for an export licence is unduly protracted or expensive or complicated.

No one argued before her that there was no equivalent provision in the 2004 Code or that otherwise there was no obligation upon her imposed by Italian law to apply for a licence and thereby provide the authorities with notice. The Judge did record a dispute about whether the 15 day waiting period had been codified (it had). The judge identified the restriction at the heart of the challenge as being a duty to give notice. There is no challenge to her conclusion on this.  If the Appellant was seriously in doubt as to the source of her duties under Italian law then it was well within the ability of her legal advisers to prove such an assertion by reference to the law.  She has after all been advised throughout by Italian lawyers and she was embroiled in litigation with the Italian authorities in 2004 when the new Code came into being. To suggest that her legal team is unable to identify the target of their challenge and that the burden of identifying the restriction lay with the Respondent is artificial and unsustainable.   </p>

In my view the analysis of the Judge was correct. In this case the gravamen of the Appellant’s objection is that she was subjected to a duty to provide advance notice of her intention to remove the painting.  The Judge found that such an obligation existed under Italian law. There is no serious basis upon which that finding can be challenged and, in truth, the Appellant does not say that such an obligation does not exist, and indeed it is the nub of her case that it does exist.  Such an obligation does, <span style="font-style:italic">prima facie</span>, fall within Article 35 TFEU.  It is that notice requirement (and not any wider part of the system) which therefore requires justification under Article 36 TFEU. In particular – since she does not challenge the system as a whole but only its application to her – it is the applicability of the notice obligation to her on the present facts which has to be justified. </p>

And a failure to adduce that superfluous evidence would render the law in question unlawful. There is no magic <span style="font-style:italic">per se</span> in the adducing of evidence.  What matters is that the Member State satisfies the court that the measure in issue is justified.  That might be through evidence, or submissions and argument, or a combination of both.  The Court in all of the cited cases was merely calibrating the requirement on a Member State to adduce evidence against the need of the national court to satisfy itself that the justification being advanced was well made.  There is no absolute duty to adduce evidence.  There is a duty to adduce such material as is needed to enable the Court to perform its task. But what that material will be will vary from case to case, from industry to industry, and from issue to issue. In an appropriate case it might be no more than evidence of the restriction itself (i.e. the act, instrument or measure comprising the measure complained of) which suffices to enable the court to draw an ineluctable conclusion about its purpose.  </p>

These are overwhelmingly gambling cases where there is a long history of references to the Court of Justice and where it is apparent that there are many different justifications advanced for restrictions upon gambling in different Member States spanning religious and moral considerations, concerns about addiction and consumer protection, and the policy of some states to introduce national lotteries to generate funds for good causes.  The justifications are many and various and are predicated upon complex social and economic national factors. The cases heard before the Court of Justice are replicated in this jurisdiction in cases also involving gambling (see e.g. <span style="font-style:italic">Gibraltar Betting and Gambling v Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport</span> [2014] EWHC 3326 (Admin)).  The proportionality of the national restrictions in issue in all these cases raised difficult factual and evidential questions and it was unsurprising therefore that the states seeking to justify such restrictions on trade needed to adduce relevant evidence. These cases do not in my view assist the Appellant’s analysis in the present case where the impugned restriction is fundamentally different in nature.   </p>

The Court also observed, in relation to the appropriate judicial scrutiny of such restrictions, that where “… a<span style="font-style:italic"> national measure does not threaten the integration of the internal market, for example because the subject matter lies within an area of national rather than EU competence, a less strict approach is generally adopted. That also tends to be the case in contexts where an unregulated economic activity would be harmful to consumers, particularly where national regulatory measures are influenced by national traditions and culture”</span> (paragraph [37]). In addition, caution had to be applied when seeking to draw lessons from dicta of the Court of Justice arising in cases in particular sectors, since it was apparent from the case law as a whole that there were differences in the application of the proportionality test as between different activities (judgment paragraph [34]). There is no one cap which fits all. In my view the cases cited by the Appellant do not compel the conclusion that the state must adduce evidence, however superfluous, irrespective of whether the justification for the restriction is obvious or a matter of common sense.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.58in;margin-right:0.04in">First, the duty on Member States to impose a licensing regime to cover exports from the EU is imposed by the Export Regulation.  It is hard to see how a licensing regime can operate absent some form of a duty on those seeking a licence to apply for one. The Appellant does not say that <span style="font-style:italic">prima facie</span> a duty to apply and provide notice is not integral to an effective licensing regime. Under the Export Regulation the duty to apply and give notice is subject to only limited exceptions but these are for categories of cultural items into which the Giotto painting does not fit: see paragraph [45] above. Italy was therefore under an obligation to impose the licensing regime upon Mrs Simonis and she had a duty to comply.  Indeed, under Article 9 of the Export Regulation Member States are required to impose sanctions for breach. The argument advanced by the Appellant that her facts are exceptional cannot therefore succeed.  There is no exception in the Export Regulation for a case such as hers. On this basis the suggestion that Italy is in breach of EU law founders because all that Italy was doing was applying the Export Regulation to her. Mr O’Neill QC, in oral argument, sought to circumvent this by arguing that when Mrs Simonis removed the painting from Italy she was not seeking to dispatch the painting <span style="font-style:italic">from</span> the EU, which is what the Export Regulation is concerned with, and therefore the obligation upon her to give notice hindered a purely intra-EU dispatch ie from Italy to the UK, which is not a dispatch <span style="text-decoration:underline">from</span> the EU.  Therefore, the duty in the Export Regulation to impose a licence requirement did not apply. This seems highly contrived. This case is all about removal from the EU.  London is the hub of the international art market and Italy is a </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.60in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.00in">major source of art works.  The elephant in the room is that a better price is likely to be realised on the international market than from a forced sale to the state <span style="text-decoration:underline">in</span> Italy and of course Mrs Simonis now seeks a licence from the Arts Council to remove the painting out of the EU, to Switzerland.  In short, a notice requirement introduced as part of an export licensing regime is integral to such a system and since the system itself is justified by an EU regulation it is in my view impossible to say that the notice obligation is not likewise justified.    </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.58in;margin-right:0.04in">Second, even if (to test the Appellant’s argument further) in 2007 all that Mrs Simonis wished to do was dispatch the painting for some intra-EU purpose, the analysis would not change.  Again, the short answer is that in the field of cultural goods all Member States are entitled to put in place licensing rules which compel the provision of prior notice of dispatch from that state.  And this remains so even where it is predictable that the authority will grant the licence sought, whether as a formality or otherwise. In <span style="text-decoration:underline">all</span> cases the state is entitled to apply a system of prophylactic, advance, verification.  Otherwise no state could prevent wholesale avoidance of the system to the obvious detriment of its national culture. Therefore the argument (premised as it is upon the suggestion in the expert report that the authorities would be bound to grant a new licence) that in such cases Italy has no right to operate a verification procedure, involving prior notice, simply misses the point.  Italy is always entitled to verify that a putative exporter is properly entitled to dispatch the item from Italy and onto the wider international market.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.58in;margin-right:0.04in">The Commission identifies two misuses of licensing systems which resonate in this case.  First, there is the deliberate under-estimation of value of cultural goods in export applications with a view to diverting attention from true value and true cultural significance.  In this case there is some evidence of such a practice – see paragraphs </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.60in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.00in">[19] – [21] above.  Second, there is the situation described of “<span style="font-style:italic">unscrupulous</span>” traders misusing the temporary licence regime by obtaining consent temporarily to dispatch an item to another Member State and then applying to the authorities of a second Member State to obtain a full licence to export from the EU permanently.  Once the item has left the EU and been sold on the open market the chances of the interested state recovering the work for the benefit of its citizens are negligible. Mr O’Neill QC bridled strongly at the suggestion that this case was comparable. In my view it is. Here Mrs Simonis did not even apply for a temporary licence.  She took matters into her own hands and removed the painting from Italy, providing notice to the Italian authorities after the event, as a <span style="font-style:italic">fait accompli.  </span>And she<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>now seeks to compel the Arts Council to grant her a licence to dispatch the painting from the EU, notwithstanding opposition from the state most directly interested.  To my mind, and whatever the ultimate merits or otherwise of the position of Mrs Simonis, the present facts are at least a paradigm illustration of just why a state must be able to verify in advance the position of proposed exports.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.58in;margin-right:0.04in">The Commission 2019 Report also provides evidence of the way in which exceptions to national licensing regimes are operated in practice and as to the reasons arising for refusing licences.  It appears that only one state operates a system of exceptions thereby underscoring the importance that is attached to universal verification.  But it also indicates that a high percentage of applications are granted and provides evidence that almost all states impose what the Appellant terms “<span style="font-style:italic">formalities</span>” facilitating verification.

The main argument for making use of the possibility is that archaeological objects which are not the direct product of excavations are deemed to have limited scientific value because of their separation from their archaeo-historical context.  </p>

In most cases, an export licence application is rejected or withdrawn by the applicant for other reasons such as: insufficient proof of licit provenance; non-compliance with the applicable rules; the object is a fake; or the issue of which Member State is competent to issue the licence has not been resolved. Cases where the applicant refuses to provide further information on provenance when requested and then immediately withdraws their application are rare. When that happens, the majority of Member States reject the application, inform the applicant and, if there is suspicion of illicit provenance, they also inform the appropriate law enforcement authorities about the case.” </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.58in;margin-right:0.04in">Fourth, I address briefly the Appellant’s argument that because Professor Lenzerini suggested that the Italian authorities would be required to grant a licence as, so it was argued, a formality that this in itself justified the conduct of Mrs Simonis and is dispositive of the Article 36 TFEU analysis.  For the reasons given that is not the case.  The state has a powerful right, even in the case of formalities, to apply a protective, <span style="font-style:italic">ex ante</span>, verification process.  But in any event, I do not accept the Appellant’s analysis of the implications of the expert evidence. The point is that whilst the expert did indicate that in his view the authorities would be bound to grant an export licence: (i) he was clear that this had to be <span style="font-style:italic">upon application</span> by Mrs Simonis; and (ii), the duty on the authorities to grant a licence was for technical reasons which could be capable of being unravelled under Italian law. In other words, the grant of a licence might not have been the end of the story and whilst any complications and legal difficulties were being resolved the authorities could seek interim relief from the courts to prevent dispatch from Italy.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.58in;margin-right:0.04in">Finally, the argument is also advanced that the notice requirement is not the least restrictive measure that could be imposed and for this reason it is unjustified as disproportionate under Article 36 TFEU.  There is nothing in this point.  The Commission 2019 Report says that the licensing system has been reasonably successful in controlling exports i.e. there is evidence that the system works. Further, it is not suggested that the process of making an application is especially burdensome, expensive or time consuming.  The posited (superior – less restrictive) alternative is the Return Directive.  It is said that this is a perfectly workable, existing, mechanism </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.60in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.00in">which operates following dispatch and can adequately address those cases where there is a dispute between an exporter and a state. I disagree.  Any comparison between an easily worked and successful licence application system and the exigencies of the operation of the Return Directive and the risk of full scale foreign litigation that it can give rise to (and which this case illustrates) demonstrates just why an advance notice obligation as part of a licence application regime is just about as good as it gets in terms of proportionality.  </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.58in;margin-right:0.04in">Finally - A1P1.  This argument did not loom large.  The Appellant puts the argument in the following way. The Return Directive balances the interests of a Member State seeking recovery of its national treasures with the legitimate property rights of the owners of those cultural objects.  So, Article 8(1) requires the competent authority of the requesting Member State to bring proceedings within three years of becoming aware of the location of the cultural object and of the identity of its possessor or holder.   Here the Italian authorities brought no proceedings within the required time frame for return of the painting from the UK.  Article 10 of the Return Directive provides that where <span style="font-style:italic">“… return of the object is ordered, the competent court in the requested Member State shall award the possessor fair compensation according to the circumstances of the case, provided that the possessor demonstrates that he exercised due care and attention in acquiring the object</span>”.    It also provides that the “… <span style="font-style:italic">requesting Member State shall pay that compensation upon return of the object</span>.”  The duty to pay compensation ensures observance of the fundamental rights (Article 17 of the Fundamental Charter and A1P1) for respect for their property.  None of these safeguards are provided for in the Export Regulation.  Applying the principle <span style="font-style:italic">generalia specialibus non derogant </span>this tells<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>against construing the more general provisions of the Export Regulation in a way that indirectly achieves the same ends but without the accompanying safeguards, alternatively it is an argument in favour of concluding that the Italian law is disproportionate under Article 36 TFEU. I disagree with the premise behind this argument. The Export Regulation balances the rights of the State with those of the owner.  It is not unlawful by reference to standards of fundamental and human rights for a state to regulate the export of cultural items.  If and insofar as there is, however, an issue under, for instance, A1P1 then that is a right that can be pursued by Mrs Simonis in the Italian courts.  Nothing in EU law or for that matter Italian or English law can prevent Mrs Simonis from pursuing any right to compensation that she believes that she has <span style="text-decoration:underline">in</span> Italy which is the state allegedly depriving her of her rights.  Nothing in these asserted rights affects either the construction or the validity of the Italian law.  </p>

There is no arguable case that Italian law is invalid.  In any event a reference is a matter of discretion.  If the Appellant is so confident that she would be entitled to an export licence as of right, then she has not had the courage of her conviction and accepted the offer of an export licence back to Italy from the Arts Council. If she is correct, then upon return of the painting to Italy she will obtain the necessary export licence.  Doing this would be a quicker, cheaper </p>
