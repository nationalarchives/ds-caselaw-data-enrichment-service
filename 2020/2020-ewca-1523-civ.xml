	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.61in;margin-right:0.00in">As the Judge explained in paragraph 2, cauda equina syndrome (‘CES’) is commonly caused by the prolapse of a large disc in the spinal canal. This compresses a bundle of nerves which transmit messages to and from the bladder, bowel, genitals and saddle area, interfering with sensation and movement. Once it has been diagnosed, it is seen as an emergency, because unless the pressure on the nerves is released quickly, they can be damaged permanently. A clinical diagnosis of CES is confirmed by an MRI scan. </p>

	  <num style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000;background-color:auto;margin-left:0.61in;text-indent:-0.23in">6.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.61in;margin-right:0.00in">There is a group of symptoms, described as ‘red flags’, the presence of which may lead a clinician to suspect CES. Often, as in this case, a patient has severe pain in his lower back, and sciatica. The red flags include numbness (or hypoaesthesia) in the saddle/peri-anal, or genital area, or in the urethra. Most patients who go to an accident and emergency department (‘A and E’) with suspected CES are not, in fact, suffering from it. There are different types of CES, depending on the extent of nerve damage. </p>

	</paragraph>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.64in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">These include CES Incomplete (‘CESI’) and CES Complete, or Retention CES (‘CESR’). All patients with CES experience a continuous deterioration, but the rate of deterioration varies between patients. Sometimes the deterioration is complete within hours. Other patients’ CESI never reaches CESR. It was agreed that, in general, on balance of probability, the outcome of surgery for patients with CESI tends to be good, whereas it tends to be poor for patients with CESR. It is therefore vital, once a clinician suspects CES, that an MRI scan is done as soon as possible (or as soon as is reasonably possible), and that, if CES is found, the patient has decompression surgery as soon as possible (or as soon as is reasonably possible). </p>

The GP recommended that he go to Watford General Hospital (‘the Hospital’) immediately as that was where the A and E department was.

That was ‘more serious’, and could lead to symptoms in the bowel, bladder, anus or genitalia. If the Claimant was getting those symptoms, he should go to the A and E department at the Hospital. The GP’s notes record that he considered that this was potentially a case of CES (‘??’) and that he had advised the Claimant to go to the A and E department at the Hospital for an urgent review. He also recorded that the Claimant had ‘no abdo pain, no urinary/bowels sx [symptoms], no numbness in perianal area, reports developed numbness under genitals/saddle area in the past 1 hr, and pain increasing ++’.  </p>

Trust 2’s handover sheet recorded numbness in the Claimant’s left buttock, leg and foot. The Claimant was seen by Dr Roffey, an FY2 A and E (that, is a junior hospital doctor who was in his second year of his foundation training) at 0920 in the ‘Majors’ area of A and E. He noted the report of saddle numbness and that there had been no obvious disturbance of the Claimant’s bowel or bladder. On examination, he found ‘good anal tone’. He did not diagnose CES, but referred the Claimant for orthopaedic assessment in the light of ‘new neurology’. His treatment plan included pain relief and admission for a further scan. His notes record that the Claimant was ‘accepted’ in the orthopaedic department at 1040. No allegation of negligence was made against Dr Roffey. </p>

Dr McKenzie recorded his review as orthopaedic registrar at 1500. It described the Claimant’s ‘Painless urinary retention’ and said ‘neurology worsening’. The plan was that there should be an urgent discussion with Mr Langdon (the orthopaedic consultant at the Hospital) ‘for theatre today…Impression: cauda equina’. The MRI of the lumbar spine showed a ‘massive L5/S1disc herniation which occupied ‘most of the central canal’. A further note at 1500 recorded a discussion with the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery in Queen Square, London (‘QSH’). QSH would review the scans and arrange for the Claimant’s transfer, if necessary.

All emergency departments receiving such patients should have an agreed protocol with their spinal service for the assessment, imaging and referral of such cases. Whether an MRI scan was needed should be established. MRI scans should be done locally if possible. Patients with suspected CES must have access to a 24-hour MRI service. If CES compression is confirmed by an MRI scan, the local specialist unit must be told immediately, and the scans made available. The patient should be directly transferred to the unit with the images and documents. If the clinical and radiological assessment indicates that surgery might reduce long-term damage, it should be done immediately. </p>

On legal causation, the Claimant argued that had he had decompression surgery before 1500, he would not have developed CESR. Trust 1’s case was that when the Claimant was admitted, it was likely, already, that he was in urinary retention but that he would, unavoidably, have developed CESR by 1203, and certainly by 1445/1500 when it is likely that Dr McKenzie saw the MRI scan. ‘It is therefore unlikely…that any decompressive surgery before that time would have impacted upon his condition and prognosis’ (paragraph 30). </p>

Her conclusion was that both experts gave their evidence in good faith, and that there was nothing in their evidence which caused her to prefer one expert’s evidence to that of the other. Her view was that ‘…Dr Swale’s evidence is too inflexible when set against the evidence and publications and that Dr Russell’s evidence accurately reflects a reasonable position in terms of the options available to [the GP]’ at the relevant time. She noted (paragraph 45) that Dr Swale had ‘fairly conceded that if I accept the factual evidence I heard from Dr [sic] Langdon (which I do) that any GP who tried at 0600 to refer a suspected CES directly to the orthopaedic department rather than to the A and E department would be informed to go through A and E, then the GP would have discharged his/her duty and the alleged failure to refer to a specialist would not have affected the outcome’. The Judge was referring here to the evidence of Mr Langdon, which, she recorded in paragraph 54, she had accepted, that ‘had [the GP] rung the A &amp;E department [sic] between 0600 and 0630 on 12 March 2012, on the balance of probabilities he would have been advised to re-route the Claimant to the A&amp;E department’.

The Judge noted the lack of evidence about the two other cases (one patient with cancer, and a patient with compression of the spinal cord) and about whether there had been any conversation about displacing either patient. The Claimant’s case was that the Judge should draw an inference that his case should have had priority. She reviewed the evidence of the experts about this. She noted, importantly, that Mr Thorpe ‘agreed that the time taken from logging the scan request to availability of the images was reasonable’. She preferred Professor Fairbank’s evidence, as ‘more balanced on this issue’.

He also agreed that it would reasonably take some 2 hours 10 minutes from logging the request to scan, scanning, uploading the results to taking the decision to operate. It would take another 90 minutes to prepare the patient for surgery, including anaesthetic induction. The time taken to reach decompression was variable, potentially 60 to 90 minutes. In short, a period of some six and a half hours could reasonably elapse between orthopaedic acceptance and decompression’. In the light of her findings on legal causation, even if Trust 1 and the GP were negligent, the outcome would have been no different, based on the timings conceded by Mr Thorpe. To spell this out: the Claimant’s pleaded case was that he was in CESR by 1500. He was ‘accepted’ as an orthopaedic patient at 1040 (paragraph 40). If six and a half hours are added to 1040, they make 1710. Thus, on Mr Thorpe’s own evidence about reasonable timings, the Claimant could not reasonably have been operated on before, even on his pleaded case, his condition became CESR. </p>

Because the Claimant never showed those symptoms before 1500, Mr Mannion thought that his condition was still CESI. He also considered that patients who have lost the desire/ability to urinate could be either in CESR or in CESI. Mr Crocker and Mr Cowie thought that rigid adherence to the literature was unreliable and not very practical in the modern era when CES tends to be diagnosed earlier than it used to be. They did not see CESR and CESI as hard-edged categories, although they were content to agree working definitions. Their approach was to be cautious about the literature since CES is complex and controversial, and to focus on the ‘pathophysiological indicators’ in the case in hand. Where a patient is numb from very early in the day, and does not want to, and cannot, urinate, despite having a very full bladder, ‘CESR has probably been reached’.

Mr Crocker said that bladder function was the best surrogate marker for autonomic function, and that there was no salvageable bladder function by 1203.

On average, a person feels an urge to urinate when there are between 300 and 400 ml of urine in his bladder. The scan showed a residual volume of 621 ml at 1203. That suggested that there had been a period, before 1203, when although the bladder was full, the Claimant had felt no desire to urinate, suggesting, in turn, that the function of the relevant nerves was impaired. If it is assumed that adults produce, on average, 50 ml of urine an hour, there were 400 ml of urine in the Claimant’s bladder at 0800. Yet the Claimant had felt no urge to urinate. That suggested that CESR was established by 0800. By 1203 the bladder was pathologically swollen. The Claimant had been unable to urinate after the scan, when he was asked to. He had not tried to before that, and had not felt that he wanted to. Change in rectal tone is a relevant factor, but ‘nowhere near as reliable’ an index as bladder function’. </p>

She explained, in paragraph 91(iii) why she accepted Mr Crocker’s argument that the literature gave limited help, but she was careful not to discount it altogether. She could not accept Mr Mannion’s insistence that CESR could not be confirmed without overflow incontinence and loss of anal/perineal tone. As she explained, overflow incontinence is ‘a secondary marker of a loss of executive bladder control which is a surrogate marker occurring hours earlier’.

A judge is not obliged to decide every single disputed issue, or to give reasons for her reasons, as the Judge appreciated (see paragraph 91: ‘…for the following non-exhaustive reasons’). In this case, the Judge decided the issues which, the parties had agreed, after the evidence, she had to decide (see paragraph 37). There were four issues. Some involved sub-issues, but this was not a case in which the parties agreed that there was a complicated sequence of issues, each of which was capable of influencing the overall result. It was not, therefore, a case in which she was required to do more than to explain, in a way which was intelligible to the parties, who were familiar with the interstices of the dispute, why she had decided the agreed issues in the way in which she had. Moreover, it is clear from several passages in the transcript of the hearing to which this court was taken by counsel, that the Judge engaged in a thorough and rigorous way with a range of issues which she did not specifically refer to in the judgment; and the parties know that. </p>

A judge is not expected to summarise all the evidence, but only to refer to the evidence which is significant to the decision.

She recorded, in paragraph 36, that the parties had agreed what test she should apply. The Claimant objects that paragraph 36 does not accurately reflect the Claimant’s position, because his position was that in an emergency, each step must be taken as soon as practicably possible. Whether or not the Judge accurately recorded her understanding of what the parties agreed, the test she described is legally accurate. To introduce a gloss such as the Claimant now suggests, if it had led to a decision adverse to the Respondents, would, rightly, have prompted an appeal from them. The Judge was right to use reasonableness as a touchstone, while making it clear that what was reasonable depended on the context, and that part of the context was that, on his case, the Claimant was an emergency. The other part of the context is the relatively limited resources of a District General Hospital in a busy public health service with many urgent cases competing for attention.  </p>

The Claimant points to parts of his evidence, which, it is suggested, are illogical. In particular, the Claimant relies on a suggestion by Dr Russell that a reasonable option for the GP in this case would have been to refer the Claimant for a face-to-face consultation with a GP. This was said to be contrary to the experts’ joint statement, and intrinsically illogical. A submission on an appeal such as this that the Judge did not take something into account ‘properly’ starts from a shaky foundation. But that does not help the Claimant. The Claimant has to persuade the court that no reasonable judge could have taken the approach to Dr Russell’s evidence which the Judge took. That submission was not expressly made. If it had been, it would have failed. In any event, the Judge did refer to this particular criticism of Dr Russell’s evidence, and explained why it did not affect her overall assessment of his evidence (paragraphs 49 and 51). The Judge could not reasonably be expected to have done more than she did with this point; indeed, it might be said that her approach was a textbook example of how to evaluate whether an attack on part of an expert’s evidence should undermine all of his evidence, or not. The real question here is not, as Mr Booth seemed at times to suggest, the credibility of Dr Russell as an expert, but whether the different components of his evidence, judged on their merits, were persuasive. I therefore reject this submission. </p>

That is so even if she was wrong about which page of the NICE guidelines Dr Swale referred to in his evidence (see paragraph 46). I doubt, however, whether she was, since the case against the GP had not been presented initially on the basis that the GP had been negligent in not treating the Claimant as a ‘follow-up patient’ (as that term is used in the NICE guidelines); nor was that case put to the GP in cross-examination. She explained why she resolved that dispute as she did in paragraph 52. That approach was open to her. It is not even arguably wrong. I would also accept the more detailed reasons given by Mr Antelme in his oral submissions and in the GP’s skeleton argument for upholding this aspect of the Judge’s judgment. I do not consider that there is anything to criticise in the conduct of this busy out-of-hours GP. In a short telephone call he took an accurate history from the Claimant, skilfully elicited a red flag for CES, diagnosed suspected CES, and gave the Claimant sensible and reasonable advice, which was to go to the A and E department at the Hospital where an urgent scan could be organised and he could be referred to an orthopaedic doctor. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.63in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Booth argued that the Judge was wrong, in paragraph 54, to hold that, even if the GP was negligent, it would have made no difference, because if the GP had rung A and E between 0600 and 0630, he would have been advised, on the balance of probability, to re-route the claimant to A and E. He relied on the judgment of Neuberger LJ (as he then was) in <span style="font-style:italic">Wright v Cambridge Medical Group </span>[2011] EWCA (Civ) 669; [2013] QB 312 for the proposition that if a defendant GP has been negligent in his treatment of a patient, he cannot rely on subsequent negligent treatment of the same patient by a hospital to escape liability. This point does not arise in this case, because the GP was not negligent. In any event, it is not easy to tease a ratio from this decision as the two members of the court who allowed the appeal did so for different reasons. Further, it is clear from the judgment of Neuberger LJ that he was not articulating a legal rule that applies in all cases, in part, because the application of any such rule will depend on what damage was caused by each successive negligent act.  </p>

The main evidence about this was Dr McKenzie’s hearsay statement, which the Judge decided to admit, subject to weight. The Claimant does not have leave to challenge that aspect of the Judge’s reasoning. Dr McKenzie’s evidence, unsurprisingly, some time after the event, was about his standard practice in a case such as the Claimant’s rather than evidence of what he remembered. That evidence was supplemented by the evidence of Ms Devereux on two relevant points:  outpatients were scanned between about 0900 and 1130, and the slot between 1130 and 1400 was reserved for scans of inpatients; and any request for an urgent scan had to be approved by a consultant radiologist.

The Claimant argued that one or other of those patients should have been ‘bumped’ to make way for the Claimant. All three were scanned, not in the elective list in the morning, but in the inpatient slot in the late morning/afternoon (between 1130 and 1400). There was evidence, which the Judge was entitled to accept, that the person who accorded priority to requests for scans was the radiology consultant, who had to agree all requests for scans. Mr Hutton clarified in his oral submissions that it was agreed at trial that the request for the Claimant’s scan was uploaded onto CRIS at 1159. By that time, one of the two patients was already being scanned. She was a gynaecological referral with suspected cancer. It would not have been reasonable to remove her from the scanner in order to replace her with the Claimant. The other patient, who was scanned next, had suspected cord compression. The Judge was entitled to infer, on the evidence which this court was shown, that that patient’s case was as urgent, if not more urgent, than the Claimant’s. The request for the scan in that case was made earlier than 1159. Mr Booth was asked about this point, and did not go so far as to submit that the only inference which the Judge could draw in relation to the two gaps in the evidence on which he relied (of which this was one) was the inference he contended for, that is, an inference adverse to Trust 1. He complained that there was a gap in the evidence which was ‘in the gift’ of Trust 1; but that gap was partly a product of the fact that the Claimant’s pleaded case was that he should have been scanned significantly earlier. Moreover, the Judge cannot be criticised for not, herself, taking steps to require Trust 1 to fill that gap if the Claimant did not ask her to. </p>

Both the Respondents’ experts relied in their evidence on a distinction between somatic and autonomic nerves (skeleton argument, paragraphs 95 and 103). The fact that the Respondents admitted that the DREs had been done says nothing about their significance. Anal tone was not referred to in the experts’ agreed definitions. Mr Mannion accepted in his report that anal tone was not, of itself, a reliable marker. Indeed, the Claimant had some anal tone when he was examined at QSH, at a time when, all experts agreed, he was in CESR. The unreliability of anal tone (as tested by a human observer by DRE) as a marker for CESR may in part be because the internal anal sphincter is controlled by the autonomic nervous system, and the external anal sphincter by the somatic nervous system, and the latter may be more resilient than the former. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.63in;margin-right:0.00in">The next issue is whether or not the Judge’s finding that the Claimant had lost bladder function is wrong. There is some conceptual confusion in this part of the case, and it is not helped by the ambiguous language of the experts’ agreed definitions. However, those definitions have to be read as a whole, and if the experts agreed that executive control of the bladder is a marker of CESI, then by implication, at least, they also agreed that loss of executive control is a marker of CESR. The Judge accepted that overflow incontinence is not often seen now because patients are often catheterised before that happens. That does not, of course, mean that the point at which it would happen, absent a catheter, is irrelevant, as the experts’ agreed definition appears to acknowledge. Overflow incontinence (whether actual, or which would have occurred absent a catheter) may, therefore, represent, in most cases, the point of no return. It does not follow that irreversible damage cannot occur before the point at which there is (or absent a catheter, would have been) overflow incontinence. The point at which a catheter was in fact, or might have been, or should have been inserted is not decisive. Loss of executive control means loss of control of the ability to contract the bladder and to relax the sphincter. A person who has lost executive control of the bladder cannot contract the bladder or relax the sphincter, and so cannot urinate voluntarily. An insensate bladder is one which can no longer transmit to the brain a message that the bladder is full. If a patient’s bladder is insensate, then, even though, objectively, his bladder is full, that patient no longer has the desire to urinate. The Claimant had reached that point by 1203. Overflow incontinence is, as the Judge found, a secondary marker of loss of executive control (paragraph 91(iii)). It occurs when the bladder is so full that the sheer pressure of the bladder contents overcomes the resistance which is normally provided by the sphincter. When overflow incontinence occurs is a product of various factors, including how much fluid the patient had drunk before and after the nerve injury. It can therefore occur after the bladder has suffered irreversible damage. </p>

He had, therefore, by 1203, at the latest, lost executive control of his bladder. At least by implication from the experts’ agreed position, the Claimant was, by 1203, in CESR. As Trust 1 and Trust 2 point out, Mr Mannion was not able to refer to anything in the literature which supported the proposition that a patient who has lost the desire and ability to urinate is in CESI, and he accepted that the Claimant was in urinary retention by 1203. Moreover, progress to overflow incontinence is influenced by extraneous factors such as how much fluid the patient has drunk before the nerve damage, as Mr Mannion accepted in his evidence (as Trust 1 and Trust 2 point out in paragraph 86 of their skeleton argument). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.68in;margin-right:0.00in">For the reasons I have given, I would dismiss this appeal. I add two things. First, having read, heard, and reflected on, the detailed attack on the judgment in the Claimant’s written and oral submissions, and the response to that from the Respondents, I not only consider that the decision which she made was one which was open to the Judge, but that it was the right decision. Second, I agree with all the Respondents that this is not a case of wider general public importance. It is, of course, very important to the Claimant. But it turns on its own facts. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.68in;margin-right:0.00in">We were told that, so far as is known, this was the first case directly relating to the treatment of CES which has come before the Court of Appeal. But that does not mean that it raises issues of principle of general application. In fact an appellate court, a court of law, often may need to be careful to avoid making generalised pronouncements on the obligations of doctors in medical situations. What is ordinarily required, in each case, is consideration of whether the responses and procedures actually undertaken in a given medical situation fall outwith the range of reasonable and logically justifiable responses and procedures, applying the <span style="font-style:italic">Bolam</span>/<span style="font-style:italic">Bolitho</span> principles, on the facts of the individual case. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.68in;margin-right:0.00in">The present grounds of appeal are directed at the judge’s primary findings of fact and her evaluation of the facts. Regrettably, they in my view fall foul of virtually all the warnings and prohibitions contained in the various recent authorities, as most recently summarised in <span style="font-style:italic">Perry</span>. The selected quotations and citations from the evidence and literature advanced in his most careful and thorough submissions by Mr Booth QC, for example, thus in turn were matched – more than matched – by the counterquotations and citations in their no less careful and thorough submissions by Mr Antelme QC and Mr Hutton QC. In fact the overall impression conveyed to me, from the arguments, of island hopping in the whole sea of evidence caused me at stages also to wonder (changing the geographical allusion) if Mr Booth was sailing in the Pacific Ocean while Mr Antelme and Mr Hutton were sailing a parallel course in the Atlantic Ocean. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.68in;margin-right:0.00in">As I see it, the judge is to be commended for getting closely to grips with the totality of the evidence and in making, in her careful reserved judgment, a thoroughly rational and cogent appraisal of the evidence. The criticisms of her judgment in the Grounds of Appeal and supporting arguments demonstrably are not made out: indeed some of the criticisms in my view should never have been made in the first place (although in fairness Mr Booth himself, who had not appeared below, wisely moderated at least some of them). It rather troubled me that the appellant’s submissions at stages seemed to come close to advocating an approach in effect requiring a counsel of perfection, bordering on strict liability: a long way away from the yardstick of reasonableness. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.68in;margin-right:0.00in">I am, speaking for myself, most surprised, given the circumstances, that the claim against the GP was pursued at all. (I say this irrespective of the, in itself conclusive, causation finding of the judge, having regard to the evidence of Mr Langdon.) As to the claim against Trust 1, the judge’s findings both on liability and on causation, on her appraisal and evaluation of the evidence and which appraisal and evaluation were properly and reasonably open to her, are unassailable in the appellate court. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.68in;margin-right:0.00in">Obviously the overall outcome here is very unfortunate for the claimant. But sympathy cannot determine the proper outcome for this legal case. Therefore I agree that the appeal must be dismissed. </p>
