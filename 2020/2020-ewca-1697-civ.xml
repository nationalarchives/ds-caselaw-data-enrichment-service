The council decided that he was not, because he had caused the overcrowding by his own deliberate act in moving into the property in the first place. The appellant’s challenge to that decision was dismissed by Martin Spencer J. He now appeals to this court. </p>

The appellant and his partner were born in Brazil but their first language is Spanish.  In 2004 they moved to Spain, where they lived together until 2013 (when the appellant acquired Spanish nationality) and where their children were born. The appellant was employed in a factory making belts, but lost his job in 2013. He was unable to find work in Spain and travelled to the United Kingdom to look for work in November 2013, intending to save enough for his family to join him. He found a shared room in the Elephant and Castle area of London, where there is a large Latin American community.   </p>

This consisted of one bedroom, with an open plan living room and kitchen area. The family moved in on 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2014, paying a monthly rent of £1,000 which included bills.

Pursuant to section 326 of the 1985 Act the maximum capacity for a two roomed flat such as the appellant and his family occupied is three “units”. An adult or a child over the age of 10 counts as one unit, while a child between the ages of one and 10 counts as half a unit. Once the appellant’s younger son attained the age of 10 years, the household was assessed as having four units. Strictly speaking, the household was statutorily overcrowded from 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2016, the 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> birthday of the appellant’s elder son, when the household counted as 3 ½ units, but this does not matter for the purpose of this appeal. “Statutory overcrowding” is a term used in this technical sense, although the council also uses the term “overcrowding” (albeit not “statutory overcrowding”) in a looser sense. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In fact the appellant had only asked to be included in Band 3 so this decision gave him most of what he had been seeking (he had also asked for a priority star within Band 3). However, after consulting a local law centre, the appellant contended that if the council had applied its Housing Allocation Scheme correctly, he ought to have been placed in Band 1. That claim was first put forward in a pre-action protocol letter dated 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2019 and is the claim now advanced in these proceedings. The judge held that even though the appellant had not requested to be placed in Band 1, the council had considered whether he ought to be and had been right to do so, and accordingly gave permission for the judicial review claim to be advanced. There is no challenge to that decision on appeal. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The main point in my view was to consider how the overcrowding had come about and had later become statutory overcrowding. The overcrowding had started from when the [appellant] initially moved his family of four into the current 1bedroom flat. There was nothing to indicate this was anything other than a voluntary act. The [appellant] never suggested otherwise and I considered it to have been a deliberate act. The flat was overcrowded from the outset by reference to the bedroom standard set out at Appendix B in the Scheme which required two bedrooms. This was therefore different from the situation where a family’s current accommodation had once met the family’s needs but those needs had naturally increased as a result of the birth or adoption of children so that the accommodation no longer met their needs. In the present case, given the size of the household, this accommodation was never going to be suitable for the [appellant’s] family in the long or medium term. The statutory overcrowding then came about simply because, as mentioned above, the [appellant’s] younger son reached the age of 10 years, which meant that the space standard under s326 Housing Act 1985 was contravened. Again, this was not a case of natural increase in the size of the household and there was no other change of circumstances to break the chain of causation which led back to the [appellant’s] action in moving his family into the accommodation. </p>

But it would make no sense if a local authority had an obligation to formulate an allocation scheme, but no obligation to follow that scheme when deciding what priority should be accorded to applicants for housing.

The judge rejected this submission. He held that it was sufficient that the appellant had voluntarily entered into the tenancy in question when it was inevitable that there would be statutory overcrowding once his elder son attained the age of 10, and that it made no difference whether the appellant was aware of the terms of the statute or of the Scheme: </p>

He submitted that it was necessary to consider the appellant’s individual circumstances at the time when the family moved into the accommodation which eventually became statutorily overcrowded, and that in the context of the Scheme “a deliberate act” required some planned or intentional act which created the overcrowding. Here the overcrowding was caused, not by moving into the accommodation in the first place, but by the natural event of the children growing older.

Such schemes should also be implemented in a flexible manner, with the courts slow to interfere in the absence of irrationality. Here the judge had given the words of paragraph 6.2 of the Southwark Scheme an ordinary meaning which was flexible and not restrictive. The paragraphs of the Scheme dealing with “deliberately worsening housing circumstances” were directed to exceptional situations, which were not applicable here, and should not be used to import concepts of culpability into the banding scheme in paragraph 6.2. There was a distinction between statutory overcrowding arising from children growing older and the addition of a child to the family by birth or adoption. There was no obligation on the council to investigate the appellant’s circumstances further. The onus was on him to provide any relevant information to the council. </p>

Accordingly, the only question arising in these proceedings is whether the appellant “caused this statutory overcrowding by a deliberate act” within the meaning of paragraph 6.2.

An act is deliberate if it is something which the person who does it intends to do. It need not be culpable or planned. Accordingly, in agreement with the judge, I see no reason to interpret paragraph 6.2 as involving concepts of culpability. That is an unnecessary complication, apparently derived from paragraph 5.24 which, it is agreed, does not apply in this case. The applicant for public housing for whom the Scheme is primarily intended should not have to comb through this 60 page document, in the way that a lawyer might, to see whether the clear terms of paragraph 6.2 require qualification as a result of other provisions dealing with situations which do not apply to his case.  </p>

At that time he obtained for himself and his family the best accommodation which he could afford. He did not take it with any thought of improving his position on the register, a possibility of which at the time he had no knowledge. As Ms Tait expressly and rightly accepted in the decision letter, this was accommodation which it was reasonable for him to occupy with his family. One might ask, what else was he to do? As he could not have afforded any more spacious accommodation, either in Southwark or in any other central London borough, the only “choice” available to him was to continue living in the one room in Gordon Road or to leave his job and move his family elsewhere, to seek other employment and accommodation, either within the United Kingdom or abroad. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">First, in my view the supposed distinction between overcrowding as a result of children growing older and overcrowding as a result of an addition to the family by birth or adoption is misconceived. It is not actually a distinction contained in the Scheme, which merely states that a natural increase in family size due to birth or adoption is not to be regarded as a deliberate worsening of an applicant’s housing circumstances. It says nothing about the natural growth of children. Indeed, birth and adoption are much more likely to be caused by a deliberate act than the natural and inevitable growth of existing children. So even if it were relevant to interpret paragraph 6.2 of the Scheme by reference to paragraph 5.24.1, the result would be the same. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Second, I cannot see any valid basis on which the appellant could be placed in Band 3. That expressly excludes applicants who are statutorily overcrowded. Given that, as is common ground, Band 2 is not relevant in this case, the appellant should either have been placed in Band 1 (if the statutory overcrowding was not caused by his deliberate act) or in Band 4 (if it was). That gives coherence to the Scheme as it makes sense for an applicant whose deliberate act is the cause of his own problem to be given reduced priority. The fact that Ms Tait considered Band 3 to be the closest fit for the appellant’s circumstances ought to have alerted her to the fact that something had gone wrong in her decision-making. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Third, the council’s approach leads to some odd, or even perverse, consequences. It means that an applicant who acts reasonably in taking the most suitable accommodation for his family that he can afford disqualifies himself from priority once his children grow to an age which renders that accommodation statutorily overcrowded. An interpretation of the Scheme which has that consequence, or which incentivises an applicant to refuse accommodation which is suitable for his current needs because of the consequences which will ensue when his children reach the age of 10, is to say the least counter-intuitive and requires careful scrutiny. </p>
