The Council notified Miss Broderick that it regarded the duty which it had owed her under section 193 of the Housing Act 1996 (“the 1996 Act”) as having ceased as a result of the refusal. His Honour Judge Lamb QC allowed an appeal by Miss Broderick, but the Council now challenges Judge Lamb’s decision in this Court. </p>

In other words, the Council accepted that it owed what has been termed the “main homelessness duty” under section 193(2) of the 1996 Act. However, the Council’s letter went on to note that its duty to Miss Broderick would end if she refused an offer of suitable accommodation. </p>

Mrs Ross explained in the decision letter that, in carrying out her review, she had taken into account, among other things, the representations from Citizens Advice Bromley and Deton Solicitors and “Enquiries made with the Council’s allocations team as to what temporary accommodation units were available on 19 December 2017”. She also referred to a telephone conversation which she had had with Miss Broderick.

Although it is accepted that Gravesham is nearer to the Bromley Borough, this property was offered to the local authority at a rent level which could not have been covered in its entirety by your Housing Benefit award. As such over a 12 month period the local authority would have been required to pay an additional £7,500 from its General Fund to the accommodation provider. This, as you will appreciate, would have been both an unnecessary and inappropriate use of public funds. </p>

Indeed it is my view that as of 19 December 2017 there was simply no other accommodation available to the Council which could have been offered to you. It is of note that the Council’s policy for the allocation of temporary accommodation states clearly that where there is no availability either in the Borough or close to it, households will be offered accommodation further away from Bromley. In the circumstances I am satisfied that the authority complied with the terms of this policy when it offered you 186a Richmond Road.” </p>

In an ideal world the local authority would have been in a position to offer you accommodation within or nearer to its own Borough, regrettably this was not possible. In the end though the local authority was required to offer you suitable accommodation and not that which was ideal. It is my opinion that there is nothing about your circumstances, taking into account the provisions of the Equality Act 2010, to lead me to a conclusion that you should have been prioritised above other households for accommodation within the Borough. Having considered your case carefully I can see no reason why you should not have been treated in line with the authority’s temporary accommodation allocations policy.” </p>

It seems to me that this will necessarily bring into focus as a relevant consideration the issue of whether other suitable accommodation may at the time of the decision be available either within or closer to the authority’s district and whether the existence of such accommodation means that the other accommodation is in those circumstances to be regarded as unsuitable even if, in the absence of other suitable accommodation, it could be said to meet the needs of the applicant and his or her family.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Jon Holbrook, who appeared for the Council, stressed the terms of section 193(5) of the 1996 Act. Section 193(5), he said, allows a housing authority to bring a duty under section 193 to an end if it has made the person in question “an offer of accommodation which the authority are satisfied is suitable for the applicant”, the authority has informed the applicant “of the possible consequence of refusal or acceptance and of the right to request a review of the suitability of the accommodation”, the applicant has nonetheless refused the offer, and the authority has notified the applicant that it regards itself as ceasing to be subject to the section 193 duty. In this case, there was never any doubt that the Council gave Miss Broderick the requisite information, that Miss Broderick refused the offer of 186A Richmond Road or that the Council notified Miss Broderick that it regarded its duty towards her as ended. The only issue for the reviewing officer or the Judge was as to the suitability of 186A Richmond Road, and that fell to be assessed as at the date it was offered to Miss Broderick. The Judge decided against the Council on the basis that it was relevant to consider the availability of other properties between the date of the offer (19 December 2017) and that of the refusal (29 January 2018), but there was no obligation to make (or to consider making) additional offers. It is not the law, Mr Holbrook argued, that an authority can be required to make further offers of accommodation when it relies on section 193(5) to establish that the particular offer it has already made is a staging post that may cause its duty to the applicant to cease. </p>

What the Council ought to have done was put Miss Broderick in the mix for a few days (say, up to five) after offering her 186A Richmond Road. That followed from the duty recognised in <span style="font-style:italic">Nzolameso v Westminster City Council </span>to try to place a household, if not in-district, then at least as close as possible to where they were previously living.

There is, moreover, “a continuing duty on the part of the housing authority to keep the suitability of accommodation under review”, as Patten LJ observed in <span style="font-style:italic">Saleh </span>at paragraph 32. In that regard, the 2018 Code explains in paragraph 17.8: </p>

In <span style="font-style:italic">Saleh</span>, the housing authority accepted that the accommodation in which Mr Saleh and his family were living had become too small after his mother had come to live with them (see paragraph 4). The question in the litigation was whether the alternative accommodation which the authority then provided was suitable. </p>

However, it is possible to conceive of an exceptional case in which accommodation might become unsuitable as a result of change in the availability of alternatives. As I understood him, Mr Holbrook was inclined to accept that, in the doubtless unlikely event of a glut of properties suddenly becoming available within a housing authority’s district, it could be incumbent on the authority to make new offers to persons who were being housed outside the district. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in">LJ, as I have already mentioned, distinguished between “suitability of accommodation” and “impugning an authority’s decision to discharge its full housing duty at a particular time” in <span style="font-style:italic">Alibkhiet v Brent LBC</span>. Lewison LJ went on to say that, were an authority to be aware that a development that would provide affordable housing was approaching completion, that “may well be relevant to the question whether it should discharge its housing duty immediately, or whether it should wait until the development is complete”. I would think, however, that it would be relatively rare for an authority’s decision to make an offer on a particular date rather than to delay to be susceptible to successful challenge, especially where, as was the case in <span style="font-style:italic">Alibkhiet</span>, a “shortage of housing … is the constant backcloth against which all housing decisions are … made”. In a more normal case, it will not be possible to say that the authority has acted outside its discretion. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Turning to the first question (whether the accommodation offered is suitable), that, it seems to me, falls to be answered by reference to the circumstances at a specific point. While the second and third questions may require examination of changes over time, suitability is to be determined as at a particular time. Where an applicant has accepted an offer and asked for a review, the focus will be on the position when the review decision is made, in accordance with <span style="font-style:italic">Mohamed v Hammersmith and Fulham London Borough </span>and the cases following it. That, however, will not be so where an applicant has refused an offer of accommodation and the housing authority has deemed its duty to the applicant to have come to an end in consequence. In such a case, it makes sense to me that suitability should be determined on the basis of the position at the date the offer was made. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Fitzpatrick, as I have said, argued that Miss Broderick should have been put in the mix for a number of days. An offer’s suitability would, on the basis of his submissions, be assessed over a period of, say, four or five days. However, the 1996 Act does not in terms require suitability to be assessed in this way. Moreover, any such approach would be impractical. Suppose, for example, that on Day 1 an authority has four applicants and four properties available to it, but that the properties are all outside its district (as was the position in the present case on 19 December 2017). The authority should not, presumably, finally allocate any of the properties that day in case better properties materialised over the next days. If the pattern repeated itself over the next three days, by Day 4 there would be 16 applicants and 16 properties. If, though, at least four of the later applicants had stronger claims to be close to the district than the first four, it would seem that the authority still should not offer anything to any of the first four, lest that prejudice the applicants with greater needs. If, after all, the authority gave the Day 1 applicants the best of the properties that had become available by Day 4, a more deserving candidate would have cause to complain if the properties appearing in the following days were further from the district and he were therefore offered something worse than the Day 1 applicants had received. A process such as Mr Fitzpatrick advocated could thus be expected both to create problems for authorities and to result in properties standing empty, to the disadvantage of the homeless. While a particular applicant might obtain accommodation in or closer to the district, applicants generally would suffer. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Parliament is unlikely to have intended an interpretation giving rise to such consequences. In <span style="font-style:italic">Osseily v Westminster City Council</span>, Laws LJ referred at paragraph 11 to the “intolerable burden” which the appellant’s argument would impose on local authorities “whose housing stock … is extremely hard pressed to meet demand” when rejecting the contention. In a similar vein, in <span style="font-style:italic">Alibkhiet v Brent LBC </span>Lewison LJ observed at paragraph 38 that a court “must be wary about imposing onerous duties on housing authorities struggling to cope with the number of applications they receive from the homeless, in the context of a severe housing shortage and overstretched financial and staffing resources”. In <span style="font-style:italic">Waltham Forest London Borough Council v Saleh</span>, Patten LJ at paragraph 33 expressed “some sympathy with the argument that the burden on local housing authorities should not be unnecessarily increased”. </p>

The reasons which Mrs Ross gave in the review decision for regarding the accommodation as suitable are compelling. There is no question of Mrs Ross having overlooked the importance of location. To the contrary, she identified 186A Richmond Road’s location as the “substantive matter in contention” and cited the 2006 Code and the 2012 Order. Moreover, she addressed in detail both the accommodation that was available to the Council on the day it made its offer and Miss Broderick’s reasons for wishing to be closer to Bromley. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It is fair to say that the review decision did not address the second of the three questions I identified earlier, viz. whether the Council ought to have made an offer, or otherwise performed its housing duty, on a different date. It did not need to do so, however. Citizens Advice Bromley and Deton Solicitors had taken issue with 186A Richmond Road’s <span style="font-style:italic">suitability</span>. Thus, Citizens Advice Bromley had asked that the Council “give further consideration as to whether the offer of temporary accommodation in Gillingham, Kent was suitable for Ms Broderick and her young son”, and Deton Solicitors had said that Miss Broderick “qualifies for … review of suitability due to the unsuitability of the location of the property offered to her”. No argument was developed to the effect that the Council had not been entitled to decide to make an offer on the day it did so. On top of that, it seems to me that any such argument would have been doomed to fail. In the present case, as in <span style="font-style:italic">Alibkhiet v Brent LBC</span>, “the shortage of housing … is the constant backcloth against which all housing decisions are currently made”, the Council did not need to “wait in the Micawberish hope that ‘something will turn up’” and the Council “discharged its duty by inquiring </p>

Since Judge Lamb QC did not mention these words in his judgment and no respondent’s notice was filed seeking to uphold his decision on the strength of them, they cannot be important to this appeal. In any case, though, I do not think it right to see them as sinister. Not only was Mr Manlow not the housing allocations officer responsible for the offer that was made to Miss Broderick, but Mr Holbrook explained the words as a reflection of a difficult reality in which housing is in short supply and the Council needs to act fast if it is to secure Mears accommodation which might otherwise be snapped up by another authority. </p>
