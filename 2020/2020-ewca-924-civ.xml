As Ground 1, it is submitted that regulation 33 of the EEA Regulations is unlawful in requiring an application for interim relief to be pursued in a different forum from the appeal itself, the EEA Regulations are in violation of the article 31(2) of the Directive.  As Ground 2, it is contended that requiring such an approach – dissociating the appeal from the application for interim relief pending the appeal – infringes the EU principle of equivalence because, in the judicial review proceedings, an appellant has to show that there is a serious issue to be tried on human rights grounds whereas, if the interim application could be made in the appeal, then it would be sufficient to show that there was a serious issue on EU law grounds including grounds under Part VI of the Directive (which concerns restrictions on the rights of entry and residence on grounds of public policy, public security and public health).  Finally, as Ground 3, it is submitted that such an approach also infringes the EU principle of effectiveness, in that (a) the Appellant was a child when he was given the opportunity to make representations on the notice of liability to deportation and there was a failure to ensure that, as a minor, he was properly represented, (b) the scheme did not provide for notification to the Appellant of the right to seek judicial review or the time limit for bringing a claim, and (c) the Appellant is exposed to a greater costs risk.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Ground 1 appears to be new: it was not argued as such before Murray J.  However, before us, Mr Bedford helpfully explained that the importance of the systemic challenge as to correct forum was as a mere building block for his ultimate key argument that the correct approach on any challenge to interim relief pending the determination of the substantive appeal (i.e. under the statutory scheme, certification) was the same as if the interim relief had been sought in the appeal itself.  The substance of that argument had been put before Murray J.  That approach required the consideration of merits of the underlying claim (i.e. in the case of a challenge to certification, the merits of the appeal against the deportation order), even if only the limited consideration as prescribed by Lord Diplock in <span style="text-decoration:underline">American Cyanamid</span> (at page 407).  Lord Diplock made clear that, on an application for interim relief, it was unnecessary for the court to be involved in the respective merits of the parties’ underlying case in any detail because an applicant only has to show that there is a serious issue to be tried and, if there is, the merits are not relevant unless the applicant can show that he is highly likely to succeed.  Merits therefore only matter if they are clear, one way or the other: otherwise, as has been said, it does not matter whether the claimant’s chances of winning the underlying claim are 90% or 20% (<span style="text-decoration:underline">Mothercare</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">Limited v Robson Books Limited</span> [1979] FSR 466 at page 474).   </p>

The appeal was set down for a hearing before Designated FtT Judge McClure on 19 March 2020.  The Appellant did not attend; and it is now apparent that contemporaneous correspondence from Bail for Immigration Detainees (“BID”) who had been assisting the Appellant, which had requested an adjournment because the Appellant had been granted legal aid in relation to the appeal and wished to instruct legal representatives in relation to it, was not before Judge McClure.  In a determination promulgated on 26 March 2020, on the basis that the Appellant did not lodge an appeal until January 2020 (i.e. after his removal), the judge concluded that the appeal was out-of-time and there were no good reasons for extending time.  He accordingly did not accept the appeal.  However, on 10 July 2020, that decision was set aside by Resident FtT Judge Campbell because it had been made without the benefit of the BID correspondence.  The Appellant’s application to bring an out-of-time appeal currently awaits redetermination.

The judge’s approach was therefore wrong in law; and the resulting exercise of his discretion in relation to interim relief consequently unlawful.  It cannot be said that that error is immaterial.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">First, the parties did not entirely agree about the correct approach to the merits of the underlying appeal when considering an application for interim relief.  I have set out Mr Bedford’s submissions above (see paragraph 29).  Mr Blundell submitted that the merits of the underlying appeal could only be indirectly relevant in an application for interim relief pending a judicial review of certification, because the focus in such an application must be on the merits of temporary removal pending the ultimate outcome of the certification decision, rather than permanent removal as a result of deportation; and, in respect of the former, the merits of an appeal against the deportation order can only be obliquely relevant.  However, even on the basis of Mr Bedford’s submissions on this issue, in my view this is not a case in which it would be right for this court now to determine the interim relief application taking into account the merits of the underlying appeal, because that was not envisaged by the Order of 12 May 2020 and, even if we were able properly to conduct such an exercise involving consideration of the merits, that would to an extent usurp not only the certifying function of the Secretary of State granted to her by the EEA Regulations (which she is in the process of (re-)exercising in the Appellant’s case), but also the function of the FtT (if the Upper Tribunal were to extend time) in determining whether there was (e.g.) procedural unfairness as alleged. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Second and in any event, even if Mr Bedford were to expand the basis upon which he sought interim relief, the Appellant is seeking a mandatory order for the Secretary of State to facilitate his return to the UK, having been removed to Portugal prior to the time of the hearing before Murray J in the circumstances I have described.  As discussed in <span style="text-decoration:underline">R (Nixon and Tracey) v Secretary of State for the Home Department</span> [2018] EWCA Civ 3; [2018] HRLR 7 and <span style="text-decoration:underline">R (QR (Pakistan) v Secretary of State for</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">the Home Department</span> [2018] EWCA Civ 1413, such applications for mandatory orders involve consideration of factors and jurisprudence relevant to the exercise of the court’s discretion over and above those relevant to orders simply restraining removal, e.g. the circumstances of the individual abroad.  In this case, it would require evidence (e.g. as to the Appellant’s circumstances in Portugal) and/or submissions not currently before the court.

That is an issue which does not directly arise on the specific facts of this appeal; because the Appellant did not apply to the FtT for interim relief only to be refused, but rather applied to the Administrative Court or such relief and has pressed this court on appeal to grant such relief.  Mr Bedford does not suggest that the Administrative Court does not have jurisdiction to grant interim relief: his complaint is that, under the EEA Regulations, the FtT does not have that jurisdiction.  In this case, the Appellant had his route for interim relief, which he exercised: it is irrelevant for current purposes that the EEA Regulations might have deprived him of a potentially easier route.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I also agree.  I wish to associate myself particularly with what Hickinbottom LJ says at the end of his final paragraph.  The Appellant has now been excluded from the UK for over a year: that is a long time if his appeal against deportation eventually succeeds.  The sooner there is some resolution of whether he can return on an interim basis (as a result either of a decision of the Secretary of State or of a decision of the court) the better.  Of course a final resolution will be achieved once the Appellant’s appeal against his deportation order is determined one way or the other.  We now know that the First-tier Tribunal will be reconsidering his appeal, and I would hope that in view of the history that can be done as soon as possible. </p>
