The First-tier Tribunal (Judge Jonathan Richards) (the FTT) allowed the respondents’ appeals against closure notices which disallowed the deductions. The Upper Tribunal (Mann J and Judge Timothy Herrington) dismissed the appeal of the Revenue and Customs Commissioners (HMRC), who appeal to this court with permission granted by Lewison LJ. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In 2003, the holding company established an employee benefit trust (EBT) which, in the years ended 30 April 2010, 2011 and 2012, granted options to staff employed by the taxpayers. The options entitled the grantees to acquire shares in the holding company from the EBT. There were a significant number of options which were never exercised, and therefore lapsed, either because the vesting conditions were not satisfied or because the options were out of the money at the exercise dates. Whether or not the options were in due course exercised had no impact on the deductions claimed by the taxpayers. </p>

While the trustee normally held some shares in the holding company to satisfy options, it did not always have sufficient shares to do so and it would acquire shares as and when necessary to ensure that it could satisfy options that were exercised. The holding company made payments to the EBT from time to time to enable the trustee to purchase or subscribe for shares in the holding company. </p>

The options were regarded as part of the remuneration of those employees. There was no suggestion of any tax avoidance or tax mitigation scheme. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Before summarising the effect of IFRS 2 in this case, as found by the FTT, it should first be noted (and this is common ground) that the fact of the Recharge is irrelevant to the accounting treatment, particularly as regards the debit in the computation of the taxpayers’ profits. Indeed, the expert evidence was that it would be contrary to IFRS 2 to recognise a debit for the Recharge. As will be seen, IFRS 2 required the taxpayers to recognise a debit unconnected with the Recharge and irrespective of any recharge or other outflow of funds from the taxpayers. There is something counter-intuitive about requiring a debit to profit and loss account even though there is no outflow of funds but prohibiting a debit that does recognise an outflow of funds. This is not the first occasion on which GAAP has produced what may to the non-expert appear surprising results (see, for example, <span style="font-style:italic">The Union Castle Mail Steamship Co Ltd v HMRC </span>[2020] EWCA Civ 547 (<span style="font-style:italic">Union Castle</span>)) but accounting standards are the product of careful expert evaluation and wide consultation and it is not for this court to question whether a standard is appropriate. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The options granted by the EBT to employees of the taxpayers were treated as “equity-settled”. The taxpayers were treated as receiving the services of their employees under a share-based payment transaction and were required to account for the services received. As the services of the employees were regarded as consumed immediately on receipt, IFRS 2 required the taxpayers to recognise an expense reflecting the consumption of the services. Given the practical difficulty in measuring directly the fair value of the employee services received, IFRS 2 required the fair value of the equity instruments granted for those services to be used as a surrogate for the fair value of the services. As the FTT noted in its Decision at [26], “any grant of share options by the EBT Trustee to employees triggered an obligation on the [taxpayers] to recognise an expense in their income statements equal to the fair value of the options that the EBT Trustee had granted…whether or not the [taxpayers] had to pay any amount to any other person (such as [the holding company] or the EBT Trustee) in relation to the grant of these options”. There was a process for allocating the debits to different accounting periods which, it was common ground, the taxpayers had correctly followed.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The debits required by IFRS 2 had to be matched by corresponding entries in the taxpayers’ balance sheets. IFRS 2, addressing the situation where a parent company issues share options to employees of a subsidiary, required the subsidiary to recognise a capital contribution received from the parent as a credit on its balance sheet. As the FTT remarked at [33], this treatment “might be thought to sit oddly” with a recharge arrangement; if the subsidiary “was compensating the parent for the grant of the options with a cash payment, it might be thought that the parent should not be regarded as making a capital contribution at all”. However, the effect of IFRS 2 was clear.</p>

IFRS 2 made no provision for this, so the treatment had to be determined in accordance with general principles. There were a number of possible treatments, but no professional consensus on which was to be preferred. The taxpayers adopted a policy of treating the Recharge as reducing the capital contribution. The result was that in their year-end accounts, the income statement recorded the debit required by IFRS 2 but no capital contribution appeared in the balance sheet because, as at the balance sheet date, it was treated as having been repaid by the Recharge. The FTT found that this was a proper accounting treatment.       </p>

It was of no consequence that the expense recognised by the application of IFRS 2 did not reflect any money actually spent by the taxpayers.

The UT rejected HMRC’s submissions and held that the word “incurred” could not bear the weight that HMRC sought to place on it. It did not impose an additional requirement on what was an “expense” for the purposes of sections 46 and 48. By requiring expenses to be incurred wholly and exclusively for the purposes of the taxpayer’s trade, section 54(1)(a) ensured that expenses which had a dual purpose were not deductible.

The effect of section 46 was that it was a necessary, but not a sufficient, condition that a debit should be made in accordance with GAAP. Trading profits are thus measured initially by accounting receipts and expenses. An expense is not deductible if it is not reflected in an accounting debit. But, when read with section 54, it was also necessary that the debit should reflect an incurred expense, i.e. an actual or (as in the case of a provision) a prospective outgoing. Section 54 operated as an “adjustment required…by law in calculating profits for corporation tax purposes” (section 46(1)). </p>

The provision was properly shown in its profit and loss account in accordance with normal principles of commercial accountancy, even though no payment had been made nor had any liability been incurred. The Revenue’s argument, that the provision was not deductible because it was not a sum “actually expended” for the repair of premises within section 74(1)(d) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988, was rejected.

It concerned an issue of shares at par to employees at a time when their market value stood at a considerable premium to par. The company sought to treat the amount of the premium as a deductible expense in the calculation of its profits for tax purposes, as if it had expended that amount in the remuneration of its employees. The question, Viscount Caldecote LC said, was whether the company could be said “to have incurred a trading expense to the amount of the premium” (p.278). He concluded at p.282 that “the cost to the Company of earning its trading receipts was not increased by the issue of these shares at less than their full market value”. Viscount Maugham agreed in the result but on the ground that an issue of shares was not a trading transaction, giving rise to either trading profits or losses. Lord Russell of Killowen based his decision on both grounds: see pp. 292 and 295. The other two members of the House dissented. </p>

Similar language was used in successive legislation up to section 74(1)(a) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988, which was replaced by section 54(1)(a) of the 2009 Act as part of the Tax Re-write. Reference to earlier authority, such as <span style="font-style:italic">Lowry</span>, may be made only where there is ambiguity in the replacement provision.

The UT rejected the premise on which the taxpayers’ submissions rested, that they were contractually bound to pay 100% of the production costs of the films. It was liable for and paid 30, but it was neither liable for nor in fact paid more than 30. The only “real expenditure…incurred by the LLPs” was 30. The authorities relied on related to capital allowances.

They nonetheless considered that the emphasis in <span style="font-style:italic">Tower MCashback LLP v HMRC </span>[2011] UKSC 19, [2011] 2 AC 457, on whether there was “real” expenditure was highly relevant. </p>

The debits recorded the effects of the grant of the options which formed part of the remuneration package of the employees. The purpose of the transaction, as found by the FTT, was to reward the employees, and thereby enable the taxpayers to make a profit, and the FTT was therefore fully entitled to find, as it did, that the options were granted wholly and exclusively for the purposes of the taxpayers’ trades. Moreover, this was one of those obvious cases recognised by Lord Brightman in <span style="font-style:italic">Mallalieu v Drummond</span> [1983] 2 AC 861 which speaks for itself, in the absence of any other purpose not related to the taxpayers’ trades.  </p>

As the FTT found, the debits in this case were required by IFRS 2 to reflect the consumption by the taxpayers of the services provided by the employees, who were in part remunerated by the grant of the options. The taxpayers consumed those services wholly and exclusively for the purposes of their trades, being the provision of their employees’ services to other group companies at a profit.

They submitted, as they did to the FTT, that section 1290 applied in the present case, for two reasons. First, the grant of the options was an act under which property became subject to an arrangement, set out in the terms of the options, which was for the benefit of employees. The property comprised the shares in the holding company or the contractual rights granted under the options. Second, the share incentive schemes were “employee benefit schemes” as defined by section 1291(2). Until the options were exercised, the options (or the contractual rights under them or the shares to which they related) were property which was held, or which might be used, under an employee benefit scheme. They were part of an arrangement for the benefit of persons who included employees. For either reason, the grant of an option was an “employee benefit contribution” in respect of which deduction was deferred by section 1290.  </p>

Observing that section 1291 did not define an “employee benefit contribution” as such, the FTT judge again correctly noted that the contribution is the “act or omission” that leads to the results specified in section 1291(1). On that basis, the question was whether, as a result of the grant of the options, either limb of section 1291(1) was satisfied.</p>

That is emphasised by the fact that s.1290(2) permits a deduction to be given where qualifying benefits are provided “out of” employee benefit contributions (suggesting that an employee benefit contribution is something other than an outright transfer to employees). It is also emphasised by the fact that the definition of “employee benefit arrangement” envisages that there is some sort of intermediary arrangement standing between the provision of property by the employer and the receipt of benefits by the employee.” </p>

If and to the extent that options were exercised, the Trustee would use shares, which it already held or which it acquired specifically for the purpose, to fulfil its obligations to the option-holders. Those shares were property which “may be used” under the EBT, which was an employee benefit scheme. The shares to be delivered on exercise of the options were as much a benefit as the options themselves.  Accordingly, the grant of options by the Trustee were “employee benefit contributions” within sections 1290-1291, with the result that no deduction was allowable in respect of the relevant debits in the taxpayers’ profit and loss accounts. </p>

It was the option that entitled the employee to acquire shares at a price that might be less than their market value.
