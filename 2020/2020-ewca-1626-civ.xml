	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The judge refused sanction for two main reasons. First, despite the fact that PAC and Rothesay had equivalent Solvency Capital Requirement (“SCR”) metrics, Rothesay did not have the same capital management policies or the backing of a large wellresourced group with a reputational imperative to support it over the lifetime of the annuity policies. Secondly, it had been reasonable, in the light of PAC’s sales materials, age and reputation, for policyholders to have chosen PAC on the basis of an assumption that it would not seek to transfer their policies to a third party provider.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly, PAC and Rothesay submitted that the judge accorded too much weight to the objecting policyholders’ contentions that (a) they chose PAC on the basis of its age and established reputation, (b) they had reasonably assumed that their annuity would be provided throughout its term by the same provider, and (c) there were distinguishing features of an annuity.  </p>

They submitted that the SCR metrics employed by the Prudential Regulation Authority (the “PRA”) were entirely based upon analyses of the current year and made no attempt to predict what risks the future might hold. The judge had been justified in taking his own view of those risks. The individual policyholders who made submissions explained how they had chosen PAC for its age and reputation. They made powerful submissions about how those features allowed them peace of mind. They said that they did not want to be the subject of repeated Part VII transfers in the future. </p>

Despite that fact, as we have said, there has never before been a substantive appeal of a sanction decision to this court. Moreover, it is rare for such applications to be refused. For that reason, we have paid special attention to the arguments in this case, and have tried to explain in this judgment how the jurisdiction should generally be exercised.  </p>

These contracts provide for regular payments of fixed sums, in some cases increasing in line with objective criteria such as indices that measure inflation, over the lives of the annuitants and others. For convenience, we refer to the contracts as policies and to the annuitants as policyholders. The Scheme was designed to reduce PAC’s regulatory capital requirements in connection with a planned demerger (the “Demerger”) of the Prudential group. The Demerger was announced on 14 March 2018 and was to separate the Prudential group’s business into two segments: the UK and Europe on the one hand; and Asia, the US and Africa on the other. M&amp;G Prudential would separate from the Prudential group and focus on the UK and European market. Prudential plc was to focus on the Asian, US and African market. The need for PAC to reduce its regulatory capital requirements arose from the transfer of two Hong Kong subsidiaries from PAC to a Prudential plc subsidiary.

However, the contractual obligations under the policies remained with PAC.

It should be appreciated, however, that what might appear a material difference in SCR coverage ratio may not equate to a material difference in the likelihood of remaining solvent for a year. So, for example, Mr. Dumbreck calculated that in the case of Rothesay, an SCR coverage ratio of 100% equates to a likelihood of its assets being sufficient to cover its Technical Provisions in one year’s time of 99.5%; an SCR coverage ratio of 130% would equate to a likelihood of its assets being sufficient to cover its Technical Provisions in one year’s time of 99.96%; and an SCR coverage ratio of 150% would equate to a likelihood of its assets being sufficient to cover its Technical Provisions in one year’s time of 99.994%. So a reduction in SCR coverage ratio from 150% to 130% would only mean that the risk of insolvency after one year has increased by 0.034%. </p>

At least in theory, an insurer could seek to distribute any such surplus or excess. It is, however, common for insurers to commit extra capital to be held in addition to the SCR. This additional level of capital is intended to provide a company with comfort that even if a moderately severe event occurred, it would still have sufficient capital to cover its SCR in full. The amount of such additional capital is determined by the insurer’s capital management policy which is reviewed by the PRA. </p>

In addition, PAC would no longer be a subsidiary of Prudential plc after the planned Demerger and would no longer benefit from its parental support. By contrast, Rothesay’s parent was unlisted and lacked comparable financial resources. Mr Dumbreck cited the corrective actions in Rothesay’s capital management policy and the possibility of Rothesay’s parent raising capital from shareholders and the debt markets in support of his conclusion that both companies’ capital management policies provided “a very high level of security for policyholders”. Critically, he also concluded that “scenarios which could lead to the entire own funds of either company being dissipated are so extreme that any comparison of probabilities is subject to a very high degree of uncertainty”. </p>

There can be no single test nor a single list of factors that can be applied in all cases. This may be contrasted with the court’s discretion to sanction a scheme of arrangement under Part 26 of the Companies Act 2006, where agreement to the scheme must first be obtained from meetings of the members or creditors concerned. Irrespective of the circumstances of the case or whether the scheme is proposed with members or creditors, the requirement for class meetings enables the court, having satisfied itself that the class was fairly represented by those at the meeting and that the majority was acting in good faith and not to promote interests adverse to those of the class,  to apply the single test of whether the scheme is one that an honest and intelligent person, a member of the class concerned and acting in respect of their interest, might reasonably approve: see <span style="font-style:italic">Re Telewest Communications plc (No 2) </span>[2004] EWHC 1466 (Ch), [2005] 1 BCLC 722 at [20]-[22].   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">There has been a plethora of first instance decisions approving insurance business transfer schemes under Part VII. When considering those decisions, it is important to understand the nature of the business with which the court was concerned. There is an infinite variation in the books of business held by insurance companies. The type of business varies over time as economic trends change. It is undesirable for us to try to produce a definitive categorisation. In broad terms, however, there are two important distinctions. The first is between general insurance business (e.g. motor and household insurance) and long-term business (e.g. life assurance and annuities). The second is between policies that vest a discretion in the insurer, most obviously in those having a with-profits element, and those that do not. A book of annuities such as that sought to be transferred in this case, of course, has no such discretionary element. It is simply a long-term debt owed to each policyholder, payable on a regular basis during their life (or lives). </p>

In the case of the transfer of with-profits business, for example, the interests of the insurers and their shareholders have to be balanced against those of the policyholders, and the interests of different classes of with-profits policyholders may need to be balanced against each other. In the case of a book of in-payment annuities, on the other hand, the interests that require consideration are, at least primarily, those of the creditor policyholders. Moreover, the factors to be considered in transferring general business are different again. </p>

It was a merger of the two societies and, because London Life was a mutual society, the transfer engaged the with-profits policyholders’ interests as members as well as their interests as policyholders.

The Assurance Companies Act 1909 then added a requirement that the material to be made available to the policyholders and the court should include the report of an independent actuary. Matters then remained unchanged until sections 49 and 50 of the Insurance Companies Amendment Act 1973 abrogated the veto that one-tenth of the transferring policyholders could previously exercise, and introduced a provision as to the persons who could be heard. Those persons, including employees of transferor or transferee, were those who alleged that they “would be adversely affected by the carrying out of the scheme”. Hoffmann J noted that the third change effected in 1973 was to remove the express condition requiring the court to be satisfied that “no sufficient objection” has been established, and to introduce what was “expressed as a completely unfettered discretion”. He doubted whether the change made any difference “except to make it clear that even in the absence of objection the court is not obliged to sanction a scheme”. </p>

The court was, he said, first concerned with whether a policyholder, employee or other person would be adversely affected by the scheme in the sense that it appeared likely to leave him worse off. It did not, however, follow that any scheme which did so had to be rejected. The question was whether the scheme as a whole was “fair as between the interests of the different classes of persons affected”. The court did not have to be satisfied that no better scheme could have been devised. The choice as between different schemes and the details of them were matters for the board and for negotiation between transferor and transferee. The court could either confirm or reject the scheme proposed. Finally, Hoffmann J said that the question of whether policyholders would be adversely affected by the scheme was largely actuarial and involved “a comparison of their security and reasonable expectations without the scheme with what [they] would be if the scheme were implemented”. Whilst he did not say these were the only considerations, they were obviously very important. </p>

Under the scheme, eligible policyholders were entitled to elect to receive cash payments or additional bonuses on their policies (incentive payments) and thereby waive their rights to receive distributions from the inherited estate.  Evans-Lombe J described the primary question at [7] as being whether the scheme was unfair because Axa’s offer to policyholders of the incentive payments did not represent a reasonable price to compensate them for their interest in receiving distributions in the future.

He said that the approach indicated by <span style="font-style:italic">Axa</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Royal Sun Alliance</span> meant that, in the overwhelming majority of cases, “the court’s inquiry would focus on the questions of whether policyholders’ security of benefits and reasonable expectations of service standards would be adversely affected by the proposed scheme”, and that the court would “regard the first of those issues as “primarily” a matter of actuarial judgment, and in that respect [would] give close attention to the views of the independent expert and the regulators”. At [115], however, the judge said that it was clear that this was not the full extent of the factors that the court might take into account in the exercise of its discretion under section 111(3). The question for the court was whether it was appropriate to sanction the scheme, and the court was required to take into account all the circumstances of the case. <span style="font-style:italic">London Life</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Axa </span>acknowledged that this conferred a very broad discretion.

An annuity policy was often purchased on retirement with a large single premium payment derived from a person’s pension scheme.

These considerations were apparent throughout the representations that the judge received from opposing policyholders.

Mr Stoker had also drawn attention to the fact that, of the current investors in Rothesay’s parent company, Blackstone held its investment in its long-term strategic opportunities fund; MassMutual was a substantial US life insurance company of comparable age to PAC, and GIC included “long-term investing” as one of its investment principles on its website. Whilst the judge did not doubt that Mr Stoker’s views were genuinely held, he regarded them as “still essentially supposition as to the possible future actions of Rothesay and those institutions who are currently interested in it”.  His view was that “the opposing policyholders were justified in their submission that such matters do not provide equivalent comfort to the existing availability of capital in the Prudential group and the commercial imperative that would motivate the other Prudential group companies to stand behind PAC”. Blackstone, GIC and MassMutual were not “integrated with, or inherently tied to the business of Rothesay in the same way as the business operations, name and reputation of other parts of the Prudential group are tied to the business of PAC”.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="13">

	      </authorialNote> Questions of the relative lack of availability of parental support for Rothesay were, therefore, material. Even though (a) the current SCR and SCR coverage ratios of both companies meant that there was a very high degree of confidence (in excess of 99.5%) that neither company would fail to maintain capital assets at least equal to its Technical Provisions in the next year, and (b) the judge had no reason to doubt the PRA’s statement that there was nothing to suggest any imminent deterioration in Rothesay’s current balance sheet, he did not think that there could be anything like the same level of confidence that a material deterioration of the balance sheets of either company might not occur at some time over the decades during which the annuities would require payment. It was necessary to have regard to the fact that, if the remote risk of insolvency were to eventuate, the result for policyholders would be catastrophic. The likelihood of support being available for PAC, and the relative uncertainty of whether it would be available for Rothesay, could not be dismissed as an immaterial factor. The judge did not agree with Mr Dumbreck that a comparison could be made between the comfort to be obtained from the current capital resources, regulatory capital requirements and capital management policies of the two companies on the one hand, and the potential for parental support on the other. The two were not alternatives: the availability of parental support was capable of providing additional comfort in the event that the comfort to be derived from the current financial strength of the two companies proved misplaced. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The judge concluded on his fourth reason at [154]-[155] by saying that he did not consider that he could disregard as fanciful the possibility that PAC or Rothesay might require external financial support over the lifetime of the annuitants in this case. There was a material difference in the potential availability of assistance for the two companies: “if the need arose, PAC would be likely to be supported from the very substantial resources of the Prudential group; but no equivalent measure of comfort is available in relation to Rothesay”. That conclusion was unaffected by the possibility of the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (“FSCS”) paying full compensation. The relevant question was whether the Scheme made a material change in the security of benefits for policyholders as a result of the change from PAC to Rothesay. If FSCS compensation were relevant, it would apply in all annuity cases, and it would mean that there would be no purpose in any detailed analysis of the respective financial strengths of the transferor and transferee companies. That was not, the judge noted, an approach which had been adopted in any previous case.  </p>

Where consumers had made a choice of annuity provider based on such factors, that was something that the court could take into account. No-one could ever guarantee that a financial institution could not fail. The fact that the PRA or an actuary could not quantify a firm’s venerability or reputation in capital terms did not mean that those matters had to be disregarded by the court. The judge said at [160] that the court’s role under section 111(3) was not simply intended to replicate the Regulators’ risk-based approach or the independent expert’s actuarial approach. Consumers were not generally given access to the detailed financial information and Solvency II metrics. Instead, they were expected to select an insurer based upon other factors. The purchaser of an annuity policy who decided to place reliance on the longevity and established reputation of an insurer could not be said to be acting irrationally or unreasonably. The court was entitled to have some regard to the reasons for their choice. At [164], the judge noted that the facts of this case were distinguishable from those which Warren J considered in <a href="http://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IA67911405BE511E7B2B0F2DEC64A0EEF/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&amp;transitionType=DocumentItem&amp;vr=3.0&amp;rs=PLUK1.0&amp;contextData=(sc.Search)">

The judge said at [170] that he could take that into account in striking the balance between the interests of policyholders and commercial parties. The judge did not consider that the other prejudices relied upon were of major significance. A continuing regulatory capital requirement of £100 million represented a very small proportion of PAC’s capital benefits from the Reinsurance Agreement.  Rothesay entered into the Reinsurance Agreement knowing that the Scheme was subject to the sanction of the court: “[t]here is a distinct air of bootstraps in Rothesay suggesting that it would be prejudiced if the Scheme was not sanctioned, by being deprived of the opportunities which it would have for saving administration costs, managing risks, or for using different or more innovative investment techniques for the assets that back the transferring annuities, which it would be able to do if the Scheme was sanctioned”. </p>

But it was not determinative. The court could take into account a wider set of factors in striking a balance between the interests of policyholders and commercial parties. The 6 factors weighed heavily against the exercise of the court’s discretion to sanction this Scheme. In terms of the criteria that the opposing policyholders relied upon to select their annuity provider, Rothesay was very different from PAC. It was a relatively new entrant without an established reputation in the business. In the event of insolvency during the long life of the policies, the reliance which policyholders would have to place upon an uncertain capital-raising exercise from the investors in Rothesay or the markets more generally was a material disadvantage of the Scheme to Transferring Policyholders. </p>

An adverse effect will only be material to the court’s consideration if it is: (i) a possibility that cannot sensibly be ignored having regard to the nature and gravity of the feared harm in the particular case, (ii) a consequence of the scheme, and (iii) material in the sense that there is the prospect of real or significant, as opposed to fanciful or insignificant, risk to the position of the stakeholder concerned.

None of the expert, the PRA or the court can assume that any non-contractual parental support will be available in the future, let alone long into the future. Any insurer, who complies with the requirements of Solvency II, is at liberty to dispose of its excess own funds above its Technical Provisions and SCR at any time. Parents can never be required to support their subsidiaries’ capital whether for reputational reasons or on any other basis. Moreover, parents of insurers are always at liberty to sell their regulated subsidiaries to others with lesser resources. Indeed, the Demerger which was in contemplation at the time of the hearing before the judge, and has since been implemented, involved PAC ceasing to be a subsidiary of Prudential plc and becoming part of a smaller group.

It was not a relevant factor once the Solvency II metrics were satisfied. Insurers can be sold, as we have said, and can reduce their surplus own funds at any stage. That is why the evaluation of an insurer’s Solvency II metrics, taken together with the prospect of its continuing regulation, is both necessary and normally sufficient to measure its resilience to future events.  </p>

The relevant issue was the appellants’ financial resilience throughout the life of the annuities. That latter question could not be answered by speculation as to what future parents might offer by way of non-contractual financial support, but only by looking at the companies’ compliance with the current and future regulatory regime. </p>

As regards security of policyholders’ benefits, however, those factors must go to the question of whether the Scheme will have a material adverse effect on those policyholders. Such matters may certainly include matters which fall outside the PRA’s assessment of the proposed scheme, but do not include speculation as to what future owners of an insurer may or may not wish non-contractually to do in the future to support their regulated subsidiary. </p>

The judge should not have tempered his reliance on that opinion with his own speculation that Rothesay might require external financial support during the life of the annuities (as he did at [149], [154] and [181]). It is true, of course, that Rothesay, like any insurer, might at some stage during the life of annuities suffer a material deterioration in its balance sheet and require external financial support. But the whole thrust of the Solvency II regime is to evaluate those risks going forward and to ensure that steps are taken to mitigate them as and when they arise. The judge’s speculation about what additional parental funds might or might not be available in the future added nothing to the analysis undertaken by the PRA and the independent expert.  </p>

This was not a ground of appeal, so the court is not strictly obliged to deal with the point. Nonetheless, we cannot see how the FSCS could have been relevant to what the judge had to decide in this case. The FSCS is a scheme of last resort, and is applicable equally to the holders of Transferring Policies before and after the transfer. As the judge suggested, if the existence of 100% protection for policyholders were a crucial factor, it would be hard to see why the expert needed to undertake a detailed analysis of the respective financial strengths of the transferor and transferee companies.  </p>

The judge’s approach placed an insuperable obstacle in the way of any transfer of annuities under Part VII. Finally, the appellants submitted that the judge had been wrong to place so much weight on the nature of the annuity business.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">It is once again important to have regard to the context in which Hoffmann J and Evans-Lombe J referred to the commercial judgment of the directors. In <span style="font-style:italic">London Life</span>, the entire business of London Life was to be transferred to an Australian mutual society, with the transferring with-profits policyholders necessarily losing their membership of London Life. It was not to any significant extent simply a transfer of actual or contingent liabilities of the sort typically found in ordinary policies of general insurance or life assurance or in annuities. The terms of transfer were a matter for detailed negotiation between the boards of the two societies, with each advancing the interests of their own with-profits policyholders, who were also the members of each society. There were no doubt many possible outcomes to those negotiations and it was the duty of London Life’s board to agree what they considered to be the best and fairest terms obtainable in the circumstances. Fairness was a vital element because the interests of different groups of London Life policyholders had to be balanced against each other. It is for these reasons that Hoffmann J said, correctly in the circumstances of that case, that the question was whether the scheme as a whole was “fair as between the interests of the different classes of persons affected” and that the choice as between different schemes and the detail of them were matters for the board and for negotiation between transferor and transferee. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In <span style="font-style:italic">Axa</span>, there was a different balance of interests to be struck. Longstanding withprofits funds had in many cases accumulated large “inherited estates”, representing surpluses in the fund not required for the expected level of reversionary and terminal bonuses. These estates were often referred to as 90/10 funds, because <span style="font-style:italic">if </span>a distribution were made from it, policyholders’ reasonable expectations would usually require that 90% was apportioned to policyholders and 10% to the insurer’s shareholder funds. The assets representing the with-profits fund, including the inherited estate, were beneficially the property of the insurer, not the with-profits policyholders. The entitlement of policyholders to 90% of any distribution was dependent on the insurer’s decision to make a distribution. The scope for a continued inexorable increase in the inherited estate, with only limited use being made of it, was obvious. The scheme proposed by Axa, and sanctioned by the court, was designed to reduce the inherited estate, which stood at £1.68 billion, in a mutually beneficial way. The issue for the court was whether the incentive payments proposed for electing policyholders represented a fair price for the contingent rights that they would give up. Axa’s proposal was the subject of intense scrutiny and discussion between Axa and the regulators and the independent actuary (as he was then known). The commercial judgment of the board of Axa was that the deal was fair, but that was, in truth, of limited value since their duty was to act in the best interests of Axa. It is to be noted that, although Evans-Lombe J referred in [6(i)] to the board’s commercial judgment as one of the factors to emerge from Hoffmann J’s judgment, he did not rely on it, or even again refer to it, in his reasons for sanctioning the scheme.    </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The court is entitled to assume that, in proposing a scheme, the directors of the transferor and transferee companies are acting in accordance with their statutory and other duties. If it became apparent that they were not doing so, it is very difficult to see that the court could contemplate sanctioning the scheme. In most circumstances, the commercial judgment of the directors has little, if any, further role to play. The facts of <span style="font-style:italic">London Life </span>illustrate a case where it did have a substantial role, but such cases have been comparatively rare and we see no real part for their commercial judgment in the court’s consideration of whether to sanction a scheme such as the present. </p>

The same applies had the judge been right to say that relevant factors included (a) the policyholders’ choice of PAC on the basis of its age, venerability and established reputation, and (b) the policyholders’ reasonable assumption that PAC would always provide their annuities. As we have held, however, the judge was not right on these two points. We do not think, however, that he made any error of law in his approach to the commercial judgment of the PAC’s board. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Again, we can deal with this issue briefly. In our judgment, the judge was, quite correctly, looking for a material adverse effect on the policyholders’ security of benefits. Had he been right that the two main factors he identified did provide such a material adverse effect, we do not consider that in the circumstances of the present case any prejudice to the commercial interests of PAC or Rothesay would have been in point. Those commercial interests were unrelated to the interests of the transferring policyholders and, if the scheme had involved a material adverse effect to policyholders, we are unable to see why their interests should give way to the commercial interests of the companies and their shareholders. Since the Scheme was promulgated by the commercial parties knowing that it needed the sanction of the court, it does not seem to us that the kind of prejudice they pointed to would carry great weight if there had been shown to be a material adverse effect on policyholders. </p>

He ought not to have concluded that there was a material disparity between the non-contractual external support potentially available for each of PAC and Rothesay. In any event, such a disparity was not a material factor. Moreover, he failed to accord adequate weight to the expert’s conclusion that the risk of PAC or Rothesay needing external support in the future was remote, to the Regulators’ lack of objection to the Scheme, and to the continuing future regulation of Rothesay. Finally, he ought not to have accorded any weight to the fact that the objecting policyholders chose PAC on the basis of its age, venerability and established reputation, and reasonably assumed that PAC would always provide their annuities. </p>
