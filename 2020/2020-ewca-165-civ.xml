	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">This judgment concerns an application by the appellant for a protective costs order (“PCO”) in an appeal against part of the decision of Mrs Justice Lambert DBE of 2 August 2018 on the trial of a personal injury claim by the appellant against the respondent. The appeal turns on a narrow but difficult issue, namely the decision by the Judge to make no award in respect of the additional capital cost which she found to be required by the appellant so as to fund the special accommodation costs arising from her disability. The reason for that decision of the Judge was that she considered she was bound by the approach set down in <span style="font-style:italic">Roberts v Johnstone </span>[1989] QB 878. The underlying cause of that outcome was the then current negative discount rate. The appeal proceeds on this issue with the permission of the Judge herself.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The appellant sustained serious injuries in the collision.

She was a very active and sports-oriented individual and has made sustained efforts at rehabilitation. She has had continuing difficulties which it is not necessary to set out in detail, but they include severe continuing “phantom pain” in the amputated foot and continuing complications from the disruption of the structure of the right foot. </p>

She concluded, however, that she was bound by the approach approved in <span style="font-style:italic">Roberts v Johnstone</span> and so, by the application of that approach in light of the then negative discount rate of -0.75%, she felt compelled to decline to make any award in respect of the additional capital cost which she found would arise. </p>

She was “prepared to limit her claim to a figure which is lower than an unadjusted interest-rate-based lump sum award”. The appellant did apply, however, to introduce evidence of a particular mortgage package backed by a periodical payment order (“PPO”), so as to assist consideration of that alternative submission. The evidence was said to be helpful since it might assist this court in considering whether a PPO-based award was appropriate as an alternative to the <span style="font-style:italic">Roberts v Johnstone</span> approach.   </p>

The likely response of a trial judge was to decline to admit such evidence, because the court below was bound to follow <span style="font-style:italic">Roberts v Johnstone</span>, and the evidence was unnecessary for that purpose.  For this reason, he said, it was highly problematic to introduce below the proper evidential platform, so that other approaches to the problem could be considered on appeal. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The respondent opposed the admission of further evidence.  The preamble to the respondent’s opposition included the following factual points. The appellant had confirmed by way of communications between the parties that the first attempt to obtain any such evidence began only after the trial in the court below in August 2018, although the relevant attendance note disclosed indicates that earlier attempts had been made to obtain such evidence from a different financial institution. The respondent further noted that the only step taken by the appellant prior to trial in this regard was to obtain evidence as to mortgage products and rates by means of a basic internet search, the results of which were not disclosed or sought to be introduced at trial. The appellant therefore took no steps to obtain evidence as to the availability of a PPO-mortgage-backed product prior to trial. </p>

The effect of QOCS is that no order for costs made against the appellant may be enforced, without the permission of the court, to the extent that the costs payable under such an order exceed the amount of damages and interest awarded in her favour. The appellant does not consider that limitation on the recoverability of the respondent’s costs gives her fair and adequate protection in all the circumstances because, she says, without a PCO an adverse order for costs on the appeal would exceed the additional amount of £900,000 which she requires for a suitably adapted house to meet her needs as a result of the accident caused by the respondent’s negligence. It would also diminish her damages award to a significant extent and will, she says, leave some of her needs unmet.</p>

He pointed out that, had the appeal proceeded on 23 July 2019, the appellant’s risk exposure would have been in the region of £209,000 in respect of the respondent’s costs together with her own minimal disbursements. If a PCO is granted retrospective to 24 July 2019, as the appellant seeks in her application, her risk exposure would be £345,000, being the aggregate of the respondent’s estimated costs until 23 July 2019 and the appellant’s own disbursements. Mr Arney said that even that amount would exceed the totality of the appellant’s life savings but she is prepared to accept that risk. On the basis of the available evidence, Mr Arney said that, if the PCO was to run from 26 November 2019, the date of the application notice, the appellant’s costs exposure would be £580,000; and if the PCO were to run only from the date of the hearing of the application, 6 February 2020, her costs exposure would be £710,000. He said that, if the application was refused, the appellant’s costs exposure would be £944,000. Mr Arney emphasised the appellant’s horror at the size of those figures. That is a reaction with which we have considerable sympathy. </p>

She applied for a PCO that BA be not permitted to recover its costs of the appeal from her. Sedley LJ dismissed that application on the papers but, upon a revised application, made a second order that the amount for which the claimant should be at risk in respect of BA’s costs be limited to £20,000. BA challenged that order before the full court (Maurice Kay, Lloyd and Moses LJJ). The court held that it could not make a PCO. It held that Sedley LJ’s second order be discharged and no order ought to be made in its place limiting the claimant’s contingent liability for BA’s costs, if the claimant failed in her appeal. </p>

Firstly, contrary to the impression in some of the observations made in the skeleton arguments on behalf of the appellant that the court was instrumental in bringing about the adjournment in 2019, the adjournment was made on the application of the appellant as a result of the appellant’s own conclusion that she did not have sufficient and appropriate expert evidence for her appeal. As Nicola Davies LJ observed during the hearing, the trial judge had herself made an observation about the lack of such evidence. The resulting costs of the adjournment, and of the delay in the hearing of the appeal, obtaining further evidence and the extended time estimate for the hearing of the appeal were all consequences of that tactical decision by the appellant herself, from which she now seeks to protect herself by the present application. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly, there was a significant delay in the application for the PCO. The possibility of such an application for a PCO was mentioned on 24 July 2019, at the directions hearing following the decision on the previous day to adjourn the hearing of the appeal, but the application for a PCO was not in fact made until late November 2019. During that time the respondent incurred very substantial costs, from which the appellant now seeks to protect herself. If a party wishes to have the protection of a PCO, the application must be made as soon as possible as its existence will be highly likely to have a material effect on decisions by the other party as to the incurring of costs and the making of offers of settlement. Mr Arney sought to explain and excuse the delay in the present case on the ground that the appellant failed to appreciate the likely size of the additional costs consequential on the adjournment and the obtaining of expert evidence. We cannot accept that as a justifiable reason for the delay, not least because the appellant has had the benefit of solicitors who are highly experienced in this area of litigation. Even if the very large sums now said to have been incurred were not predicted, considerable cost would have been anticipated. </p>

Like any other policy or practice, they may be subject to adjustment in the light of circumstances that did not exist or were not anticipated at the time they were set. In the present case, Mr Arney was not able to draw our attention to any features of the present proceedings and the present application for a PCO that might distinguish them from the situations under consideration by the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Eweida</span>. He sought to distinguish those cases by emphasising that there has never been a decision on an application for a PCO in which the court has held that, but for the strict application of the <span style="font-style:italic">Corner House</span> conditions, it would have granted a PCO. That, however, is not a reason for departing from the policy and practice clearly set down in <span style="font-style:italic">Eweida</span>. In reality, the substance of the appellant’s argument is that the Court of Appeal was simply wrong in<span style="font-style:italic"> Eweida</span> to hold that the court should not make a PCO in private litigation, or, to the same effect, in litigation in which the applicant for the PCO has a material private interest.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The appellant does not rely on that provision. It was apparently intended to address the type of situation in <span style="font-style:italic">Eweida </span>where a person appeals from a “no costs” jurisdiction, so as to preserve, in an appropriate case, the same costs policy on appeal. To that extent, therefore, the Civil Procedure Rule Committee, no doubt prompted by encouragement in some of the cases to review the inflexibility of the <span style="font-style:italic">Corner House</span> conditions, has reversed the effect of <span style="font-style:italic">Corner House</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Eweida.</span> The Civil Procedure Rule Committee has not, however, decided to go further and remove entirely the condition that a PCO is not available in private litigation or where the applicant has a material private interest in the outcome of the litigation. As we have said, it is accepted by the respondent, correctly in our view, that the QOCS regime which applied at first instance in the present case continues to apply on appeal. It is also to be noted that it has been held that “the recoverable costs of an appeal” in CPR 52.19 means the costs recoverable by the winning party on the appeal, whoever the winner may turn out to be; the rule does not contemplate an order in favour of just one party, win or lose: <span style="font-style:italic">JE (Jamaica) v Secretary of State for the Home Department</span> [2014] </p>
