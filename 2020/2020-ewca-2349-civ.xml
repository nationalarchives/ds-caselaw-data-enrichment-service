	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">This appeal is concerned with two long term agreements (“the Principal Agreements”) for the sale of gas from the Sole Pit Reservoirs in the North Sea. The agreements, on materially identical terms so far as this appeal is concerned, were between Shell and Esso respectively as the Sellers and British Gas as the Buyer. They require the Sellers to provide and maintain a capacity to deliver Natural Gas from the Reservoirs at a specified rate.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The first issue to be determined concerns the true construction of that obligation: for the purpose of deciding whether the Sellers have maintained the necessary capacity, is it permissible (as the Sellers contend) to take account of gas from other reservoirs which is owed to them by other gas producers in repayment of gas from the Sole Pit Reservoirs which the Sellers previously lent to those other companies to enable them to fulfil their delivery obligations to British Gas? The judge, Mr Lionel Persey QC, sitting as a Deputy High Court Judge, held that it is, and accordingly that the Sellers are not in breach of the capacity obligation. The second issue concerns the assessment of damages for breach of the capacity obligation, which the judge resolved (although strictly it did not arise in view of his conclusion of liability) in British Gas’s favour. </p>

The Principal Agreements, concluded on 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> December 1988 and due to run until at least 2025, are contracts for the supply of daily quantities of gas from the Reservoirs. There are contractual provisions which set the daily quantity which British Gas is entitled to nominate for delivery. If the Sellers fail to deliver the full amount properly nominated, then they will be in default and must bear the consequences (for which the agreements provide). The Principal </p>

The TRDQ will change over the life of the contract, beginning with a “Run-In Period” which was followed by the “Build-Up Period” and then the “Minimum Plateau Period”. Following the end of the Minimum Plateau Period, the Sellers had the right to serve Variation Notices which, unless successfully challenged by British Gas, would bring about a reduction (but never an increase) in the TRDQ. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In fact, however, the gas actually delivered to British Gas under the Principal Agreements does not consist of gas molecules exclusively produced from the Reservoirs. Instead gas produced from a number of different reservoirs (including the Reservoirs) is commingled and processed at the Shell Sub-Terminal at Bacton. Processed gas is then redelivered to the producers on a broadly <span style="font-style:italic">pro rata</span> basis for delivery to British Gas. Provision for this is made in Article 5 of the Principal Agreements and in an agreement known as “STACA” (“the Shell Bacton Sub-Terminal Allocation Commingling and Attribution Agreement”) dated 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 1997, to which Shell, Esso, British Gas and producers from other reservoirs are parties. Although STACA post-dates the Principal Agreements, those agreements had always expressly contemplated an allocation agreement, and STACA superseded a previous allocation agreement, known as “SPOTS” (“the SPOTS Allocation and Commingling Agreement”) dated 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 1993. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">STACA provides also for gas to be lent and borrowed between “User Groups” (the term used to refer to the producers from each of the various participating reservoirs or groups of reservoirs) in certain circumstances. Thus the Sellers, as the Sole Pit User Group, may be (and have been) required to lend gas produced from the Reservoirs (i.e. Sole Pit gas) to producers from other reservoirs, on terms that the gas so lent will be repaid as soon as reasonably practicable.  </p>

Rather its complaint, made because for some years the market price of gas has fallen below the price payable under the Principal Agreements, is that the Sellers are in breach of an obligation to provide and maintain a capacity to deliver Natural Gas from the Reservoirs at a specified rate. British Gas contends that, in order to comply with that obligation in circumstances where the production volumes of the Reservoirs were in decline, the Sellers ought to have taken steps to reduce the daily quantities of gas that British Gas was obliged to nominate for delivery under the Principal Agreements by serving Variation Notices to reduce the TRDQ. It says that, had such reductions occurred, it would instead have bought other gas in the market at a cheaper price.  </p>

The unavoidable fact is that gas which is repaid to the Sellers in repayment of Sole Pit gas previously lent by them is <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> gas “from the Reservoirs”. The plain meaning of the clause, therefore, is that it is concerned only with the capacity to supply gas from the Sole Pit Reservoirs and not with gas from other sources. The Sellers recognised the force of this point, which they sought to meet by submitting that repaid gas had to be treated as if it were gas produced from the Reservoirs (or, as the judge put it, such gas represented gas produced from the Reservoirs). Thus it is the Sellers, rather than British Gas, who are seeking to read words into the clause. But there is in my judgment no sound basis for doing so. Clause 6.4(1) contains no such deeming provision while clause 5.3, which deals with commingling, draws a distinction between gas “produced from the Reservoirs” and gas “produced from any other accumulation or accumulations”, without suggesting that the latter should be treated as the former, either for the purpose of the capacity obligation in clause 6.4(1) or at all. </p>

The Variation Notice which is then served must specify the maximum TRDQ and Delivery Capacity which the Sellers are of the opinion they will be able to maintain assuming those facilities.

Conspicuously they say nothing about the possible availability to the Sellers of gas from other reservoirs which, if taken into account, would or might enable the Sellers to maintain the TRDQ and its associated Delivery Capacity.

But in any event, I see nothing surprising, let alone nonsensical, about the British Gas construction. The purpose of clause 6.4(1) is to ensure security of supply of gas from the Reservoirs. There is no reason why, when dealing with capacity as distinct from delivery, the possible availability of gas from other sources should be taken into account. The availability of such gas is inherently uncertain. It depends on the ability of the borrowing User Group to repay such gas as and when needed by the Sellers.

The defendant argued that the damages for repudiation should be nominal because the contract did not specify the number of flights required or passenger numbers to be carried and that, in the absence of any minimum requirement, the claimant had suffered no loss. That argument was rejected. The Court of Appeal held that when assessing damages, the court had to make an estimate of how the contract would have been performed if it had continued. </p>

Its performance is the only counter-factual assumption in the exercise. On the basis of that premise, the court has to look at the relevant economic and other surrounding circumstances to decide on the level of performance which the defendant would have adopted. The judge conducting the assessment must assume that the defendant would not have acted outside the terms of the contract and would have performed it in his own interests having regard to the relevant factors prevailing at the time. But the court is not required to make assumptions that the defaulting party would have acted uncommercially merely in order to spite the claimant.

In the present case the obligation in clause 6.4(1) was to maintain a Delivery Capacity of 130% of the TRDQ in circumstances where it was known that the TRDQ would change over the period of the Agreements and, in particular, that the Sellers had a right in some circumstances (but never a duty) to serve a Variation Notice to reduce the TRDQ after the expiry of the Minimum Plateau Period. On any given day it is a straightforward matter to ascertain what capacity the Sellers are obliged to maintain. All that is necessary is to ask what is the current TRDQ and to multiply that by 130%. To construe the contract in this way promotes certainty and clarity. In contrast, to construe the contract as requiring the Sellers to predict the maximum capacity they will be able to maintain in 2 ½ to 3 years’ time, and to serve Variation Notices to adjust the TRDQ accordingly, is far from straightforward, as well as having the effect of converting a right into a duty. </p>

They were under no obligation to serve a Variation Notice with a view to reducing the TRDQ in the event that they foresaw a future inability to comply with that obligation. Damages cannot be assessed as if they were under an obligation to serve such a notice: to do so would be contrary to the terms of the parties’ contract.

Accordingly, when considering whether that contractual obligation has been performed, it is impermissible to take into consideration the Sellers’ ability to use repaid gas from other User Groups to perform their obligations to deliver the requisite contractual quantities to British Gas.

However, I agree with Males LJ that once the TRDQ was set (if necessary, by expert determination) the Sellers had no choice about how to perform their obligation under Clause 6.4(1). They had to be in a position to produce and deliver 130% <span style="font-style:italic">of that quantity</span> from their own resources, unless and until they elected to reduce the TRDQ by service of a Variation Notice. The obligation that was breached was an obligation to maintain the capacity to deliver 130% of the TRDQ that currently dictated how much gas British Gas was obliged to take up and pay for, and not 130% of some lower TRDQ that might be declared in substitution for that figure in future.   </p>

If they so elected, the obligation under Clause 6.4(1) would remain an obligation to maintain a capacity to deliver from the Reservoirs 130% of the TRDQ, but the obligation would be performed by maintaining a lower production capacity because the Sellers had adjusted the TRDQ downwards. Thus the ability to serve a Variation Notice provided the Sellers with a contractual safeguard against the consequences of a breach of Clause 6.4(1). If they exercised the option after the capacity had fallen below the contractual requirements, they would cease to be in breach of contract as soon as the election took effect, and damages for the breach would be measured over that period.  </p>

However, the very fact that the Sellers had an option, rather than an obligation, to vary necessarily envisages that there might be circumstances in which they would be unconcerned about the consequences of being in breach of Clause 6.4(1), and  would decide that they did not need to reduce the TRDQ. From a commercial perspective, the question whether they would wish to avail themselves of that safeguard would be likely to depend on their exposure to damages for the breach.  </p>

However, in the present case, the Sellers had no problem in delivering against the TRDQ which they had set.

Absent such an election, the damages to be quantified would be the loss, if any, suffered in consequence of the Sellers’ failure to maintain the (unmodified) capacity to deliver 130% of the TRDQ as at the date of the breach, measured over the whole of the period while that breach continued. That is the loss with which we are concerned. The key question is therefore whether we can conclude, without the need for evidence, that it inevitably follows from the fact that the Sellers could (and in the event did) perform their <span style="font-style:italic">delivery</span> obligations by using repaid gas from other User Groups to make up the shortfall in the quantities that they were unable to produce from the Reservoirs, that British Gas has suffered no loss in consequence of their breach of Clause 6.4(1).  </p>

However, that may just be a consequence of a failure by British Gas to negotiate terms which obliged the Sellers to serve a Variation Notice instead of giving them a choice. It would also be the consequence of a set of facts arising which I doubt any of the contracting parties expected to occur at the time when they entered into these contracts. It would have been reasonable for them to have assumed that, as and when it became apparent that the Reservoirs were no longer going to be able to produce 130% of the TRDQ the Sellers <span style="font-style:italic">would</span> serve a Variation Notice, because it was not contemplated that so much gas would be “borrowed” under the STACA arrangements that there would be enough available to enable them to continue to meet up to 130% of the TRDQ in the long term once it became impossible for them to do so from their own resources.

When putting the injured party into the position in which they would have been if the contract had been performed, one must assume that the relevant breach did not occur. In a commercial contract for the manufacture and delivery of goods, the situation may arise in which the supplier is unable to make the goods because he cannot source a key ingredient. The buyer’s damages are based on comparing the situation in which the seller did produce and supply those goods to him, with the situation that actually occurred, in which he was unable to do so. For the purposes of that exercise, the fact that he could never have delivered those goods is irrelevant. </p>

This ‘capacity obligation’ requires them to maintain the physical capacity to meet the prevailing contract quantities.  They could have honoured the contract by further exploitation of the Reservoirs and/or by serving Variation Notices.  Yet it is common ground for present purposes that (although they have been coy about the details) the Sellers have for some considerable time been unable to meet the capacity obligation from gas from the Reservoirs, and that this will remain the case.  This breach can occur with impunity, provided that they deliver enough equivalent gas to meet the Buyer’s nominations.  Indeed, they could theoretically have breached it for the majority of the contract period.  Looking backwards in time, they could have served no Variation Notices at all following the end of the Minimum Plateau Period in 1997; that may not have been realistic in practice, but that cannot affect the analysis.  Looking forward, they may seek to remain in continuous breach until the end of the contract in 2025.  They may not extract another cubic metre from the Reservoirs, yet the Buyer is said to be locked into taking and paying for gas that it does not want on grounds of price.  That, says Mr Bools for the Buyer, is absurd. </p>

I turn finally to the Sellers’ contention that the only relevant obligation pleaded by BGT is to maintain a delivery capacity of 108.43 TJ/day, which was to all intents and purposes achieved.  This is not, in my view, a fair categorisation of BGT’s pleaded case.  BGT has  pleaded that the Sellers failed to maintain a capacity physically to deliver gas at a rate of 130% of the DCQ (paragraph 19 of the AmPoC) and that as a result of that breach of clause 6.4(1) BGT has been required to take or pay for a larger quantity of gas under the Principal Agreements than, but for the breach, it would have done (paragraphs 25 and 26 of the  AmPoC).  This is not an issue that can be disposed of at this stage.  </p>

It follows from this that the losses allegedly caused to BGT by the Sellers’ breach of Clause 6.4(1) are not, in my judgment, to be calculated on the assumption that the Reservoirs would have had a physical capacity of 108.43 TJ/day.”    </p>

That the judge understood this can be seen from this earlier passage where he made clear that the existence of an obligation to serve the notices was an essential condition for his conclusion on this issue:    </p>

As its treatment in <span style="font-style:italic">McGregor on Damages </span>20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> Ed. at 10-110 shows, the <span style="font-style:italic">Durham Tees </span>inquiry is appropriate in a case where there is uncertainty about the extent of the claimant’s loss in circumstances where the defendant has a discretion as to how a contract can be performed.  A contract of this kind was considered by this court in <span style="font-style:italic">Abrahams v Herbert Reiach Ltd</span> [1922] 1 KB 477.  Publishers undertook to republish the claimant’s magazine articles in book form, paying a royalty on each copy sold.  The form, price, publication date and number of copies to be printed was left to their discretion.  They then refused to publish the book and the issue was what would have amounted to sufficient publication to constitute performance of the contract.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The present case is different.  The Sellers had a single obligation to provide and maintain the capacity to deliver gas from the Reservoirs at 130% of the TRDQ, whatever that was at the time.  They had no discretion as to how much daily gas they had to deliver.  As already noted, and the distinction is a subtle one, the power to change an obligation is not a discretion as to how to perform it.  Accordingly, once the obligation is identified and the breach established, the only remaining question is what if any loss has flowed from the breach.  There is no uncertainty about definition of the loss, though its quantification may be complex, depending on the circumstances.   </p>

I am conscious that we are differing from the judge not once but twice, but that is no reflection on his judgment, which dealt clearly and succinctly with three difficult issues.  It should also be noted that his undisturbed finding on the third issue (no implied term) has had a decisive effect on the outcome and that his decision and ours have by different routes arrived at the same destination.  </p>
