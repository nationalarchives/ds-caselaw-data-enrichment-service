The courts below held that the certificate was conclusive as to the cost incurred in providing the services but not as to whether such services fell within the scope of services for which the landlord was entitled to charge under the lease. The landlord appeals with permission granted by Lewison LJ. </p>

The first was dated 15 May 2013, made between IVG Institutional Funds GmbH as landlord and Blacks as tenant, with a term of 10 years but with a break clause after 5 years (the 2013 lease). The freehold reversion was assigned to the appellant Sara &amp; Hossein Asset Holdings Limited (S&amp;H) in December 2016. Blacks exercised its rights under the break clause and entered into a further lease dated 23 April 2018 (the 2018 lease), with S&amp;H as landlord, for a term of one year ending on 15 May 2019. Blacks vacated the premises at the expiry of the 2018 lease. </p>

Mr Fowler, then as now appearing for S&amp;H, had submitted that these authorities could be applied by analogy to the present case. As to this, the judge said:  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.00in;text-indent:0.00in">“24. That is, at its inception, a difficult proposition. There is to my mind a fundamental distinction between a contractual provision that assigns matters that might potentially be disputed to an independent expert, and a provision that is said to confer on one of the parties to the contract the power to determine conclusively (subject to limited exceptions for obvious errors and fraud) the question of whether that party has complied with its obligations under the contract. In this case, the lease provided a clear example of the former, in paragraph 6 of Schedule 6 which provided for an expert determination of the proportion of the total costs that were payable by the tenant. On S&amp;H's case, however, the landlord has the power to decide conclusively all of the issues that might arise in determining whether certain costs were properly claimed as service charges under the lease at all, including issues of law and principle as to the correct construction of the lease.  </p>

Notwithstanding the express provisions in Schedule 6 excluding from the service charges matters such as (for example) costs caused or necessitated by the negligence of the landlord, or the cost of improvement or modernisation the premises, the tenant would be precluded from enforcing those provisions against the landlord, absent obvious errors or fraud. Mr Fowler was not able to identify any precedent authority that supported his position on this point.”  </p>

It is, as the Deputy Master noted, not necessary to define exhaustively the circumstances in which a certificate would or might be conclusive; rather it is sufficient for the purposes of this appeal to find that the landlord's certificate is not conclusive as to the various matters relied upon by Blacks which the Deputy Master considered were properly characterised as defences to liability.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I part company from the judge at the first step of her reasoning, that Blacks’ construction represents the natural meaning of the crucial words in paragraph 3 of schedule 6. The landlord’s certificate is conclusive “as to the amount of the total cost and the sum payable by the Tenant”. On any basis, this comprises at least two elements: (i) the amount of the total cost and (ii) the sum payable by the tenant. The latter is, if not agreed, subject to binding expert determination to the extent provided under paragraph 6, that is to say, as to the proportion of the total cost payable by the tenant. The judge reads the former as itself divided into two elements: (i) the identification of the services and expenses properly falling within part II of schedule 6 and not constituting Excluded Costs under paragraph 10 and (ii) the total costs incurred in respect of those services and expenses. It is, of course, correct that these elements make up the “total cost” certified by the landlord, as paragraph 1 makes clear. But, I am unable to see how, as a matter of the ordinary meaning of the language used in paragraphs 1 and 3, those two elements can be separated, with the certificate being conclusive only as regards the second element. Paragraph 3, as I read it, renders the certificate conclusive as regards the single figure of “such total cost”, which necessarily involves both elements going to make up that single figure. Treating the categorisation of the relevant services and expenses as not being conclusively determined by the landlord’s certificate (subject to mathematical or manifest error or fraud) would require express words to that effect or a necessary implication. There are no such express words, and, in my judgment, there are no grounds for a necessary implication to that effect. </p>

That is undoubtedly a matter which a tenant would be well advised to consider very carefully before agreeing a lease in these terms, particularly where the amount of the service charge is not capped by the terms of the lease. But, it is not the function of contractual construction to save a party from an imprudent term, as Lord Neuberger said in <span style="font-style:italic">Arnold v Britton</span> [2015] UKSC 36, [2015] AC 1619 at [20], a case concerning service charge provisions in leases.

On the contrary, it makes sense for the landlord, by avoiding what could be protracted and very detailed arguments about whether particular pieces of work and expenses did or did not fall within part II of schedule 6. The potential for such disputes is apparent from reading the categories of works and services envisaged by part II, even before getting to the open-textured terms of paragraph 13 of part IIA: “Providing all and any other services by the Landlord acting reasonably in the interests of good estate management”. </p>

She took the view that this provided a basis for concluding that the potentially more important issue of whether particular services or expenses fell within part II, or were Excluded Costs as itemised in paragraph 10 of part I, was to be left to the court, in the absence of an equivalent provision for expert determination. In my judgment, this seeks to prove too much. The presence of the provision in paragraph 6 for an expert determination of the appropriate proportion, which feeds directly into the certified sum payable by the tenant, does not carry with it a basis for saying that, in the absence of such a provision applicable to the services and expenses provided and incurred by the landlord, their correct categorisation must have been intended to be a matter for the court. In the absence of any language in the provisions to suggest that result, of which there is none, the more natural inference is that it was a matter for the landlord’s certificate. </p>
