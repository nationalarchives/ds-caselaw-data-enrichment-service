	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The questions raised on this appeal concern the correct legal test for assessing the sum payable under a policy of insurance against property damage when there is no term of the policy which fixes the measure of loss.  The main issue is whether, in order to recover the cost of reinstating damaged property under such a policy when this cost has not actually been incurred, the insured needs to show a genuine, fixed and settled intention to reinstate the property and (in the case of a building) to do so on the same site and in the same style and general shape as it was before the damage occurred. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The appellant insurer contends that this is a legal requirement and that, because it was not satisfied in this case, the trial judge was wrong to award damages to the insured based on the cost of reinstating buildings which were very substantially damaged by a fire at its premises and replacing plant and machinery which was destroyed by the fire.  Instead, the insurer argues, the sum awarded should have been limited to the (much lower) market value of the buildings, plant and machinery damaged or destroyed. </p>

The premises were occupied by the claimant insured, Sartex Quilts &amp; Textiles Limited, which was preparing to use them as a factory to manufacture “shoddy hard pads”.  The buildings and machinery and plant were insured against property loss or damage under an insurance policy underwritten by the defendant (and appellant), Endurance Corporate Capital Limited, which I will refer to as “the insurer”.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The driving force behind the insured’s business is Mr Maqbool Ahmed.  Other members of his family are also involved.  The business was originally conducted as a partnership between Mr Ahmed, one of his brothers and two cousins.  The four partners are the freehold owners of Crossfield Works.  After the insured company was formed to carry on the business, an agreement was made in writing between the partners and the insured dated 28 April 1995 under which the partners granted the insured a licence to use Crossfield Works for no rent so long as it arranged (at its own cost) appropriate insurance cover for the buildings and contents and ensured that the premises were maintained in a good state of repair.  It is on that basis that the insured has since occupied the premises. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">From about 2005, Mr Ahmed became interested in expanding the insured’s business by manufacturing shoddy hard pads at Crossfield Works for use mainly in mattresses (as covers for springs) and also for general insulation.  Shoddy hard pads are made from a mixture of shredded rags and low melt fibre.  Having researched the market and designed a production process, the insured gradually, over several years, acquired the necessary plant and machinery from the USA, Italy and Germany, as well as the UK.  Much of the machinery was bought second hand and was refurbished by the insured. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The planned manufacturing process involved three production lines.  By late 2010 most of the plant and machinery had been installed at Crossfield Works and, by the time of the fire in May 2011, one of the production lines was in operation.  The other two production lines were awaiting the installation of an upgraded electricity supply before they could begin operating. </p>

It is clear from the wording of Condition 7 that the basis upon which the amount payable under Section A is to be calculated is always that set out in Condition 7 and is always – subject to the limits specified in that clause – the cost of Reinstatement (as defined in the policy) of the Property lost, destroyed or damaged.   </p>

It does not provide for the amount payable under Section A to be calculated on any basis other than that set out in Condition 7 or to be anything other than the cost of Reinstatement.  What it does is to set a cap on the amount payable which applies in specified circumstances.  Where the cap applies, as it does here, this means that the cost of Reinstatement is not recoverable beyond the amount of the cap.  But it is still the cost of Reinstatement, or part of it, which is payable, subject to the cap. </p>

As mentioned, the amount of the cap is “the amount which would have been payable in the absence of [Condition 7]”.  To ascertain the amount of the cap, it is therefore necessary to ask what amount would have been payable if the policy had not contained Condition 7.  There is no term of the policy which specifies what amount would have been payable in that hypothetical situation.  The amount of the cap must therefore be assessed by applying the principles of law which apply by default to determine what sum is payable under an insurance policy of this kind in the absence of any express contractual provision.   </p>

The occurrence of such loss or damage is therefore a breach of contract which gives rise to a claim for damages: see <span style="font-style:italic">Firma C-Trade SA v Newcastle Protection and Indemnity Association (‘The Fanti’ and ‘The Padre Island’)</span> [1991] 2 AC 1, 35; <span style="font-style:italic">Ventouris v Mountain (The Italia Express (No 2))</span> [1992] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 281, 292; <span style="font-style:italic">Sprung v Royal Insurance (UK) Ltd</span> [1997] CLC 70. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The general object of an award of damages for breach of contract is to put the claimant in the same position so far as money can do it as if the breach had not occurred: see e.g. <span style="font-style:italic">British Westinghouse Electric &amp; Manufacturing Co Ltd v Underground Electric Railways Co of London Ltd</span> [1912] AC 673, 689.  Where the breach of contract arises from loss or destruction of or damage to property (as it does where the contract is a property insurance policy), there are two distinct ways of seeking to give effect to this principle.  One is to award the cost of replacing or repairing the property.  The other is to award the market value of the property in its condition immediately before the damage occurred (less any residual value).  Which measure is appropriate depends, at least in the first place, on the use to which the claimant was intending to put the property.  </p>

It is generally understood that outside the field of marine insurance there is no concept of constructive total loss whereby property is treated as a total loss if the costs of repair would exceed its value when repaired.  However, without having heard argument on the point, it seems to me that in principle a building should be regarded as destroyed if there is so little left of it that it is more economic to demolish anything that remains and erect an entirely new structure than it is to rebuild incorporating parts of the original building.  </p>

It did not become necessary to decide between these approaches, however, as the respective estimates were so close to each other that the figures were agreed.  At the trial, although it does not appear that any formal concession was made, the insured does not seem to have contradicted the insurer’s contention that the buildings should be regarded as damaged rather than destroyed and, while the judge did not specifically address the distinction, he described the buildings as “severely damaged” in para 2 of his judgment.   </p>

Forbes J found that the cost of erecting functionally equivalent modern buildings in their place was £55,000, whereas the cost of reinstating the buildings substantially as they were before the fire (but with appropriate economies in the use of materials) was £246,883.  The insurers argued that no reasonable commercial person would choose an old and inefficient building which was costly to maintain when they could have at a fraction of the cost a modern purpose-built construction which could be efficiently operated and cheaply maintained.  The judge accepted that this might be so if the insured was using its own money, but considered that this was not the proper test.  Rather, it was sufficient for the insured to show that it would reinstate the buildings if awarded the cost of doing so, provided this was not an eccentric or unreasonable course to pursue.  On the facts the judge found that the insured genuinely intended to reconstruct the maltings if given the means to do so and that this intention was not unreasonable.

The pool as built had an area suitable for diving but which was only 6 feet deep.  The House of Lords held that the owner, Mr Forsyth, was not entitled to recover the cost of rebuilding the pool with the specified depth, as this cost would be out of all proportion to the benefit to be obtained.  Lord Jauncey and Lord Lloyd considered the question whether the measure of damages was affected by whether or not Mr Forsyth intended to rebuild the pool if awarded the cost of doing so.  The trial judge was not persuaded that Mr Forsyth did have such an intention but on appeal he gave an undertaking to spend the damages on rebuilding the pool if his claim succeeded.

The individual who controlled the insured claimed that he intended, if awarded the cost of doing so, to reinstate the shell of the main building both because it had emotional value for his family and (perhaps more realistically) because doing so would further increase the development value of the property.  It is understandable that in these circumstances the Court of Appeal expressed doubt about whether, if the measure of damages had been at large, the insured could have recovered this cost, unless it was actually going to reinstate the property in this way.  On any view, however, it seems to me that the insured could not have recovered this cost, in the absence of the express reinstatement clause, without giving credit in calculating its loss for the amount by which it was better off financially as a result of the fire.  </p>

However, the word “reinstatement” is not used in the insuring clause (nor in any other relevant policy provision apart from Condition 7).  No question therefore arises about what the word means.  The only question could be whether, in the absence of any policy term fixing the measure of indemnity, there can be circumstances in which the appropriate measure is the cost of acquiring or constructing a building on another site and/or which is not in the same style and general shape as the damaged building.  The answer to that question, however, is that there clearly can be such cases.  An example is <span style="font-style:italic">Dominion Mosaics Co Ltd v Trafalgar Trucking Co Ltd</span> [1990] 2 All ER 246, where the Court of Appeal held that the claimant was entitled to recover the cost of purchasing new premises from which to carry on its business where this cost less than rebuilding and the claimant needed to carry on the business in order to avoid losing significant income and profits.

Mr Evans-Tovey emphasised that this definition draws a distinction between property lost or destroyed and property which is damaged.  Where property is destroyed, the definition of “Reinstatement” permits the rebuilding or replacement of the property to be carried out “in any manner suitable to the insured’s requirements” and “upon another site”.  No such latitude is afforded where property is damaged.  By clear implication, therefore, the “Reinstatement” of damaged buildings is limited to the repair or restoration of the buildings on the same site, substantially as they were before the damage occurred. </p>

Nor is there any provision of the policy which “tempers” (as it was put by Mr Evans-Tovey) the measure of indemnity applicable in that hypothetical situation. It is contradictory to argue that Condition 7 is such a term when the test to be applied pursuant to special condition 2 is to determine what amount would be payable in the <span style="text-decoration:underline">absence</span> of Condition 7. </p>

Consideration of what indemnity would be recoverable under the policy in the absence of Condition 7 merely sets a cap on the sum payable in accordance with that clause: it does not permit a better or more beneficial measure of indemnity. </p>

In their joint report the insurer’s expert, Mr Taft, expressed the view that, where an old building is replaced by a new one, there will inevitably be an element of betterment.  Some examples of this (such as better thermal insulation as a result of using modern materials to construct the external walls) would lead to a reduction in the overall building cost, while others (such as upgrading all glazing to double glazed units) would be likely to increase the building cost.  Mr Taft also said that in this case any new structure would require minimal maintenance for the first 25 years of its lifespan, which he regarded as “a fundamental general betterment issue” when comparing such a new structure with the previous building.  He said that it was extremely difficult to establish a cost differential for this general betterment.  He noted that loss adjusters had calculated a range of figures for betterment, including percentage deductions of 25%, 30% or 35%, but said that he was not able to comment on whether this approach was appropriate or whether any of those percentages was the correct one to use. </p>

One form of betterment arises where an insured, rather than seeking simply to reinstate property substantially as it was before it was destroyed or damaged, chooses to make improvements to the property at an additional cost.  In such a case the additional cost is not part of the cost of reinstatement at all and is therefore not recoverable unless it falls within some express provision of the policy. </p>

In that case it was held that the insured’s scheme for replacing buildings largely destroyed by fire could not be characterised as a reinstatement scheme, as it included significant improvements to the property.  An alternative scheme prepared by the insurer’s expert was found to be a reinstatement scheme and therefore a proper basis for assessment.  A further issue arose as to whether certain specific costs included in the latter scheme were nevertheless optional improvements which, if adopted, would go beyond reinstatement and in that sense constituted ‘betterment’.  Two examples of such betterment found by the judge (HHJ Coulson QC) were that the scheme included the costs of insulating the main roof of a barn which had not previously been insulated and of installing double glazed windows when the windows were not originally double glazed: see paras 357 and 361.  These additional costs were therefore excluded from the sum awarded. </p>

However, there can be betterment of a different type where the insured derives a benefit as an incidental consequence of adopting a reasonable reinstatement scheme.  This may occur where, for example, the insured uses modern materials for rebuilding which cost less than materials of the kind originally used but which have advantages such as better thermal insulation.  Another example would be where an old machine is destroyed of a kind which can only reasonably be replaced by buying a new machine because there is no market in which a machine of a similar age can readily be found.  In the first of these examples there is no additional cost incurred by the insured and in the second example the additional cost (of a new machine over and above the likely cost of an old machine, had it been available) is unavoidable. </p>

The defendants did not contend that this benefit would result in any cost savings.

The short answer to this argument is that, as noted earlier, a claim under an indemnity insurance policy is a claim for damages for breach of contract.  It is true that the liability of the insurer is a strict one which does not depend on proof of fault.  But I am not aware of any authority and can see no reason in principle which would support making the measure of damages for breach of contract depend on the character of the contractual obligation of which the defendant is in breach.  In particular, it is no more just in a case where the defendant is an insurer who has promised to indemnify the claimant against loss than it is in any other breach of contract case to force the claimant to pay for a benefit which it did not choose to receive and which does not save the claimant any money. </p>
