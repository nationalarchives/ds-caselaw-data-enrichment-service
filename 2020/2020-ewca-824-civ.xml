Such evidence should identify the medical attendant and give details of his familiarity with the party’s medical condition (detailing all recent consultations), should identify with particularity what the patient’s medical condition is and the features of that condition which (in the medical attendant’s opinion) prevent participation in the trial process, should provide a reasoned prognosis and should give the court some confidence that what is being expressed is an independent opinion after a proper examination. It is being tendered as expert evidence.  The court can then consider what weight to attach to that opinion, and what arrangements might be made (short of an adjournment) to accommodate a party’s difficulties.  No judge is bound to accept expert evidence: even a proper medical report falls to be considered simply as part of the material as a whole (including the previous conduct of the case)….” </p>

The Judge should have considered whether the District Judge’s decision was wrong under CPR Part 39.3(5). Instead, he treated the appeal effectively as an appeal against the Recorder’s decision. Mr Willoughby emphasises that he does not in fact in any way criticise the Recorder’s decision not to adjourn the trial, nor does he need to. </p>

There are clear distinctions between an appellate mechanism and an application under CPR Part 39.3(3). It is wrong to suggest, as FCL and Mr Riaz do, that the District Judge was in some way bound by a finding of the Recorder to the effect that there was no good reason for Ms Fatima’s non-attendance at trial.  Equally, there is no requirement for a material change of circumstance in order for an application under CPR Part 39.3(3) to succeed.    </p>

Too much weight is said to have been given to the overriding objective. In addition, it is said that the Judge failed to consider properly the additional material that was before the District Judge (and which had not been before the Recorder), namely the witness statement from Ms Fatima dated 31 January 2019 explaining the reason for her absence on 17 January 2019 in particular and her hospital attendance record.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.89in;margin-right:0.25in">Mr Roberts for FCL and Mr Riaz submits that the Recorder was entitled to rule in the way that he did.  Implicit in his decision was the finding that Ms Fatima had no good reason for failing to attend the trial.  It was therefore wrong of the District Judge to overrule the Recorder’s findings. Not only were they decisions of a higher court, there was no legal or factual basis for doing so.  The District Judge did not have transcripts of the Recorder’s judgments and should have adjourned the hearing in order to obtain them. Had he seen the transcripts, the District Judge would have understood that the Recorder “in effect” found that there was no good reason for Ms Fatima’s failure to attend trial.  There was no additional evidence of any substance before the District Judge. Ms Fatima’s witness statement of 31 January 2019 added nothing to the sum of what the Recorder had known, namely that Ms Fatima was in hospital with chest pains. The District Judge was bound by the factual findings of the Recorder in respect of which there was no appeal. Mr Roberts makes it clear, as he did to the District Judge, that FCL and Mr Riaz do not for a moment believe that Ms Fatima ever intended to attend trial or that she was ill: he submits, for example, that there is no proven physical cause for her chest pains on 17 January 2019. </p>

An application to set aside judgment given in the applicant's absence is now subject to clear rules. As was made clear by Simon Brown LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Regency Rolls Ltd v Carnall </span>[2000] EWCA Civ 379, the court no longer has a broad discretion whether to grant such an application: all three of the conditions listed in CPR 39.3(5) must be satisfied before it can be invoked to enable the court to set aside an order. So, if the application is not made promptly, or if the applicant had no good reason for being absent from the original hearing, or if the applicant would have no substantive case at a retrial, the application to set aside must be refused.   </p>

It is a fundamental principle of any civilised legal system, enshrined in the common law and in article 6 of the Convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms that all parties in a case are entitled to the opportunity to have their case dealt with at a hearing at   which they or their representatives are present and are heard. If the case is disposed of in the absence of a party, and the party (i) has not attended for good reasons, (ii) has an arguable case on the merits, and (iii) has applied to set aside promptly, it would require very   unusual circumstances indeed before the court would not set aside the order.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.56in;margin-right:1.24in;text-indent:0.50in">The strictness of this trio of hurdles is plain, but the rigour of the rule is modified by three factors. First, what constitutes promptness and what constitutes a good reason for not attending is, in each case, very factsensitive, and the court should, at least in many cases, not be very rigorous when considering the applicant's conduct; similarly, the court should not pre-judge the applicant's case, particularly where there is an issue of fact, when considering the third hurdle. Secondly, like all other rules, CPR 39.3 is subject to the overriding objective, and must be applied in that light. Thirdly, the fact that an application under CPR 39.3 to set aside an order fails does not prevent the applicant seeking permission to appeal the order. It is not very convenient, but an applicant may be well advised to issue both a CPR 39.3 application and an application for permission to appeal at the same time, or to get agreement from the other party for an extension of time for the application for permission to appeal. </p>

However, an appellate court should be slow to overturn a decision of this nature, unless satisfied that the judge went wrong in principle.  The decision will often involve making findings of fact, and while the findings will normally be based on written evidence only, an appellate court should never lose sight of the principle that the first instance tribunal is the primary finder of fact.  In so far as the decision involves a balancing exercise, an appellate court should pay proper respect to the judge’s views. Another way of making essentially the same point is that the appellate court normally has a reviewing, as opposed to a rehearing function in such a case, and can therefore only interfere if satisfied that the judge was wrong.”  </p>

Moreover, it must be interpreted so as to comply with article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights (right to a fair hearing). I refer to the judgment of Brooke LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Goode v Martin</span> [2001] EWCA Civ 1899, [2002] 1 WLR 1828 para 35.  In my view, it is necessary to have both article 6 and the overriding objective in mind when interpreting and applying the phrase “good reason”. It should not be overlooked that the power to set aside an order made in the absence of the applicant may only be exercised where all three of the conditions stated in CPR 39.3(5) are satisfied. In addition to the need to show a good reason for not attending, the applicant must have acted promptly and that he has a reasonable prospect of success.  If the phrase “good reason” is interpreted too strictly against an applicant, there is a danger that the interpretation will not give effect to the overriding objective and not comply with article 6.”  </p>

But I accept the submission...that there is a material distinction between an application under rule 39.3(3) and an application for an adjournment of a trial. If the court refuses an adjournment, there will usually be a trial and a decision on the merits, although the unsuccessful applicant will be at a disadvantage, possibly a huge disadvantage, by reason of the absence of the witness or the party himself. Despite their absence and depending on the circumstances, it may still be possible for the disadvantaged claimant to prove the claim or the disadvantaged defendant to resist it.  I accept that, in some cases, the refusal of an adjournment will almost inevitably lead to the unsuccessful applicant losing at trial.  That is a factor that must be borne in mind when the court exercises its discretion in deciding whether or not to grant an adjournment.  But if the application to set aside a judgment under rule 39.3(3) fails, the applicant will have had no opportunity whatsoever to have an adjudication by the court on the merits. This difference between an application under rule 39.3(3) and an application for an adjournment of the trial is important.  Although it has not been articulated as the justification for generally adopting a more draconian approach to an application for an adjournment than to an application under rule 39.3(5), in my view it does justify such a distinction. It follows that the judge should have applied the P<span style="font-style:italic">ereira</span> guidance rather than the guidance in so far as there is a difference between the two……. </p>

The three stages identified in <span style="font-style:italic">Denton</span> are well known: under CPR Part 3.9 the court is required to consider first the seriousness and significance of the breach; secondly, the reason for the default; thirdly, all the circumstances of the case, so as to enable the court to deal justly with the application, including the need for litigation to be conducted efficiently and at proportionate cost and to enforce compliance with rules, practice directions and orders.

Again, the sanction from which relief is sought is the order granted when the applicant failed to attend the trial, not the delay in applying to set aside the resulting judgment.

The change of circumstances rule is based on the principle identified in <span style="font-style:italic">Chanel Ltd v FW Woolworth &amp; Co Ltd </span>[1981] 1 WLR 485<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>that a party must bring forward in argument all points reasonably available to him at the first opportunity; and that to allow him to take them serially in subsequent applications would permit abuse and obstruct the efficacy of the judicial process by undermining the necessary finality of unappealed decisions.  There is no analogy with the present case.  For similar reasons there is nothing in the submission for FCL and Mr Riaz that the District Judge was bound by a finding of fact by the Recorder that the Appellant did not intend to attend on 17 January 2019.  There was no need for the District Judge to adjourn the application before him in order to obtain transcripts of the Recorder’s rulings. It was for the District Judge to draw his own conclusions from the evidence before him.  He was entitled to conclude that Ms Fatima’s stance on the previous day would not necessarily hold for the next day because she might have taken account of the protective measures which the Recorder had indicated that he would put in place. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.02in;margin-right:0.25in">This approach in no way offends the principle of finality. Putting to one side the fact that the evidence before the District Judge was much fuller than that before the Recorder (which consisted essentially of a bare text message indicating that Ms Fatima was in hospital), an application to adjourn a trial and an application under CPR Part 39.3 are different and discrete applications involving, as set out above, different tests.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.02in;margin-right:0.25in">Since the Judge was conducting an appeal by way of review under CPR Part 51.21 and the decision under appeal was the exercise of a discretion, he should not have interfered with its exercise in the absence of error of law or it being outside the wide ambit permissible.

	    <p style="margin-left:1.02in;margin-right:0.25in">There was no error of law by the District Judge and the exercise of his discretion was well within the range of decisions properly open to him. It was conceded before him both that Ms Fatima had made the application promptly and had reasonable prospects of success at trial. The only issue was whether or not she had a good reason for not attending the trial and, if she did, whether the Recorder’s judgment and orders should be set aside. It was fully open to the District Judge to conclude that Ms Fatima had had a good reason for not attending for the reasons that he gave and to exercise his discretion to set aside the Recorder’s judgment and orders. It is clear (from [13]) of his judgment that he took into account Ms Fatima’s witness statement in reaching his conclusion that there had been a good reason for her non-attendance at trial.  The Judge’s observation (at [32]) that it was “disappointing” that Ms Fatima had not stated in terms that she had any intention in attending court on 17 January 2019 was not well-made. The witness statement, fairly read, made it clear that “the reason for [her] non-attendance” was her medical condition. It stated in terms that she did not attend court on 18 January 2019 because she “was not well enough to do so after being hospitalised”.  As already indicated, the witness statement on any view provided a much fuller picture to the District Judge than that presented before the Recorder. Despite the attack by FCL and Mr Riaz on Ms Fatima’s credibility, certainly in the absence of any application to cross-examine or direct evidence to undermine her position, the District Judge was entitled to reject that attack and approach the application as he did, on the basis that Ms Fatima was genuinely affected and attended hospital in good faith for treatment. </p>
