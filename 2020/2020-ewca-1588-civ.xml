What the applicant seeks here, ultimately, is an order of the court quashing two decisions taken by Canterbury City Council (“the council”), as local planning authority, to approve housing development to the east of Canterbury, and then, when the proposals go back to committee for redetermination, to persuade the council to reverse its earlier decisions by refusing planning permission. </p>

Such a claim may not attack the decision on the planning merits but may only be grounded on a point or points of law, and it can only proceed with the court’s permission. If it does proceed, the claimant will usually enjoy costs protection, consistent with the principles of the Aarhus Convention, under<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>CPR 45.41-45 – which in one of these two related claims, “the Hoplands claim”, the applicant was granted by an order of 2 May 2019. In the other case, “the Chislet claim”, the applicant qualified for and sought such costs protection, but it appears that no express order was made; however, when the claim for judicial review was dismissed, the judge, Lang J., expressly treated the applicant as if she were subject to costs protection and applied the relevant limit of £5,000 to the recoverable adverse costs. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Since 2014, a claim of this kind has been heard in a specialist court, the Planning Court, where it will be determined by one of the “specialist planning judges” regularly assigned to sit there, in accordance with the specific arrangements and timetable created by CPR 54.21-22 for “Planning Court claims”. The Planning Court operates as a separate list within the Administrative Court. An appeal lies from it to the Court of Appeal against the first instance judge’s decision, if either that judge or a Lord or Lady Justice of Appeal grants permission for it to do so on either of the two limbs in CPR r.52.6 – conscious that the applicant for permission does not have an automatic right to renew to an oral hearing (see paragraphs 32 to 35 of the judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Goring-on-Thames Parish Council</span>). </p>

There is a useful summary of the information and documentation to which she had regard in reaching that conclusion in the penultimate paragraph of her reasons for refusing permission to appeal against her decision in the Hoplands case.

Essentially, it was contended that the HRA in the Hoplands case was not a lawful means of curing the breach of EU law by failing to carry out such an assessment at the outline permission stage, especially as the HRA that was carried out later only related to part of the site; that it was arguable, despite the authorities to the contrary relied on by the judge, that the outline permission was null and void; and that the judge had insufficient information or evidence on which to conclude that the decision would inevitably have been the same if a HRA had been carried out before the grant of outline permission.

It was contended that the HRA carried out was deficient in various respects, and that the judge was wrong to dismiss the criticisms of it.

It was suggested that it was unnecessary for a formal application for permission to add or amend the grounds to be made.  In our view, these contentions betrayed an unfortunate attitude to the rules of procedure that seems to have affected the conduct of these proceedings on behalf of the applicant, both at first instance and before this court. We consider that, procedurally, a claimant’s Statement of Facts and Grounds is to be treated in the same way as a Particulars of Claim. Indeed, given the sometimes broad assertions that can be advanced in public law claims and the corresponding difficulties that defendants have in responding to them, there is force in the view that it is even more important in public law claims that claimants are kept to their<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>pleaded case.  </p>

That emphasis was not present in the original skeleton argument for permission to appeal, and in any event appeared to be contradicted by regulation 63(5) of the Habitats Regulations.

It is particularly important in planning cases, where there is a need for speedy determination of issues relating to development, and many people other than those directly connected are affected by the outcome: see <span style="font-style:italic">Bhamjee v Forsdick </span>[2003] EWCA Civ 799, per Carnwath L.J., as he then was, at paragraph 36. As we have said, the Planning Court was established, as a specialist court, to achieve the necessary expedition in the determination of claims in planning and environmental cases. It would subvert the arrangements that have been put in place if unsuccessful litigants could revive the same arguments repeatedly and without limit, thereby prolonging the proceedings, and delaying a certain and final outcome. We should stress that these observations apply generally to all claims for judicial review, and not just to planning cases. </p>

The case concerned alleged<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>bias on the part of the judge by reference to events which were unknown to the parties until after the dismissal of the appeal. A five-judge constitution held that this court had a residual jurisdiction to reopen an appeal “to avoid real injustice in exceptional circumstances”: paragraph 54.

Alternatively, they suggested that, if the requirements of CPR 52.30 will only be satisfied if the circumstances are “egregious”, then for a second application, an applicant would have to show that the circumstances were “overwhelmingly egregious”.

In that case the CJEU stated at paragraphs 9 and 10 that the mere fact that a party contends that a dispute gives rise to a question concerning the interpretation of EU law does not mean that the court or tribunal concerned is compelled to consider that a question has been raised within the meaning of what is now Article 267 of the TFEU (formerly Article 177 of the EEC Treaty). Article 267 of the TFEU makes it plain that a reference to the CJEU only potentially arises if the court “considers that a decision on the question is necessary to enable it to give judgment”. The court or tribunal is therefore only obliged to make such a reference if it considers that a decision on community law is necessary to enable it to give judgment. There is no obligation to make a reference if the question is not relevant – that is, if the answer to that question, regardless of what it may be, can in no way affect the outcome of the case. </p>

Since the applicant’s complaints relate to the cumulative effects of the two projects, rather than the independent effects of either, requiring a joint assessment would have made no difference to the outcome.  </p>

In that regard, attention should be drawn to the importance, both of the community legal order and national legal systems, of the principal of res judicata. In order to ensure both stability of the law and legal relations and the sound administration of justice, it is important that judicial decisions which become definitive after all rights of appeal have been exhausted or after expiry of the time limits provided for in that connection can no longer be called into question <span style="font-style:italic">(Kohler</span> (C-224/01) [223] ECR 1-10239; [2003] 3 CMLR 28 at [38]. </p>

The fact that under the CPR there is a power to re-open is immaterial because there is no legal obligation to exercise that power in such circumstances.  </p>

But even had she done so, that would not have been good enough to satisfy the test for re-opening the question of permission to appeal. The integrity of the earlier proceedings was not undermined in any way. There is no question of Lewison L.J.’s decisions being <span style="font-style:italic">ultra vires</span>, and the applicant has failed to establish that, even if –contrary to our findings – her individual points were right, the outcome would or might have been different. There is no injustice to the applicant involved in refusing her a fourth or fifth attempt to gain the result she seeks, let alone the “grave injustice” required to overcome the pressing claim of finality in litigation.  </p>

They fail to meet any – let alone all – of the criteria set out in CPR 52.30. These are not exceptional cases. There has been no injustice to the applicant. There is no probability of a different result. There was never any tenable basis for an appeal, for the reasons given by both the judge and Lewison L.J.. We consider that neither application for reconsideration was justifiable. The applications before us are therefore dismissed. </p>
