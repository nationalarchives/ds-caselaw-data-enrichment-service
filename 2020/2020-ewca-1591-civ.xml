	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In July 2020, two children who had been placed for adoption by a local authority moved from the care of their prospective adopters and returned to foster care.  In August, the prospective adopters asked for one of the children to be returned.  When the local authority refused, they issued adoption proceedings and also applied for an order for the child’s return.  In a decision given on 21 October 2020, Mostyn J dismissed the application for a return order and struck out the adoption proceedings.  The prospective adopters, having appealed from both decisions, no longer challenge the dismissal of the application for a return order and their appeal in that respect will be dismissed.  However, they maintain their appeal from the striking out of the adoption proceedings because they wish to adopt the child or at least to have a voice in the planning for her future.    </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">G (9) and M (7) are sisters who had very unsettled early lives, with repeated changes of carer.  In March 2019 they were made the subject of placement orders and were then matched with the prospective adopters, Mr and Mrs A.  After introductions, the children were placed with them in September 2019.  From an early stage the girls’ behaviour was very difficult to manage.  The As responded in an exemplary way but the situation would have challenged any parents.  Concern was felt about both children, but the culminating problem was a number of assaults by G on her younger sister.  In early July 2020 the As suggested that the children needed to be separated for their own protection, but the local authority would not agree to this without undertaking a sibling assessment.  Before that could happen, matters reached crisis point and on 22 July both children were removed at the request of the As and placed in separate foster homes. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">On 14 August the As asked the local authority to return M, but not G.  That request was refused and on 7 September they made an application for an adoption order in respect of M.  On 25 September, an application followed under the Human Rights Act 1998 (‘HRA 1998’) seeking an order for M’s immediate return to their care.  That application and the adoption application came before the Judge on 9 October.  In a judgment delivered on 21 October he dismissed the application for an order under the HRA 1998 and struck out the adoption application.  On 4 November I granted permission to appeal. </p>

After 20 mins we called the CAMHS crisis - and then began a succession of being passed from pillar to post whilst in total crisis. We decided an hour in that we’d take her back to ED, and she started to calm as we prepared to go. So we sat for a couple of minutes, before 5 minutes later, it all began again. In desperation [Mr A] called Sheffield who told us to ring an ambulance.  </p>

Whilst we were trying to soothe/ restrain G, M was cowering behind our bed holding onto her toys for dear life, sobbing hysterically. She cannot continue to be exposed to this trauma and abuse. Luckily my neighbour took her from me, so she didn’t have to be exposed to the entirety of it as she was shaking and terrified, and obviously didn’t want to be left alone with my friend K but obviously it was a necessity to protect her. The headbands tonight, were the last of M’s... this week G has destroyed every single one of M’s headbands. Ones we’ve tried to fix before. Precious personalised books and presents from foster carers and family. Bracelets. Toys. Anything that is precious to M she always targets. Never anything of her own. M, at this stage, has very little that hasn’t been broken, and this week, alongside the harm she has suffered at G’s hands, the threats of G to kill herself, M screaming from the back of the car as I’m driving that G is hurting herself and screaming </p>

The postscript to the email evidences the strength of feeling of prospective adopters in wanting finality and wanting to disengage from the local authority;  iii) The prospective adopters had previously rejected the idea of respite care (I note the local authority’s submission that it intended this respite care to be provided by the family of the prospective adopters and not by the local authority) because in their words they wanted a solution and not a temporary fix. The solution had to be permanent and they did not see respite care as such;  iv) That the social worker later emailed saying he would “want to consider this as a respite type placement initially” does not assist the applicants. Rather it reinforces the view that this was not a respite placement. The social worker would only “want to consider” i.e. treat it as a respite-type placement if indeed it was not a respite-type placement. Evidently at this time the local authority was still hoping that the situation could be salvaged in some fashion. This also explains the local authority’s actions in subsequently continuing to involve the prospective adopters in decisions regarding the children and in facilitating contact with them.

The applicants sought the return of M on 14 August 2020. The local authority declined to return her and in making that decision they tacitly made the decision to terminate the placement.

They invite us to set aside the order dismissing the adoption application and to remit those proceedings to a judge of the Family Division for urgent case management.  The appeal in respect of the refusal of an order for M’s immediate return is not pursued because of the complex welfare issues that now arise in relation to both girls’ futures.  Furthermore, during the hearing of the appeal, Ms Fottrell withdrew the argument, rejected by the Judge, that the As had agreed to the children being accommodated under s. 20 CA 1989 and that the local authority had acted unlawfully in refusing to return M.</p>

She rightly reminded us that the conclusion that notice was given is a finding of fact and that the question is not what conclusion we would reach ourselves but whether the Judge’s conclusion was supportable or not.  Here the Judge was entitled, indeed bound, to find that the placement for adoption came to an end when the children were collected by the local authority.  Ms Cabeza realistically recognised the difficulties with the Judge’s alternative conclusion that tacit notice had been given by the local authority at a later stage and she did not seek to uphold his statement at paragraph 30 that as M was already with the local authority there was no need for it to give notice at all. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The placement of a child for adoption is a momentous step in the child’s life that fundamentally alters the status and relationships of the child, the birth parents, and the prospective adopters.  Whether it is achieved with parental consent under s. 19 ACA 2002 or following a placement order under s. 21, it creates a new legal environment that continues until the making of an adoption order or the ending of the placement.  So, for example, upon the making of a placement order, <span style="font-style:italic">the child</span> will no longer be subject to a care order (s. 29(1)) but will instead be a child looked after by the local authority (s. 18(3)).  <span style="font-style:italic">The birth parents</span> can only apply to revoke the placement order with leave of the court, and then only if the child has not been placed (s. 24(2)).  Upon placement, parental responsibility is given to <span style="font-style:italic">the prospective adopters </span>(s. 25(3)) and the child cannot be removed by anyone other than the agency (s. 30 (1)), and then only after notice has been given under s. 35(2).  As approved adopters, they are entitled to apply for an adoption order without seeking the leave of the court, and can do so after only ten weeks, a much shorter time than in the case of other applicants (s. 42).  For its part <span style="font-style:italic">the local authority</span> has parental responsibility for the child (s. 25(2)) and has the power to determine that the parental responsibility of a parent or guardian, or of prospective adopters, is to be restricted to the extent specified in the determination (s. 25(4)).   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The placement of a child for adoption therefore involves much more than the child moving to the home of the prospective adopters in a physical sense.  This can particularly be seen from s. 18(1), which provides that an agency may not only place a child with prospective adopters but, where it has placed a child with any persons, leave the child with them as prospective adopters.  This is of course the situation with a foster-to-adopt arrangement or where local authority foster parents become adopters. </p>

The Adoption Support Services Regulations 2005 require the local authority to carry out an assessment of the need for adoption support services, including to prospective adopters, who are defined for this purpose as adoptive parents.  The services that may be provided include respite care, and assistance where the disruption of an adoptive placement has occurred or is in danger of occurring (regs. 3(2)(e) and (f)).  </p>

In turn, the procedures that the adoption agency must observe are mirrored in the degree of commitment that will have been shown by approved prospective adopters for them to have got to the point where a child can be placed with them.   </p>

It is well-established that where a local authority seeks to bring a placement to an end it must act with procedural fairness towards the prospective adopters.  It may be unlawful for it to give notice without first giving prospective adopters the opportunity to deal with the concerns and ‘head off’ the notice: <span style="font-style:italic">R v Devon County Council Ex Parte O (Adoption)</span> [1997] 2 FLR 388 at 395 (Scott Baker J); <span style="font-style:italic">DL and ML v Newham London Borough Council and Secretary of State for Education</span>  [2011] 2 FLR 1033 at [115] (Charles J); and <span style="font-style:italic">RCW v A Local Authority </span>[2013] 2 FLR 95 at [32] (Cobb J).  This process (which concerns the status of the placement) would not prevent the physical removal of the child in the meantime under an emergency protection order or an interim care order if for some reason the child should not remain with the prospective adopters for another seven days.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The decisions under s. 35(2) underscore the significance of any decision to bring an adoptive placement to an end.  It was suggested to us that an equivalent obligation of procedural fairness should be read into s. 35(1).  But the sub-sections are not direct counterparts.  Prospective adopters are under no obligation to act as if they were a public authority and, as discussed below, the focus under s. 35(1) is upon what they intended.  Where there is ambiguity about that, it might be argued that a local authority is under a duty to clarify the situation before acting on the supposed notice (but that is not in my view the position in this case and I need say no more about it).  </p>

In my view the notice, however it is expressed, must amount to a clear and unequivocal statement that the prospective adopters no longer wish to be regarded as prospective adopters for the child and that they therefore wish to hand the child permanently back into the care of the adoption agency.  Anything less than this would be out of keeping with a scheme of legislation that places such significance upon the status of placement for adoption.  It is not, however, necessary that the notice is given with an understanding of the legal framework; it is enough that the prospective adopters understand that, in ordinary language, they are withdrawing from the plan to adopt.</p>

In a case under sub-section (1), the fact that the authority has or has not carried out its obligations in full or in part does not determine whether notice has been given, but it may reveal its understanding of the prospective adopters’ intentions and thereby cast light on what those intentions were.   </p>

The child remains a looked after child and the local authority must make arrangements for his or her living arrangements under s. 22C CA 1989, no doubt through placement in foster care in the first instance.  The mechanism under s. 20 CA 1989, which exists where a local authority does not have parental responsibility, does not apply.    </p>

If there is a disagreement about the return of the child, the local authority can, at least in the short term, exercise its powers under s. 25(4) to restrict the parental responsibility of the prospective adopters by determining that they may not insist upon the child’s return.  As to the broader question of the child’s status, the local authority may itself give notice under s. 35(2) if it considers that it should do so.  Either way, the legislation allows the child’s situation to be regularised, both in regard to physical living arrangements and as to legal status.  If the prospective adopters have any complaint of unlawfulness, they can make it by means of an application for judicial review or under the HRA 1998. </p>

For the reasons given above, I respectfully disagree.  On the evidence, the email was clearly not written with that intention.  But if there was any doubt, it would have to be resolved in favour of an interpretation that supports a scheme of legislation that places such significance upon the status of placement for adoption.  It must also be borne in mind that placement for adoption in all likelihood (and certainly in this case) confers on the prospective adopters and the children the right to respect for family life under Article 8 ECHR.  The court should therefore not strain to find notice in anything less than a clear and unequivocal statement.  A placement for adoption is a precious thing and nothing less will do to bring it to an end. </p>

The As were then arguing that they had placed M with the local authority under s. 20 CA 1989 and that its refusal to return her was unlawful.  The Judge rightly had no time for that analysis and it has now been abandoned.  However, the overreach seems in turn to have led to the argument about the lawfulness of the children’s foster placements being framed with reference to the continuation or otherwise of the placement for adoption, when it was more appropriately to be seen as a concerning the restriction of the As’ parental responsibility.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In my view, the refusal of the local authority to return M following the request on 14 August was lawful because it amounted to a determination restricting the As’ parental responsibility under s. 25(4) ACA 2002.  The determination was repeated in the email of 7 September and again formally repeated in the letter of 9 September.  Even if, contrary to this view, the determination was not made until 9 September, after the adoption application had been issued, the children were no longer in the care of the As and s. 35(5) (which provides that a child need only be returned under a court order after adoption proceedings are issued) would not apply.   </p>

It is clear to me that the local authority did not give notice under s. 35, tacit or otherwise, before the adoption application was issued in respect of M.  In consequence the children remained placed for adoption when the application was issued and the As were entitled to make the application. </p>

It was not (as Ms Cabeza very properly explained to us) in a position to form the necessary opinion until the assessments had taken place.  Moreover, it did not take any of the steps that should have accompanied the giving of notice.  It did not inform the birth parents of a development that would restore to them the right to apply for leave to apply to revoke the placement order.  It did not convene a Disruption Meeting, required by its Children’s Service Procedures Manual to take place between 28 and 42 days after the breakdown of a placement.  In its legal letter of 9 September it did not assert that it had given notice.  In short, it did not itself believe that it had given notice and in such circumstances it is impossible to find that notice had nonetheless been given.  </p>

It is not reasonable to expect prospective adopters to take the lead.  Two adoption agencies, the local authority and the As’ agency, were involved in the placement of these children.
