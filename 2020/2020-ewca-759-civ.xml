BB2 now challenges that decision on the basis that, first, the relevant arbitration clause does not extend to its claim for relief under section 1028(3) and, secondly, such matters are not in any event susceptible to arbitration. </p>

Completion was to take place between 21 January 2020 and 1 July 2022. BB2 was incorporated specifically for the purpose of entering into the Contract and has no other business or assets. </p>

In arriving at that conclusion, the Arbitrator rejected, among others, a contention by BB2 that any effective termination had to be reassessed retrospectively as a result of BB2’s restoration to the register by virtue of section 1028(1) of the 2006 Act. The Arbitrator considered that section 1028(1) did not serve to undo an action taken by a party to the Contract in the period between striking off and restoration. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">On 11 July 2018, BB2 issued an appeal against the Arbitrator’s award. One of the grounds of appeal was that the Arbitrator was mistaken as to the effect of section 1028(1) of the 2006 Act. On 11 July 2019, however, Cockerill J dismissed the appeal. She concluded that the Arbitrator had been correct to conclude that BAE’s termination of the Contract did not fall to be reassessed retrospectively as a result of section 1028(1). </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Cockerill J refused permission to appeal from her decision. As the proceedings before her were an appeal under section 69 of the 1996 Act, that refusal was final unless BB2 could satisfy the heavy burden of showing that the refusal “has come about as a result of unfair or improper process such that the decision to refuse permission cannot be categorised as a refusal at all” (<span style="font-style:italic">Bunge SA v Kyla Shipping Co Ltd</span> [2013] EWCA Civ 734, [2013] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 463).

The claim form asked for an order that BAE’s termination of the Contract “is of no effect” or, in the alternative, “an order that [BAE] enter into a new agreement with [BB2] on the same terms as those contained in the [Contract]” and “Such further or other relief as the Court considers just for placing [BB2] and [BAE] in the same position as if [BB2] had not been struck off the register of companies and dissolved on 31 May 2016”. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Giving judgment on 21 March 2019, the Judge acceded to BAE’s application. BB2 had argued that its claim is not within the scope of clause 19.1(a) of the Contract and that, were that wrong, “the arbitration agreement is ‘inoperative’ within the meaning of section 9(4) of the 1996 Act on the grounds that the parties’ dispute is not capable of being settled by arbitration, because the Act impliedly prohibits or English public policy prohibits the reference to arbitration of such matters, and that BAE is estopped from relying on the arbitration agreement” (paragraph 14 of the judgment). The Judge, however, rejected those contentions and stayed the claim. He held, first, that the claim involves a dispute between the parties which arises out of the provisions of the Contract and so is a matter which falls to be referred to arbitration under clause 19.1(a) of the Contract (see paragraph 19 of the judgment); secondly, that the arbitration agreement is not “inoperative” within the meaning of section 9(4) of the 1996 Act on the basis that the parties’ dispute is not capable of being settled by arbitration (see paragraphs 30-34 of the judgment); and, thirdly, that BAE is not estopped from relying on clause 19.1(a) (see paragraph 42 of the judgment). </p>

Since 1995, a company has itself been able to make a formal application for its name to be struck off the register. Striking off may also occur at the instigation of the Registrar. If the Registrar has reasonable cause to believe that a company is not carrying on business or in operation (notably, as a result of failure to file requisite documentation with the Registrar), he may send the company a letter inquiring whether it is carrying on business or in operation and, in the absence of an answer, a further letter warning of striking off. If the company fails to reply or agrees that it is not carrying on business or in operation, the Registrar may issue a notice stating that, unless cause is shown to the contrary, the company’s name will be struck off the register after two months. </p>

First, section 651 of the Companies Act 1985 (“the 1985 Act”) empowered the Court to make an order, on such terms as it thought fit, declaring a company’s dissolution to have been void. Secondly, section 653 of the 1985 Act allowed the Court to order the name of a company which had been struck off the register to be restored if satisfied that the company was at the time of the striking off carrying on business or in operation, or otherwise that it was just that the company should be restored to the register. By virtue of section 653(3), where a company was restored to the register under section 653 it was “deemed to have continued in existence as if its name had not been struck off” and the Court could “give such directions and make such provisions as seem just for placing the company and all other persons in the same position (as nearly as may be) as if the company’s name had not been struck off”. </p>

In the first case, the order had no retrospective effect except to restore the company’s corporate existence. It did not validate any actions or activities that had taken place during the period of dissolution. In particular it did not restore to life an action which, having been commenced before the company was dissolved, had abated on the company’s dissolution, nor did it bring to life an action which, purportedly commenced while the company was dissolved, was a nullity. In the other case, by contrast, the effect of the deeming provision was to validate retrospectively what had happened while the company was dissolved, so that once the restoration order was made the company was to be regarded as never having been dissolved.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr David Lord QC, who appeared for BB2 with Mr Sebastian Kokelaar, argued that there is no longer such a dispute in the present case. BB2’s appeal from the Arbitrator’s award having been dismissed, it has been definitively decided that the Contract was validly terminated according to its terms. What is now at issue between the parties does not arise out of the provisions of the Contract but is rather a question of whether relief should be granted pursuant to statute. Mr Lord pointed out that directions under section 1028(3) of the 2006 Act are in principle capable of affecting third parties. That, he said, makes it inherently unlikely that clause 19.1(a) was intended to apply to matters relating to the grant of relief under section 1028(3). Mr Lord relied, too, on clause 27.2 of the Contract. That clause, he noted, adopted a wider formulation than clause 19.1(a), providing for the English Courts to have jurisdiction in relation to “any disputes which may arise out of or in any way relate to this agreement or its formation (including any non-contractual disputes or claims)”. The contrast with clause 19.1(a) confirms, Mr Lord suggested, that clause 19.1(a) should not be construed so widely as to encompass relief under section 1028(3): it can be seen that the parties envisaged that some matters, including issues as to the grant of section 1028(3) relief, would fall outside the scope of clause 19.1(a) and be determined not by arbitration, but by the Courts.</p>

The dispute between BB2 and BAE as to whether relief should be granted under section 1028(3) can aptly be described as “arising out of the provisions of” the Contract. After all, BB2 needs such relief only because BAE has invoked clause 20 of the Contract and the question whether there should be such relief is intimately connected with, for example, the effect of section 1028(1), which was admittedly within the arbitrator’s remit. True it is that it has been now been established that the Contract was validly terminated according to its terms, but that cannot be determinative. In fact, it is common for arbitrations to be concerned with contracts that have already been brought to an end, for example by accepted repudiation or frustration (and see also section 7 of the 1996 Act providing for the separability of an arbitration clause). The fact, moreover, that the present dispute relates to whether relief should be given pursuant to a statute does not mean that it does not also “aris[e] out of the provisions of” the Contract. Further, there is no question of the Contract “mak[ing] it clear” that questions as to relief under section 1028(3) were intended to be excluded from the arbitrator’s jurisdiction, which suggests that clause 19.1(a) should be presumed to apply in accordance with the guidance given in the <span style="font-style:italic">Fiona Trust </span>case. </p>

They engage public interest factors which render them unsuited to arbitration. Section 1028(3), like its counterpart section 1032(3), mirrors predecessor powers which have long existed to protect the public interest. That the public interest is involved is reflected in the fact that, under section 1028(3) and section 1032(3), it is “the court” which Parliament has tasked with granting relief and doing so, moreover, having regard to the position of the company and “all other persons”.  No one could suggest that an application to restore a company to the register under section 1029 could be determined by arbitration and the grant of relief under section 1032(3) is clearly ancillary to such an application and so must equally fall to be decided by the Court. Likewise, an application under section 1028(3) is not susceptible to arbitration. It cannot be supposed that the grant of relief under section 1032(3) cannot be the subject of arbitration but the grant of relief under section 1028(3) can be. There is no sensible basis for treating the two provisions differently. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">For her part, Miss Fiona Parkin QC, who appeared with Mr Patrick Harty for BAE, supported the Judge’s conclusion. The modern approach is to respect party autonomy and so to give effect to an arbitration clause unless there is a very strong reason not to do so. There is no such reason in the present case. Arbitration is prohibited neither by the terms of section 1028(3) of the 2006 Act nor by public policy. There is a close analogy to <span style="font-style:italic">Fulham Football Club (1987) Ltd v Richards </span>[2011] EWCA Civ 855, [2012] Ch 333, where arbitration was held to be available in the context of a petition for relief under section 994 of the 2006 Act. That case shows that the fact that a statutory power is given to “the court” does not mean that an arbitrator does not have a similar power and public policy has a role only as a “safeguard … necessary in the public interest”, which represents a “demanding test”. If (which would be rare) a direction under section 1028(3) could affect a third party, that might limit the relief available in an arbitration. However, the present case involves a private dispute about whether a contract does, or should, exist, affecting no one other than the parties. There is every reason for any issue as to the grant of relief under section 1028(3) to be determined by the same tribunal as other issues relating to BAE’s purported termination of the Contract, and it is not disputed that the arbitrator has power to grant the heads of relief which BB2 seeks. An issue as to the grant of relief under section 1032(3) could similarly be the subject of arbitration. </p>

Many of the statutory provisions in the insolvency regime are in place to recoup for the benefit of the company’s creditors losses caused by the misfeasance and/or malfeasance of its former management. This is especially true of the avoidance and wrongful trading provisions. This objective could be compromised if a company’s pre-insolvency management had the ability to restrict the avenues by which the company’s creditors could enforce the very statutory remedies which were meant to protect them against the company’s management. It is a not unimportant consideration that some of these remedies may include claims against former management who would not be parties to any arbitration agreement. The need to avoid different findings by different adjudicators is another reason why a collective enforcement procedure is clearly in the wider public interest.  </p>

The petition sought an injunction restraining the first respondent from acting as an unauthorised agent or from participating in negotiations regarding the transfer of players or, in the alternative, an order that the first respondent should cease to be the chairman of the second respondent. It was not disputed that an arbitrator would have power to grant such relief, but the petitioner maintained that unfair prejudice disputes were not arbitrable. The petitioner’s position was essentially that “any unfair prejudice claim under section 994 attracts a degree of state intervention and public interest such as to make it inappropriate for disposal by anything other than judicial process” (see paragraph 50).

However, section 994 of the 2006 Act does not afford a class remedy but is “designed to resolve issues of unfair prejudice without the winding up of the company” and deals with “essentially internal disputes about alleged breaches of the terms or understandings upon which the parties were intended to co-exist as members of the company” (paragraph 58). Moreover, “the limitation which the contractual basis of arbitration necessarily imposes on the power of the arbitrator to make orders affecting non-parties is not necessarily determinative of whether the subject matter of the dispute is itself arbitrable” (paragraph 40).

The determination of whether there has been unfair prejudice consisting of the breach of an agreement or some other unconscionable behaviour is plainly capable of being decided by an arbitrator and it is common ground that an arbitral tribunal constituted under the FAPL or the FA rules would have the power to grant the specific relief sought by Fulham in its section 994 petition. We are not therefore concerned with a case in which the arbitrator is being asked to grant relief of a kind which lies outside his powers or forms part of the exclusive jurisdiction of the court. Nor does the determination of issues of this kind call for some kind of state intervention in the affairs of the company which only a court can sanction. A dispute between members of a company or between shareholders and the board about alleged breaches of the articles of association or a shareholders’ agreement is an essentially contractual dispute which does not necessarily engage the rights of creditors or impinge on any statutory safeguards imposed for the benefit of third parties. The present case is a particularly good example of this where the only issue between the parties is whether Sir David has acted in breach of the FA and FAPL rules in relation to the transfer of a Premier League player.  </p>

The court is not concerned with the possible winding up of the company and there is nothing in the scheme of these provisions which, in my view, makes the resolution of the underlying dispute inherently unsuitable for determination by arbitration on grounds of public policy.

In that case, a contractor against whom proceedings had been brought issued third party proceedings seeking indemnity or contribution from a subcontractor. The Court of Appeal held that the claim against the sub-contractor had been rightly stayed under section 9 of the 1996 Act. One of the issues which the Court had to consider was whether the arbitration clause in question covered the contractor’s claim for contribution under the Civil Liability (Contribution) Act 1978, which provides for the amount of the contribution recoverable from any person to be “such as may be found by the court to be just and equitable having regard to the extent of that person’s responsibility for the damage in question”. It was argued on behalf of the contractor that “the power to award contribution was confined by the 1978 Act to the court” and so “it would not be open to parties, even by agreement, to confer on an arbitration tribunal power to award contribution in circumstances in which a court would have such power under the 1978 Act” (see paragraph 17).

Unlike a winding up order or restoration to the register, relief pursuant to section 1028(3) or section 1032(3) does not affect status and an application for such relief will normally be an essentially private matter, affecting nobody but the company and one or more specific individuals or entities.

An application for relief under section 1028(3) or section 1032(3) requires consideration of what (if any) directions and provision are “just for placing the company and all other persons in the same position (as nearly as may be) as if the company had not been dissolved or struck off the register”. Arbitrators might be called on to decide comparable questions in the context of, for example, unfair prejudice or partnership disputes or a contribution claim. An unfair prejudice dispute might require an arbitrator to decide whether a company’s affairs “are being or have been conducted in a manner that is unfairly prejudicial to the interests of members” and, if so, what (if any) relief should be given (see sections 994 and 996 of the 2006 Act). Arbitration clauses in partnership agreements will “[i]n most instances …  authorise the arbitrator to order a dissolution of the firm under section 35 of the Partnership Act 1890” (Lindley &amp; Banks on Partnership, 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> ed., at chapter 10, and also <span style="font-style:italic">Phoenix v Pope </span>[1974] 1 WLR 719), and that provision allows dissolution to be decreed where, among other things, “circumstances have arisen which, in the opinion of the Court, render it just and equitable that the partnership be dissolved”. Under the Civil Liability (Contribution) Act 1978, contribution is to be “such as may be found … to be just and equitable having regard to the extent of that person’s responsibility for the damage in question”. </p>

In practice, such cases must, I think, be the exception rather than the rule and there is no reason to think that any third party would be affected by the grant of the relief which BB2 seeks in the present claim. To the contrary, Miss Parkin confirmed that no contract to re-sell any of the land comprised in the Contract has been concluded. Be that as it may, however, the possibility of relief under section 1028(3) or section 1032(3) having an impact on third parties does not, as it seems to me, mean that applications for such relief are not susceptible to arbitration. As Patten LJ said in <span style="font-style:italic">Fulham</span>, “the limitation which the contractual basis of arbitration necessarily imposes on the power of the arbitrator to make orders affecting nonparties is not necessarily determinative of whether the subject matter of the dispute is itself arbitrable”, albeit that the potential for relief to impinge on third parties may “impose limitations on the scope of relief obtainable in arbitral proceedings”. In a similar vein, Longmore LJ observed in <span style="font-style:italic">Fulham </span>that it is “well settled that the fact that an arbitrator cannot give all the remedies which a court could does not afford any reason for treating an arbitration agreement as of no effect” and Sundaresh Menon CJ explained in <span style="font-style:italic">Tomolugen Holdings Ltd v Silica Investors Ltd </span>that “[t]he fact that the relief sought might be beyond the power of the tribunal to grant does not in and of itself make the subject matter of the dispute non-arbitrable”. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It is fair to say, as Mr Lord did, that it would be odd if an application for relief under section 1028(3) of the 2006 Act were arbitrable but one under section 1032(3) were not. I accept, too, that referring to arbitration matters under section 1032(3) could produce procedural complexity. Section 1032(3) applies only where an order for restoration is made by the Court. The company in question would necessarily, therefore, have been the subject of an application to the Court. That being so, it might be thought simpler to leave the Court to deal with any consequential relief under section 1032(3). If needs be, however, the Court proceedings could be stayed to allow for arbitration and, like Sundaresh Menon CJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Tomolugen Holdings Ltd v Silica Investors Ltd</span>, I do not consider that procedural complexity will of itself generally be capable of giving rise to non-arbitrability. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">A final point is that, in the present case, no difficulty arises as to the nature of the relief sought under section 1028(3) of the 2006 Act. As I have mentioned, BB2 asks for an order that BAE’s termination of the Contract “is of no effect” or, in the alternative, “an order that [BAE] enter into a new agreement with [BB2] on the same terms as those contained in the [Contract]”. Mr Lord accepted that the grant of such relief would be within the powers of an arbitrator. It is to be noted that section 48 of the 1996 Act provides for an arbitrator to have “the same powers as the court … to order a party to do or refrain from doing anything”. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The first issue is whether the legal proceedings in which BB2’s claim is brought are “in respect of a matter which under the agreement is to be referred to arbitration”. That depends on whether the parties’ dispute is within the scope of the arbitration clause in the agreement which provides for disputes “arising out of the provisions of the agreement” to be referred to arbitration. </p>

It says that one or other of these orders is what justice requires. BAE contends that no such order should be made, as it would be unjust to deprive BAE of its contractual right to terminate the agreement in the event of BB2 being struck off.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">But even taking a narrow view of the arbitration clause, the parties’ dispute does arise out of the provisions of the agreement. It arises out of the express contractual right for which BAE bargained to terminate the agreement by notice in the event of BB2 being struck off the register. If successful, BB2’s claim would (as Mr David Lord QC for BB2 accepted) deprive BAE of the benefit of that contractual right. </p>

These arise out of the fact that the proceedings before Mr Redmond are now concluded (save perhaps for the limited purpose of assessing the costs payable to BAE); that it is now too late for BB2 to commence an arbitration within the three-year period referred to in section 1028(4); and that Mr Redmond’s award that the Contract was validly terminated by BAE is now final and binding on the parties (see section 58 of the 1996 Act). It is unnecessary and it would be wrong to determine these issues now. But if these do prove to be insuperable obstacles for BB2, that will merely mean that its claim will fail and not that it is not an arbitrable claim. </p>
