A complete list of the different models is set out as Annex A to the decision of the Upper Tribunal Tax and Chancery Chamber (“Upper Tribunal”) (Birss J and Judge Roger Berner) which was released on 29 September 2018 and which allowed an appeal by HM Revenue and Customs (“HMRC”) against the earlier decision of the First-tier Tribunal (“FtT”) (Judge Charles Hellier and Mrs Ruth Watts Davies) in favour of the importer companies: see [2016] UKFTT 0775 (TC), 2016 WL 07048508.</p>

In [45]-[53] of its first decision released on 13 November 2014 following a 10-day hearing in July 2014 (see: [2015] UKFTT 113 (TC)), the FtT set out a description of the electric scooters that are the subject of these appeals.  These findings are not controversial and, for convenience, I set them out here:</p>

Each type of scooter had: a seat for one person (which was larger and more luxuriously padded in the larger scooters), a tiller with a wig wag, a platform connecting the front and back wheels on which to mount to the scooter and on which the feet could be kept during a journey, and either four wheels (two driven wheels at the back and two at the front) or three wheels (two at the back and one at the front). Most seats had moveable adjustable armrests and many seats could be raised and lowered and swivel through 360 degrees. Most of the smaller scooters could be disassembled into moderately light units for easier transport. </p>

Such limitation was to 4 mph (6.43 km/h) for the small and medium scooters and 8 mph (12.87 km/h) for the larger scooters (with a control to change that limitation to 4 mph). These limitations appear to be incorporated to benefit from certain exemptions from the provisions of the UK Road Traffic Acts which applied when such a scooter was driven by a disabled person (as defined in the relevant provision) – see below. There was no evidence that they provided any other benefit or advantage to any possible user. </p>

Powered wheelchairs on the other hand may, having smaller wheels, have difficulties with kerbs. </p>

The scooters, he said, were not specially designed for disabled people.  At best they were intended for use by those who are elderly or less able to walk rather than by the disabled.

But the classification headings were not mutually exclusive so that if the scooters were also reasonably to be regarded as “carriages for disabled persons” then by the operation of either GIR 3(a) (the most specific) or GIR 3(c) (the last numerically) they must fall to be classified under heading 8713.

Whatever precise meaning of disability is intended by the heading, it cannot be doubted that there will be some conditions which will be disabilities for the purposes of the heading. A person who is totally blind, someone without arms, and someone who does not have, or does not have the use of, a leg will all be disabled on any definition. It cannot be the case that "for disabled persons" requires that the vehicles would have features which aid, assist or attract all of those people because of their disabilities for then no vehicle would qualify: a person whose only disability was total blindness would not find any vehicle (save perhaps a self driving robot google car) attractive in view of their blindness. Thus it must be accepted that a vehicle can fall within the heading even if there are disabled persons for whom it would have no benefit, attraction or use. And correspondingly the heading must therefore mean that a vehicle may qualify if there is a disabled person whose disability is such that the special features of the vehicle make it beneficial for or attractive to that person because of their particular disability.” </p>

In this paragraph the ECJ puts the proposition that just because the vehicles can be used by disabled persons, that does not make them vehicles for the disabled since they can be used by those who are not disabled.  The tribunal does not understand this as meaning that any possibility of use by the nondisabled will take a vehicle out of 8713.  That is because: (1) a powered wheelchair may be used by a non-disabled person, and the court appears to accept that it is a vehicle for the disabled, and (2) at no point in the Court’s judgement does it say that vehicles for the disabled means vehicles only for the disabled.   </p>

The possibility that such a vehicle could be used by a non-disabled person did not, they suggested, affect its classification.  </p>

Both offer design features which alleviate the effect of a non marginal limitation on the ability to walk by permitting independent travel which would otherwise be impossible or unduly difficult for such a person. The design of each type of vehicle does not afford any advantage to those without such a limitation on the ability to walk: in particular the limitation on to maximum the speed and the possibility of occupancy by one person only make the use of the vehicle less advantageous than walking for a person without such a disability. Both types of vehicles may thus be said to be specifically designed for such disabled persons and as having use by them as their main or logical use.

As the FtT explained in [113] of its first decision, it was minded to classify the scooters under 8713 were it simply a matter of deciding which of the two rival headings was in terms the most appropriate so that if the headings 8703 and 8713 are to be read as mutually exclusive then its decision would still have been the same.  But in order to operate GIR 3(a) as the FtT did it is still necessary to decide whether the scooters do fall within the words of heading 8713.  The Court is therefore inevitably faced with an application of GIR 1.  I am not therefore convinced that this ground of appeal really goes anywhere, although it has been relied upon as part of the respondents’ notice on this appeal. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In any case the Upper Tribunal was right in my view to reject it.

Some reliance was placed on what Henderson J (as he then was) said in <span style="font-style:italic">Revenue and Customs Commissioners v Flir Systems AB</span> [2009] EWHC 82 (Ch) about the GIRs being a hierarchical set of principles under which if the correct classification can be ascertained at a given stage it is unnecessary to proceed further.

Mr Beal has submitted that if what the CJEU intended to do in <span style="font-style:italic">Invamed</span> was in effect to reverse its decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Lecson</span> as to the correct classification of these vehicles then it would have said so.  As it is, the Court has merely confirmed its already established approach to tariff classification with the wording of the headings read in the light of the objective characteristics of the goods in question and has emphasised (so far as not already clear) that actual rather than intended use of the scooters is irrelevant to their classification.  The identification of what the Court refers to as their intended use is therefore determinative because that is the only use which the wording of the CN headings is intended to comprehend or take account of: see <span style="font-style:italic">Invamed</span> at [24].  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The Upper Tribunal rejected a submission by Mr Beal that the effect of the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Lecson</span> was actually to classify the vehicles in that case under heading 8703.  It said in its judgment at [56] that the CJEU was merely concerned to give guidance to the national court on the principles to be applied.  It seems to me that Mr Beal was justified in making that submission given the terms of the question referred to the CJEU in <span style="font-style:italic">Lecson</span> and the way in which it was answered.  As I explained earlier, the context of the reference was the difference of view between the referring court and the Commission on the one hand and the Amsterdam Court of Appeal on the other as to whether mobility scooters of the type under consideration fell to be classified under 8703 or 8713.  The CJEU in <span style="font-style:italic">Lecson</span> was therefore asked a single and very direct question as to whether scooters of this kind fell within heading 8703 or heading 8713 and the answer which it gave was that scooters “such as those at issue in the main proceedings” which were “designed for the transport of one person who is not necessarily a disabled person” were covered by heading 8703.  In both <span style="font-style:italic">Lecson</span> (at [15]) and <span style="font-style:italic">Invamed</span> (at [16]) the CJEU emphasised that its task on a reference was merely to give the national court guidance on the criteria which should be applied rather than to make the classification itself.  But it acknowledged that it may, as it put it, in a spirit of co-operation give the national court all the guidance that it needs.  In <span style="font-style:italic">Lecson</span> this came very close to saying that the scooters in issue, as analysed in relation to their intended use, should be classified under heading 8703.  But in <span style="font-style:italic">Invamed</span> the Court was not asked how the national court should answer the ultimate question of classification.  Instead, it was asked for clarification about the test or criteria to be applied and how the intended class of users (“disabled”) under heading 8713 should be identified.  </p>

In <span style="font-style:italic">Lecson</span>, having identified the intended use of the vehicles as the transport of persons generally, the CJEU was concerned in [25] only to discount possible use by disabled persons as relevant to their tariff classification.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In <span style="font-style:italic">Invamed</span> this emphasis on the vehicles at issue in the proceedings comes in [26] which does not appear in any form in <span style="font-style:italic">Lecson</span> and states the <span style="font-style:italic">a contrario</span> position in relation to use by non-disabled persons of scooters intended for use by the disabled.  Although this is simply the application of the principle of intended use to the converse case where that intended use is for disabled persons, it is significant in my view that the Court refers in [26] to the “fact that the vehicles at issue in the main proceedings” may be used by non-disabled persons as being irrelevant to their tariff classification under heading 8713 “since by reason of <span style="text-decoration:underline">their</span> original purpose <span style="text-decoration:underline">those vehicles</span> [my emphasis] are unsuitable for other persons who do not suffer disabilities”.  I read this as a strong indication that in <span style="font-style:italic">Invamed</span> the CJEU has either changed its provisional view about the intended purpose of this type of mobility scooter or, at the very least, has accepted that their classification under heading 8713 is a conclusion open to the national court.  Were it otherwise then the addition of [26] to the intended purpose analysis makes no sense.  Although therefore I agree with the view of the FtT expressed in [29] of its second decision that <span style="font-style:italic">Invamed</span> (like <span style="font-style:italic">Lecson</span> before it) was primarily concerned to elaborate and explain the relevant classification principles, the change in emphasis is significant.  </p>

The guidance on the 8713 heading contained in the 2005 CNEN states that vehicles specifically designed for disabled persons are distinguishable in terms of their design features from vehicles under heading 8703 because they have a maximum speed of 10 km per hour, a maximum width of 80m, two sets of wheels touching the ground and special features to alleviate the disability.

That in our judgment is the wrong approach. Furthermore, we consider that the FTT was wrong, in its First Decision, at [178], to seek to identify whether particular features of the scooter afforded an extra ability or facility to able-bodied persons. In our judgment, where the core structure of the vehicle affords to an able-bodied person the same facility for mechanised travel as a disabled person, that fact without more would result in classification under heading 8703, because there could be no design distinction ascertainable from those objective characteristics between intended use by disabled persons as against ablebodied persons who may choose to use a scooter in preference to walking. It is not necessary to find something in addition to the ability to use the scooter instead of walking which aids or is an advantage to an able-bodied person in order to conclude that the scooter is designed for able-bodied persons as well as for disabled persons and so is not designed solely for disabled persons.

What differentiates the two classes is the restriction or not of their intended use to disabled persons.  What the judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Invamed</span> tells us is that their intended use is to be determined by their objective characteristics and properties and the application of this principle is spelt out in a number of different ways.  So the intended use of the product is to be determined according to its “inherent character” judged by its objective characteristics and, having regard to that, the national court must decide whether the vehicle at issue is intended “to be used specifically” by disabled persons.  If so, then this must be classified as “the main or logical use” of the vehicles and use by non-disabled persons, whilst possible, is legally irrelevant.  Vehicles (see [25] and [26] of <span style="font-style:italic">Invamed</span>) are suitable for use by disabled persons (and therefore unsuitable for use by non-disabled persons) only if this test is satisfied.

The more that the design features of the vehicle cater for the disabled rather than those who can (but do not wish to) walk the more obvious it will be that the vehicle was designed specifically for such persons.  The golf cart is a good example of a vehicle which would not pass the test.  But where the line is to be drawn in any given case is a matter for the FtT based on the evidence and using its own expertise.  Unless it can be shown to have misdirected itself about the legal test to be applied or to have reached a decision which on the correct application of the test was not open to it on the facts then the Upper Tribunal had no jurisdiction to interfere: see Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 ss. 11 and 12. </p>

The weighing of the benefits and disadvantages of the vehicles to disabled and non-disabled persons is simply a means of assessing who they were designed and intended to be used by.  I am not clear what the Upper Tribunal means when it refers to their core structure.  But if the point is that they have four wheels, a seat and a platform on which to place one’s feet then, of course, it is right that they share design features with, say, a golf buggy.  But, unlike most golf buggies, they are designed for only one person; they are small and slow; and are designed to be used along pavements and in shops where access is limited and a tight-turning vehicle is important.

The Upper Tribunal (at [74] and [75]) has criticised the FtT’s assessment of the evidence on the basis that the disadvantages which they identified to non-disabled persons in the use of the scooters were not sufficient to justify a finding that they were designed solely for the disabled.  But I disagree.  They were all factors which the FtT could properly have regard to in assessing intended use.  The decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Invamed</span> makes it clear that use by the non-disabled is a factual possibility but was irrelevant unless the vehicle was designed for such use.  The fact that the Upper Tribunal may have disagreed with the weight to be given to various factors by the FtT does not make their assessment wrong in law. </p>
