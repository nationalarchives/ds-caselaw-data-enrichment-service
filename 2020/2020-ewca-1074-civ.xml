	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">This is an appeal from the order of Cavanagh J dated 12 March 2020. By that order, the judge held that the Office for Students (“OfS”) was entitled to refuse Bloomsbury’s application to be registered with the OfS. If Bloomsbury is not registered with the OfS, its courses cannot ordinarily be “designated”, its students cannot ordinarily obtain student loans and Bloomsbury will be unlikely to survive as a higher education provider.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Bloomsbury challenged the OfS’ decision by way of an application for judicial review on a large number of grounds before Cavanagh J, who rejected them all in a judgment of great clarity and thoroughness running to 343 paragraphs. On 21 May 2020, Lewison LJ granted Bloomsbury permission to appeal on three grounds only. The issues before us have accordingly been far more focussed than those which were aired at first instance. No complaint is made of the judge’s narrative of the background, and I adopt with gratitude much of what he said. </p>

In order to survive financially, APs need to be “designated” to enable their students to access student loans. Bloomsbury’s courses were first designated by the Secretary of State in 2010 or 2011. Bloomsbury received some positive appraisals in 2015, 2016 and 2017, but in February 2016 and August 2018 it was issued with “improvement notices” in relation to the continuation rates of its students, that is to say the percentage who proceed from year one of their courses to year two.  </p>

On 30 April 2018, Bloomsbury applied to the OfS for registration. OfS staff assessed Bloomsbury’s application.  On 19 November 2018 the OfS’ Provider Risk Committee (“PRC”) decided that Bloomsbury should be issued with an “intention to refuse registration letter”.  On 29 January 2019 the OfS issued its provisional decision to refuse registration.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">One of the most important conditions of registration laid down by the OfS (though it seems to me to be almost impossible for any institution to achieve in practice) is Condition B3, that of the institution “securing successful outcomes for all its students”. The OfS did not consider that Bloomsbury had performed sufficiently well in relation to two criteria or “indicators” relevant to Condition B3, namely continuation rates from year 1 to year 2 (“continuation rates”), and rates of progression to professional employment or post-graduate study (“progression rates”). The provisional decision letter contained an Annex explaining the OfS’ methodology. This stated that the OfS relied on three data indicators – continuation and completion rates, degree and other outcomes, and progression rates – and used “split metrics”<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>to assess performance within each indicator for students from different demographic groups. The Annex stated that each of the three data indicators was considered by reference to “baselines” which had been determined by the OfS for that indicator, but did not say what the baselines were.  </p>

The effect of the decision was that Bloomsbury could not take on any new UK students, unless they were wholly self-funded, and, as the judge put it, if the decision stands, “in all probability, Bloomsbury will have to close”.  </p>

Data is collected for the indicators set out in para 340 of the RF: continuation and completion rates, degree outcomes, and progression rates. The data is broken down by level of study (such as “first degree” or “PhD”); so, for example, an assessor will be able to examine continuation or progression rates for first-degree students. The data is then broken down by study mode (full-time or part-time), enabling the OfS to examine continuation or progression rates for full-time first-degree students and part-time first-degree students. The OfS will then apply one of the “initial baselines” – a series of percentage figures set out in a table in the DMG which indicate whether the indicator data is “of concern” or “of significant concern” (or “of no concern”). For example, a provider’s continuation rate would be of “significant concern” if the proportion of its full-time, first-degree students who continue their studies from year 1 to year 2 was 75% or less. </p>

Different baselines were set for part-time students, in some cases 15% below those for full-time students on the same type of course, but no different baselines were set for students, like those at Bloomsbury, who were on four-year courses which included a foundation year. The OfS’ explanation was that this was because the OfS did not want to tolerate poorer outcomes for foundation year students, and that data issues concerning the reporting of the outcomes of foundation year students would limit its confidence in the reliability of any baselines which it constructed.  </p>

Because the initial baselines were (in the words of the OfS’ witnesses) a means of “operationalising” the evaluative scheme set out in the RF, Ms Lapworth was entitled to formulate the DMG without approval by the Board. The baselines were matters of specific and technical detail which were suitable for being worked out by a member of the executive team rather than by a committee such as the PRC. As the handling of Bloomsbury’s case shows, final registration decisions still rested with the PRC and not Ms Lapworth: the DMG was thus not determinative of registration applications. <span style="font-style:italic">Whether the OfS failed to consult adequately on the DMG</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The judge rejected Bloomsbury’s contention that, by taking registration decisions using the DMG, the OfS adopted a very different approach to assessing Condition B3 from that which was foreshadowed in the RF consultation exercise and that, as a result, the OfS should have consulted on the DMG. The judge held that, firstly, the DMG’s use of “initial baselines” and “split indicators” to analyse performance was consistent with the approach set out in the RF. The DMG does not lay down that those metrics should be inflexible absolute values and states repeatedly that an assessor should look at the wider context in which a provider operates. Secondly, the consultation document did not suggest a “provider-specific approach”, whereby an OfS assessor would create a bespoke evaluation process for each provider. Rather, the consultation made clear that the OfS would not tolerate poor outcomes for students of any providers and that one of the RF’s primary objectives was to ensure positive outcomes for “all” students.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">The judge held, thirdly, that the DMG did not ignore the demographic make-up of a provider’s student body. The initial baselines were formulated generously and the OfS could also take into account the number of disadvantaged students at a provider at the third (“context”) stage of its analysis. Finally, although the initial baselines were not set out in the consultation document, this did not render the consultation process defective. The purpose of s 75(8) and s 5(5) of HERA was “not to require consultation on every granular detail of the assessment process that was carried out by the OfS”, but to consult “in broad terms about the Regulatory Framework and… about the Conditions that should be adopted”. It was therefore not necessary for the consultation document to say where the initial baselines for “significant concern” would be set. Consultees had sufficient information to make intelligent representations about the OfS’ approach to evaluation without such material. </p>

The RF said that the OfS would evaluate providers using data and contextual evidence; the DMG provided for this.

In her submission, <span style="font-style:italic">Lumba </span>is authority for the proposition that a policy should be published if it will inform discretionary decisions in respect of which the potential object of those decisions has a right to make representations. The right to know the content of the policy is therefore parasitic on the right to make representations; there is no general obligation on a public body to publish every policy which it applies. Where an internal guidance document does not depart from a published policy, and the published policy gives sufficient information to enable representations to be made, there is no duty to publish the internal guidance. Since the DMG did not set out a different approach to evaluating registration applications from the RF (which was published), the DMG did not have to be published.  </p>

The RF and RA 2 contained information which made providers aware that continuation and progression rates would be material to their application. Providers did not need to know the precise baselines in order to make meaningful representations, given that the baselines were not determinative of providers’ applications and, in any case, related to their historical performance. The OfS’ provisional decision of 29 January 2019 gave Bloomsbury further information about the OfS’ evaluative approach. Ms Carss-Frisk rejected any suggestion that this approach contravened the requirements of transparent regulation and submitted that there were good reasons for not publishing the DMG, such as not wanting providers to “game the system” by discontinuing lower performing courses for tactical reasons.  </p>

The OfS’ obligation to consult on the way in which compliance with Condition B3 would be assessed arose from HERA, the Regulatory Code and the common law. Sections 5 and 75 of HERA required the OfS to consult in respect of the RF, the guidance on the ongoing conditions of registration, and the initial and ongoing conditions of registration. Paragraphs 2.1, 3.2 and 3.3 of the Regulators’ Code required the OfS to engage with the organisations it regulates to develop regulatory policy and their approach to risk assessment. At common law, cases the courts have held that regulators such as the OfS may be obliged to communicate the methodology which they intend to use when evaluating the organisations that they regulate. Ms Simor submitted that the requirements of fairness are particularly exacting when the proposal in question involves the deprivation of an existing benefit: Bloomsbury was registered under the previous system, and had been so for many years. </p>

The OfS failed to discharge this obligation by not consulting on four particular policy choices: the use of the two-stage numerical test to determine compliance; the level at which the numerical thresholds would be set; the differences in thresholds which would be applied to part-time (rather than full-time) and “other undergraduate” (rather than first-degree) courses, in particular whether there should be a lower threshold for courses with a foundation year which had lower average sectoral results; and the factors which would be considered as “context”, for example whether demographic factors should be taken into account after the application of any threshold.  </p>

She submitted that the OfS discharged its duty by carrying out a single public consultation from October to December 2017, which covered both the proposed RF (as required by s 75 of HERA) and the initial and ongoing registration conditions (as required by s 5).

First, there was no such obligation under s 5(5), which required broad consultation on the design of the registration conditions, not the detail of how the OfS assesses compliance with the initial conditions. Secondly, there was no such obligation under s 75(8): that subsection required broad consultation on the RF and on the OfS’ general approach to registration conditions, not on what she described as the “detailed internal steps” which OfS assessors would take to reach an initial review on whether a condition was satisfied. Thirdly, the DMG did not need to be consulted upon because it did not depart from the detailed policy choices which were set out in the RF and included in the consultation. Fourthly, for the same reasons, the Regulators’ Code did not impose on the OfS any obligation to consult on the DMG.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Ms Simor submitted that the “demographic group threshold analysis” stage of evaluating registration applications is irrational for several reasons. First, it yields perverse results. As an example, if Provider A and Provider B both pass the numerical threshold test (and have similar levels of attainment), but Provider B has a concentration of students who fall within a demographic group that disproportionately lowers its attainment level, Provider A may pass the demographic analysis threshold when Provider B will not. Thus, for the purposes of the demographic group threshold, what matters is how low attainment is spread through the various demographic characteristics, not what the failure amounts to. In Ms Simor’s submission, the demographic group analysis obscures the role of other factors in student outcomes, such as their impecuniosity, level of previous education or age, and incentivises providers to take fewer disadvantaged students, because the more disadvantaged students a provider has, the more likely it is to fail.   </p>

She submitted that there were good reasons for using the demographic threshold analysis: as Cavanagh J found, it enabled OfS assessors to bring together all the rates into a single figure, providing a “sense check” and an overview of the provider’s performance. Ms CarssFrisk rejected the argument that the analysis yielded perverse results. She submitted that even if the demographic group threshold was irrational, it was immaterial to Bloomsbury’s registration application: the OfS considered the wider context in which the provider operated, including the broad demographic issues which Bloomsbury identified. </p>

The DMG was “considered and noted” by the PRC but was never approved by that committee, still less by the Board.

But I consider that the baseline decisions I have just summarised fall well on the policy side of the line and could not by any stretch of the imagination be described as merely operational. Such an interpretation of paragraph 13 of the Scheme of Delegation may not be from what Lord Reed in <span style="font-style:italic">Tesco </span>(alluding to the famous speech of Lord Atkin in <span style="font-style:italic">Liversidge v Anderson </span>[1942] AC 206) called the “world of Humpty Dumpty”, but it is not far off it.

Indeed, since paragraph 13 allows operational decisions to be cascaded down from level to level, the setting of baselines could on the same logic have been delegated by Ms Lapworth to the office junior.

No doubt this is true. But I do not think it of any assistance in determining whether the decision not to make special allowance for courses beginning with a foundation year was merely operational. It is not significant whether Mr Coleman or any other individual thinks now, or thought then, that the Scheme of Delegation permitted the formulation of the DMG to be entrusted to Ms Lapworth alone. On an objective interpretation of paragraph 13, it did not permit the baseline decisions to be delegated to Ms Lapworth. The claim therefore succeeds on Ground 1. </p>

As the Appellant’s skeleton argument suggests, the Board might have rejected the use of numerical thresholds to create a presumption of noncompliance; or it might have decided that the logic of applying lower numerical thresholds for part-time courses, which Ms Lapworth decided was appropriate, applied <span style="font-style:italic">a</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">fortiori</span> to foundation year courses. </p>

Unless there is a statutory specification as to the matters that are to be consulted upon, it is for the public body charged with performing the consultation to determine how it is to be carried out, including the manner and extent of the consultation, subject only to review by the court on conventional judicial review grounds.

The <span style="font-style:italic">Help Refugees </span>case itself concerned s 67 of the Immigration Act 2016 (better known as the “Dubs amendment”), which imposed on the Home Secretary a duty to make arrangements to relocate some unaccompanied refugee children who sought to enter the UK and provided in subsection (2) that “the number of children to be resettled shall be determined by the Government in consultation with local authorities”. The judicial review claim involved an all-out attack on the adequacy of that statutory consultation with local authorities. Similarly in <span style="font-style:italic">Baird</span> Sullivan LJ (sitting as a single judge of the Administrative Court) had been considering a claim that part of a non-statutory consultation about a local flood and erosion risk management strategy had been so “fatally flawed” that it should be started again.

The claimant had submitted that there was no support for this proposition in the authorities. In paragraphs 62 and 63 of my judgment, I said: "This difference between the parties is one of semantics rather than substance. A consultation exercise which is flawed in one or even in a number of respects is not necessarily so procedurally unfair as to be unlawful. With the benefit of hindsight it will always invariably be possible to suggest ways in which a consultation exercise might have been improved upon. That is most emphatically not the test. It must also be recognised that a decision maker will usually have a broad discretion as to how a consultation exercise should be carried out. This applies with particular force to a consultation with the whole of the adult population of the United Kingdom. The defendant had a very broad discretion as to how best to carry out such a far-reaching consultation exercise. In reality, a conclusion that a consultation exercise was unlawful on the ground of unfairness would be based upon a finding by the court not merely that something was wrong but that something went "clearly and radically" wrong." </p>

Secondly, it is directed principally at cases where a consultation exercise is under attack on such a broad front that it is alleged that the whole process is unlawful.

Having made that decision, she then set what she regarded as “somewhat generous baselines” which she thought “would take adequate account of demographic differences”.

That third stage requires the assessor to take into account “the context in which the provider operates, such as the type of provision it offers and its size”. It is apparent, however, that the intention of the Guidance is that such factors should primarily be taken into account at the first two stages, with only limited scope thereafter to consider arguments based on “context”. This was in fact how the Guidance was applied in practice, as appears from the minutes of the Provider Risk Committee meeting on 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2019 at which the decision to refuse Bloomsbury’s registration was made. At that meeting the Committee determined that “limited weight” should be given to arguments based on the characteristics of a provider’s student population or to arguments that some students withdrew from their courses for reasons outside the provider’s control because allowance was already made for such factors in the baselines which had been set. </p>

I agree that this is a particularly striking example of a policy decision, not least in view of the economic and other circumstances likely to affect students taking four year courses which have nothing to do with the quality of education provided and over which a provider has no control. In my judgment, however, the decision to use baselines more generally as the means by which demographic factors would be taken into account in assessing a provider’s performance, leaving only limited scope for consideration of the context of a particular provider, was itself an important policy decision. </p>
