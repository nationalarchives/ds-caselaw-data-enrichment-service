	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Rule 104 of the Competition Appeal Tribunal Rules 2015 (“the CAT rules”) provides that the Competition Appeals Tribunal (“the CAT”) may “at its discretion … make any order it thinks fit in relation to the payment of costs in respect of the whole or part of the proceedings”. It is common ground that this rule confers a discretion on the CAT. The question on this appeal is whether there is a starting point for the exercise of that discretion; and, if so, what it is.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The proceedings with which we are concerned arose out of an investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority (“the CMA”) into the pricing of an epilepsy drug called phenytoin sodium. By its decision of 7 December 2016, after an investigation lasting over three years, it found that Flynn and Pfizer had abused their dominant positions in the UK market for phenytoin sodium capsules under both domestic and EU competition law by charging excessive prices. It imposed a fine of £84.2 million on Pfizer and £5.2 million on Flynn.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Both Flynn and Pfizer appealed to the CAT. The CAT recognised in its substantive decision the “importance of this case for the public interest”: [2018] CAT 11 at [5]. After a four week trial, the CAT found that although Flynn and Pfizer held dominant positions in the market in question, the CMA had made errors in deciding that they had abused their positions. The CAT therefore set aside the penalties and remitted the question of abuse to the CMA for redetermination. The CMA’s subsequent appeal to this court in large part failed; but that court also recognised that the issues “were of considerable public importance”: [2020] EWCA Civ 339 at [15]. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Following its decision on the substantive appeal, the CAT considered the question of costs. In its ruling of 29 March 2019 ([2019] CAT 9) it held that the established practice of the CAT in appeals of this nature was that the starting point for the exercise of discretion was that the unsuccessful party should pay the successful party’s costs. I refer to this starting point as “costs follow the event”. It considered the decision of this court in <span style="font-style:italic">British Telecommunications plc v Office of Communications</span> (“<span style="font-style:italic">BT v Ofcom</span>”) [2018] EWCA Civ 2542, [2019] Bus LR 592, but decided that the decision in that case did not require a different starting point. From that starting point the CAT considered who had won and who had lost on the various main issues. Its ultimate ruling was that the CMA should pay a proportion of the costs of both Flynn and Pfizer. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The CMA challenge that conclusion. In the skeleton argument filed on their behalf, it was argued that  the starting point is that no order for costs should be made against a public body performing its functions in the public interest unless it has acted unreasonably. They described this as “the Principle” (with a capital P). The Principle may be displaced where rules of court or equivalent lay down a different starting point (such as the general rule in CPR Part 44.2 (2) (a) that the unsuccessful party pays the successful party’s costs). But there is nothing in the CAT rules which displaces the Principle. In the oral submissions presented by Sir James Eadie QC, the CMA adopted a more nuanced position. The principle for which the CMA now argues is </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">that in proceedings by or against a regulator in the exercise of its statutory functions, the default position (or starting point) is that no order for costs should be made against the regulator, except for good reason. The mere fact of an outcome adverse to the regulator is not, of itself, a good reason. But a good reason would include unreasonable conduct by or on behalf of the regulator, or financial hardship likely to be suffered by a successful party if no costs order is made. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The CMA has a range of powers which enable it to carry out an investigation where it has reasonable grounds to suspect an infringement of competition law. As Mr Brealey QC pointed out on behalf of Pfizer, those powers are extensive. They include power to enter business premises without a warrant, power to require the provision of documents or information, and power to interview persons. An investigation by the CMA into a suspected breach of competition law may be, and often is, protracted. As mentioned, in the present case the investigation took over three years. If, as a result of its investigations, the CMA is minded to find a breach of competition law, it must give notice to the persons likely to be affected, and give them an opportunity to make representations. Those representations may be (and usually are) followed up by a hearing which, Mr Brealey said, is to all intents and purposes akin to a trial (although this latter point was disputed by Sir James). This stage (referred to as the administrative phase) can be very expensive for the subjects of the investigation, requiring the engagement of both lawyers and expert economists, as well as the expenditure of management time; and any expenses they incur in the administrative phase cannot be recouped from the CMA, whatever the outcome of the investigation or an appeal to the CAT. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Once the CMA has decided that there has been a breach of competition law, it has a range of powers open to it. These include the making of directions designed to bring the anti-competitive conduct to an end. The CMA has power to apply to the court to enforce such directions. Section 36 of the Competition Act 1998 enables the CMA to impose financial penalties on undertakings if it is satisfied that the infringement of competition law has been committed intentionally or negligently by the undertaking. A decision by the CMA to this effect is an appealable decision, giving rise to a right of appeal to the CAT: Competition Act 1998 s 46. </p>

Because the appeal is an appeal “on the merits” rather than akin to judicial review, the CAT will often hear detailed evidence, both factual and expert. This may in some cases include evidence that was not considered by the CMA in arriving at its contested decision. The CAT may confirm or set aside the decision which is the subject of the appeal, or any part of it, and may: </p>

This statutory tribunal is entrusted with wide and important disciplinary responsibilities for the profession, and when deciding any application or complaint made to it, section 47(2) of the Solicitors Act 1974 undoubtedly vests it with a very wide costs discretion. An order that the Law Society itself should pay the costs of another party to disciplinary proceedings is neither prohibited nor expressly discouraged by section 47(2)(i). That said, however, it is selfevident that when the Law Society is addressing the question whether to investigate possible professional misconduct, or whether there is sufficient evidence to justify a formal complaint to the tribunal, the ambit of its responsibility is far greater than it would be for a litigant deciding whether to bring civil proceedings. Disciplinary proceedings supervise the proper discharge by solicitors of their professional obligations, and guard the public interest,… by ensuring that high professional standards are maintained, and, when necessary, vindicated. Although… it is true that the Law Society is not obliged to bring disciplinary proceedings, if it is to perform these functions and safeguard standards, the tribunal is dependent on the Law Society to bring properly justified complaints of professional misconduct to its attention. Accordingly, the Law Society has an independent obligation of its own to ensure that the tribunal is enabled to fulfil its statutory responsibilities. The exercise of this regulatory function places the Law Society in a wholly different position to that of a party to ordinary civil litigation.

Quite apart from authority, however, for the reasons given by Lord Bingham CJ I would respectfully endorse its application in licensing proceedings in the magistrates' court and the Crown Court. (2) For the same reasons, the principle is applicable to disciplinary proceedings before tribunals at first instance brought by public authorities acting in the public interest: see <span style="font-style:italic">Baxendale-Walker v Law Society</span>. (3) Whether the principle should be applied in other contexts will depend on the substantive legislative framework and the applicable procedural provisions. (4) The principle does not apply in proceedings to which the CPR apply. (5) <span style="font-style:italic">Where the principle applies, and the party opposing the order sought by the public authority has been successful, in relation to costs the starting point and default position is that no order should be made.</span> (6) A successful private party to proceedings to which the principle applies may none the less be awarded all or part of his costs if the conduct of the public authority in question justifies it. (7) Other facts relevant to the exercise of the discretion conferred by the applicable procedural rules may also justify an order for costs. It would not be sensible to try exhaustively to define such matters, and I do not propose to do so. </p>

It is clearly desirable that there are general guidelines, but it is equally important that any such guidelines are not too rigid. There is a difficult, if not unfamiliar, balance to be struck, namely between flexibility, so a court can make the order which is most appropriate to the facts of the particular case and the circumstances and behaviour of the particular parties, and certainty, so that parties can know where they are likely to stand in advance, and inconsistency between different courts is kept to a minimum.” </p>

The effect of the reasoning is that, just because a disciplinary body's functions have to be carried out before a tribunal with a power to order costs, it does not follow that there is a presumption that the tribunal ought to order the disciplinary body to pay the costs if it is unsuccessful, and that, when deciding what order to make, the tribunal should approach the question by reference to Lord Bingham CJ's three principles. It is hard to see why a different approach should apply to a regulatory or similar body carrying out its functions before a court—unless the rules of that court have any presumptive principle inconsistent with those principles, such as CPR r 44.3(2)(a).” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.00in;text-indent:0.00in">[59] In our view, the Director’s concerns over costs are better addressed by other means. The aim of the Tribunal’s case management procedures is to focus as early as possible on what the main issues are so as to avoid unnecessary escalation of costs. That aim is supported by the use of written procedure, sanctions against prolixity, control over the presentation of expert evidence, limits on oral hearings, and strict timetabling. Disclosure of documents, which is a major source of cost in traditional litigation, is minimised before the Tribunal. While it is, perhaps, inevitable that some cases before the Tribunal will be expensive, the Tribunal’s procedures are designed to save costs wherever possible. The Director did not have the advantage of that system under the former Restrictive Trade Practices Acts.” </p>

The difference between the two, in practical terms, is that the starting point is the default position. That must mean that there is some sort of burden cast on the unsuccessful party to move the CAT away from that starting point. Lord Bingham’s principle, in so far as it relates to the making of a costs order at all, has got lost. Subsequent cases in the CAT have also rejected the application of Lord Bingham’s principle in this category of case, and have adopted “costs follow the event” as a starting point. It is also pertinent, in my judgment, to observe that the suggested meeting of the regulator’s concerns by control of costs takes place (for the most part) as a matter of case management, which necessarily takes place before the outcome of the appeal is known. Costs control at that stage (which is now a feature of all litigation) is evenhanded as between the parties. It is difficult to see how that bears on the subsequent decision whether or not to make a costs order once the outcome of the appeal is known. In addition, the subsequent adoption by the CAT of “costs follow the event” as a starting point loses sight of Sir Christopher Bellamy’s observation that a general rule to the effect that losing appellants should normally be liable for the regulator’s costs, as well as their own, could tend to deter appeals. </p>

And although the OFT is a competition authority acting in the public interest, under the regime of the 1998 and 2002 Acts it does not bring proceedings before this Tribunal in order to obtain the imposition of a sanction. The OFT puts the allegations of infringement to the parties involved, receives submissions from them in response and then itself takes a decision as to whether an infringement occurred and, if so, whether to impose a penalty and what the amount of that penalty should be. Hays and Eden Brown are not entitled to recover, nor have they claimed, any of the no doubt significant costs of contesting these issues before the OFT at that administrative stage.

This approach aligns the present case with the starting point adopted by the Tribunal in most categories of case with which it deals, is consistent with the approach generally found in civil litigation, including, in particular, other public law cases, and provides ample flexibility to reach a just conclusion in each case. Using this starting point is justified in such cases as the present given that regulatory decisions of this kind often have very significant effects on the commercial interests of the regulated entity and sometimes also on the vital interests of other parties (as, for example, claimed by FAPL in the present case).

That is reinforced by the entirely general statement at [83], which deals compendiously with “a claim before the CAT” in which Ofcom (or the CMA) is acting purely in its regulatory capacity. The court had explained what it meant by “in its regulatory capacity” at [72]; namely that the regulator was acting solely in pursuit of its public duty and in the public interest. In other words, it was not acting in its own commercial interest. Both <span style="font-style:italic">Tesco</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Pay TV</span>, which followed <span style="font-style:italic">Eden Brown</span> in distinguishing different kinds of case brought before the CAT, were specifically disapproved.

The key point, as <span style="font-style:italic">BT v Ofcom</span> made clear (if it was not already clear), is that the regulator is acting purely in its regulatory capacity.

The fact that it has a large measure of operational freedom whether or not to pursue an investigation; and whether to impose a penalty (and if so how much) is not a relevant distinction.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">It is true that the CMA’s powers are extensive. The imposition of a financial penalty is a serious matter for an undertaking, as is the reputational damage likely to be occasioned by a finding of infringement. But I question whether, in context, that is of greater significance than the loss to a sole trader of a licence to carry on a trade at all, such as the refusal of the private hire licence to Mr Booth in <span style="font-style:italic">Bradford</span>. That, too, is a decision or sanction imposed by the regulator itself which must be challenged by the person aggrieved by the sanction. The SDT, which was under consideration in <span style="font-style:italic">Baxendale-Walker</span>, has power to strike a solicitor’s name from the roll and thereby permanently to deprive him or her of their professional livelihood. In that situation the sanction is imposed by the tribunal rather than the Law Society, which acts as prosecutor; but I cannot see that that is relevant distinction. I accept that an infringement of competition law is treated for many purposes as a breach of the criminal law, as this court held in the appeal against the CAT’s substantive decision: [2020] EWCA Civ 339 at [136]. But that, in my judgment, is only of tangential relevance to the question of costs.  It must not be forgotten that a corporate defendant (unlike an individual defendant) has no entitlement to costs in successfully defending a prosecution in the criminal courts: see Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 s 16A which limits the making of a defendant’s costs order to cases in which the defendant is an individual. So I do not find the quasi-criminal nature of a penalty a compelling analogy. </p>

This seems to me to be a feature of many forms of regulatory processes. I note that in <span style="font-style:italic">RBS Backhaul</span> at [60] the CAT referred to the “constant regulatory dialogue” and to the “costs of maintaining specialised regulatory and compliance departments, and taking specialised advice, [which] will not ordinarily be recoverable prior to proceedings.” Yet even so, the CAT’s approach in that case was that no order for costs should be made. Ms Bacon pointed out that those remarks were directed to a case involving a regulated industry. Competition infringement cases, by contrast, do not (or do not necessarily) involve regulated industries; and undertakings operating in unregulated industries (such as the construction industry) are not in such dialogue and do not maintain specialised regulatory departments.

If the starting point or default position were to be that no order for costs should be made against a regulator without good reason, the regulator would be encouraged to take every conceivable point: what was referred to as “kitchen sink” litigation. There is no doubt that the encouragement of discipline justifies “costs follow the event” as a starting point or general rule. Many distinguished judges have said so. But that applies to all forms of litigation, including litigation in which the starting point is that no order for costs should be made against a regulator.

That approach can, no doubt, include the degree of success or failure achieved by a party as one of the relevant factors as envisaged by rule 104 itself. It may also include consideration of what (if any) hardship would be suffered by a successful appellant if an order for costs was not made (which would not be a relevant consideration under the CPR). In considering hardship, the CAT could take into account, in an appropriate case, the level of irrecoverable costs that the successful party had borne in the administrative stage of the investigation. The conduct of the parties would also be a relevant consideration as the rule again envisages. It may be that if the CMA were to pursue a small or medium-sized enterprise as a test case, that would justify a departure from the starting point. But whatever approach is adopted the CAT must also put into the scales the fact that the CMA is a public body carrying out functions in the public interest; and that there is a public interest in encouraging public bodies to exercise their public function of making reasonable and sound decisions without fear of exposure to undue financial prejudice, if the decision is successfully challenged.  </p>

I have also considered the further considerations urged by both Mr Brealey and Ms Bacon; and I consider that they, too, are inadequate. The CAT found that the CMA had not acted unreasonably and could not be criticised for not accepting points made by Pfizer and Flynn. It also found that neither Pfizer nor Flynn had suffered financial hardship. In those circumstances I do not consider that any useful purpose would be served by remitting the case to the CAT. </p>

As he notes at [38], Lord Neuberger MR recognised in <span style="font-style:italic">Perinpanathan </span>at [75] that there were respectable arguments (a) for a presumption that the successful party should recover costs and (b) for saying that there is no such presumption and that, absent other factors, a successful party should only be able to recover costs where the actions of the public body (in that case, the police) were unreasonable or otherwise open to criticism. The courts of England and Wales have resolved this dilemma by the classic common law method of making a series of decisions, initially on a case-by-case basis, which have come to be recognised as establishing a general principle. Even if that process was not already complete by the time of <span style="font-style:italic">Perinpanathan</span>, the generality of the principle was clearly established by <span style="font-style:italic">BT v Ofcom</span>; and our decision reinforces it. In proceeding in this way, the courts have relied, as the common law always does, upon the experience and judgment of the judges involved, some of whom were very distinguished. It is fair to say, however, that the decisions have not been evidencebased, nor have the courts been able to take into account any wider considerations of policy than those discussed in the cases. In those circumstances there may be merit in the issue being considered by the Law Commission.   </p>
