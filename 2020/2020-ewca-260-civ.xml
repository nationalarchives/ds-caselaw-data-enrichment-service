	    <p style="margin-left:0.40in;margin-right:0.00in">The children had been wrongfully removed by their mother in late March 2018 when she secretly brought the children to England and Wales.  She and the father were engaged in legal proceedings in Germany by which he was seeking contact.  As set out in the judgment below, the mother “kept their whereabouts secret from the father, the German courts and other German authorities”.  The father did not discover that they were living here until December 2018.  He then commenced proceedings under the 1980 Convention which led to the precise location of the children being established in April 2019.  Regrettably, for a variety of reasons, the determination of the application has been excessively delayed. </p>

German youth and family services and child and adolescent psychiatric services became involved in and from 2014.  Although it is not entirely clear, their involvement appears principally to have been due to problems P was having at school.  He had been expelled from school in late 2014 and, for a period, was admitted to a child psychiatric ward for in-patient treatment.  He attended what is described, in the psychological report, as a “special school with an emphasis on emotional and social development” and received extra support through an organisation which “offers special support for the development of social competencies”. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.40in;margin-right:0.00in">In late 2016 the father applied to the German court for contact.  A contact guardian was appointed whose role appears to have been to support and, perhaps, supervise contact.  Contact was ordered and, as reported by the contact guardian, very positive contact took place including with the grandmother.  The court also ordered the psychological report, referred to above, to provide an expert opinion on what contact would be in the best interests of the children and on the parenting capacity of the mother.  The paternal grandmother and the mother’s husband were included in those seen by the author of the report. </p>

Its conclusion was that it was strongly in the interests of all of the children to have contact with the father and the paternal grandmother.  The report also records that P’s problems at school were said by him to have diminished significantly.

The mother had described “her current life situation with her husband and everyday family life [as] almost completely idealised”.  This idealisation was “copied by” P.   </p>

The courts in Germany were seised of the case for well over a year before M and the family came to the United Kingdom.  They are far better placed to deal with the welfare issues than the courts of this jurisdiction; those welfare issues may include where the children live, contact and perhaps also whether M should be permitted to relocate with the children from Germany to the United Kingdom.  The German social services were engaged with the family for a period measured in years and a family psychologist report was prepared in Germany.

It is hard to see how F, and the paternal grandmother, could achieve a successful reintroduction of contact from the distance of Germany in circumstances where M is resolutely opposed to contact.  Difficulty in pursuing legal proceedings from afar, together with difficulty in implementing and enforcing welfare decisions, may prove too much for F.” </p>

As set out in the Preamble, it is “to protect children internationally from the harmful effects of their wrongful removal or retention”.  In addition to seeking to discourage abductions generally, in specific cases this is achieved through the application of the structure and procedures established by the Convention which are designed and intended to “to ensure their prompt return to the State of their habitual residence”.  As noted by Lady Hale, the “two fundamental purposes of the Convention (are) to protect children from the harmful effects of international abduction and to secure that disputes about their future are determined in the state where they were habitually resident before the abduction”: <span style="font-style:italic">Re K (A Child) (Reunite International Child Abduction Centre intervening)</span> [2014] AC 1401, at [57].   </p>

This factor has a particular relevance to Convention proceedings.  The need for expedition is written into article 11.3 the Convention; and the aspiration, articulated in the same paragraph, for determination within six weeks of issue is, in the case of EU states, stiffened by article 11.3 of B2R, which positively requires determination within that period save in exceptional circumstances. </p>

The examples include, at (a) the case where a CAFCASS officer favours the grant; at (d) the case where the child's views cannot adequately be communicated by a report; and at (e) the case where an older child is opposing a proposed course of action.  The last example should not in my view be taken to endorse any routine grant of party status to older children objecting to their return to the requesting state in Convention proceedings.

Lady Hale made some general observations including, at [59], that “children should be heard far more frequently in Hague Convention cases than has been the practice hitherto”.  This was in part because it “is plainly not good enough to say that the abducting parent, with whom the child is living, can present the child’s views to the court”.  This was because, “If those views coincide with the views of the abducting parent, the court will either assume that they are not authentically the child’s own or give them little independent weight.  There has to be some means of conveying them to the court independently of the abducting parent”.   </p>

They are, as she said, “skilled and experienced in talking with children” and are “aware of the limited compass within which the child’s views are relevant in Hague Convention cases”.  As she also said at [60]: “Only in a few cases will full scale representation be necessary” adding that, “whenever it seems likely that the child's views and interests may not be properly presented to the court, and in particular where there are legal arguments which the adult parties are not putting forward, then the child should be separately represented”. </p>

The time which had elapsed since the children had been removed from Germany and the delays which had occurred in the determination of the application under the 1980 Convention diminished, and indeed negated, the significance of any further delay which would have been caused by P being joined.  Further he questioned the use by the judge of the word “nothing” being gained by separate representation when, he submitted, surely something would be gained. </p>

As I understood it, this was partly because the judge did not refer to these provisions or any authorities dealing with separate representation and partly because the factors set out, in particular in paragraphs 7.2(b), (c), (d) and (f), supported P being joined as a party.  Mr Devereux submitted that while P has many strengths and attributes, as an older child who objected “very strongly” and who had “particular needs and vulnerabilities”, it was in his best interests for him to be separately represented. </p>

He questioned whether the Cafcass officer’s evidence was sufficient in part because P’s views were based on matters which were “entirely different to the mother’s concerns” and/or did not coincide with the mother’s views.  The other “problem” on which he relied was that, because the mother was open to criticism, P’s views were at risk of being “tainted” by association with the mother.  Mr Devereux also referred to the fact that a full translation of the psychological report was not available when the Cafcass officer met the children and completed her report.  However, as he acknowledged, she had seen a full translation by the time she gave oral evidence. </p>

In his submission the judge’s analysis should have included the following but did not: the strength of P’s objections and his age and level of maturity; a proper consideration of the authenticity of P’s views; an analysis of the rationality of his objections; the length of time he had been in this country; the consequences of the mother not returning including the practical arrangements for the children.   </p>

He decided that the children’s views, including P’s, were “clearly presented through the report and oral evidence of the very experienced Cafcass officer”.  This was a decision which the judge was entitled to make and which, in my view, was right.  He also decided “nothing would be gained by separate representation”.  By this, the judge clearly meant that nothing sufficient would be gained to justify joining P.  He determined that he had the evidence <span style="font-style:italic">and</span> the arguments necessary properly to decide whether P’s objections meant that a return order should not be made.  Again, he was entitled to reach this conclusion and, in my view, was right to decide in the circumstances of this case that P’s interests were fully before the court and did not require or justify separate representation.  I would also note that Mr Devereux did not identify any additional matter which was not set out in the evidence before the judge.  It is, accordingly, clear that none of the circumstances set out in paragraph 7.2 of PD16A justified P being joined as a party. </p>

He was entitled to take into account the further delay that would be caused if P were joined as a party.  The judge was also able properly to take into account P’s age and his maturity and the nature and strength of his objections without him being joined as a party.  The fact that the reasons for his objecting to returning overlapped only in part with the matters relied on by the mother did not mean that his objections could not be properly conveyed through the Cafcass officer’s evidence.  Her evidence was clear that P “expressed his views with considerable force” and that “his expressed memories of Germany were wholly negative”.  Additionally, the background, including what Mr Devereux referred to as P’s “needs and vulnerabilities”, are analysed in detail in the psychologist’s report which, as Ms Jones submitted, provided a great deal of information to assist the judge in making his decision.   </p>

He was entitled to decide, for the reasons he gave, that the children’s situation would not be such that they should not be ordered to return.  The judge was entitled to decide that, with the protective measures referred to in the judgment, which included the involvement of the German courts, the broader welfare and other factors present in this case would still justify an order for P’s return to Germany.  </p>
