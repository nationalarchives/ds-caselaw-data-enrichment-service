	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The Strategy pointed out that the provision of sport and recreation facilities was not a statutory responsibility of the local authority and that the facilities which it provided were, therefore, a part of its discretionary provision, which needed “to be measured against their positive impact on [the council’s] priorities of health, regeneration, education, and future affordability”. It noted that, at present, the council provided ten leisure centres, which was more than any other Welsh local authority, and which took up over 70% of the council’s sport and leisure budget. However, these centres varied in quality, and many of them were old and in need of high levels of maintenance. The Strategy noted also that the budget for community and leisure services needed to achieve reductions over the course of the ten year period which it covered, and that the provision of leisure centres needed to be “rationalised”. It stated that: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.00in">“A rationalisation of facilities will result in 4 strategic, high quality, multi service leisure centres that are managed by the authority’s Sport and Leisure Service. The 4 strategic centres will be located in Risca, Caerphilly, and Newbridge, and one in Bargoed/Aberbargoed areas to serve the north of the county borough. It is therefore anticipated that the other leisure centres would either transfer to school management (if they are joint use facilities located on a school site, subject to governing body approval) or could close completely. Careful consideration will be given to opportunities for alternative provision before any facilities are withdrawn.” </p>

This was not to be one of the four strategic centres and was not a joint use facility located on a school site. One of the issues arising on this appeal is whether adoption of the Strategy amounted in effect to a firm decision to close the Pontllanfraith centre. In fact the council had already deferred a decision on its future pending the adoption of the Strategy. Once the Strategy had been adopted, the council commissioned a report on the centre which recommended closure. At a meeting on 10th April 2019 the council, once again acting </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In a claim for judicial review the appellant, a regular user of the centre who has campaigned against its closure, contended that both decisions, to adopt the Strategy and to close the Pontllanfraith centre, were unlawful. Swift J dismissed the claim so far as the decision to adopt the Strategy was concerned, but held that the decision to close the centre was unlawful for failure to comply with the public sector equality duty. In this appeal the appellant contends that the decision to adopt the Strategy was unlawful. There is no cross-appeal by the council so far as the decision to close the Pontllanfraith centre is concerned. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.00in">“9. The Council's description of the Sports Strategy is that it sets out the future purpose and direction for the provision of sport and active recreation in the County Borough, and establishes ‘… the key principles and vision over the next 10 years’. This description is accurate. On consideration of the document, it is clear that it is genuinely a strategy document. It identifies the Council's ‘vision’ to ‘encourage healthy lifestyles and support … residents to be more active more often’. It identifies the role of the Council's Community and Leisure Service as being to lead ‘the promotion of sport and active recreation’ and to co-ordinate the delivery of the Strategy. In this way the Sports Strategy signals the Council's intention to move from an approach which assumed that the Council would be the main provider of leisure facilities, and towards one resting on a mix of Council-provided facilities and facilities provided by others. The Sports Strategy next sets out how the Council's approach will fit with the ‘7 Wellbeing Goals’ listed in the Wellbeing of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015, and the Wellbeing Objectives in the Council's own corporate plan. While it would be wrong to describe these parts of the Sports Strategy as purely aspirational, it is certainly the case that the Strategy is not written in hard-edged or prescriptive language. Rather, the document describes a collection of ideas, principles and objectives. It is not a set of marching orders. In this same vein, the Sports Strategy states that the Council will, in respect of facilities, adopt the approach advocated by the Welsh Government and Sport Wales in their March 2016 document ‘Facilities for Future Generations’, including what is referred to as the ‘Decision-Making Matrix’ contained in that document to determine which leisure facilities are to be considered ‘strategic leisure facilities’ and are to be directly managed by the Council. Under the heading ‘What Needs to be Done’, the Sports Strategy sets out the Council's Corporate Policy; states that the facilities it will provide are to comprise four ‘strategic, high quality, multi-service leisure centres’ in Risca, Caerphilly, Newbridge and either the Bargoed area or the Aberbargoed area; states that a plan will be developed to enhance outdoor recreational spaces; develop a plan for swimming facilities; and will seek to collaborate with schools, community groups and clubs through a recreation outreach and intervention programme.” </p>

He submitted that, if adoption of the Strategy had any real purpose, it would result in expenditure on providing the four strategic leisure centres and closing or transferring others, either within the current financial year or, at any rate, within the period up to 2022 covered by the current capital expenditure plan. This was demonstrated by the fact that, within only a few months, the council incurred expenditure of £225,000 on a report on the closure of the Pontllanfraith centre and approved further expenditure of £550,000 on upgrading the Newbridge centre, which was one of the four chosen strategic centres, and that the cabinet decision on 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2019 to close the Pontllanfraith centre was made, at least in part, on the ground that it was not one of the four strategic centres and “to keep the leisure centre open would undermine the vision for future delivery set out in the Strategy”.

Nevertheless, the executive would not have the authority to adopt a strategy if that strategy was “concerned with” the authority’s budget or capital expenditure plan and its adoption was “contrary to, or not wholly in accordance with” that budget or plan. As any strategy is likely to have implications for future expenditure in the event that it is implemented, the structure of the table in Schedule 4 suggests that the expression “concerned with” in column 1 should be given a fairly narrow meaning, while “the authority’s budget” and “the plan or strategy for the time being approved or adopted by the authority in relation to their borrowing or capital expenditure” can only refer to an existing budget or plan, in this case the budget for the 2018-19 financial year and the capital expenditure plan for the financial years 2019-22. The structure and language of the table suggest also that it is only a firm decision involving the expenditure of money not provided for in the budget or capital expenditure plan which will fall within the responsibility of the full council, and that a decision which is merely likely (or even very likely) to lead to a future decision involving such expenditure will remain the responsibility of the executive. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.00in">“10. Mr Howells relies in particular on the part of the Sports Strategy that refers to the four proposed strategic leisure centres, to support his submission that the Strategy Decision was a ‘gateway decision’ which committed the Council to clear and prescribed courses of action. As such, he submitted, the Sports Strategy was a strategy for investment. Although he accepted that the Sports Strategy was not itself a mandate to close or redevelop any specific leisure facility, he contends that when the Sports Strategy was adopted a die was cast. In my view this is a significant over-reading of the Sport Strategy. The Strategy sets a direction – but only in generic terms. Any specific decision, for example to redevelop or close a leisure centre could not be taken by the Council simply on the basis that it was, in general terms, in-keeping with the Sports Strategy; rather, the specifics of any such proposal would have to be worked through in detail. Even by reference to the four strategic leisure centres, the Sports Strategy goes no further than saying that over a 10 year period these facilities should be provided. That is a policy objective rather than a hard-edged plan. The cost or other implications of that objective could significantly change over the 10 year life of the Strategy. Those matters are only capable of being distilled in specifics at such time as the Council chooses to make an operational decision. Put shortly, the Sports Strategy is a demonstration of intent; the way in which or the extent to which that intent becomes manifest in the course of the next 10 years is not set in stone.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.00in">11. I now turn to the second question posed at paragraph 6 above – was the discharge of the section 111 power, the decision to adopt the Sports Strategy, ‘concerned with’ the Council's budget, borrowing or capital expenditure? The words ‘concerned with’ have a flexible meaning. At one end of a scale, any decision that could, even indirectly, result in expenditure or borrowing might be said to be ‘concerned with’ those matters. Yet that would not be a realistic application of those words in the context in which they appear. How they are applied must be guided by the purpose of paragraph 2 of Schedule 4 to the 2007 Regulations, namely that decisions which are inconsistent with a relevant budget or borrowing or capital expenditure plan should only be taken by persons authorised under the Council's own executive arrangements to take decisions which have those consequences. Thus while the words ‘concerned with’ are to be applied taking good account of the specifics of the decision in hand, the focus should be on the direct consequences of the decision. Applied to the facts of this case, I do not consider it is correct to say that the Strategy Decision was a decision concerned with the Council's budget, borrowing or capital expenditure. Most obviously, the Strategy Decision was concerned with the Council's policy for sports and leisure provision over the period to 2029. It was not in the nature of the Sports Strategy – as I have described it above – that it was concerned with the Council's budget, borrowing or capital expenditure. The Sports Strategy contained no decision that committed the Council, as a matter of law, to specific expenditure, capital expenditure or borrowing. The fact that the Sports Strategy might be described as a plan that if implemented would inevitably entail expenditure of Council funds, is not to the point. Such spending decisions are yet to be taken; when proposals for development are put forward they will have to be assessed by the Council, on their own terms. (The Officer's Report for the Cabinet meeting on 14 November 2018 said as much at paragraph 7.1 – see below at paragraph 15 of this judgment).” </p>

My conclusion is that the Strategy Decision was not unlawful by reason of a failure to take account of the likely costs of implementing the Sports Strategy. The Strategy Decision did not commit the Council to any specific expenditure. As is apparent from paragraph 7.1 of the Officer's Report, a decision to adopt the Sports Strategy ran the risk of political embarrassment if over the 10 year period the Council lacked the resources to realise the Strategy. Yet in my view, that is an approach that the Council was entitled to take. Given that the Sports Strategy was set to endure for 10 years, it is equally reasonable to assume that anything approaching detailed costings would be either impossible or artificial given the difficulty of estimating now the cost of works that might not commence for 5, 7 or even 10 years.  </p>

Once the nature and substance of the Sports Strategy, as I have described it, is taken into account, it was not <span style="font-style:italic">Wednesbury</span> unlawful for the Council to adopt the Sports Strategy without information about the likely cost that its implementation might entail. Given that the Strategy Decision did not commit the Council to any specific programme of work, it was open to the Council to proceed on the basis that information about the cost of implementation was not a material consideration at that stage, and that such financial considerations would be addressed step by step as implementing plans came forward. This ran a political risk if implementation turned out not to be possible; but that is not a matter going to the legality of the decision.” </p>

He pointed to the figures which had been provided for the Caerphilly leisure centre set out above and submitted that equivalent estimates should have been provided for each of the other three proposed strategic centres, as well as estimates of the running costs for the four centres; the cabinet also needed information about the cost of closing other centres and the savings which would be achieved by doing so; such information could have been presented on a number of alternative bases to deal with the fact that implementation (and thus the incurring of expense and the achievement of savings) would take place over a ten year period. He submitted that unless an overall assessment was done when the Strategy was adopted, it would never be done as future decisions would be no more than the piecemeal implementation of the Strategy concerned with individual centres; and that without such an assessment it was impossible to say whether the stated objective of making savings in the budget would be achieved.

If, as I have concluded, the Strategy set out broad policy objectives to be implemented over a ten year period, but with implementation to be subject to later decisions for which detailed financial information would be provided at the time, it was not irrational for the cabinet to adopt the strategy without insisting on being provided with the information described by Mr Havers. In any event there were so many permutations, depending on the timing and nature of decisions about individual centres, and so many uncertainties about the way in which the Strategy would be implemented, that the value of any such estimates must be questionable. </p>

I note also that while the duty in England is to make arrangements to secure continuous improvement “in the way in which its functions are exercised”, the language of the Welsh measure is subtly different, being to make arrangements to secure continuous improvement “in the exercise of its functions”. It is hard to think, however, that this difference of language is intended to be a difference of substance. </p>

We must assume that the section was intended to be understood by councillors and council officials who would be responsible for complying with the duty, but exactly when it applies is not easy to discern. This is unfortunate because when the general duty applies, a specific obligation to consult in accordance with section 5 is triggered.  </p>

I do not say that the choice of whether, or to what extent, to outsource is the only such choice; but in the light of the legislative background outlined above the ‘ways’ in which functions can be performed must include whether they are performed directly by the authority itself or in partnership with others: indeed that would seem to be a paradigm of the kinds of choices with which section 3(1) is concerned. </p>

It may also be that the draftsman wanted to emphasise the need to build the fulfilment of the best value duty into authorities’ plans and procedures. Or perhaps it is just circumlocution.

It is not – for example, in the manner of the public sector equality duty under section 149(1) of the Equality Act 2010 – expressed in terms of an obligation to have regard to prescribed considerations whenever a decision is taken. Rather, it is an obligation to ‘make arrangements to secure continuous improvement in the exercise of functions’. This suggests that the section requires relevant authorities to put in place free-standing measures to improve decision-making processes by reference to the criteria listed at section 2(2) of the 2009 Measure. These arrangements are distinct from what a relevant authority might do in the exercise of its ordinary substantive functions; the section 2 arrangements are intended to improve the way in which those other functions are used. …  </p>

My conclusion is that neither the section 2 duty, nor the section 5 obligation to consult is a criterion for the legality of the Strategy Decision, because that decision was not in the manner of a decision to make improvement arrangements, and for that reason was not a decision within the scope of section 2 of the 2009 Measure.” </p>

I would not accept that section 2 is concerned only with measures which are intended to improve an authority’s decision making processes, although that is a good example of the kind of measure on which the section is primarily focused.

Rather, given the way in which the duty is formulated (both under the 1999 Act and under the 2009 Measure) the issue must be whether the decision taken was by its nature, a decision on the arrangements to be made by the authority to secure improvement in the exercise of its functions.

This is underlined by the various provisions directed to securing compliance with the improvement obligation. So far as concerns the 2009 Measure I have referred to them above; so far as concerns the 1999 Act, sections 10 – 15 of that Act establish a system for inspection of compliance and give the Secretary of State powers of direction in instances where there is a failure to comply with obligations under Part 1 of the 1999 Act. This structure is material since it displaces any incentive to construe or apply the obligations under section 3 of the 1999 Act or section 2 of the 2009 Measure as if they attach to all, or any class of, instances of decision-making.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It is unnecessary to decide whether it is permissible to have regard to the Guidance issued by the Welsh Ministers as this does not in my judgment shed any real light on the issue. I am doubtful, however, whether the Guidance is admissible as there is nothing in the Measure which requires the court to have regard to such Guidance and, in this case, the Guidance in question was produced some time after the passing of the Measure. </p>

While Mr Goudie accepted that there was no consultation satisfying the requirements of section 5, he did point out that the draft Strategy had been put out to consultation, and I have already referred to the difficulty of providing meaningful financial information as to the consequences of adopting the Strategy. It is questionable, therefore, whether it would be sensible to quash the decision to adopt the Strategy because such information was not provided. </p>
