	    <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0.03in">This appeal raises an issue about whether the judge was entitled to find that PN’s hearing before the First-tier Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) (“FTT”) was unfair.  The FTT hearing took place pursuant to the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Fast Track Procedure) Rules, known as the Detained Fast Track Rules (“the 2005 DFT Rules”), which have been declared in other proceedings to have been ultra vires, as appears from paragraphs 27 to 35 below.  There are also issues about the lawfulness of periods of PN’s detention. </p>

The judge found that PN’s appeal to the FTT had been unfair under the 2005 DFT Rules and that the period of PN’s detention between 6 August and 10 September 2013 was unlawful.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0.03in">Both PN and the Secretary of State appeal against the judgment.  PN seeks to set aside the findings of the judge that she was lawfully detained from 29 July to 6 August 2013 and from 10 September to 12 December 2013.  The Secretary of State seeks to set aside the judge’s finding that the Court had, on an earlier occasion, granted PN permission to apply for judicial review to quash the decision of the FTT.  The Secretary of State contends that even if PN was granted permission to apply for judicial review to quash the decision of the FTT, that decision should not have been quashed because in fact the proceedings before the FTT were fair to PN.  This also means that the consequential findings of unlawful detention should be set aside.  The Secretary of State also served a Respondent’s Notice in relation to the period of detention between 10 September 2013 and 12 December 2013, seeking to affirm the judge’s finding on the basis that the judge should have found that the proceedings before the FTT were fair. </p>

By the conclusion of the proceedings it was apparent that the following matters were in issue in the appeal: (1) whether PN had been granted permission by the Court to apply for judicial review of the FTT’s decision; (2) whether the judge was entitled to find that the proceedings before the FTT under the 2005 DFT Rules were unfair and should be quashed; (3) whether the period of detention from 29 July to 6 August 2013 was unlawful; and (4) whether the period of detention from 10 September to 12 December 2013 was unlawful.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0.03in">The factual background is taken from the findings made by the judge.  PN was born in July 1993 and is now aged 27 years.  She is a citizen of Uganda and lived there as she was growing up.  She claimed that she did not know who her mother was, and her father had died young.  She said she had been brought up by other members of her family and sexually abused and raped as a child.  PN said she had had lesbian relationships as she was growing up in Uganda.  It is common ground that lesbians are persecuted on the grounds of their sexual orientation in Uganda but the Secretary of State does not accept that PN is a lesbian. </p>

PN was accompanying a person who purported to be her father.  It appears to be common ground that the person accompanying PN was not her father.  It became apparent in the course of the FTT proceedings that the file relating to the grant of the entry visa had been destroyed.   On 25 February 2011, when she was still aged 17 years, PN’s visa expired and she became an overstayer. </p>

When she was arrested PN was in bed with a man, and the various explanations given for that fact became an issue in the asylum claim.  PN gave a false identity on arrest.  It was common ground that PN’s initial detention was lawful. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0.03in">At trial the first period of detention was analysed as being from 22 July to 6 August 2013.  On 22 July 2013 PN claimed asylum on the basis that she would be at risk of persecution if returned to Uganda on the basis of her sexuality as a lesbian.  On 25 July 2013 it was noted that referral to the Detained Fast Track (“DFT”) process was appropriate, but it was also recorded that if PN was not accepted within that process, temporary release would be considered.  Arrangements were made for PN’s screening interview, and on 28 July 2013 that interview took place.  After that screening interview, on 29 July 2013 the Secretary of State decided to progress PN’s asylum claim within the DFT.   On 31 July 2013 PN was allocated a solicitor.  On 5 August 2013 PN’s asylum interview took place.  PN’s solicitors requested an extension until 7 August 2013 to enable them to contact PN’s partner and refer the case to the Helen Bamber Foundation.  </p>

They also referred the case to the Helen Bamber Foundation.  On the same day the Secretary of State refused PN’s asylum claim.  The Secretary of State did not accept that PN was a lesbian.  The Secretary of State noted the absence of evidence of any of the relationships claimed by PN, various other matters were pointed out in PN’s account which were said to be implausible, and it was noted that PN had been found in bed with a man on arrest and had not given any proper explanation for that fact. </p>

PN was represented by counsel instructed by Duncan Lewis, solicitors.  The Secretary of State was represented by a Home Office Presenting Officer.  The visa information was not available, nor was further information from the immigration officers who had arrested PN on 21 July 2013.  At the FTT hearing PN gave evidence of her sexual experiences in Uganda and London.  She explained that she had been in bed with a man when she was arrested because he had helped her home the night before.  Although she had thought about having a baby, and had mentioned that in her interviews when asked about the man who had been in her bed when she was detained, she said she had not had sexual relations with the man, that she did not like men sexually, and was not thinking of using him as a sperm donor.  She had only mentioned this because she had thought that the immigration officers wanted an explanation.  The man found in PN’s bed gave evidence that PN had become drunk at a nightclub, the man had walked PN back home, and had fallen asleep on her bed.  They had not had sexual relations.  SM, a friend of PN, gave evidence that she had had samesex sexual relationships with PN on two occasions before losing PN’s contact details.  She had heard through others that PN had been arrested and had come to assist.  Another male friend gave evidence that he understood PN to be a lesbian.   </p>

PN claimed that her partner had paid for her to come to the UK because of concerns about her safety, but had not either accompanied her or taken steps to keep in contact.  PN claimed in evidence to have had three samesex sexual relationships in the UK, but in interview had claimed to have had only one.  The FTT Judge said that the one fact that was established, was that PN was arrested with a man, and had come up with an explanation about wanting a baby.

The affidavit confirmed the existence of those relationships, but also said that PN was married.  This was not PN’s case and was inconsistent with PN’s evidence.  It was suggested in submissions to this Court that there might have been a typographical error in the affidavit because Rose might have been referring to her own marriage.

In R(Detention Action) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2014] EWHC 2245 (Admin)  (“DA1”) the Administrative Court considered a challenge to the operation of the initial decision-making in the detained fast track.  It was held that part of the operation of the system up to the start of the appeal stage was unlawful.  There was a judgment on consequential orders in R(Detention Action) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2014] EWHC 2525 (Admin) (“DA2”).   The Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal about the relief granted in the consequential orders in R(Detention Action) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2014] EWCA Civ 1270 (“DA 3”).  In R(Detention Action) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2014] EWCA Civ 1634 (“DA4”) the Court of Appeal found that the policy concerning detention for the purposes of the DFT process had changed in 2008.  Before that date only those who satisfied the criteria in the Enforcement Instructions Guidance (“EIG”) were detained pending appeals.  After that date persons who were included in the DFT process were detained pending appeals to the FTT until their appeal rights were exhausted.  The change in policy was held to be unlawful because it lacked clarity and transparency and detention pending exhaustion of appeal rights was not justified in the light of the principles set out in R v Governor of Durham Prison, ex parte Hardial Singh [1984] 1 WLR 704. </p>

On appeal from Nicol J in R(Detention Action) v First-tier Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) [2015] EWCA Civ 840; [2015] 1 WLR 5341, the Court of Appeal upheld the finding that the 2014 Rules were systemically unfair.  This was because the period of seven days between the asylum decision and the appeal hearing in the FTT was bound to be insufficient in many cases for evidence to be found to corroborate the appellant’s account of the case.  Lord Dyson noted that “the time limits are so tight as to make it impossible for there to be a fair hearing of appeals in a significant number of cases”.  The 2014 Rules were quashed but the Court of Appeal did not set out what was to happen to cases determined under the 2014 Rules.  The President of the FTT decided that he would, on application, set aside those determinations, with the result that the appeals would be reheard as they had not, once the earlier decision had been set aside, yet been determined.   </p>

The finding that the 2005 DFT Rules were void did not mean that the proceedings in the FTT were themselves void, because the FTT Judge had power to act validly notwithstanding the invalid rules.  The same constitution of the Court (Sharp, Peter Jackson and Singh LJJ) sat as a Divisional Court in R(TN (Vietnam)) v First-tier Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) and another [2018] EWHC 3546; [2019] 1 WLR 2675 and in another judgment dated 19 December 2018 held that the FTT did not have power to set aside earlier determinations of the FTT under the rules then applicable.  It was held that applications to quash the decisions of the FTT had to be made in judicial review proceedings in the Administrative Court. </p>

The Court noted at paragraph 90 that whether the proceedings were in fact unfair and liable to be set aside would “depend on a careful assessment of the individual facts”. </p>

On the first issue, the judge addressed the scope of the grant of permission in paragraphs 59 to 62 of the judgment.  The judge held that the original grant of permission did not include the challenge to the FTT proceedings, because the claim form indicated that an application to set aside the FTT decision was being made to the FTT.  However the judgments of the Court of Appeal and Divisional Court in R(TN (Vietnam)) had made it clear that it was the High Court and not the FTT which had jurisdiction to set aside the FTT determination, and Supperstone J. had granted permission to amend the claim to reflect those judgments.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.48in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">The judge addressed the fairness of the proceedings before the FTT from paragraphs 63 to 77 of the judgment.  The judge stated that the specific unfairness relied on was the lack of sufficient opportunity under the 2005 DFT Rules to obtain evidence from Uganda to support PN’s case about her sexuality.  The judge considered that PN’s asylum claim necessarily involved obtaining evidence from external sources, including sources in Uganda. The DFT Rules did not provide sufficient time to enable such evidence to be obtained.  PN had provided further evidence relatively quickly after the appeal hearing and explained the difficulties that she had had in obtaining such evidence.  Although PN did not seek to adjourn the appeal hearing on the basis that she was seeking evidence from Uganda, the DFT Rules put her in an unfair position.  This was because if she had applied to adjourn on the basis that there was missing evidence, it would simply have highlighted the missing evidence in her case.

As to the first period of detention (from 22 July to 6 August 2013) the judge considered the first part of this first period (from 22 July to 29 July 2013) when the decision was taken to process the asylum claim in the DFT process after the screening interview.  The judge reviewed the documentation and found that the reviewing officer was entitled on 25 July 2013 to consider that PN might abscond.  Asylum was a bar to removal but if the claim was accepted in the DFT process detention was permissible.  The judge held that detention in the period to 29 July 2013 was justified for these reasons in paragraph 106 of the judgment. </p>

The judge therefore concluded that the Secretary of State acted lawfully in concluding that PN might be detained so that her application could be decided quickly using the asylum fast track procedures.  The judge specifically recorded in paragraph 116 of the judgment that it was in the asylum interview on 5 August 2013 that PN mentioned her lesbian relationships abroad, which then made the case unsuitable for inclusion within the DFT process.  That interview had finished at 1745 hours on 5 August 2013 and it was only after that time that the asylum claim became unsuitable for inclusion within the fast track process.   </p>

Further the judge held that from 6 August 2013 onwards it had become clear that PN could not lawfully be held in the DFT process because she was relying on the existence of foreign lesbian relationships to prove her case and more time was needed to prove that case.  This meant that from 6 August 2013 the detention became unlawful.  The judge held that although it was possible that PN might have been detained applying the general criteria in the EIG, he was not satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that she would have been detained.  This was because the contemporaneous notes made it clear that an assessment of detention would have needed to be carried out and it was not possible to know what conclusion would have been arrived at.  This meant that the claim for detention over this period would not be restricted to nominal damages. </p>

The judge concluded at paragraph 129 that “On the evidence before the defendant there were reasonable grounds for believing that she was someone to whom  removal directions could be issued”.  The judge said that the Secretary of State was entitled to conclude that detention complied with the EIG because PN now had no incentive to remain in contact with immigration authorities.  There were no other medical reasons suggesting that detention would be unlawful.  The judge held in paragraph 133 that “the fact that the determination of the  appeal is now to be quashed does not, in my judgment, render the decision to detain  unlawful. … there was no such apparent barrier to removal”.  The judge considered that the situation in PN’s case was akin to R(AB) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2017] EWCA Civ 59.  In R(AB) the Court of Appeal had held that a subsequent decision that the DFT process and FTT appeal was unlawful did not prevent the Secretary of State relying on the validity of the tribunal decisions.  The judge concluded that the decision in R(AB) provided strong support for the conclusion that detention pending removal was not unlawful.   </p>

The judge referred to the Court of Appeal’s judgment in R(DN (Rwanda)) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2018] EWCA Civ 273, [2019] QB 71 that the decision in Draga was binding.  He recorded that the Supreme Court had granted permission to appeal in R(DN (Rwanda)) and said that he found the decision in Draga to be of little assistance in resolving the present case.  The judge concluded at paragraph 141 that the Secretary of State was exercising powers for the purpose conferred by the relevant statutory provisions and had complied with relevant policy and common law principles in Hardial Singh.  The judge ordered the Secretary of State to use best endeavours to facilitate the return of PN to the United Kingdom.  </p>

It was not particularly surprising that when the procedural route became clear, PN claimed in the Administrative Court to set aside the determination of the FTT.  In my judgment there is nothing in the relevant background, context and purpose of the order to give the words used in the order a different meaning to that which appears on an ordinary reading of them.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.48in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">Although, as the judge held and I agree, PN did have permission under the order of the Administrative Court dated 6 February 2019 to amend her claim to challenge the decision of the FTT dated 30 August 2013, it was very unfortunate that the court was asked to permit the amendment without being provided with draft amended grounds of claim by PN’s legal team.  There was no good reason for the failure, and I should make it clear that neither Mr Buttler nor Duncan Lewis solicitors were at that stage representing PN.  Those representing the Secretary of State should have pointed out the failure to Supperstone J., and I should make it clear that neither Mr Tam nor Ms Barnes were at that stage representing the Secretary of State.  If the draft amended grounds had been produced, there would have been clarity about what amendments were being permitted.  The parties would also have appreciated that the FTT should be joined to the claim because the FTT decision was now a formal target in the claim.  As it is no one has suggested that the failure to join the FTT makes the amendment a nullity, and it has not been suggested that the FTT would have either participated in the proceedings or had different points to raise.  This Court in Fayad v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2018] EWCA Civ 54 emphasised at paragraphs 48 and 56 the importance of pleading and particularising claims in judicial review.  Proposed amendments to claims should receive the same care and attention. </p>

First, although complaint was made by the Secretary of State in her detailed grounds of defence about the amendment, the detailed grounds of defence proceeded on the basis that permission had not been given, and it could all be addressed on a “rolled up” basis at the hearing of the claim for judicial review.  This was not a satisfactory approach to take because it did not deal with the possibility that the order, properly construed, permitted the amendment.   </p>

Proceedings should be brought promptly and in any event not later than three months after the grounds to make the claim first arose.  The way in which the challenges in this case were permitted by both sides to develop meant that the Court did not have an opportunity to consider the question of delay or the effect of the earlier judicial review proceedings brought by PN when deciding whether to grant permission to apply in this case.  If the Court had had such an opportunity, account could have been taken of the fact that PN had commenced three claims for judicial review before her removal on 10 December 2013.  In any of those proceedings it would have been open to PN to challenge the fairness of the FTT proceedings, but she had not done so.   </p>

Mr Tam pointed out that: an application had been made to adjourn the FTT proceedings on behalf of PN; an adjournment had been granted albeit for other reasons; and the FTT Judge had specifically addressed whether the proceedings were fair and had found them to be fair.  Mr Tam also relied on the fact that when the Secretary of State had refused to treat the evidence from Rose as amounting to a fresh claim, Jeremy Baker J. had refused permission to apply for judicial review to challenge that decision.  This meant, Mr Tam said, that obtaining the evidence from Rose could not have affected the fairness of the proceedings before the FTT.  Mr Buttler submitted that there were well-known difficulties in obtaining evidence to prove sexual orientation, and that those difficulties were very substantially increased when an individual was in detention.  He submitted that if PN had been required to ask for an adjournment it would only have highlighted the deficiencies in PN’s case at that point, and the decision by Jeremy Baker J. was made against the background of a finding of adverse credibility made by the FTT Judge which might not have been made if the evidence of Rose was available.  Mr Buttler also noted that the judge had made a finding of fact that the proceedings were unfair and there was no basis for this court to set it aside. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.48in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.5in">In this case the judge considered that the proceedings were made unfair because of the effect of the 2005 DFT Rules.  This was because PN did not have the opportunity to obtain the evidence from Rose.  Rose’s evidence came too late to assist in the proceedings before the FTT.  This was a judgment made on the particular facts in this case by the judge and I can see no basis for interfering with that finding.  The judge had legitimate and proper grounds for reaching his decision because there was an affidavit from Rose which was not before the FTT Judge but which became available shortly after the proceedings in the FTT.  It is right that no application was made to adjourn so that the evidence from Rose could be located and adduced.  However, as Lord Dyson MR noted in R(Detention Action) [2015] 1 WLR 5341, the effect of the DFT process was that it put the advocate into an unfair dilemma, namely whether to seek an adjournment and highlight difficulties with a case or to do the best on the material available.  Although the FTT Judge did consider whether the proceedings were fair, that evaluation was carried out without the benefit of knowing that efforts to trace Rose were being made, and that those efforts would result in Rose providing an affidavit.  Similarly Jeremy Baker J. was evaluating whether Rose’s affidavit should have been treated as fresh evidence against a finding of adverse credibility against PN.  The ruling by Jeremy Baker J. was not addressing the question whether the finding of adverse credibility was unfair because of the effect of the 2005 DFT Rules. </p>

However if it is apparent that Rose’s evidence could not have contributed to the proceedings in the FTT, for example because she could not be located or could give no relevant evidence, then there would be no basis to impugn the fairness of the proceedings.  In this respect I have considered whether that part of Rose’s affidavit which stated that PN was married, in circumstances where it was common ground that PN was not married, meant that the whole affidavit should have been discounted.  I accept that there might be an innocent explanation for this apparent inconsistency, and I am unable to say that such an explanation would, if accepted, mean that PN’s case was bound to fail so that the fairness of the proceedings would not be affected.   </p>

This was because PN had been validly detained after being located by immigration officers, there was considered to be risk of absconding which justified her detention, and at that stage PN had not been detained for the purposes of the DFT process, and so any unlawfulness in the 2005 DFT Rules and the unfairness of the FTT proceedings, could not have affected the decision to detain.

The 2005 DFT Rules have been held to be unlawful because they were systemically unfair, and although not all proceedings under the 2005 DFT Rules would be unfair, these proceedings were unfair.  There was therefore no lawful basis to detain PN.  It might be noted that this was not the way in which PN’s case was put before the judge below, but I accept that this raises an issue of law only and the burden has always been on the Secretary of State to justify the detention so it is necessary for this Court to determine the point. </p>

This means, in the immigration law context, that the unlawful policy has been applied by or taken into account by the decision-maker, see paragraphs 63 and 68 of R(Lumba).  If the unlawful policy did not affect the decision to detain, its unlawful nature will not affect the lawfulness of the detention.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0.03in">There was some discussion in the submissions before this Court about whether a second administrative act will be wrongful if the first administrative act is unlawful.  This has sometimes been termed “the second actor theory” and Mr Tam relied on the judgment in Percy v Hall [1997] QB 924.  In Percy v Hall  the Court of Appeal held that byelaws, which prevented access to Ministry of Defence land, were valid. The Court went on to consider whether arrests for infringing the bye-laws would have been lawful if the bye-laws were invalid.  The Military Lands Act 1892, as amended by the Criminal Justice Act 1982, provided a power of arrest “if any person commits an offence against any byelaw”.  The Court in Percy v Hall considered the construction of various statutes incorporating a power of arrest, including the Town Police Clauses Act 1847, where the Courts had interpreted constables’ powers of arrest for offences to include a power of arrest for persons that they honestly (but mistakenly) believed had committed an offence.  This was on the basis that Parliament must have intended to protect a constable in such circumstances.  The Court held that even if the bye-laws had been invalid, the arrests of trespassers by MOD police officers would have been lawful because they could show that they had a reasonable belief that the claimants were committing an offence.  Percy v Hall is therefore a decision on the proper statutory interpretation of the powers of arrest contained in the Military Lands Act 1892.  The decision does not justify finding detention to be lawful where the detention has been carried out pursuant to an unlawful policy. </p>

The effect of those cases was that where there was a statutory scheme provided by appeals to the FTT to determine whether the Secretary of State was acting lawfully, later decisions taken in reliance of a decision of the FTT could not be impugned.  However in R(DN (Rwanda)) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2020] UKSC 7; [2020] 2 WLR 611 the Supreme Court overruled the decision of the Court of Appeal in Draga.  In R(DN) Lord Carnwath made obiter statements to the effect that the answer might have been provided by the doctrines of res iudicata and issue estoppel. </p>

I would not allow any reservation on these matters.  If res iudicata and issue estoppel provide an answer to this appeal, the matter should be argued when relevant at the hearing of the appeal, and not reserved for some future hearing.  Any other approach will delay proceedings and increase costs.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0.03in">I agree that it was the need to locate Rose which made the shortened time limits in the DFT process unfair.  As Lord Dyson made clear in R(Lumba) at paragraph 64 when rejecting submissions made on behalf of the Secretary of State to the effect that the Court was expanding the tort of false imprisonment beyond its proper bounds, it “is not every breach of public law that is sufficient to give rise to a cause of action in false imprisonment”.  It is right that the 2005 DFT Rules were a nullity, but in R(TN (Vietnam)) it was held that this did not mean that all proceedings under the 2005 DFT Rules were unfair.  It is also right to say that the FTT proceedings involving PN were unfair and have been quashed.  However that unfairness arose only when it became apparent that there was a need to obtain evidence from abroad.  On the judge’s findings that need had not arisen until the asylum interview took place on 5 August 2013.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0.03in">In those circumstances the continued exercise of the statutory powers to detain up to 6 August 2013 was lawful.  This is because the statutory powers were being exercised for a purpose, namely detention in the fast track process in relation to potential FTT proceedings, pursuant to the unlawful 2005 DFT Rules, that were still at that stage fair.  This meant that the FTT proceedings had not yet become unlawful.  In my judgment the judge was therefore right to find that the second part of the first period of detention, namely from 29 July 2013 to 6 August 2013, was lawful.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0.03in">In my judgment the public law failures in this case, being the unlawful 2005 DFT Rules and the unfair FTT proceedings which were quashed by the judge, were relevant to and bore upon the decision to detain PN after 10 September 2013.  This was because PN was being detained following the conclusion of the FTT proceedings which have been quashed.  In those circumstances the detention from 10 September 2013 to 12 December 2013 was unlawful because, properly analysed, there had been no determination in the FTT and it would not be possible to complete such a determination within a reasonable period of time.  Further, there is no basis for finding that absent the public law error PN would have been detained, so issues of nominal damages do not arise in relation to this third period of detention.  As a matter of fairness to the judge it might be noted that his reasoning was influenced by the decision in R(AB) which was itself based on Draga, which has now been overruled by the Supreme Court in R(DN).  </p>
