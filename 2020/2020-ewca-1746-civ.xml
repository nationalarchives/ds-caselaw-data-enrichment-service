	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">It is convenient to note at the start that the question whether a person is a victim of human trafficking may arise in other contexts besides eligibility for support under the NRM.  In particular, it may arise in the context of immigration: victims of trafficking do not as such acquire any right to leave to remain under domestic legislation or the Immigration Rules, but the circumstances surrounding their trafficking may, depending on the facts of the particular case, mean that they are entitled to leave to remain as a refugee or by way of humanitarian protection.  Accordingly decisions on whether a person is, in substance, a victim of trafficking may be taken in the context of immigration appeals.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="2">

She was referred to the NRM.  The CA made a reasonable grounds decision in her favour on 21 March 2013.  On 7 August 2017, four years later, the CA made a conclusive grounds decision that MN was not a victim of trafficking.  During the interval between the two decisions her asylum claim was refused.  An appeal to the First-tier Tribunal (“the FTT”) was unsuccessful.  On 12 October 2017 MN began proceedings for judicial review of the CA’s decision.

She says that in fact she came not primarily as a student but because she was trafficked and that on her arrival she was expected to become a prostitute.  After, on her account, escaping from her traffickers she agreed to marry an EU national, but the marriage was prevented by the immigration authorities; and on 9 April 2014 she was convicted of an offence of conspiracy in relation to the proposed marriage and sentenced to two years’ imprisonment.  Following her sentence she was served with notice of liability to automatic deportation.  She made an asylum claim.  Her application was refused.  In the context of her appeal to the FTT (which was eventually unsuccessful) she gave an account of her history which led to her being referred to the NRM in June 2015.

Shortly before the hearing of the appeal Anti-Slavery International made an application to rely on a witness statement from Kate Roberts, who is their UK &amp; Europe Manager.  The Secretary of State objected to its admission.  In our judgment she was entitled to do so.  The first problem about the evidence is that it is being sought to be introduced for the first time in this Court, and by an intervener who was not even a party below.  That might not in itself be fatal: when this Court is considering an appeal which raises issues of general import it will sometimes be willing to admit for the first time evidence which explains uncontentious background or contextual matters.  But Ms Roberts’ witness statement contains extensive passages which include statements of fact and opinion about such matters as the way in which CAs acquire evidence and make their decisions and about the quality of the decisions made.  That evidence is self-evidently contentious, and it should have been apparent to those advising Ms Roberts that it would be impossible for this Court, on an appeal and without evidence from the Secretary of State, to make any assessment of the extent to which it is reliable.  In fairness to Ms Roberts we should acknowledge that her statement is evidently the product of considerable work and based on deep experience and sincere concerns, and there are other parts of it which are uncontentious and potentially useful.

Article 10 seeks to allow such identification so that victims can be given the benefit of the measures provided for in Chapter III. Identification of victims is crucial, is often tricky and necessitates detailed enquiries. Failure to identify a trafficking victim correctly will probably mean that victim’s continuing to be denied his or her fundamental rights and the prosecution to be denied the necessary witness in criminal proceedings to gain a conviction of the perpetrator for trafficking in human beings. Through the identification process, competent authorities seek and evaluate different circumstances, according to which they can consider a person to be a victim of trafficking.  </p>

Paragraph 1 places obligations on Parties so as to make it possible to identify victims and, in appropriate cases, issue residence permits in the manner laid down in Article 14 of the Convention. Paragraph 1 addresses the fact that national authorities are often insufficiently aware of the problem of trafficking in human beings. Victims frequently have their passports or identity documents taken away from them or destroyed by the traffickers. In such cases they risk being treated primarily as illegal immigrants, prostitutes or illegal workers and being punished or returned to their countries without being given any help. To avoid that, Article 10, paragraph 1, requires that Parties provide their competent authorities with persons who are trained and qualified in preventing and combating trafficking in human beings and in identifying and helping victims, including children, and that they ensure that those authorities cooperate with one other as well as with relevant support organisations.  </p>

Identifying a trafficking victim is a process which takes time. It may require an exchange of information with other countries or Parties or with victim-support organisations, and this may well lengthen the identification process. Many victims, however, are illegally present in the country where they are being exploited. Paragraph 2 seeks to avoid their being immediately removed from the country before they can be identified as victims. Chapter III of the Convention secures various rights to people who are victims of trafficking in human beings. Those rights would be purely theoretical and illusory if such people were removed from the country before identification as victims was possible.  </p>

As for paragraph 2, the language of “tak[ing] due account” of the victim’s safety and protection needs is rather awkward, but its intended effect is plainly that the victim should be afforded protection against further exploitation, in particular from their traffickers: this is made clear in para. 164 of the Explanatory Report.  In <span style="font-style:italic">Atamewan</span> Aikens LJ treated paragraph 2 as ancillary to paragraph 1 (see para. 73 of his judgment).

The Convention contains a provision requiring Parties to provide in their internal law for this period to last at least 30 days. This minimum period constitutes an important guarantee for victims and serves a number of purposes.  One of the purposes of this period is to allow victims to recover and escape the influence of traffickers.  Victims recovery implies, for example, healing of the wounds and recovery from the physical assault which they have suffered.  That also implies that they have recovered a minimum of psychological stability.  Paragraph 3 of Article 13 allows Parties not to observe this period if grounds of public order prevent it or if it is found that victim status is being claimed improperly.  This provision aims to guarantee that victims’ status will not be illegitimately used.  </p>

By this is meant that victims must decide whether they will cooperate with the law-enforcement authorities in a prosecution of the traffickers.  From that standpoint, the period is likely to make the victim a better witness: statements from victims wishing to give evidence to the authorities may well be unreliable if they are still in a state of shock from their ordeal.  ‘Informed decision’ means that the victim must be in a reasonably calm frame of mind and know about the protection and assistance measures available and the possible judicial proceedings against the traffickers. Such a decision requires that the victim no longer be under the traffickers’ influence.” </p>

Most if not all member states of the EU are parties to ECAT, and it is referred to in recital (9) as a “crucial step in the process of enhancing international cooperation against trafficking in human beings”.  Further, all member states are parties to the ECHR, which, as we have seen, had by 2011 been interpreted by the ECtHR as in practice giving effect to the provisions of ECAT.  That being so, it is unsurprising that the provisions of the Directive bear a close resemblance to those of ECAT and in some respects directly reproduce them.  In </p>

A person should be provided with assistance and support as soon as there is a reasonable-grounds indication for believing that he or she might have been trafficked and irrespective of his or her willingness to act as a witness. In cases where the victim does not reside lawfully in the Member State concerned, assistance and support should be provided unconditionally at least during the reflection period.

Where necessary, assistance and support should continue for an appropriate period after the criminal proceedings have ended, for example if medical treatment is ongoing due to the severe physical or psychological consequences of the crime, or if the victim’s safety is at risk due to the victim’s statements in those criminal proceedings.” </p>

As regards the other provisions of Chapter III, the Directive contains no equivalent to article 13 (recovery and reflection period) or article 14 (residence permits), but similar (though possibly more limited) rights are accorded by the 2004 Directive.

Paragraph 1 requires the provision of support by reference to the existence of criminal proceedings whereas the paragraph 2 duty arises where there are reasonable grounds to believe that the person in question is a victim of trafficking.  It may be arguable that that is a distinction without a difference, since if there are reasonable grounds to believe that a person is a victim of the crime of trafficking it must be contemplated, at least until there has been some investigation, that there will be criminal proceedings, and the duty under paragraph 1 arises “before” criminal proceedings, not just once they have started.  It is unnecessary to decide whether that argument is correct: even if the paragraph 1 duty may not always arise in parallel with the paragraph 2 duty, that has no consequences because the content of the two duties is identical.  We suspect, however, that the drafters of the Directive did not focus on this question but, rather, provided for two distinct duties in order to acknowledge that support for victims is required not only in order to encourage their co-operation in any investigation and prosecution (which had been the sole focus of the 2004 Directive) but also for its own sake, which is clearly the policy of ECAT.   </p>

As for what is meant by an “appropriate period” after the conclusion of proceedings, that does not arise on these appeals.  However, it seems clear that the intention is that what is appropriate will have to be judged in the circumstances of a particular case: there is some limited guidance at the end of recital (18).</p>

The provisions which are most relevant for our purposes (and in particular article 11) were not transposed into UK legislation.  The reasons for this were not explored before us, but presumably it was not thought that the Directive added anything substantial to what was already required under ECAT, which had already been incorporated in the domestic regime described below.

We cannot read the relevant provisions in that way.  What article 10 expressly provides for is a single identification process leading to a definitive decision which then attracts the substantive rights provided for in Chapter III.  The purpose of the first stage is simply to ensure that persons who may in due course be identified as victims of trafficking are not removed, and are assisted with their essential needs, pending that decision.   That is in our view the only natural reading of, in particular, article 10.2: the first sentence provides for the identification process, and the second provides for certain minimum rights “until the identification process … is completed”.  That view is reinforced by the relevant passages in the Explanatory Report: see in particular paras. 132 (“<span style="font-style:italic">until</span> completion of the identification process establishes conclusively whether or not they are victims of trafficking”) and 135 (“the benefit, <span style="font-style:italic">during the identification process</span>, of the assistance measures provided for …”).   </p>

We do not believe that that means that ECAT has to be interpreted as requiring the continuation of support (including protection) in such a case.  No system can protect against all risk; and it seems to us understandable that the parties to ECAT should have chosen to draw the line at the point of a definitive decision taken, after proper investigation, by people who are (as article 10 (1) requires) “trained and qualified in preventing and combating trafficking in human beings”.

That may not be a complete distinction because the protective element in the provisions of Chapter III is likewise addressed to future risk, necessarily assessed on the basis that the account of past trafficking is true.  Nevertheless, the risk of a victim of trafficking coming back under the influence of his or her traffickers, particularly after a protected recovery and reflection period, is not to be compared with the risk to a victim of persecution if they are returned to their country of origin.

He referred, for example, to article 11, which requires states to protect “the private life and identity of victims” and to article 15, which requires that “victims” be given access to information about relevant administrative judicial and administrative proceedings “as from their first contact with the competent authorities”.  But we can see no significance in this.  It simply means that in contexts where it was evident that reference was required to potential as well as established victims the drafter used the term to cover both: that might be somewhat loose by domestic standards but it is entirely understandable.   </p>

The position may be a little more complicated than that, but we are prepared to proceed on the basis that he is right.   But that does not advance the argument.

We can see no sign that that is the case.  On the contrary, as shown at para. 63 above, the provisions of the 2011 Directive (read with the 2004 Directive) in all essential respects reflect those of Chapter III.  We accept that the distinction between rights to be accorded when there are first reasonable grounds to believe that a person is a victim of trafficking and rights to be accorded at the completion of the identification process is not explicit in article 11 itself; but it is clear from the italicised passage in recital (18), notwithstanding the confusion about what rights are being referred to.          </p>

It is important to distinguish between cases where an expert is saying no more than that the signs found and/or symptoms reported are consistent with the treatment recounted by the applicant – “mere consistency” cases – and cases where they what they are saying is that they are positively supportive of it.  Even if the witness does not use the Istanbul categories, the intended meaning will usually be sufficiently clear from the context.  This needs to be borne in mind both when considering the report of an expert in a particular case and when considering the caselaw. </p>

The appellant claimed to have been tortured by the authorities in the DRC.  He relied on medical evidence reporting very extensive scarring.  The doctor expressed the opinion that the appellant’s account was supported by two points.  First, the scarring was “consistent with” his account of torture: some of the tortures were of very particular kinds, corresponding to the scarring found, and it is clear that the doctor was using the language of “consistency” in a way that corresponds to the Istanbul terminology of “highly consistent”.  Secondly, she expressed the opinion that the veracity of his account was supported by the fact that he had himself told her to ignore certain particular scars which he said had a different cause and by what she judged to be his genuine distress in describing the torture.  The adjudicator attached no weight to her evidence and that decision was upheld by the IAT.   </p>

Just as, if I may take a banal if alliterative example, one cannot make a cake with only one ingredient, so also frequently one cannot make a case, in the sense of establishing its truth, otherwise than by combination of a number of pieces of evidence. Mr Tam, on behalf of the Secretary of State, argues that decisions as to the credibility of an account are to be taken by the judicial fact-finder and that, in their reports, experts, whether in relation to medical matters or in relation to in-country circumstances, cannot usurp the factfinder's function in assessing credibility. I agree. What, however, they can offer, is a factual context in which it may be necessary for the fact-finder to survey the allegations placed before him; and such context may prove a crucial aid to the decision whether or not to accept the truth of them.  What the fact-finder does at his peril is to reach a conclusion by reference only to the Appellant’s evidence and then, if it be negative, to ask whether the conclusion should be shifted by the expert evidence.”   </p>

A particular difficulty arises in the contention that a report should be seen as corroborating the evidence of an applicant for protection. A doctor does not usually assess the credibility of an applicant; it is not usually appropriate for him to do so in respect of a patient or client. That is in any event the task of the fact-finder who will have often more material than the doctor, and will have heard the evidence tested. So for very good and understandable reasons the medical report will nearly always accept at face value what the patient or client says about his history. The report may be able to offer a description of physical conditions and an opinion as to the degree of consistency of what has been observed with what has been said by the applicant. But for those conditions, eg scarring, to be merely consistent with what has been said by the applicant, does no more than state that it is consistent with other causes also. It is not common for the phrases which indicate a higher probative value in the observed conditions to be used. That limits the weight which can be afforded to such a report when judging the credibility of the claim. Rather than offering significant separate support for the claim, a conclusion as to mere consistency generally only has the effect of not negating the claim. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.99in;margin-right:0.42in;text-indent:0.5in">Where the report is a psychiatric report, often diagnosing PTSD or some form of depression, there are often observations of behaviour at the interview, and a recounting of the answers given to questions about relevant conditions eg dreams and sleep patterns. Sometimes these answers are said to be consistent with what has been set out as the relevant history of the applicant. It is more difficult for the psychiatrist to treat what he observes as objectively verified, than it is for the description of physical conditions, because they are the more readily feigned; it is rare for a psychiatrist's report to be able to indicate that any part of the observations were undertaken in a way which makes them more objectively verifiable. It is the more difficult for there to be any verification of conditions which the psychiatrist cannot observe and for which he is wholly dependent on the applicant. The further major problem with the contention that a psychiatric report can be used to support an applicant's claim to have told the truth about the history, is that there are usually other obvious potential causes for the signs of anxiety, stress and depression. These include the fact that the applicant may be facing return to the country which he has left, at some expense to himself and family, and it may well not be a pleasant place to which to return. He may face the loss of friendships and lifestyle which he has enjoyed in the United Kingdom. There may be a loss of family contacts and of medical treatment. He may anyway suffer from some depression, without having been ill-treated in a way requiring international protection. He may have experienced difficulties other than those which he relies on for his claim. But it is very rare, and it will usually be very difficult, for a psychiatrist to assess such other factors without engaging in the process of testing the truth of what the applicant says. This is not his task and if there is a therapeutic side to the interview, it may run counter to those aims as seen properly by the doctor. </p>

Dr Groszer's conclusion, as a result of his observation of Mrs Levy's EMDR test, that HK's story was true, is also of real support to HK's case. Of course, as Chadwick LJ observed during the argument, it is the Tribunal, not the doctors, who must ultimately decide whether or not the story is to be believed. However, particularly in a case such as this, with the very unusual nature of the story and the absence of much other corroborating or conflicting evidence, that testimony should not have been passed over without mention.” </p>

Doctors often do comment upon the consistency and credibility of the historian before them, namely of the patient's account.

In the asylum and trafficking context applicants sometimes adduce evidence from nonmedical witnesses, with experience of the kind of persecution or trafficking in question, to the effect that the account which the applicant gives of their experiences is “consistent with” the accounts given by other established victims.  This is obviously evidence of a different character from evidence of signs or symptoms assessed by a doctor, and the relevance of “consistency” would appear to be rather different.  If an applicant gives a highly circumstantial account of, say, the means used to recruit or transport them or the way in which they were exploited, and the details closely correspond to what other established victims have reported, that will in principle support the truth of their story, though the extent to which it does so will depend on the particular case: it will always be necessary to assess the degree of correspondence, and a decision-maker will also have to bear in mind the real possibility of the applicant having been coached to give a convincing account.  We were referred to no authority about the proper approach to opinion evidence of this character, but in our experience it is commonly admitted and taken into account (see, for example, para. 78 of the judgment of Underhill LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">TDT</span>).

It is not simply that that phraseology has an inappropriate echo of criminal proceedings.  More substantially, it implies an approach under which the decision-taker first identifies the defects in the account of a putative victim and then tries to decide whether they can be excused for reasons of the kind given.  That risks being overmechanistic and does not reflect the real nature of the exercise.  As is made clear in <span style="font-style:italic">Mibanga</span>, what is required is a single process in which the decision-maker assesses the credibility of the core account given by the putative victim.  In doing so it will be necessary to take into account features which potentially call their credibility into question, such as incoherence, inconsistency or delay, alongside factors which may explain those features. </p>

But in truth it connotes no more than whether the applicant’s account is to be believed.  In making that assessment the decision-maker will have to take account all factors that may bear on that question.  Likewise the term “plausibility” is not a term of art.  To say that a particular account, or element in that account, is implausible is simply to say that it seems to the decision-maker to be inherently surprising, or the kind of thing that you would not normally expect to happen; and such an assessment will obviously feed in to the overall assessment of credibility, though the weight to be given to it will depend on the degree of unlikelihood and how confident the decision-maker can be about it.  Perhaps both points are too obvious to need making; but if terms are used too regularly they sometimes get in the way of the process of common sense decision-making.   </p>

To say that an applicant's account is not credible is to state a conclusion’ (emphasis added).

He went on to emphasise, as did Pill LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Ghaisari </span>[[2004] EWCA Civ 1854], the entitlement of the fact-finder to rely ‘on his common sense and his ability, as a practical and informed person, to identify what is or is not plausible’.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">MN relied first on a one-page letter dated 19 April 2016 from Hannah Rees, a registered psychotherapist and the “Counselling Co-ordinator” at the charity Rape Crisis, where MN had been receiving counselling.  The letter is very short and is to whom it may concern “in support of her status as victim of trafficking”.  Ms Rees had not herself seen MN and the letter is based on what appeared in Rape Crisis’ internal assessment report and what Ms Rees had been told by MN’s counsellor.  After a very summary account of MN’s reported history, it describes her as displaying “symptoms of high anxiety and low mood, hypervigilance and hyper arousal, rumination, sleeplessness, overwhelming feelings of shame and issues with memory recall”.  She said that those symptoms were “consistent with those displayed by people who had suffered sexual violence-related trauma and PTSD”.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Second, MN relied on a report dated 24 October 2016 addressed to MN by Dr Rebecca Johnson of London Trauma Specialists.  Dr Johnson is a clinical psychologist working in the Haringey Complex Care Team at the Barnet, Enfield and Haringey NHS Trust, who met MN for the purpose of an assessment on 9 and 26 September: there is no mention of whether an interpreter was required.  It is based on an assessment of MN in September 2016.  It contains, again, a short summary of MN’s account of her experiences followed by a fuller account of her presenting symptoms. It concludes that she “is presenting with difficulties consistent with a diagnosis of PTSD as a result of trafficking and sexual abuse in Italy”.  The symptoms of PTSD are described as “intrusive memories, nightmares, hyper arousal, persistent and negative views about herself”.  It refers in particular to MN’s overwhelming feelings of shame and describes them as similar to those reported by other Albanian victims of sexual abuse whom Dr Johnson has treated. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Finally, MN relied on a report dated 15 March 2017 from Mirjam Thullesen, a psychologist and psychotherapist specialising in the assessment and treatment of victims of trafficking.  She interviewed MN for over three hours on 14 November 2016: she says that an interpreter was present, and presumably therefore MN was interviewed wholly or mainly in Albanian.  Ms Thullsen’s report is exceedingly long, and we should summarise her principal conclusions in a little detail. </p>

On one view that does indeed amount to her “commenting on credibility”; but it appears that Ms Thullesen meant that she ought not to express a view on the ultimate question of whether the account was true although she plainly does express a view on factors feeding into that question.  That is unexceptionable. </p>

On a fair reading, it seems that all three witnesses use that phrase to connote more than “mere consistency”: that is, they intend to convey that the symptoms are at least to some extent positively supportive of the truth of her account.  But the weight to be given to that evidence must depend on the extent to which similar symptoms may be caused by other experiences, which is not a point that any of the reports directly addresses.  It is also, of course, dependent on whether the symptoms were being feigned.  But Ms Thullesen expressly and Dr Johnson (we think) by implication express the opinion that that is not the case. </p>

Ms Rees’s account of the history given by MN was both second-hand and extremely summary: it does not represent a full and thorough history of the kind recorded by Ms Thullesen.  The first discrepancy could very readily have arisen as a result of an error of recollection more than five years after the event, quite apart from the warnings contained both in the Guidance and in Ms Thullesen’s evidence about the effect of a prolonged period of abuse on a victim’s ability to recall detail; or it could simply be an error in recording.  Similarly, it would not be surprising for a client, in a summary account given to a counsellor, to refer to a period of 17 months as “two years”.  Nor would it be surprising if MN had in fact given precise dates but they were approximated when being written down: we repeat that this was not a full clinical history, nor would it have been of any significance to the counsellor whether MN was held for 17 months or 24. The significance attached to these minor discrepancies is rather troubling inasmuch as it suggests a hyper-critical mindset on the part of the decision-maker where he was positively looking for reasons to discount the evidence of the expert. </p>

Dr Johnson records her as having said that she did not tell her family about her relationship with Ardian before they left for Italy because they would not have approved, whereas she had told the Home Office, as the letter puts it, that “your family were not only aware of your relationship but gave you their blessing to relocate with him to Italy” (paras. 25-27).  We will return to this discrepancy later in a wider context, but the conclusion drawn from it as regards Dr Johnson’s report is that it “raises concerns that the report was produced without the medical professional benefitting from access to all your previously submitted material”.  This presumably means that Dr Johnson had not seen the screening and asylum interviews.  For ourselves, we think it is clear from the report itself that Dr Johnson had indeed simply relied on MN’s history.  But we do not see how this affects the weight of the evidence in her report.  It was not her business to carry out a critical assessment of MN’s accounts and she had not purported to do so.  She had simply expressed the opinion that MN’s symptoms were consistent with those reported by other established victims of trafficking.   </p>

That does not appear to be an accurate summary of the relevant passage in Ms Thullesen’s report: there is no reference to “later that evening”, the phrase used (para. 48) being “after some time”.  We cannot see that that phrase is inconsistent with the much shorter account given in the asylum interview (Q61); but, even if it could be said to be, this is precisely the kind of minor inconsistency which is to be expected between accounts given some time apart, and in different circumstances, of a traumatic event years previously. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.90in;margin-right:0.04in">“where you stated the police did not speak to anybody during their raid”.  We can find no such statement in the asylum interview.  At Q105 she says that “the policemen were basically talking to the men that were around”; and at Q106, in answer to a question why the police did not stop her and the other women who were leaving, she said “I don’t know why they didn’t stop us but they stopped the men at the reception and around the house”.  That does not seem to us substantially different from what is recorded by Ms Thullesen: an inconsistency can only be contrived by taking the word “everyone” wholly literally and out of context, even supposing that Ms Thullesen was recording MN’s exact language. The truth is that in both accounts what MN was saying is that the police were talking to several men at the reception but not to the women.  Elsewhere in the letter the CA expresses the view that that is implausible, and we return to that below; but there is no inconsistency. </p>

The letter goes on to say that her story “contains many implausible elements” and gives as “the most prominent examples … your retention of your passport, your traffickers giving you money and the circumstances of your escape”.  There is also a reference at para. 54 to MN’s account “lacking plausibility in fundamental aspects … which exist independently of your alleged experiences as trafficking victim”: it is said that it will be “discussed below”, i.e. in a later section of the letter.  We deal later with the discrepancies and implausibilities in MN’s account identified by the CA.  At this stage we need only say that this element in the CA’s reasoning is plainly legitimate in principle.  Ms Thullesen’s evidence could not offer more than a <span style="font-style:italic">potential</span> explanation of inconsistencies in her account or late disclosure of parts of it.  It was the CA’s responsibility to weigh the evidence as a whole, including objective evidence of the kind here referred to and questions of inherent plausibility.

But that does not mean that she was not entitled to give her expert opinion on issues that were relevant to that question – such as the consistency of MN’s account both with her symptoms, its similarity with the accounts of other Albanian victims of trafficking the known <span style="font-style:italic">modus operandi</span> of Albanian traffickers, and her presentation when giving her account; and she did so.   </p>

It is said that that was contrary to the decision of this Court in <span style="font-style:italic">HH (Ethiopia)</span> (paras. 50-52).  As to this, we repeat our observations in relation to the same point in relation to Dr Johnson’s report: the point is in principle valid, but we are concerned about how it is deployed here and what weight the CA gave to it.

We do not believe that that conclusion was justified.  The expert evidence was relevant and of real weight, and the CA was obliged to take it into account.  We have identified a number of flaws in the reasons which the CA gives for not doing so.  The underlying problem is a failure on its part to proceed analytically.  What it needed to do was to identify, if only in summary form, the specific opinions expressed by the witnesses that were potentially supportive of the truth of MN’s account, and to assess in relation to each the weight to be given to it – which of course involves identifying the points which qualified or undermined their value.  The CA did not adopt such a structured approach but simply listed in relation to each witness a number of criticisms – some, it has to be said, of a rather formulaic nature – without any assessment of their specific relevance.   </p>

As noted at para. 179 above, it would in principle have been quite legitimate for it to give the expert reports full weight but nevertheless conclude that the difficulties with MN’s account were simply so great that they could not be explained by the factors to which the experts draw attention.  If on a fair reading of the letter that was in substance what the CA did – or if it was the only possible conclusion in any event – its decision should be upheld, despite its having made criticisms of the reports which are ill-founded or of marginal significance.

The CA did not accept that explanation.  It noted at para. 76 of the letter that she had had ample opportunity to correct the error since then, “not least in your witness statements or during the Asylum Appeal system”.  As regards the witness statements, that is simply wrong: as we have said, the alleged error was corrected in her first witness statement.  As regards the asylum appeal, the weight of the point depends on the extent to which the discrepancy was relied on in the FTT: that was not a point explored before us, but it seems unlikely that it was, since it is not referred to in the FTT’s decision.  The decision-maker also refers to the fact that at para. 35 of the FTT’s decision the judge “addressed your repeated assertions of erroneous interpretation” and said that he could not accept them, describing her answers in interview as “recorded repeatedly and very clearly”.  This, however, refers to a particular set of answers in a different interview (being her interview at Stansted in November 2012), and the FTT does not make any more general criticism of MN for repeatedly resorting to allegations of having been wrongly interpreted.  That does not mean that such a criticism may not be available, and it is also obviously material that the FTT rejected MN’s account overall; but what troubles us about the CA’s reasoning at this point is that it smacks of the deployment of a stock answer to her explanation without attempting to see whether it is actually applicable to the specific point. </p>

It appears that the CA did not accept that MN had travelled on such a passport, but it is not entirely clear what its reasons were.  The letter does not, as it might have done, take any point on the late emergence of the account given by MN of the passport having been obtained by Ardian and kept by him for most of the journey.  It does, however, observe that her account of having her passport invalidated on her return to Albania in 2012 following her escape was inconsistent with it being false.  The point is not fully spelt out, but we take it to be that if the passport was false the Albanian authorities would have invalidated it on that basis, rather than on the basis that she had outstayed her Italian visa (which in any event it is hard to see why the <span style="font-style:italic">Albanian</span> authorities would be worried about); they might indeed even have made difficulties about allowing her into the country.  That is a reasonable point, and we are not the fact-finders.  But we are not sure that it is conclusive by itself.  It is not possible to know for sure how the Albanian authorities would have behaved if MN presented what must, on her account as it now is, have been a false passport: we do not know if it was obviously false, though we do know (if her story is true) that they invalidated it, albeit giving (at least as she recounts it) a puzzling reason for doing so.   </p>

However, this striking discrepancy was not raised in the CA’s questionnaire, so we do not know how she might account for it.

In her third witness statement, as part of her answer to the CA’s question on this aspect, MN said that she had used the term “everyone” in a “generic” sense, by which we understand her to mean not literally.

The FTT had made the same point.

She says that she hadn’t said that the police “just went to the big rooms”, but that “they were somewhere at the reception … and then spread out” and that her answer must have been misrecorded or misunderstood by the interpreter.  We are bound to say that we cannot see how that very minor difference matters: it is certainly not what the CA was asking about.  But we mention it because the CA letter says, again, that “as previously stated, you did not raise erroneous interpretation during the asylum process” (para. 93).  Read literally, this does not make sense because the alleged error arose in recording of the asylum interview itself; but we assume that what the CA means is that MN did not raise it in the FTT.  There is, however, no sign that any point was taken about Q102 during the FTT proceedings; and it seems that the decision-maker has, again, raised this objection mechanistically and without any consideration of its applicability to the particular point being made. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">First, the CA regarded it as inherently implausible that if the police were raiding the house because it was a brothel they would simply have let MN – and indeed, as she appeared to have said in one of her answers in the asylum interview, the other women – leave without questioning them: they were likely to need support, and they were also potential witnesses in any prosecution.  The letter makes the point that many Italian law enforcement officers are specially trained in trafficking situations.  The FTT had made essentially the same point.  Mr Husain submitted that that finding was not open to the CA.  As to the likelihood of MN being simply allowed to leave, the decision-maker had no way of knowing how the Italian police would behave on such an occasion: he was simply making an assumption.  He referred us to para. 30 of the judgment of Neuberger LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">HK </span>(see para. 128 above), where he endorsed Lord Brodie’s warning against finding an asylum-seeker’s account to be implausible on the basis of speculation or in disregard of his or her social or cultural background.  We do not accept that submission.  In our view it was entirely reasonable of the CA to find this aspect of MN’s account surprising – though, again, it does not follow that this was by itself a sufficient reason to reject her entire story. </p>

He submitted that the CA could not draw any safe conclusions about how a young woman would react in the situation that MN was in if her account was true.  It was entirely plausible that she would instinctively want to get away from her place of captivity as soon as possible and return to her home country, whatever the risks: it should be noted that she did not go back to her home town or her immediate family but went instead to her uncle in Tirana.  What she said in the third witness statement about being “in a terrible state” and feeling “ruined” is consistent with the expert evidence of Ms Thullesen, and indeed with the Guidance.

In her first witness statement she said that she could not now remember when Ardian’s visit had been.  The CA says at para. 110 that it cannot accept MN’s explanation in her FTT witness statement for the discrepancy between June and August, because there had been no fewer than 26 questions in the basis of claim section of the screening interview and that she therefore had the opportunity “to coherently relay this information”.  We cannot regard that as a satisfactory reason: the fact that there were 26 questions (covering the entirety of her account) does not mean that she had the opportunity to avoid all errors.

She did not give many details about what had happened in the intervening fortnight, and those that she did give are not entirely easy to understand from the record of the interview.  However, she said that she had gone by train to a town in France whose name she could not recall, but had stayed only for one day (including staying overnight in a hotel) and that at the station a man had given her a false Italian ID and said that he would keep her passport. She was asked why she went to France and said that it was because she could not find work.  At the start of the interview she had been asked how she acquired the false Italian ID.  She said that she did so after a chance meeting with some Albanians in a café in an Italian town recorded as “Alexandra” (presumably Alessandria), who had advised her to try to find work in the UK and put her in touch with someone who sold her the ID card for €200.  There are thus two different accounts of how she acquired her Italian ID (though they are ostensibly reconciled in the fuller account that she gave later – see para. 217 below).

She explains that about three or four weeks before her unsuccessful attempt to enter the UK in November 2012 she had attempted to fly to the UK from France but had been stopped at the airport.  In summary her account was that she left Albania with an agent by ferry to Bari and then took a train to a city in France whose name she did not know.  She was given a false Italian ID.  The agent took her to the airport for a flight to the UK, but the false ID was detected and she was not allowed to fly.  She contacted the agent again, who took her to Turin, where she stayed for “a few days” before being given a new false Italian ID, which is the one that she used to fly to Stansted.  That account is broadly consistent, though not in all respects (see below), with what MN said when interviewed at Stansted (see above), but it is wholly inconsistent with what she said in her asylum interview and in her first witness statement, where she says, with some circumstantiality, that she had flown from Tirana to Turin the previous day.  In her second witness statement MN explains her failure to recall this episode earlier by saying that previous solicitors had told her not to mention (presumably, though she does not say this, at the asylum interview) that she had been in France, because if she did she might be returned there, and that that had driven it to the back of her mind. </p>

It is not, therefore, clear what else about the “journey” is not accepted.  However, what matters more is the rejection of “your reasons for seeking entry”.  What the CA clearly means is that the reasons that MN gave for seeking entry – i.e. to find work – were true, and that her subsequent account of having come to the UK to escape her traffickers, but feeling unable to give that reason when interviewed, is untrue. </p>

However, if its conclusion was correct it would mean that when MN was returned to Milan (apparently without a passport) the Italian authorities either simply allowed her to pass through immigration controls or made a positive decision not to return her to Albania.  We are bound to say that that seems rather less plausible than that the reason why the Albanian authorities have no record of her return – or none that turned up on the search done at the request of the Home Office – is as suggested by MN.  But the issue is only significant to the extent that it bears on the credibility of MN’s core account of being a victim of trafficking, as to which there are clearly points which are more directly relevant. </p>

We can see nothing wrong in it doing so.  The FTT had had the advantage, which the CA had not, of hearing MN give evidence and being questioned on her account.  The issues canvassed before it traversed the same ground as those with which the CA was concerned.  It would be artificial and unsatisfactory if it was not entitled to take into account both the FTT’s assessment of MN as a witness and those parts of its reasoning that were applicable to the material before it.  It was of course important also that the CA should recognise that it had the advantage not only of expert evidence of a kind which the FTT did not have but of much fuller and more circumstantial witness statements; and that if the FTT had had the benefit of those materials its assessment, even of MN’s demeanour as a witness, might have been different.

The Secretary of State (delegating his function to the CA) is the primary decision-maker whose function is to determine whether a person is a victim of trafficking under ECAT. The task of identifying victims of trafficking is an executive task and is not a matter of expert opinion.

Although, strictly, we are concerned only with the court’s scrutiny of the original decision, the starting-point must be the standard of reasoning required in the decision itself.  As to that, it is clear that a high quality of reasoning is required in a conclusive grounds decision, which engages fully with the case advanced by the putative victim of trafficking.  Sir James Eadie and Mr Irwin acknowledged that expressly in their skeleton argument, citing the judgments of Dove J in <span style="font-style:italic">R (FK) v Secretary of State for the Home Department</span> [2016] EWHC 56 (Admin) (see para. 27) and of this Court in <span style="font-style:italic">R (YH) v Secretary of State for the Home Department </span>[2010] EWCA Civ 116, [2010] 4 All ER 448, where Carnwath LJ refers to the “need for decisions to show by their reasoning that every factor which tells in favour of the applicant has been properly taken into account” (see para. 24 of his judgment)<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="32">

	      </authorialNote>.  This is for obvious reasons.  A conclusive grounds decision is very important for the putative victim: we have described above some of the rights to which an established victim of trafficking becomes entitled.  Although the potential consequences of a wrong conclusive grounds decision are not generally comparable in terms of gravity to the risk to a victim of persecution if wrongly returned to their country of origin, these are nonetheless gateway decisions that relate to important rights.  But the decision is also likely to influence the decision of the state whether to pursue a prosecution against alleged traffickers.  The requirement for a high standard of reasoning is all the more important given that in general the decision-making process is a primarily paper exercise<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="33">

In addition to the passages to which we have already referred, it makes clear that it is essential that decision-makers make a “comprehensive written assessment of how the person’s situation meets or does not meet the definition of a trafficked victim”.  To make the decision “they must weigh the strength of the indicators or evidence presented, including the credibility of the claim, and use common sense and logic based on the particular circumstances of each case”.  They “must also take into account any medical reports submitted, particularly those from qualified health practitioners”.  Decision-makers are advised to assess the material facts of past and present events (material facts being those which are serious and significant in nature), taking into account coherence, internal and external consistency, the level of detail in an account and matters that might provide good reason for a potential victim’s account to be lacking in detail or consistency </p>

We have concluded at para. 183 that many of the reasons that the CA gave for attaching no substantial weight to the expert evidence submitted by MN were seriously flawed.  However, as we acknowledge at para. 184, that failure would not be fatal if on a fair reading of the letter its essential reasoning was that there were simply too many “difficulties” with MN’s account for it to be believed even if full weight was given to the expert evidence, and if that conclusion was reached in a sustainable way.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">We should start by saying that we are not satisfied that that was the CA’s reasoning.  It certainly nowhere articulates it.  There is, it is true, a reference to reasons “given throughout this letter” (see para. 175 above) and another to a lack of plausibility “as will be discussed below” (para. 179), but those are only part of an omnium gatherum of miscellaneous points which are treated as reducing the value of the reports.   However, even if we were charitably to hold that that was the substance of its reasoning, we do not believe that the way in which it reached that conclusion was sustainable.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">First, the letter does not engage in any real analysis of most of the various inconsistencies or other difficulties on which the CA relies in reaching its conclusion that MN’s account was untrue.  It simply piles up difficulties without any attempt to assess their significance to the issue of credibility: cf. our criticisms of its approach to the expert evidence.  We will not repeat the various instances of wrong or unsatisfactory reasoning which we have identified at paras. 189-228 above.  We fully accept that there remain some serious difficulties to which the CA was entitled to give real weight, most obviously about whether MN’s account is consistent with the passport on which she says she travelled to Italy in 2010 being false (as it must have been, given the evidence of the Albanian authorities).  But the undiscriminating basis on which the CA proceeds overall does not inspire confidence that it has carefully assessed whether those more serious difficulties are such as to undermine her account overall. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Secondly, and connectedly, the CA does not at any stage in this section of the letter attempt to consider the inconsistencies and other difficulties in the light of the expert evidence.  That evidence was relevant to the credibility of MN’s account in all the ways identified at paras. 157-160 above.  For example, some weight should have been given to Ms Thullesen’s reasoned opinion that MN’s history gave no sign of being feigned, though of course that could not in any sense be determinative.  Weight also had to be given to her evidence about the impact of trauma on a victim’s ability to recount their experiences coherently and consistently; that is of course a point also made in Home Office Guidance, not only in the Frontline Guidance from which Ms Thullesen quotes but in a passage from the Competent Authority Guidance which is not quoted in the decision letter (see para. 185 above).  Some at least of the inconsistencies on which the CA relied might quite readily have been explained on that basis.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="34">
		<p class="footnotedescription" style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:-0.49in"> They might even in a modest way have been supportive of her account, in the sense that false accounts which have been learned can be unnaturally consistent, as Ms Thullesen says at para. 128 of her report (see para. 151 above). <span style="font-size:10pt"> </span></p>

	      </authorialNote>  These points are simply not fed into the credibility analysis. Having dismissed the expert evidence as being of no real value before embarking on the assessment of credibility, the CA makes no reference to it thereafter.  If the evidence was indeed worthless, that would be acceptable; but that was not the case.  In truth, despite its evident attempt to avoid it, the CA did in substance fall into the <span style="font-style:italic">Mibanga </span>error.  The point made by <span style="font-style:italic">Mibanga</span> is not that the expert evidence and the issue of credibility must be considered in a particular order but that the former must be allowed to feed into the latter.

We have thought carefully about this.  This was not an easy case for the CA.  As we hope we have made clear, by no means all the reasons given for impugning the credibility of her account are insubstantial.  There are, as Mr Husain candidly conceded, substantial inconsistencies.  We have identified several above and need not repeat them.  There are also elements in her account which might legitimately be thought implausible.  We have also been given serious pause by the fact that the FTT believed that MN was lying and found that she had come to the UK for economic reasons and not as a victim of trafficking. As we have already said, we do not accept Mr Husain’s submission that the FTT’s conclusions should have been treated as irrelevant.    </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">In the end, however, we are not satisfied that the only conclusion to which the CA could properly have come was that MN’s story was untrue.  There is a known problem of Albanian women being trafficked into prostitution in Italy.  MN’s overall account and her presentation to the expert witnesses were characteristic of those of genuine victims.  The inconsistencies within and between her various accounts are a real problem, but some at least are explained in her evidence in ways which are not self-evidently untrue.  Full weight must be given to the evidence (and guidance) about the difficulties that victims of trafficking have in telling their stories, not only because of the effects of trauma but because their experiences often engender distrust of authority and sometimes entangle them in deceptions of various kinds from which it is difficult to escape.  It is also necessary to heed the caution expressed in the authorities about judging accounts to be implausible without complete knowledge of the relevant circumstances, and making full allowance for how people can behave in circumstances of stress.  As to the decision of the FTT, we repeat the reasons given at para. 230 above as to why it cannot be treated as decisive. </p>

The result is that that application will have to be determined afresh by a different decision-maker on behalf of the CA.  Given its unusual complexities, we would encourage the CA to consider whether this is a case in which MN should be interviewed.  Such interviews were provided for at p. 68 of the version of the Guidance which is before us, and no doubt there is similar provision in the current version.  Nothing is there said about legal representatives attending the interview, but consideration may need to be given to whether that is appropriate in this case and if so what their role should be. </p>

We have not referred specifically to the submissions in the skeleton argument of Sir James Eadie and Mr Irwin, which were supplemented to a very limited extent in Mr Irwin’s oral submissions.  In truth they amounted essentially to a submission that it was legitimate to treat the decision letter as having found that there were simply too many difficulties with MN’s story for it to be believed and that that was an entirely sustainable conclusion.

It is fair to record that the decision-maker in this case considered the materials before him thoroughly and observed procedural fairness by giving MN’s advisers the opportunity to answer what seemed to him to be the principal difficulties with her account.  We would not, any more than with the decision of a court or tribunal, find his decision to be wrong in law only because of minor inaccuracies or loosenesses of expression or thinking on inessential matters.  However, as we have said, the question whether a person is a victim of trafficking governs access to important Convention rights.  The fact that the Government has chosen to entrust the determination of that question to an official in the Home Office rather than to a court or tribunal cannot justify a less rigorous approach to the reasoning required to support their decisions. For the reasons given above we have been driven to the conclusion that the CA here adopted a wrong approach to its task, as well as making a number of particular errors, and overall its decision cannot stand. </p>

She pleaded with her parents not to allow her to be cut again, but they refused, so she ran away.

Element (b) (“means”) is unnecessary because she was a child.

Ms Thullesen uses the phrase “highly consistent” (see para. 179 of her report); and it may be that Dr Sharp intended also to connote more than “mere consistency”.  The weight to be given to that evidence must depend on the extent to which those symptoms might be caused by other experiences.  Dr Sharp acknowledges that the experience of immigration detention can itself be “highly distressing” (see para. 78 of her report); but we do not understand her to be saying that it is probable that that was the principal, let alone sole, cause.

We should note at this point that the CA in fact considers the expert evidence in two distinct sections of the decision letter.  In these paragraphs its focus appears to be on whether that evidence gives any positive support to IXU’s account – or, as it sometimes expresses it, whether it “corroborates” it.  Later, at paras. 140-143, it considers whether it offers any “mitigation” for what would otherwise be features which cast doubt on its truth (such as inconsistency or late disclosure): see paras. 317-321 below.  We understand the theoretical logic behind that distinction, but it is not clear-cut in practice and, as appears below, the CA had difficulty observing it.  We should also say that the term “corroboration”, though not as inappropriate as “mitigation”, is not ideal, because it carries a certain amount of baggage from its use in the context of criminal law: in particular, it may imply that a person’s account cannot be accepted in the absence of some supporting evidence.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.89in;margin-right:0.04in">We do not regard it as appropriate for the CA to discount the value of Dr Sharp’s evidence because she did not take into account the fact that the FTT had found that IXU had not told the truth on important aspects of her account and that she had “even” said that she had not been asked to “ascertain for certain that [IXU] is telling the truth”.  As the CA itself emphasises elsewhere, the question whether IXU was telling the truth was ultimately for it to decide, and it is not the role of an expert witness to undertake the task of assessing a subject’s account against other accounts or evidence or previous judicial findings.  What Dr Sharp said at para. 12 of her report was thus perfectly conventional.  But it does not follow that an expert may not give evidence which is relevant to the decision-maker’s assessment of credibility, and Dr Sharp did so: see paras. 292293 above. </p>

The possibility – albeit not specifically raised by Dr Sharp herself – that the experience of undergoing FGM was the only cause of IXU’s PTSD, to the exclusion of the subsequent episodes of exploitation by Sam Okoro and Ma which she describes, is certainly something which the CA was entitled to take into account, but it is not in our view a sufficient reason for disregarding this aspect of Dr Sharp’s evidence altogether. </p>

The presence [<span style="font-style:italic">sic</span>] of [Ms Thullesen’s report] does not substantiate your claims as it presupposes that the material facts of your claim are settled.

But it was entirely appropriate for her to express her opinions on the basis of IXU’s history as recounted to her; and it is regrettable that the CA should have used the language of “bias” (though we are sure that it was not its intention to impugn Ms Thullesen’s good faith).  </p>

It is also misleading to suggest that Ms Thullesen simply uncritically accepted IXU’s history.  She did not do the same exercise that the CA itself was required to do, of assessing it in the round against all the available evidence; but para. 141 of her report makes it clear that she was alive to the possibility of fabrication and that, so far as presentation was concerned, she judged that it was unlikely.

As we understand it, what the CA is saying is that even where full allowance is made for this factor a decisionmaker may still find an applicant’s story to be untrue.  It seems to us that this point is more relevant to “mitigation” than it is to “corroboration”.  As far as it goes it is obviously correct, but we do not see how it supports the CA’s conclusion in para. 68 that Ms Thullesen’s evidence is “only of limited value”: rather, her evidence is of real value, but it is not (of course) conclusive. </p>

At paras. 55-59 of his judgment he considers whether a forced marriage constitutes a form of exploitation within the meaning of article 4 (a) of ECAT (and thus the NRM).  Ms Luh submitted that it necessarily did, relying on a number of materials which the judge sets out at para. 55.  Mr Irwin submitted that it would not necessarily do so: it would depend on the circumstances of a particular case.  The judge accepted Ms Luh’s submission, and his conclusion in that regard is not challenged before us.  But he continued, at para. 60: </p>

In my judgment the decision maker was entitled to come to the conclusion that it was not sufficiently established, or sufficiently proximate. The Claimant’s accounts of her understanding were not clear (perhaps unsurprisingly in view of her age at the time). At their highest they hardly suggest an immediate forced marriage. Rather they suggest that the FGM was a ritual which would be practised regardless of marriage, although in her culture it would be expected of any prospective bride. I bear very much in mind that I am not the factfinder, but the FTT judge was, and she concluded that the Claimant was not going to be forced into a marriage.” </p>

He then considered the approach to expert evidence generally.  He noted that the structure of the conclusive grounds decision was that it dealt with expert evidence on two different bases – first whether the reports reflected directly on the question of credibility, and secondly in relation to “mitigating circumstances”, meaning, as the judge said, the adjustments to the normal assessment of credibility necessary to take account of the effect of trafficking on a victim.  On the first basis, he held that the CA’s approach was correct in light of the statements in the two reports which demonstrated that the experts had not considered directly the question of credibility.  On the second basis, he noted that the CA had quoted extensively from the relevant passages in the Guidance.  He described the CA’s summary of Dr Sharp’s opinion as wholly fair and accurate.  He noted Ms Thullesen’s view that IXU’s presentation of her account was consistent with the pattern seen in many other trafficking victims, but he observed that the CA had specifically referred to this passage in her report in its decision.

He conceded that this was an unfortunate word to use and it would have been better to employ the term “supporting evidence”.  He added, however, that it was clear from the context that this was what the CA had meant.  On this point, he concluded (at para. 89): </p>

But the CG letter does not say this, nor even imply it. In circumstances such as this, where there are multiple untruths, and changes and additions to the accounts such that credibility is doubted, even after making due allowances for the guidance and expert evidence, it is reasonable to look to see if there is any supporting evidence.

However it makes no finding about whether that claim is true or, which is strictly the relevant question, whether that was indeed the purpose of subjecting her to FGM.  That must be because it believed that it was unnecessary to make such a finding because there was, as it says in the second sentence, no evidence that such a forced marriage would constitute either domestic servitude (para. 172) or sexual exploitation (para. 176).   </p>

He evidently had in mind para. 62 of the FTT’s decision (see para. 273 above), where the judge says that she did not accept that IXU “has been or will be forced into marriage by her family”.

Such discussion as there is about IXU’s evidence about the FGM relates to whether it was, as she claimed, only partial (so that she was at risk of a further procedure).  That is not particularly surprising, since the issue for the FTT was whether she would be at risk on return and that was the focus of its findings.  We do not think that it was safe for the judge to proceed on the basis that the CA had implicitly found, or would or should have found, that IXU had never been threatened with forced marriage in connection with the FGM procedure (or indeed at all, which is what the FTT appears to have held).

The phrase “entitled to conclude” suggests that the judge thought that the CA had indeed found that any forced marriage would not be immediate.  The CA’s use in paras. 172 and 176 of the phrase “at some point in the future” suggests that he may be right about that, though it is very general and there is no supporting discussion.  If he is, the next question is whether that was a finding to which it was entitled to come.  Mr Husain challenged the judge’s description of IXU’s accounts as not suggesting an immediate marriage.   He referred us in particular to what she had said in her amended defence statement (para. 266 above), her asylum interview (para. 269) and her history as taken by Ms Thullesen (para. 286).  Those statements are, unsurprisingly, not identical in their details, but (if they are true) what IXU says that she was told does go further than mere general statements to the effect that girls have to be cut in order to be fit for marriage: their effect is that once the procedure was complete the next step would be to give her in marriage.  Whether that can be described as “immediate” depends on what you mean by that term.  We can accept that it does not suggest days or weeks, particularly as there is no suggestion that a husband had yet been identified; but it is not possible to say more than that. </p>

It is easy enough at either extreme.  If, say, the intended husband had said that he wanted to marry the child in question but that she must undergo FGM first, it would be a natural use of language, and in accordance with the aims of ECAT, to describe the FGM (or, rather, any associated taking away) as being for the purpose of the forced marriage (which, as already established, constitutes exploitation).  At the other extreme, if the evidence were <span style="text-decoration:underline">only</span> that in a particular culture (1) girls were routinely taken away and subjected to FGM at a young age in order to render them marriageable<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="40">

In between those two extremes there will be a wide variety of circumstances, and it would not be appropriate for us to offer guidance divorced from the particular facts found.  The distinction between the two cases could be characterised in terms of the degree of proximacy (the judge’s term) or closeness (Mr Irwin’s) of the act to the intended exploitation; but we are wary of introducing glosses of this kind which may distract decision-makers from the language of article 4 (a) itself.  We certainly think that it is dangerous to substitute a test of “immediacy”: the distance of time between the act and any possible future exploitation will be relevant to an assessment of whether the one is done for the purpose of the other, but it cannot be the touchstone. </p>

We do not find his analysis of the structure of the CA’s decision – referring to the two bases on which the expert evidence was considered – meets the force of the appellant’s criticism as to the overall approach of the CA to that evidence. Accordingly, we uphold this ground of appeal. </p>

In these circumstances, the Competent Authority should treat the potential victim as having been a child at the time of the modern slavery incident and follow the guidance covering children within the NRM decision-making process. This means assessing the case as if they were a child to make a reasonable grounds and conclusive grounds decision.” </p>

He says that the decision letter nowhere alludes to this consideration and that it does not show any sign of applying particular caution. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">Mr Irwin, as we understood him, accepted that the CA should in assessing the account given by a potential victim of trafficking of events that occurred when they were a child take into account the difficulties that a child may have in understanding events, and the different perceptions that they may have of them, and the effect that this may have on the cogency of their evidence – quite apart from the fact that the events may have been traumatic and have happened many years ago.  In any event that seems to us to be plainly correct.  He did not, however, accept that in evaluating the account of an adult potential victim of trafficking it was necessary to treat their evidence as if, contrary to the fact, they were still children, simply because some of the events which they describe occurred when that was the case; and he said that that was not the effect of the passages in the Guidance.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">We are bound to say that this debate seems more theoretical than real.  Any decisionmaker in such a case should as a matter of common sense when assessing the accounts given by a potential victim of trafficking take into account both their age at the time when their accounts were given and their age at the time of the events which they narrate.  But it will be difficult to isolate the weight to be given to those considerations as distinct from other considerations, which will include (as we have said) the potential impact of any traumatic events described on how coherently and consistently they are recounted, and of course their inherent plausibility, their consistency with such objective evidence as there may be and so forth.  Given that IXU’s case is to be remitted in any event we see no value in attempting to discern to what extent the CA may or may not have given sufficient weight to the “age factor”. </p>
