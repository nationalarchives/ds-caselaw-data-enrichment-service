	    <p style="margin-left:0.69in;margin-right:0.00in">The father appeals from the dismissal on 8 April 2020 by Judd J of his application under the 1980 Hague Child Abduction Convention (“the 1980 Convention”) for an order that the parties’ child (B) be returned to France.  The application was dismissed because the judge decided that B was habitually resident in Australia, and not in France, at the date of the mother’s retention of B in England and Wales and that, as a result, the 1980 Convention did not apply.  The judge did not, therefore, determine whether the mother had established either acquiescence or the existence of a grave risk under Article 13(b), both of which she relied upon. </p>

They arrived in France on 2 December.  On 20 December the family came to England and Wales to stay with the mother’s family over the Christmas holidays.  The father returned to France on 27 December to commence his new job.  On 3 January 2020 the mother told the father that she and B would not be returning to France.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.69in;margin-right:0.00in">The mother’s case was that the “door to a return [to Australia] was very much open and both parents ensured they had a ‘safety net’ so that they could return to Australia in the event that their move to France did not work out or in the event that the father’s 6-month probationary [work] period was not successful”.  A number of other specific matters were relied on including: the father continued with his application for a permanent Australian visa (based on the mother’s citizenship); the mother’s employment remained open for her to return in 2021; the family remained registered with their GP, paediatrician, dentist and health visitor in Australia (although they had suspended their medical insurance); B did not have a bed in “their temporary French home”; the mother described “in some detail, the isolation she felt in” France; neither B nor the mother “speak anything beyond conversational French”; and that there were difficulties in the marriage. </p>

The fact she was more integrated in her Australian life would not mean that she could not achieve some degree of integration in France, a lesser degree of integration but still sufficient.

She had her doubts right from the very beginning, she felt excluded because of the language barrier, she was not able to drive, she did not have use of her mobile phone, or easy use of a bank account.  Regardless of whose, indeed if it was anyone’s fault at all, the mother was unsettled and unhappy both in the relationship and otherwise during the period when she was in France.  That must be clear from what happened afterwards. </p>

The mother had joined a group of English-speaking people on Facebook but none of them lived nearby and she did not see any of them.  Although I accept that the father was in a different situation from the mother, in that he spoke the language and was returning to the country of his birth and upbringing, with the mother feeling as she did, the family unit was simply not at all the same as it had been in Australia.  Apart from possibly one or two visits to the library, [B] had not really begun the process of getting into the sort of life a toddler of her age does, for example, by going to any toddler groups, or parent and toddler groups, or attending any social get togethers at all, although I accept of course she spent time with paternal relatives.  She had not visited the nurseries that she was to attend and the process of integration into that was only due to start in early January. </p>

I have been conscious at all times while considering the evidence and law in this case that it is highly unusual for a court to find that a child has no habitual residence.  No doubt it is very unusual as well as undesirable for an individual, a child or an adult, to have no habitual residence at a particular point in time but it does occasionally happen and particularly at a junction like this when a family has just moved from across the world to a new place and then they organise a holiday very soon afterwards.  Having said that, the roots in Australia were strong ones for the mother and B at least and I have concluded they had not loosened to the extent they had lost habitual residence there.  Even if I am wrong about that I am clear that neither of them had gained habitual residence in France.” </p>

In support of this submission, he relied on <span style="font-style:italic">Re J (A Child) (Finland) (Habitual Residence)</span> [2017] 2 FCR 542 in which Black LJ (as she then was) had acknowledged the force in the submission made in that case, at [57], that the judge had concentrated “entirely on the situation as it was in Finland” (to which the child had moved from England) and, at [61], had “failed to put [the ‘English factors’] into the melting pot”.  In this context, Mr Harrison “took issue” with [17](viii) of Hayden J’s summary in <span style="font-style:italic">Re B</span> because, he submitted, it does not properly reflect the nature of the parallel exercise required; by “focusing only on the degree of connection with the old state and not on other matters [it] distorts the exercise”. </p>

In contrast, article 31 specifically provides that, for the purpose of interpretation, a treaty comprises, “in addition to the text, … its preamble and annexes”.

This framework created a number of problems with a return to a third state.  Under these provisions, the courts with substantive jurisdiction are those in the state in which the child is habitually resident.  Sending a child to another state could mean that that state had no substantive jurisdiction to make welfare decisions which, Ms Renton submitted, strongly militates against there being such a power under the 1980 Convention.  Both BIIa and the 1996 Convention also respectively provide, by articles 10 and 7, that the state of habitual residence retains jurisdiction after an abduction until certain conditions have been satisfied. </p>

It first addresses, at [107] and [108], the “problem of determining the period during which the authorities concerned must order the return of the child forthwith”.  This was resolved with the imposition of a one year time limit for the automatic application of the 1980 Convention but, because of concerns that this was inflexible, this was coupled with scope for a later application provided that child was not “settled”.  This is explained as follows: </p>

The solution finally adopted plainly extends the Convention's scope by maintaining indefinitely a real obligation to return the child.  In any event, it cannot be denied that such an obligation disappears whenever it can be shown that 'the child is now settled in its new environment'.  The provision does not state how this fact is to be proved, but it would seem logical to regard such a task as falling upon the abductor or upon the person who opposes the return of the child, whilst at the same time preserving the contingent discretionary power of internal authorities in this regard.  In any case, the proof or verification of a child's establishment in a new environment opens up the possibility of longer proceedings than those envisaged in the first paragraph.  Finally, and as much for these reasons as for the fact that the return will, in the very nature of things, always occur much later than one year after the abduction, the Convention does not speak in this context of return 'forthwith' but merely of return. </p>

The Convention did not accept a proposal to the effect that the return of the child should always be to the State of its habitual residence before its removal.  Admittedly, one of the underlying reasons for requiring the return of the child was the desire to prevent the 'natural' jurisdiction of the courts of the State of the child's residence being evaded with impunity, by force.  However, including such a provision in the Convention would have made its application so inflexible as to be useless.  In fact, we must not forget that it is the right of children not to be removed from a particular environment which sometimes is a basically family one, which the fight against international child abductions seeks to protect.  Now, when the applicant no longer lives in what was the State of the child's habitual residence prior to its removal, the return of the child to that State might cause practical problems which would be difficult to resolve.  The Convention's silence on this matter must therefore be understood as allowing the authorities of the State of refuge to return the child directly to the applicant, regardless of the latter's present place of residence.” </p>

It is to be noted that article 12 does not contain any such restriction, and that Professor Pérez-Vera's Report at para 110 makes clear that the decision not to do so was deliberate.  The reason given is that whilst ordinarily that state will be the obvious state to which return should be made, there may be circumstances in which it would be against the interests of the child for that to be the destination of return.  The example given is of the applicant custodial parent who has, in the meantime, moved to a different state.  The propriety, in such circumstances, of an order returning the child to the new home state of the custodial parent is not in issue in this case.  For the reasons given above, the silence of article 12 on the destination of a return order is of no help on the issue which does arise, namely whether an order for return can be made if at the time of the wrongful act the child was habitually resident in the requested state.  It is however to be observed in passing that the unusual circumstances envisaged in para 110 of the Pérez-Vera Report were held at first instance to have arisen in <span style="font-style:italic">O v O (Child Abduction: Return to Third Country)</span> [2014] Fam 87 and there did result in an order for return to the new home state.” </p>

In his application under the 1980 Convention, the father sought the child’s return to Hungary because he had left Germany and returned to live in Hungary.  The return order was set aside because, as set out in my judgment at [57], it was “in effect a relocation order”.  It was ordering neither a return to the state in which the child had been habitually resident at the relevant date nor a return to the state “to which the custodial parent had moved”.

Before the date set for the transfer the mother removed the child to Israel.  The mother’s argument that the Court could not order return of the child to Belgium because his habitual residence was in France was rejected. Justice Arbel stated that in most cases returning the child to a third country would not give effect to the objectives of the Convention of returning the child to a familiar everyday life.  However, in cases where it is not practicable to return the child to the place of habitual residence, then it may be preferable to return the child to a third country than to leave him in the State of refuge, especially where the third country was a place with which he was familiar, for example, where he had lived there previously or had visited the left-behind parent there.  Furthermore, in this particular case, if the child had not been abducted, he would have in any event moved to live in Belgium in accordance with the Belgian Court’s decision, which was enforceable in France.  Thus, returning the child to France, from where he would be sent to Belgium in any event, would only lead to unnecessary prolongation of the process of returning the child to his father, in contravention of the purpose of the Convention” </p>

It requires an evaluation of all relevant circumstances.  It focuses on the situation of the child, with the purposes and intentions of the parents being merely among the relevant factors.  It is necessary to assess the degree of integration of the child into a social and family environment in the country in question.  The social and family environment of an infant or young child is shared with those (whether parents or others) on whom she is dependent.  Hence it is necessary, in such a case, to assess the integration of that person or persons in the social and family environment of the country concerned.

When he turned to the particular facts concerning B, in a section headed “Application” commencing at [48], he was even further from stating principles than he had been at [46], having turned his attention to what, as a matter of fact, should be the finding as to habitual residence in that case.

Why, it might be asked, should the taking parent at that stage be able to avoid the effect of the Convention and why should the child be deprived of the remedy provided by the Convention?  I do not consider it sufficient to answer that question simply by responding with the answer that such an order is not expressly included within the terms of the Convention.  A principled answer must be identified as to why it is or is not within the scope of the 1980 Convention.  In my view, the principled answer is that it is within the scope of the Convention. </p>

To exclude the remedy of a return to a third state would not protect children in that situation from the harmful effects of abduction.  I do not consider that it is any answer to this to say that an alternative jurisdiction would be available in England and Wales.  As an international convention, the 1980 Convention operates autonomously and its interpretation cannot depend on the vagaries of domestic laws.

This answer troubled me at the time but, on reflection, it does provide a principled basis for interpreting the Convention as including such a power.

The parties could, of course, seek to address this through Articles 8 or 9 but this would apply equally to England and Wales and France. </p>

This appears to have been significantly because “the mother did not become at all integrated into France” and “the family unit was simply not the same as it had been in Australia”.  In respect of Australia, the judge’s decision was based on her conclusion that “the roots in Australia … had not loosened to the extent that [the mother and B] had lost habitual residence there”.   </p>

The father had employment.  It was where the father was from so, at least for him, he was returning to an environment with which he was very familiar. </p>

The same point was made in <span style="font-style:italic">Mercredi v Chaffe</span>, at [55]: “An infant necessarily shares the social and family environment of the circle of people on whom he or she is dependent”.

In my view, Ms Renton sought to place far more weight on the judge’s analysis, at [20], than it can bear.  This paragraph, with the judge’s bare conclusion that the roots in Australia were strong and had not loosened, does not sufficiently reflect the nature and extent of the family’s continuing connections with Australia.  The family’s continuing connections with Australia could only be described as tenuous.  The matters relied on by the mother, in support of her argument that the door had been left open to a return to Australia, are plainly insufficient to counterbalance the extent of the family’s “disengagement” from Australia. </p>

Looking at the totality of the family’s circumstances at the relevant date, I conclude that the child had achieved some degree of integration into a social and family environment in France.  This was an example of the type of case, identified by Lady Hale, at [63], in <span style="font-style:italic">In re LC (Children) (Reunite International Child Abduction Centre intervening)</span> [2014] AC 1038<span style="font-style:italic">C</span>, of a family leaving their home country with the intention of emigrating, having made all necessary plans, and thereby losing one habitual residence immediately and acquiring a new one very quickly. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.69in;margin-right:0.00in">Like my Lord, I consider that the judge erred in focusing on the position of the mother rather than the family unit as a whole.  Furthermore, although the judge warned herself that there should not be “any sort of equivalence” between the family’s situation in France and Australia, it is clear reading her judgment as a whole that, when assessing the degree of current integration in France, she used the degree of historic integration Australia as a comparator.  To my mind, this is a further illustration of the need for caution, identified by Moylan LJ in his judgment in the recent decision in <span style="font-style:italic">M (Children) (Habitual Residence: 1980 Hague Child Abduction Convention)</span> [2020] EWCA Civ 1105, when applying the “see-saw” analogy suggested by Lord Wilson in <span style="font-style:italic">In re B (A Child) (Reunite International Child Abduction Centre and others intervening)</span> [2016] AC 606.  There is a danger that the analogy may lead judges to think that, when a family moves from one country to another, there needs to be an equivalent degree of integration in the second country to that enjoyed in the first before habitual residence in the second country can be acquired. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.69in;margin-right:0.00in">At the hearing before the judge, it was accepted on behalf of the father that his application under the 1980 Convention depended on B being habitually resident in France.  Although the third state issue was referred to in a skeleton argument filed on behalf of the mother, it was apparently not raised by counsel then appearing on behalf of the father.  In the light of the view reached by this court that the child had acquired habitual residence in France, the question whether the court has the power under the 1980 Convention to order the return of the child to a country other than the state of her habitual residence does not arise on this appeal.  In my view, this question is complex and finely balanced.  The point was not taken before the judge and, although it was fully argued before us, our decision on habitual residence means that any comment I may make on this question would be entirely obiter.  For my part, I would prefer to refrain from expressing any view until the issue falls for substantive determination. </p>
