	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">While acting for an Indonesian company which was to provide finance in connection with a share sale agreement, the respondent firm of solicitors (“Ashurst”) provided a written confirmation to the appellant bank (“the Bank”) that it had been put in funds in an amount not less than US $85 million and that it had received irrevocable instructions to transfer these funds into an escrow account or, in the event that the proposed escrow agreement was not signed within 30 days, to continue to hold the funds pending agreement between the parties on an alternative arrangement. The Bank says that, in reliance on that confirmation, it agreed to release its security to enable the transaction to proceed. It is now apparent, however, that although Ashurst did receive the US $85 million into its client account, within about 2 ½ months the money was no longer there and the balance of the client account had been reduced to zero. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In the event, although it obtained the shares, the buyer failed to pay the agreed price and the Bank has commenced this action, not only against the buyer but also against Ashurst, claiming that by issuing the confirmation, Ashurst undertook obligations of which it is in breach and made representations which were untrue.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">This appeal arises as a result of requests by the Bank for disclosure of documents and Further Information relating to the instructions which Ashurst had received from its client. Moulder J ordered Ashurst to disclose the balances on its client account during the relevant period, but otherwise refused the Bank’s applications, holding that the material sought was privileged. This is an appeal against that refusal. </p>

At the heart of the Bank’s case, however, is a claim that, by giving the Solicitor’s Confirmation, Ashurst undertook that it would continue to hold the Escrow Amount as security for payment of the Purchase Price unless either (1) the Escrow Agreement was signed or (2) an alternative agreement was concluded as contemplated by clause 4.2 of the Sale and Purchase Agreement; and that, as neither of these things had happened, that security should still have been held by Ashurst and available for enforcement of any judgment against ACE. </p>

It accepts also that if the parties did not sign the Escrow Agreement, it was obliged to retain the money, but only for so long as “an alternative arrangement to achieve the same commercial purpose” was “pending”, which it interprets as meaning for so long as there remained a realistic prospect of such an arrangement being reached.

It pleads at paragraph 36 of its Defence that the Confirmation “did not address what would happen in the event that the parties did reach agreement as contemplated by clause 4.2 of the [Sale and Purchase Agreement]” and that in that event it would be for its client, SM Multiartha, to decide what instructions to give. That seems somewhat odd. It means that Ashurst accepts that it was obliged to retain the money “pending” an alternative arrangement, but under no obligation in the event that such an alternative arrangement was successfully concluded. However, in the event there was no alternative arrangement and it is unnecessary to pursue that oddity further in this appeal. </p>

The first issue is whether the Bank is entitled to recover the Purchase Price from ACE. If it is not, the question whether the Escrow Amount should have been available to it as security will be academic. But on the assumption that it is so entitled, the second issue is as to the meaning and effect of the Solicitor’s Confirmation. If, as the Bank contends, Ashurst undertook that it would continue to hold the Escrow Amount unless either (1) the Escrow Agreement was signed or (2) an alternative agreement was concluded, so that it would be available as security for payment of the Purchase Price, Ashurst is in breach of that obligation. On the other hand, if the effect of the Confirmation was as pleaded by Ashurst, Ashurst was entitled to return the funds to its client or at its client’s direction once it became apparent that no “alternative arrangement” would be concluded and the claim against it will fail.  </p>

In this court, Mr David Wolfson QC for Ashurst has made clear that disclosure is not resisted on the ground that the documents are irrelevant but solely on the ground of privilege. That may be, as he suggests, because Ashurst would wish to disclose the documents if it is free to do so, but takes the view that it has a duty to its client to assert any properly arguable claim for privilege in circumstances where (as we are told) the client has declined a request to waive privilege (cf. <span style="font-style:italic">Nationwide Building Society v Various Solicitors</span> [1999] PNLR 52 at 69B-C). </p>

The only real issue is as to the scope of that obligation, which will depend on the meaning and effect of the Confirmation. That must be determined objectively by reference to the language of the Confirmation set in its commercial context. It seems to me that none of the documents sought are relevant to that issue. What instructions Ashurst in fact received cannot affect the true construction of the Confirmation. If on that true construction it undertook to retain the money but failed to do so, it will be liable. If not, it will not be liable. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.00in">“Although originally confined to advice regarding litigation, the privilege was extended to non-litigious business. Nevertheless, despite that extension, the purpose and scope of the privilege is still to enable legal advice to be sought and given in confidence. In my judgment, therefore, the test is whether the communication or other document was made confidentially for the purposes of legal advice. Those purposes have to be construed broadly. Privilege obviously attaches to a document conveying legal advice from solicitor to client and to a specific request from the client for such advice. But it does not follow that all other communications between them lack privilege. In most solicitor and client relationships, especially where a transaction involves protracted dealings, advice may be required or appropriate on matters great or small at various stages. There will be a continuum of communication and meetings between the solicitor and client. The negotiations for a lease such as occurred in the present case are only one example. Where information is passed by the solicitor or client to the other as part of the continuum aimed at keeping both informed so that advice may be sought and given as required, privilege will attach. A letter from the client containing information may end with such words as ‘please advise me what I should do’. But, even if it does not, there will usually be implied in the relationship an overall expectation that the solicitor will at each stage, whether asked specifically or not, tender appropriate advice. Moreover, legal advice is not confined to telling the client the law; it must include advice as to what should prudently and sensibly be done in the relevant legal context.” </p>

First, the communication between solicitor and client must be confidential. Second, the communication must be “for the purpose of legal advice” (or, which is the same thing, it must occur in a “relevant legal context”). However, if these two conditions are satisfied, communications between solicitor and client will be privileged notwithstanding that some of them may not themselves be concerned either to seek or to provide legal advice.

The client must be sure that what he tells his lawyer in confidence will never be revealed without his consent. Legal professional privilege is thus much more than an ordinary rule of evidence, limited in its application to the facts of a particular case. It is a fundamental condition on which the administration of justice as a whole rests." </p>

It arose out of the alleged settlement of a personal injuries claim. When the claimant issued proceedings for damages, the defendant pleaded that the claim had been settled by acceptance of terms of settlement offered in correspondence by the claimant’s solicitors. In his reply the claimant denied making any settlement agreement and asserted that if his former solicitors had purported to conclude a settlement on his behalf, they had done so without his authority. The defendant sought to administer interrogatories requiring the claimant to say whether the former solicitors had been acting as his solicitors as at the date when they had offered the terms of settlement, whether the claimant had authorised them to negotiate settlement terms with the defendant, and whether or when any such instructions had been withdrawn. The claimant objected to answering each of these interrogatories “on the ground that it is an inquiry as to the communications passing between me and a solicitor confidentially and in his professional character and is thereby privileged”. </p>

Equally, if two parties come to an agreement through their authorised agents the agreement ought to be binding between the principals of agents who had authority to enter into the agreement. If the agents be solicitors on each side, there may be a danger of the two rules or principles appearing to be in conflict. That which the client says to the solicitor normally is privileged, but if the client says to the solicitor: ‘Settle this case for me on these terms’, and the solicitors does so, a different position arises, for it may be that that which the client says to the solicitor is an instruction to the solicitor: ‘Tell this to the other side’, and, if the solicitor, acting on his client’s instructions, tells the solicitor on the other side: ‘I have my client’s instructions to accept £1,000 and costs’, and as a result of that an agreement is arrived at between the two solicitors in complete accord and satisfaction of the claim, I do not think that the first client can claim privilege in respect of that which he has said to his solicitor and at the same time has told his solicitor to communicate to the other side. </p>

It is, I think, plain that, if there are professional communications between a solicitor and his client of a confidential character for the purpose of getting legal advice, then, in general, there is privilege and protection.  But that is not the case here. The interrogatories are directed to the three letters, and the plaintiff is invited to look at the three letters. When those letters are examined a fair and reasonable reading of them is: ‘My client authorises me to say to you that he will accept such and such an amount in settlement’. That being so, an inquiry whether the plaintiff did or did not authorise his solicitor to write those letters is not an inquiry as to communications passing between the plaintiff and his solicitor confidentially. There is no suggestion in this case of asking for the disclosure of anything that the solicitors may have said to the plaintiff in regard to his claim generally or by way of giving advice as to the prospects of the action. The inquiry that is raised is whether the plaintiff did or did not authorise his solicitor to write certain letters which state that the plaintiff will accept a certain sum.” </p>

In <span style="font-style:italic">Benecke v National Australia Bank</span> (1993) 35 NSWLR 110, a decision of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, the facts were similar to those in <span style="font-style:italic">Conlon</span>. After judgment in court proceedings had been entered in accordance with the terms of a settlement signed by the claimant’s counsel, the claimant commenced further proceedings alleging that the settlement was not authorised by her and gave an account of what she contended were the instructions which she had given to her former counsel. The defendant sought to contradict that account by calling the claimant’s former counsel as a witness, but the claimant contended that the communications between her and counsel were privileged. The court held that privilege had been lost because the claimant herself had put in issue the content of the communications in question. Gleeson CJ said at 111F-112A: </p>

However, it did not enable the appellant to make public her version of those communications and, at the same time, to enforce silence on the part of others who disagreed with that version. The law permits the search for the truth in legal proceedings to yield, in certain circumstances, to the public interest in preserving the secrecy of communications between lawyer and client. In the present case, however, the appellant herself lifted the veil of secrecy by giving her version of the communications. Thereafter, there was no reason in principle why the pursuit of the truth should not take its course, or why the court should be inhibited in seeking to ascertain the true facts concerning those communications.” </p>

Certainly, it was not referred to in the judgments. The difference in approach may simply be a function of the way in which the cases were argued. For my part, the approach taken in <span style="font-style:italic">Benecke</span> is preferable. It is not hard to imagine circumstances in which settlement discussions between lawyer and client might be far reaching and cover a variety of subjects. When the result of those discussions is made known to a third party, privilege might continue to attach to part of the discussions. In those circumstances it may be difficult to segregate the discussions into aspects that did, and those that did not, attract privilege. It seems to me to be preferable to approach the matter by looking at the end result. On this basis the correct approach is to assume that privilege initially applied to the discussions and then to ask whether the conduct of the parties (particularly the client), the nature of the dispute that has since arisen and the interests of justice generally require a conclusion that privilege was waived in relation to all or part of the discussions. This also accords with the simple proposition that waiver itself may be partial or total: see <span style="font-style:italic">Lyell v Kennedy (No 3)</span> (1884) 27 Ch D 1 at 24. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.00in">I believe that this view flows from the principles underlying the privilege. The aim is to encourage uninhibited communication between lawyer and client. Confidentiality is an indispensable feature of that requirement. In my opinion, the fact that at the conclusion of the discussions both solicitor and client knew that the result was to be communicated to the other side does not mean that the discussions were never of a type that would attract the seal of confidentiality. It means that the course of events has been such that something which initially may have been confidential can no longer be regarded in the same light. In other words, the privilege that once attached to the communication has been waived. </p>

I respectfully agree with that analysis. The question then arises whether it is open to us to say that <span style="font-style:italic">Conlon</span> should be understood in this way. I would hold that it is. While it is true that the judgments are not expressly reasoned in this way, these were <span style="font-style:italic">extempore</span> judgments somewhat shortly expressed and it is axiomatic that any decision must be understood by reference to the facts of the case in question. The fact that it was the client who put in issue the instructions which he had given to his solicitors was obviously a striking and important feature of the case. I doubt whether Singleton and Morris LJJ were seeking to lay down any general rule which would apply when that feature was not present but, if they were, they went further than was necessary for the decision in the case. It is also worth bearing in mind that <span style="font-style:italic">Conlon</span> was decided before the decision of the House of Lords in <span style="font-style:italic">Derby Magistrates</span> which confirmed the absolute nature of privilege and ruled out any scope for a balancing of competing principles. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In this regard it is helpful to consider what it is that the Bank is (presumably) seeking to obtain. The argument is that the instructions were not confidential because the client authorised Ashurst to make the statements contained in the Confirmation. But Mr Foxton accepts that Ashurst must have had instructions to provide the Confirmation. The Bank is not interested in seeing (for example, and if it exists) a letter from SM Multiartha saying merely, “We authorise you to provide the Solicitor’s Confirmation”. That would tell it nothing which it does not already know. What the Bank appears to want is more detail of the communications between SM Multiartha and Ashurst, going beyond what is apparent from the Confirmation itself, and which will provide it with information which it does not already have. But I can see no reason why such matters should cease to be confidential as between solicitor and client merely because the client authorised Ashurst to make the statements contained in the Confirmation. In making those statements Ashurst was, as the judge said, undertaking an independent obligation to the Bank and (adopting what Blackburne J said in <span style="font-style:italic">Nationwide</span>) there was no question of the client authorising Ashurst to say any more about the instructions which it had received or the communications between Ashurst and its client. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In this case Ashurst was instructed by SM Multiartha in connection with the acquisition of the ARM shares by ACE, a transaction in which SM Multiartha was to provide financing. As the judge said, that will have involved Ashurst in providing legal advice (including advice as to what should prudently and sensibly be done in the relevant legal context, as Taylor LJ put it in <span style="font-style:italic">Balabel</span>) to ensure that its clients’ interests were protected and its commercial objectives were achieved. This is the core business of City solicitors such as Ashurst. Its role will no doubt have included negotiating and reviewing the terms of the documentation, including the Solicitor’s Confirmation, and advising its client as to the meaning and effect of that Confirmation. Such advice is likely to have included advising as to the significance of the statement that the instructions which it had received were “irrevocable” and the circumstances, if any, in which the client would be entitled to the return of the money. It would to my mind be surprising if Ashurst had not given such advice. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">This is almost inevitably the context in which Ashurst will have received its instructions as to the basis on which the money should be held in its client account and the Confirmation should be provided. It is by its nature a legal context directly related to the performance by Ashurst of its professional duties as the client’s solicitor. It would be wrong in my judgment to seek to isolate specific communications as constituting “the instructions” for the purpose of disclosure without regard to that context, even assuming that it would be practicable to do so (Mr Wolfson suggested that, at least in some cases, it may not be). Rather those instructions formed part of a continuum of communications in a relevant legal context, which were therefore privileged. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Similar reasoning applies to any later changes to the instructions or to instructions by the client that the money should be returned to it or paid out of the client account in accordance with its instructions. It is almost inevitable that Ashurst will have considered whether it was entitled to comply with such instructions and will have advised its client accordingly. That is the context in which the money will have been paid away. It would be surprising if Ashurst were to have paid the money away without first having formed the view, and advised its client, that it was entitled to do so. Whether that view will turn out to be correct is another matter. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Like the judge, I would not accept that Ashurst was doing no more than a bank might have done in making a statement as to the basis on which it was holding money. While it may be, I suppose, that a bank or any other third party could have been asked to make such a statement, it was not merely fortuitous that the statement came to be made by a respected firm of City solicitors, whose probity and reliability were unquestioned, and which was already involved in and familiar with the transaction. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Nor would I accept Mr Foxton’s submission that the instructions given to Ashurst were like an instruction to a solicitor to collect rent on behalf of his client. This was an example discussed by Taylor LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Balabel</span> of a situation in which the solicitor’s instructions would not be privileged: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.00in">“A hypothetical instance put in argument by Mr Burton would be a case in which a client going on extended holiday instructed his solicitor to collect rent from his tenants. If an issue subsequently arose as to whether the landlord had waived any right to forfeiture, the communication of those instructions to his solicitor would be disclosable and admissible because there would be no question of their being related to the obtaining of legal advice.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">That is some distance from the facts of the present case, but in any event the example appears to assume that the client was seeking to forfeit the lease for non-payment of rent by denying that he had authorised his solicitor to collect the rent in question and thereby waived the right to forfeiture. It is therefore an example which is consistent with the approach of the Australian cases referred to above and with what I have held to be the correct understanding of the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Conlon</span>. </p>
