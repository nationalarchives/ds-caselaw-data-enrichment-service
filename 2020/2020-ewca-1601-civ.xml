The claims were heard at the East London Hearing Centre over 7 sitting days in April 2017 by a three-member ET chaired by Employment Judge Prichard. A decision dismissing all the claims was promulgated on 17 July 2017. The Appellant filed a notice of appeal against the ET judgment on 12 January 2018. The EAT (Choudhury P) heard the appeal on 7 February 2019 and handed down judgment dismissing the appeal on 21 June 2019. I granted permission to appeal to this court on 15 November 2019. The appeal was due to be heard in May 2020 but was postponed because of the pandemic. </p>

The price will go up because that is what a large order of a certain instrument will do to the price of a bond. The trader has bought a smaller amount in the bank’s own right. The private knowledge that a larger amount is soon to be acquired makes this analogous to insider dealing. The illustration just given is the simplest paradigm case. There are more subtle variants. The practice is illegal both in the US and the UK, under the respective Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) regulatory codes. </p>

In fact on the same day Steve Gooden had stated to a trader Julian Sanchez-Agus: “Hi mate … I’m still not live to trade … once I’m up and running we will trade”. “Agreed thanks mate” and “please give the details to Thomas he will look at it”. “OK”.

Nor does the earlier Bloomberg chat suggest, as was put in evidence, that Thomas Blondin was front running the Ukrainian trade. It was a speculative accusation because the claimant could not see all the information around Thomas Blondin’s trade. It would not have been visible to him. He was just making constructs from overheard one-sided telephone conversations.  </p>

The way this was presented to the tribunal was a long way short of the way it was described in the claimant’s ET1. The claimant states he unequivocally told Erich Bauer-Rowe about traders on the desk front running and misleading clients and that Mr Bauer-Rowe seem to be in agreement with him and said he would have a chat with them next time he was in London but he was not due to be in London for over a month. If there really had been regulatory breaches or if the claimant had really given Mr Bauer-Rowe cause to believe that there were such breaches, it is inconceivable that Mr Bauer-Rowe would not have notified Compliance immediately to look into the deals.

That would be extraordinary if the claimant really had raised regulatory breaches. The meeting was unmemorable to him because he would routinely meet any sales person from elsewhere who visited New York. The tribunal accepts that he is experienced enough in the business (with a trading background) that this would have stuck out if it had in fact happened. All Mr Bauer-Rowe does remember, (as so many others), was the claimant complaining about his commissions. That would not be a protected disclosure. There was no public interest. The tribunal finds as a fact that the claimant did not further mention Steve Gooden trading without FCA approval at all. That too would have made the meeting memorable to Mr Bauer- Rowe. The respondent argues that it is a figment of the claimant’s imagination. The tribunal agrees. Under examination the claimant rather lost his grip on this particular alleged disclosure.  </p>

I mean these are distressed bonds you know like the economic hit could have been substantial had the bonds rallied 10 points today. But the biggest thing is the trust right.

At this stage Mr Blondin had sorted out the situation satisfactorily but it remained an alarming near miss with a distressed bond. (Distress implies a high probability of default on a bond). Again Mr Blondin described the lack of trust in a detailed and well observed way: “If Dray is not forthright and telling the truth to the desk there is a problem. Like I ask him point blank I said Dray did you do the trade yesterday or not and it took him two minutes to start you know talking some long complicated answer.

He was again repeatedly stressing his lack of trust in Thomas Blondin and the lack of transparency over his sales commissions. He was mistrustful. Again this is based on pure speculation. There could have been a legitimate reason for Thomas Blondin’s conduct of that sale. As the claimant himself said, he could have been covering a short. He was pressed for the detail of this apparently detailed trade with an unidentified client. He failed to come up with any explanation to the tribunal.

That was a decision which we now know was taken by Erich Bauer-Rowe. The end of the email states: “I know you like to just let things run but when the guy who’s suppose to be running your business here in Europe does not do it in a proper way then I’ve got issues and I’ve been doing this too long to be afraid of speaking up.” </p>

There was a Bloomberg chat between Charles Cortellesi and the claimant at which the claimant returns to an old theme: “going to send you an email with a couple of issues to discuss …. some are already addressed others not … Tough being here where the traders control everything and no oversight”. Mr Cortellesi: “Call me” and there was a call then. It seems to have been a 30 minute call.

So how does that impact me? How it impacts me is I have stuff like someone comes in a buyer of Ukrainian bond which is super liquid then we’re bidding on a screen or to some off screen bookie and its moved against my client, and what happens is….” Cortellesi: “What you’re saying is that they are taking the information that you gave them then they’re moving their screen against your client”. Claimant: “Yeah. So what happens is Steve makes a ton of money in Ukraine …. oh yeah he’s God now and I am like well fuck man, I fed you guys information I had some orders so it doesn’t show up in my numbers because my guys didn’t get executed because they are showing preference to other clients so whether they get paid for it or not ….they wanna look like the big guy.”  </p>

In closing submissions we listened to a voice recording of the Bloomberg chat. But Charles Cortellesi disagrees with his entire assumption here stating: “Okay if they’re trying to push the market up then why don’t you find buyers and help them push the market up?” Mr Cortellesi had previously said in response: “to think about it because you know this is the model I have been operating under for 10 years”. So in other words Mr Cortellesi did not consider that the claimant, with this hypothetical illustration, was actually describing front-running. It did not necessarily involve a regulatory breach and unlawful use of insider knowledge of an impending large purchase of Ukrainian bonds. We stress again it was hypothetical. The claimant was not identifying any particular trade here. </p>

It is extraordinary that the claimant would keep quiet about this allegedly blatant example of front running for a whole month without telling compliance, without raising it to Charles Cortellesi with sufficient detail. Mr Wale is quite certain, judging from the trade tickets for that day, there was no front running. The Kazak bonds were bought from account 20 for 0.97 US dollars 5.5m once they were sold 5½ hours later for 0.970625 dollars. (profit of $3,437.50)  </p>

If there was a serious belief that this was blatant front running it would have been a prime example to put before Mr Moore with more urgency. He ultimately did raise concerns with Mr Moore as his email to Mr Moore of 15 August was only a general enquiry. It was not stated to be an urgent enquiry.  </p>

Mr Cortellesi explained his position further: “You know you’ve been telling me that you can’t take this guy any longer and I’ve been pushing back and pushing back because I know how difficult it is to bring someone into that seat and you know the thing about sales people is difficult personalities.

The claimant had ostensibly gone there, he thought, to discuss his commissions but nothing like that was discussed. What was discussed was the claimant’s conduct in going directly to Compliance and dangling the carrot of “other examples” without providing any details. That was not proper. The claimant put himself in breach of FCA regulation by not disclosing such details if, indeed, he genuinely believed there were breaches. Mr Neilly was angry with the claimant and asked to come out with all the details of these “examples” at once. Instead the claimant said he would be disclosing details to Martin Appiah, as in the paragraph above, but he never did. That was the best he was going to give Mr Neilly. So it is hard to see how the claimant can put this forward as a protected “disclosure” when on his own evidence, he procrastinated and disclosed nothing even though he was ordered to disclose it at once.  </p>

The last was most important because that specifically undermined trust. He said he would have to address the other team members to see if trust could be rebuilt or not. He was having doubts. The claimant did not hand over the notes he had been making, although they were later given to the respondent.

In summary: the claimant’s tendency to insinuate and to challenge others, and his hesitation and equivocation when challenged himself, militate against him ever making a disclosure of information (as opposed to allegations or just queries). The tribunal also consider that the origin of the claimant’s distrust was a money concern over commission payments. That meant that many of these alleged disclosures could never be in the public interest. Further having heard him giving evidence over a long period at the tribunal, the equivocation suggests that the claimant cannot have held a reasonable belief in what he was alleging. The vestigial evidence the claimant overheard on the account A trade, in which he was not involved, and the lack of a single other trade being disclosed to the respondent would suggest a lack of reasonable belief and the claimant bluffing about “other examples”.  </p>

Regarding the claimant’s dismissal, in the course of the above narrative, woven through the 37 alleged disclosures, it was clear to the tribunal that it had become utterly impossible for the team to work with the claimant. Thomas Blondin said (and it did not seem an empty threat), that if Mr Cortellesi insisted on keeping the claimant, he might be the only one left on the team. The team was exasperated with the claimant and, despite being told repeatedly, the claimant showed no sign of mending his ways. It would be utterly fanciful to state that the “principal reason” for his dismissal (s 103A Employment Rights Act 1996) was that the claimant had made protected disclosures. The team’s dissatisfaction was abundantly well investigated by the respondent and is well documented over a long period, a period which was as long as it was only because Mr Cortellesi kept “pushing back” until it was clear that was no longer an option. The claimant’s poor attendance was bad in its own right. Mr Neilly was appalled when he saw the records. But he ultimately found it just one aspect of the claimant being a poor team player. It was the lack of trust which proved most corrosive and was ultimately insuperable.  </p>

It is a contractual claim, and a claim for unlawful deductions from pay as well as a claim for whistle-blowing detriments. Detailed accounts were produced by the claimant and the respondent to show the amounts due when he was at work. There was in fact little variance. Many variations were due to the US Dollar / GBP exchange rate, deductions of fixed percentage overheads from profits, and calculation dates (the trade date or the date paid). The claimant, as stated throughout the above narrative, was never slow in complaining if he was underpaid to any extent. His main complaint was that he was forced to trust Thomas Blondin to accurately report the trades which determined the amount of sales commissions, as these were not fully visible to the claimant on the system.

He produced the Bloomberg trade tickets for all the named trades and explained to the tribunal how to read them.

On more than one of these trades, for instance, he stated it was arguable that the claimant had been overpaid.

Tribunals should, in all but the most straightforward of cases, endeavour to set out such a summary.

Whether or not there is an error depends on whether or not there has been substantial compliance. To answer that question, one needs to look closely at the entirety of the judgment. The specific challenge under Ground 1 of the appeal does not descend to the details of the judgment to make good the argument that there has not been substantial compliance. It is under Grounds 2 to 6 that the Claimant sets out instances of a failure to comply with the rule. ……. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.00in">26. In my judgment, the test is and remains one of substantial compliance with the rule. The then President stated in <span style="font-style:italic">Kellaway</span> that there is no “<span style="font-style:italic">automatic ground of appeal</span>”, where there is a failure to set out the relevant principles or a failure to make findings of fact on all the principal submissions made. The President went on to say that it has to be shown that omitting to set out the principles or key submissions made has led to a consequent error of law or incorrect finding of fact.  It might be said that that further requirement is no more than another way of stating that there needs to be substantial compliance with what is now contained in Rule 62(5) of the ET Rules. However, the use of the phrase “<span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">consequent</span><span style="font-style:italic"> error of law or incorrect finding of fact</span>”, might suggest that the EAT considered that it is not enough that there is a failure to comply with the rule and that an error of law will only arise where that failure gives rise to some consequential error of law. If that is the effect of the decision, then I would disagree with it. As is clear from the decisions of the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Balfour Beatty </span>and the EAT in <span style="font-style:italic">Greenwood</span> (neither of which cited <span style="font-style:italic">Kellaway</span>), a failure to establish substantial compliance with the rule will be enough in itself to amount to an error of law; there is no need to demonstrate that there is also some consequential error of law in some further respect (although clearly there will be cases where the lack of substantial compliance with Rule 62 goes hand in hand with other errors of law).” </p>

The ET found that Mr Neilly made the decision and like Choudhury P I regard that as a clear finding of fact. As to his reason or principal reason for doing so, the ET’s findings could not be clearer. The ET found at [160] that Mr Neilly and the Appellant had had a one-to-one meeting on 12 November at which Mr Neilly talked to the Appellant seriously and critically about his relations with the team and mentioned three points in descending order of importance – confrontational attitude, time-keeping and attendance and the taking of notes. </p>

Unlike Ms Jhuti, most employees will contribute to the decision-maker’s inquiry. The employer will advance a reason for the potential dismissal. The employee may well dispute it and may also suggest another reason for the employer’s stance. The decision-maker will generally address all rival versions of what has prompted the employer to seek to dismiss the employee and, if reaching a decision to do so, will identify the reason for it. In the present case, however, the reason for the dismissal given in good faith by Ms Vickers turns out to have been bogus. If a person in the hierarchy of responsibility above the employee (here Mr Widmer as Ms Jhuti’s line manager) determines that, for reason A (here the making of protected disclosures), the employee should be dismissed but that reason A should be hidden behind an invented reason B which the decision-maker adopts (here inadequate performance), it is the court’s duty to penetrate through the invention rather than to allow it also to infect its own determination. If limited to a person placed by the employer in the hierarchy of responsibility above the employee, there is no conceptual difficulty about attributing to the employer that person’s state of mind rather than that of the deceived decision-maker.” </p>

I think, in fact, that all that the EAT was seeking to say was that a statement which merely took the form, "You are not complying with Health and Safety requirements", would be so general and devoid of specific factual content that it could not be said to fall within the language of section 43B(1) so as to constitute a qualifying disclosure. It emphasised this by contrasting that with a statement which contained more specific factual content. That this is what the EAT was seeking to do is borne out by the fact that it itself referred to section 43F, which clearly indicates that some allegations do constitute qualifying disclosures, and by the fact that the statement "The wards have not been cleaned [etc]" could itself be an allegation if the facts were in dispute. It is unfortunate that this aspect of the EAT's reasoning at [24] is somewhat obscured in the headnote summary of this part of its decision, which can be read as indicating that a rigid distinction is to be drawn between "information" and "allegations".  </p>

Grammatically, the word "information" has to be read with the qualifying phrase, "which tends to show [etc]" (as, for example, in the present case, information which tends to show "that a person has failed or is likely to fail to comply with any legal obligation to which he is subject"). <span style="font-style:italic">In order for a statement or disclosure to be a qualifying disclosure according to this language, it has to have a sufficient factual content and specificity such as is capable of tending to show one of the matters listed in subsection (1). </span>The statements in the solicitors' letter in <span style="font-style:italic">Cavendish Munro</span> did not meet that standard<span style="font-style:italic">.”</span> (Emphasis added) </p>

Mr Reade drew attention particularly to disclosure 32, dealt with at paras [154]-[155] of the ET judgment. It may be that in the case of disclosure 32 they were, based on <span style="font-style:italic">Cavendish Munro</span>, applying too rigid a distinction between a query and information: indeed, as Mr Reade points out, the question asked was “could you let me know if the following <span style="font-style:italic">information</span> raises any issues?” [emphasis added]. But the ET rejected disclosure 32 on the further ground that it did not involve a reasonable belief on the part of the Appellant that there was a breach of FCA regulations. This should more accurately have been put as an issue of whether he had a reasonable belief that the information <span style="font-style:italic">tended </span>to show a breach of regulatory standards, but this is a minor error in the context of an alleged disclosure which appears, even on the Appellant’s case, to have played a very minor part in this complex story. </p>

If they had found a genuine belief to that effect they would have had to consider whether it was reasonable in the light of his expertise.

In that case (in which Mr Reade appeared for the appellant) Underhill LJ, giving the leading judgment, made four points about the nature of the exercise required by section 43B(1).

The particular reasons why the worker believes that to be so are not of the essence. That means that a disclosure does not cease to qualify simply because the worker seeks, as not uncommonly happens, to justify it after the event by reference to specific matters which the tribunal finds were not in his head at the time he made it. Of course, if he cannot give credible reasons for why he thought at the time that the disclosure was in the public interest, that may cast doubt on whether he really thought so at all; but the significance is evidential not substantive. Likewise, in principle a tribunal might find that the particular reasons why the worker believed the disclosure to be in the public interest did not reasonably justify his belief, but nevertheless find it to have been reasonable for different reasons which he had not articulated to himself at the time: all that matters is that his (subjective) belief was (objectively) reasonable.  </p>

Fourth, while the worker must have a genuine (and reasonable) belief that the disclosure is in the public interest, that does not have to be his or her predominant motive in making it: otherwise, as pointed out at para. 17 above, the new sections 49(6A) and 103(6A) would have no role. I am inclined to think that the belief does not in fact have to form any part of the worker's motivation – the phrase "<span style="text-decoration:underline">in</span> the belief" is not the same as "motivated by the belief"; but it is hard to see that the point will arise in practice, since where a worker believes that a disclosure is in the public interest it would be odd if that did not form at least some part of their motivation in making it.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I have left to the end the question (raised as part of Ground 1) of whether the ET’s failure to set out the relevant law means that its judgment was not <span style="font-style:italic">Meek-</span>compliant. Although I admire Mr Reade’s ability to make bricks without straw, it is really not difficult to understand why Mr Simpson lost. He lost because the ET found that (a) the decision to dismiss him was taken by Mr Neilly; (b) it was “utterly fanciful” to state that the reason was that the claimant had made protected disclosures; (c) it had become “utterly impossible” for his colleagues on his team to work with him; the lack of trust between them was “corrosive” and “ultimately insuperable”; (d) he had a poor attendance record, by which Mr Neilly was “appalled”; (e) Mr Neilly’s reasons were genuine and not the result of manipulation by others; and (f) none of the communications relied on was a protected disclosure, either because they were insufficiently specific or because Mr Simpson did not genuinely believe that the information contained in them tended to show malpractice at Cantor Fitzgerald. </p>
