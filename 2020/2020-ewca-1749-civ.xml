	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.03in">This is an appeal by Mr Lee Cant, the Appellant, against the order of Moulder J ("the Judge") on 3 June 2019, whereby she dismissed his without notice application for an anti-harassment injunction against Mr Stephen Seton, the Respondent ("the Application").  Both parties have appeared today in person.  The Respondent has very helpfully provided a carefully prepared paginated bundle which has been of great assistance to the court. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.03in">The Judge dismissed the Application on the single ground that she did not have jurisdiction to make the order sought.  Permission to appeal was granted on the limited basis that it was arguable that she was wrong to do so.  It was noted that the Judge appeared to have failed to consider whether she had jurisdiction by reference to section 37(1) of the Senior Courts Act 1981, or section 3 of the Protection from Harassment Act 1997. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.03in">The origin of the dispute between the parties appears to lie in a claim by the Respondent that the Appellant, an erstwhile accountant, owed him money.  The Appellant claims that at 7.00 pm on 29 May 2019, in the presence of three others and at what he describes as a "mediation meeting," the Respondent assaulted him - indeed attempted to murder him - causing serious injuries for which the Appellant was later treated in hospital. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.03in">On 3 June 2019 the Appellant issued an application for an injunction that the Respondent be "restrained, investigated" and "forbidden" to "go near or speak to" the Appellant and "do all as stated by equity lawyer by Mr Edward W Ellis".  This appears to be a reference to a Mr Ellis, a struck-off solicitor, who was, and remains, the subject of a civil restraint order. Mr Ellis has achieved notoriety through what have been described as "frequent and mischievous interventions" in the legal claims of others in furtherance of what he calls his UK mass remedy process (see, for example, <span style="font-style:italic">Awodiya &amp; Anor v HM Revenue and Customs</span><span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>[2019] EWHC 251 (Admin) (at paragraph 28)).  Much of the documentation that has been submitted by the Appellant here carries the hallmark of the involvement and/or encouragement of Mr Ellis. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.03in">The Application was supported by a one-page witness statement dated 30 May 2019 in which the Appellant alleged that the Respondent had, wholly without provocation, attempted to murder him.  The Respondent was said to have threatened the Appellant with further violence if he failed to comply with his demands for cash and threatened to visit the Appellant's home "or area" within seven days.  The Appellant stated that he was "terrified of any further violence" from the Respondent "and his accomplices" and required "police protection 24 hours a day".   </p>

The Respondent, having not been served with the Application or put on notice in any way, was neither present nor represented.  After the Appellant had submitted to the Judge that he had been severely beaten and assaulted and had been granted "state protection as a witness" and "protection by the Crown and the Lord's Bishops," he demanded police protection. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.03in">The Judge indicated at that stage that she did not have any power to grant such protection.  The Appellant needed to go to the police.  He was complaining of a criminal act in respect of which the court could do nothing in terms of granting protection.  The Judge said she had no relevant powers and dismissed the Application accordingly. </p>

HHJ Luba QC struck out and dismissed the claim for failure on the part of the Appellant to comply with court orders.  The Appellant had failed: (1) to establish proper service on the Respondent; (2) to file and serve Particulars of Claim; (3) to file and serve a proper witness statement; (4) to file and serve a medical report from a medical practitioner. </p>
