It alleged that Enka was liable under various identified provisions of the Russian Civil Code because it had performed the installation of the fuel oil pipelines .

The Court's view appears to have been that what was filed failed to particularise the allegations and the basis of liability sufficiently for the court to able to say that a legally viable claim against each separate defendant had been articulated.  Enka saw a copy of that ruling on 3 June 2019.   On 4 June 2019, Enka then received the filed statement of claim containing the Moscow Claim, although not its attachments. </p>

It went on to assert that in any event Chubb Russia, in exercising subrogated rights, was bound to arbitrate the dispute having stepped into the shoes of Unipro, referring to an attached memorandum prepared by Shearman &amp; Sterling LLP addressing the arbitrability of the Moscow Claim by reference to its nature and the scope of the arbitration agreement in clause 50.1 of the Contract.

Enka contended that if the arbitration agreement was, contrary to its primary case, governed by Russian law, the Court should decide on the Russian Law evidence before it that the Moscow Claim was brought in breach of the arbitration agreement and grant the final relief sought.

In his decision he took a course of his own initiative, not urged on him by either side, of declining to reach a decision on the proper law of the arbitration agreement and dismissing Enka’s claim against Chubb Russia, as a matter of final determination, on forum non conveniens grounds, namely that all questions of the scope of the arbitration agreement and its applicability to the Moscow Claim, including the conflicts issue as to the governing law of the arbitration agreement, were more appropriately to be determined by the Moscow Arbitrazh Court in the Russian proceedings.  The claim against Chubb Switzerland was determined by granting relief on its jurisdiction challenge application, setting aside Teare J’s order for service out against it, setting aside service and declaring that the Court had no jurisdiction to determine the claim.

The hearing took place on 22 January 2020 but the merits of the case were not addressed and the hearing was adjourned to 26 February 2020.  At the hearing on 26 February 2020 the judge did not hear all the parties in the allotted time and the hearing was adjourned again to take place on 16 March 2020 (and if necessary 18 March 2020).  In the course of the hearing on 16 March 2020 the judge announced that there would be a break in the hearing until 18 March indicating that she would then hear the parties’ closing statements and give judgment.  On 18 March 2020 the judge announced the operative part of her judgment after hearing closing statements.  She dismissed, on the merits, all of Chubb Russia’s claims against all defendants.  She also dismissed Enka’s motion seeking dismissal without considering the merits in reliance on the arbitration agreement. As is standard practice in Russian proceedings, the judge at this point announced only her decisions, not her reasons, which are to be given in a written judgment published by the court.   In normal times that typically occurs within 5-10 working days but the evidence is that given the complexity of the case and the COVID-19 crisis there may be a much longer delay; the written judgment had not been published at the time of the hearing of this appeal.  Chubb Russia will have one month from the date of written judgment within which to exercise its automatic right of appeal to the Arbitrazh Appellate Court in Moscow, which it has indicated its intention to do.   In normal circumstances the hearing of such an appeal might typically take place about two months after filing the appeal but again the COVID-19 crisis adds considerable uncertainty in predicting the timetable.  Enka may also appeal against the dismissal of its motion based on the arbitration agreement.  </p>

Article 18 of the ICC Rules enables the ICC Court to choose the seat of the arbitration in the absence of choice by the parties [63].  In this ICC context the choice of London as the seat indicates a joint personal preference to come to London rather than say Paris, Geneva, New York, Singapore or any other commonly chosen international arbitration venue [63]; it “perhaps may be taken to indicate a preference for the English court to be the court that gets involved, if any municipal court has ever to get involved, to assist the arbitral process during its life although even that is a stretch in the case of ICC Rules arbitration because of its essentially delocalised nature and the role and powers of the ICC Court”.  Despite these observations, the judge stopped short of deciding that English law was not the governing law of the arbitration agreement, or that Russian law was, later holding merely that the latter was “well arguable” [72] and “seriously arguable” [105].  </p>

The reason given was that the a priori superior claim of any tribunal to be the one in which to decide whether the Moscow Claim was brought in breach of clause 50.1 of the Contract would be that of the arbitrators [69].  In this section the Judge expressed the following views in the course of reaching this conclusion.  The English Court’s special role under Articles V(1)(e) and VI of the New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards 1958 (“the New York </p>

The exercise of the power to grant an anti-suit injunction to restrain such proceedings is not the exercise of powers as the arbitral supervisory court conferred by being the court of the seat, but rather an exercise of original substantive jurisdiction to restrain by injunction a breach or threatened breach of contract by a party over whom it has a personal jurisdiction [66], citing in support of this proposition <span style="font-style:italic">AES Ust-Kamenogorsk Hydropower Plant LLP v Ust-Kamenogorsk Hydropower Plant JSC</span> [2013] 1 WLR 1889.   Where in such a case service out of the jurisdiction is required to establish personal jurisdiction, CPR 62.5(1)(c) provides the relevant gateway but the need to establish personal jurisdiction carries with it the requirement that this court be the most appropriate forum and “this is of real significance in the present case”.  The same is true of a defendant served here as of right because he may apply for a stay on grounds of forum non conveniens.  Enka’s argument that the choice of seat gives the English Court an a priori superior claim to determine whether the Moscow Claim is brought in breach of clause 50.1 was rejected [68].  Enka’s failure to engage the primarily proper jurisdiction, namely that of an ICC arbitration tribunal was “a significant factor telling against their claim for the discretionary relief they seek” [78].                              </p>

However that did not apply to Chubb in this case because of “the scrambled procedure pragmatically adopted as something of an indulgence to Enka”;  the “spirit” of Carr J’s judgment being one to preserve the ability to raise issues already raised by the parties; and the fact that Chubb had throughout argued that the Russian Court was the appropriate forum.  </p>

Whereas the approach of the Judge seems to have been that the question he had to address was a truly jurisdictional one as to whether the court was properly seised of the claim and that he was entitled to treat the issue as a matter of substance as if it were a challenge to service of the proceedings under CPR Part 11, notwithstanding the absence of any such application as a matter of form.  This was his own initiative and what led him to decline to decide the proper law of the arbitration agreement contrary to the course urged by both parties.  Part 11 was raised as a relevant consideration by the Judge himself at two passages during the course of the hearing but in the course of musings in terms which do not in my view make it fair to criticise  Mr Béar QC for failing to foresee or object to the course which the Judge decided to take of his own initiative.  One of the issues which Enka sought to raise on this appeal by an application to amend its Appellant’s Notice was that such a course was not procedurally open to the Judge, apart from its main argument that such a course was juridically unsound. </p>

There is nothing in the Russian law evidence I received to suggest that there is anything that might be regarded as odd internationally, or even parochially in England, about Russian choice of law rules that may have required that concession before a Russian court if it would not be sound before an English court or before ICC arbitrators. It would be unfair to Chubb Russia in the circumstances of this case to consider granting an anti-suit injunction unless it could be justified upon the basis of that concession, but (i) though the point was raised at trial, Mr Béar QC was not instructed to make the same concession before me – in fact his submission was that it was "<span style="font-style:italic">obviously wrong</span>" to suggest that the Contract contained an express general choice of Russian law, and indeed that the Contract terms, even leaving aside clause 50.1, were positively inconsistent with it – and (ii) if the concession were made, then the anti-suit claim would fall to be considered on the basis that Russian law indeed governed the question of the scope of clause 50.1. Second, Chubb Russia has secured in effect a small degree of favourable provisional consideration by the Moscow Arbitrazh Court of the merits of its contention that it has a viable claim formulated in tort so as at least to begin its argument that its claim does not have to be arbitrated under clause 50.1. That second is a less weighty point than the first, but it is not wholly without force. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:left;margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in">On the basis, then, that the real issue between these parties, the scope of clause 50.1, either is governed by Russian law, or at any rate, were I to decide it, could only be treated as so governed to be fair to Chubb Russia, it is plainly more appropriate for that issue to be determined by the Moscow Arbitrazh Court than by this court. I am content to assume in Mr Béar QC's favour that if I found that Chubb Russia had no arguable case on the issue under Russian law that might affect the assessment: (a) <span style="font-style:italic">ex hypothesi</span> I would then be finding that there was no point requiring serious consideration that it might be better in principle for a Russian court to decide; and (b) the reasonableness of Chubb Russia's conduct in joining Enka to the Moscow Claim at all might then be called into question. I do not make that finding, however. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:left;margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in">There is, ironically, even a sense in which it may favour Enka to have the scope of clause 50.1, and as the first step in that its governing law, decided in Moscow. For on the evidence, there seems to me to be more room for argument there than I have concluded there would be here if I had to decide the point that (a) an express choice of a general governing law for a contract that does not explicitly extend to the arbitration clause within it does not so extend; and (b) absent a choice of governing law explicitly for the arbitration clause, it will be treated as governed by the law of the seat where a seat is specified, irrespective of the governing law of the contract more generally. I see no reason in the evidence to suppose that, if the Moscow Arbitrazh Court now concludes that clause 50.1 is governed by English law, then Chubb Russia will not accept that it must arbitrate (and that Enka's motion for dismissal without consideration must succeed). Indeed, I understood the burden of the expert evidence of Russian law before me to be that, in that case, the Moscow court would be bound to and would so dismiss the claim. There was a difference between the experts over how likely it was that Enka would be joined in a third-party capacity, either on application by another party or of the court's own motion, to ensure findings would bind it as against or in favour of the other parties sued, even though <span style="font-style:italic">ex hypothesi</span> no claim would or could then be being pursued against it there by Chubb Russia. But that is an irrelevance at this trial. It was plain to me, and I find, that the prospects of Enka being required to have some involvement, but without Chubb Russia pursuing a claim against it, will be no different, Chubb Russia having initially pursued a claim that was dismissed without consideration under the New York Convention, than if it had never brought a claim because it accepted the obligation to arbitrate throughout. (6) I do not overlook the complaint by Mr Béar QC that, as things now stand, the Moscow Claim is proceeding to, it may be, a species of rolled-up hearing, as he called it, where there will be at least some degree of consideration of the ultimate substantive merits at the same time as the court now deals with the motion to dismiss in favour of arbitration. The submission is that that is obviously unsatisfactory. In my judgment, however, firstly, in the particular circumstances of this case that has substantially been visited upon Enka by its failure to act promptly and more appropriately in response to the Moscow Claim, if its response was to be a claim in this court for relief by way of injunction in the hope of avoiding having to become entangled in the Russian proceedings. Secondly, it is important to bear in mind, again in the particular circumstances of this case, that there is a specific complexity to the arguments that arise as to arbitrability before the Russian court if Chubb Russia persuades it to find that the arbitration agreement is governed by Russian law. The need, in those circumstances, to arrive at an accurate characterisation of the claim as pursued by Chubb Russia, which on the evidence of the experts is not or may well not be limited to a consideration of how Chubb Russia has chosen to seek to characterise it in its Russian statement of claim, may well require a degree of understanding of what are the issues on the merits or what they would be as between the parties, so as to assess the nature of the claim and how it arises so as then to determine whether it falls within the scope of the arbitration agreement if governed by Russian law. In those (it may be unusual) circumstances it is not so outrageous or obviously unsatisfactory as it might in other circumstances be for the Moscow Arbitrazh Court in the event not to have dealt entirely separately and initially with the motion to dismiss without consideration of the merits.” </p>

That is part of the supervisory jurisdiction of the court of the seat, to which the parties submit by choosing the place of the seat.

The English court as the court of the seat of the arbitration is necessarily an appropriate court to grant an anti-suit injunction and questions of forum conveniens do not arise.  This follows from two essential principles.  First, the choice of the seat of the arbitration is an agreement by the parties to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of that seat in respect of the exercise of such powers as the choice of seat confers.  Secondly, the grant of an antisuit injunction to restrain a breach or threatened breach of the arbitration agreement is an exercise of such powers.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Before developing these points it is worth saying something about labels.  The law of the place of the seat is usually referred to as the curial or procedural law or the lex fori (see e.g. <span style="font-style:italic">Naviera Amazonica v Cie Peruana SA v Compania Internacional de Seguros del Peru </span>[1988] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 116, 119).   I shall refer to it as the curial law.   The powers which are conferred by such choice of seat are often described as the court’s “supervisory jurisdiction”.  This is a somewhat inaccurate label and may be apt to mislead.  It undoubtedly includes the powers contained in the Arbitration Act 1996, which by sections 2(1) and 4(1) make the mandatory provisions applicable by virtue of the choice of seat, and provide at s. 4(4) that this is so irrespective of the law governing the arbitration agreement.   Indeed even the non-mandatory provisions apply by virtue of the choice of seat in the absence of agreement to the contrary (s. 4(2)).  The mandatory provisions include powers which can be exercised before there is any arbitration to “supervise”.  For example s. 12 provides that the court may extend the time for commencement of an arbitration beyond that agreed by the parties.  Section 44 confers the power to grant ancillary orders, such as freezing injunctions, in cases of urgency before there is any arbitration reference.  Even where there is an arbitration, the court of the seat is not in reality “supervising” it in exercising many of the 1996 Act powers, for example in enforcing the award (s. 66).  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The use of  labels in the argument on this appeal tended to obscure rather than illuminate the analysis.   Mr Dicker QC referred to the package of rights contained in a London arbitration clause as including (1) an agreement to English law as the curial law or procedural law of the arbitration and to the application of the Arbitration Act 1996; and separately and distinctly (2) an agreement to the English Court exercising its “supervisory and supportive” role as the court of the seat including its power to grant anti-suit injunctions.  The latter phrase seems to be derived from a passage in Dicey Morris &amp; Collins on <span style="font-style:italic">The Conflict of Laws</span> cited with approval by Blair J in <span style="font-style:italic">U &amp; M Mining Zambia Ltd v Konkola Copper Mines plc</span> [2013] 2 Lloyd’s Rep at [64] but it is there applied to the conduct of an arbitration.  Mr Bailey, on the other hand, referred to the jurisdiction as the supervisory jurisdiction but distinguished between exclusive and non-exclusive supervisory jurisdictions, suggesting that only the exclusive jurisdiction (which did not include the anti-suit injunction jurisdiction) was that conferred under the curial law because only one court could be charged with the function of supervision (although he appeared to accept at one point that the nonexclusive anti-suit injunction jurisdiction arose by virtue of the choice of seat), an analysis to which Mr Dicker objected on the grounds that the curial jurisdiction “cannot be subdivided” (per Kerr LJ in the <span style="font-style:italic">Naviera Amazonica</span> case at p120).   I have not found it helpful to analyse the issue by treating the role of the court in granting anti-suit injunctions as “supportive” or to be viewed in isolation from the curial or procedural law; nor to approach the issue in two stages, first by labelling the jurisdiction as supervisory and then by analysing the ramifications of that label.  What matters is whether the scope of the powers conferred on the English Court by the choice of English curial law includes the jurisdiction which the English Court undoubtedly has to grant declaratory and anti-suit relief in relation to foreign proceedings brought in breach of the arbitration agreement.  I would prefer to use the label “curial jurisdiction” to reflect the powers which the court is exercising by reason of the parties having chosen its law as the curial law, whilst recognising of course that that is what is meant by the use in many of the authorities by the epithet “supervisory jurisdiction”.</p>

It is generally regarded as an important and valuable weapon in the hands of a court exercising supervisory jurisdiction over the arbitration. It promotes legal certainty and reduces the possibility of conflict between the arbitration award and the judgment of a national court. As Professor Schlosser also observes, it saves a party to an arbitration agreement from having to keep a watchful eye upon parallel court proceedings in another jurisdiction, trying to steer a course between so much involvement as will amount to a submission to the jurisdiction (which was what eventually happened to the buyers in <span style="font-style:italic">The Atlantic Emperor: </span>see [1992] 1 Lloyd's Rep 624 ) and so little as to lead to a default judgment.

The courts are there to serve the business community rather than the other way round. No one is obliged to choose London. The existence of the jurisdiction to restrain proceedings in breach of an arbitration agreement clearly does not deter parties to commercial agreements. On the contrary, it may be regarded as one of the advantages which the chosen seat of arbitration has to offer. Professor Schlosser rightly comments that if other Member States wish to attract arbitration business, they might do well to offer similar remedies. In proceedings falling within the Regulation it is right, as the Court of Justice said in Gasser and Turner v Grovit , that courts of Member States should trust each other to apply the Regulation. But in cases concerning arbitration, falling outside the Regulation, it is in my opinion equally necessary that Member States should trust the arbitrators (under the doctrine of <span style="font-style:italic">Kompetenz-Kompetenz</span> ) or the court exercising supervisory jurisdiction to decide whether the arbitration clause is binding and then to enforce that decision by orders which require the parties to arbitrate and not litigate.”  </p>

The choice of seat is a legal concept which determines the curial law.  It is distinct from the geographical venue at which hearings take place.  Absent specific agreement to the contrary, a London seated arbitration may be conducted for the convenience of the tribunal and the parties anywhere in the world.

The choice of seat also determines where the award is made for the purposes of whether it is an award governed by the New York Convention, regardless of where it is signed or published: s. 53 Arbitration Act 1996 and Article 31(3) of the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration adopted by the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law on 21 June 1985 (“the Model Law”).  The choice of seat is often made by choosing a “place” of arbitration, or that the arbitration is to “be in”, or “to take place in”, the specified place, in this case London.  It is well established that the choice of such place is a choice of seat rather than venue. If authority were required for these wellestablished principles it is to be found in the judgment of Kerr LJ in the <span style="font-style:italic">Naviera Amazonica</span> case, in which Kerr LJ also emphasised at p.120 that none of these principles is different in relation to institutional arbitrations such as those conducted under the ICC Rules or those of the London Court of International Arbitration.  Thus it is common ground that in this case the choice of London in clause 50.1 as the place of arbitration is a choice of English seat and of English law as the curial law, notwithstanding that under Articles 18.2 and 18.3 of the ICC Rules which govern the conduct of the arbitration there is a discretion as to where to hold hearings and deliberations.  To hold that the choice of seat is a submission to the curial jurisdiction is therefore no more than to give effect to party autonomy which is fundamental to arbitration agreements and which it is the primary function of the courts to respect and uphold.  Parties who agree a particular seat deliberately submit themselves to the law of the seat and whatever control it exerts.  That not only gives effect to party autonomy but promotes certainty.   </p>

In his view, decisions of the seat are “decisions which the parties must, on the face of it, be taken to have accepted when that seat was chosen, and should in the ordinary case be treated as final and binding”. In other words, parties who agree to a particular seat may be taken to have intentionally submitted themselves to the law of the seat and whatever control it exerts.  This is particularly so since, as pointed out by Lord Mance, the modern reality is that the choice of seat is often a deliberate and conscious one.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The primary role of the curial court in granting anti-suit relief is supported by principle.  The anti-suit injunction jurisdiction is concerned to protect and enforce the integrity of the arbitration agreement.  In order to do so it must necessarily interrogate the substantive jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal (or the putative or potential tribunal if none has been or is intended to be appointed) in determining whether the foreign proceedings are a breach of the agreement to arbitrate the dispute in question.  Questions of the substantive jurisdiction of the tribunal are paradigm issues of curial law assigned to the court of the seat.  This curial jurisdiction to determine the arbitrators’ substantive jurisdiction arises notwithstanding the international principle of <span style="font-style:italic">Kompetenz-Kompetenz</span>, reflected in our domestic law in s. 30 of the Arbitration Act 1996, that in the absence of contrary agreement the tribunal may rule on its own substantive jurisdiction.   This is because the court of the seat always remains the primary arbiter of the substantive jurisdiction of the tribunal and will examine that jurisdiction not only in a challenge to the tribunal’s ruling on its own substantive jurisdiction, but if necessary in advance of it: see <span style="font-style:italic">Dallah Real Estate and Tourism Holding Co v Ministry of Religious Affairs of the Government of Pakistan </span>[2011] 1 AC 763 at [84] and [95]-[98], in which Lord Collins repeatedly refers to this as an aspect of what I have called the curial jurisdiction of the court of the seat; and the <span style="font-style:italic">AES Ust-Kamenogorsk </span> case at [40] per Lord Mance.  This is the inevitable result of the fact that arbitration is consensual.  As the learned editors of Mustill &amp; Boyd on <span style="font-style:italic">Commercial Arbitration</span> 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> ed put it at pp.6-7  “In the eyes of English law it is a logical absurdity to hold that the arbitrator can ask himself a question which if answered in the negative implies he had no jurisdiction to ask it”.   There must be a court with power to determine the substantive jurisdiction of an arbitral tribunal, and when an arbitral tribunal has been constituted or is in contemplation, this role is assigned to the court of the seat both before and after an award is made.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It is consistent with this acknowledged primary role of the curial court that it should also perform the primary role of determining the substantive jurisdiction of an arbitral tribunal as the necessary inquiry in addressing whether to grant anti-suit relief to protect such substantive jurisdiction.  Indeed it is not only consistent, but it is moreover desirable that it should do so if the parties’ legitimate expectations of certainty and business efficiency arising from their agreement to arbitrate and choice of seat are to be given effect.    If the curial court cedes the question to a foreign court when asked to protect the integrity of an arbitration agreement by anti-suit relief, there arises a risk of parallel proceedings and inconsistent decisions.  Parallel proceedings are always undesirable but are particularly inimical in this context where being engaged in foreign proceedings is the very thing a party bargained to avoid by his agreement to arbitrate, as Lord Mance emphasised in the <span style="font-style:italic">West Tankers</span> case at [30].  The risk of parallel proceedings and inconsistent judgments arises where the English Court as the court of the seat is exercising its undoubted primary jurisdiction to determine the substantive jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal, whether before or after it has made an award.  For example the English Court might determine that an award was valid on a challenge under s. 67 of the Arbitration Act 1996 on the grounds that the dispute was within the scope of the arbitration agreement, when the foreign court had declined to stay its proceedings on the basis that the dispute was outside its scope.  Not only is such inconsistency undesirable in itself, there is the further risk of an issue estoppel arising from the decision of the foreign court, especially in the light of the difficulties to which Lord Hoffmann adverted in the <span style="font-style:italic">West Tankers</span> case of steering a line between participating in a way which prevents a default judgment but does not amount to a submission to the jurisdiction of the foreign court.  Such consequences confound the parties’ expectations of certainty and the upholding of party autonomy which it was the purpose of their arbitration agreement and choice of seat to provide.   </p>

In that case the Court was concerned with an application to the English Court as the court of the seat to restrain proceedings in Kazakhstan in circumstances where the applicant did not wish to commence arbitration and had no intention of doing so.  In upholding the grant of the anti-suit injunction the Supreme Court held that the absence of a reference to arbitration, or any intention to commence such reference, was irrelevant to the enforcement by anti-suit injunction of the negative aspect of an arbitration agreement which constituted a promise not to commence proceedings in a different forum (see [21]-[23], [48]).  This jurisdiction arose under s. 37 of the Senior Courts Act 1981, not s. 44 of the Arbitration Act 1996 which was confined by its terms to powers exercisable “for the purposes of and in relation to arbitration proceedings.”  In rejecting an argument that this analysis was contrary to the terms, scheme, parliamentary intention and philosophy of the Arbitration Act 1996 as providing a complete set of rules for the determination of jurisdictional issues and excluding the jurisdiction under s. 37 of the Senior Courts Act 1981 (see [29] and [32]), Lord Mance regarded the expressly limited scope of s. 44 as conclusive in itself against the exclusion of the s. 37 jurisdiction to grant antisuit injunctions because the existence or contemplation of such arbitral proceedings was irrelevant to the latter (see [43]).  However it simply does not follow that because the power to grant an anti-suit injunction arises under s. 37 of the 1981 Act, rather than by virtue of the 1996 Act, it is not the exercise of the curial jurisdiction.  On the contrary the Supreme Court’s rejection of the proposition that the 1996 Act provided a complete set of rules for the determination of jurisdictional issues suggests the very opposite.  Moreover Lord Mance recognised the significance of the place of the seat in the s. 37 jurisdiction to grant anti-suit injunctions at [50] when recognising that it was the fact of the seat being in London which engaged CPR 62.5(1)(c) and conferred personal jurisdiction over a defendant who could not be served within the jurisdiction.  One of the flaws in Mr Bailey’s argument was to treat s. 37 of the 1981 Act as if it conferred a freestanding power against anyone irrespective of an ability to assert personal jurisdiction over them.  But like any other power of the English Court, it can only properly be exercised over someone who is properly before the Court, and it is the fact that the seat of any arbitration would be in London which afforded personal jurisdiction in that case.   Indeed in the current case it is difficult to see where the personal jurisdiction to grant a remedy against Chubb Russia comes from on its own case, if not from the fact that London is the seat of the arbitration.  On Chubb Russia’s case the arbitration agreement is not an English law agreement.  On that hypothesis and in the absence of a voluntary submission to the jurisdiction, therefore, there could be no personal jurisdiction over Chubb Russia to enable the Court to exercise the s. 37 powers but for the fact that the seat of the arbitration is in London so that CPR62.5(1)(c) is engaged.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Lord Mance’s comment at paragraph [61] of his judgment falls to be interpreted in this light.  It is addressing the discretion to refuse injunctive relief which is discretionary in nature, when exercising the undoubted curial jurisdiction, on the discretionary grounds which have always been recognised since the seminal decision in <span style="font-style:italic">The Angelic Grace</span> where there is strong reason to do so.  His remarks have nothing to do with declining to address the question on forum conveniens grounds.  If there were any doubt about this, it is dispelled by the remarks being premised on a finding that there is a breach of the agreement to arbitrate in bringing the foreign proceedings. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The Civil Procedure Rules provide some limited further support for Enka’s case more generally.  There is an express forum conveniens requirement in most cases of applications for permission to serve out of the jurisdiction: CPR 6.37(3) provides that the court will not give permission unless it is satisfied that England and Wales is the proper place in which to bring the claim.  Arbitration claims, which include applications for anti-suit injunctions to restrain foreign proceedings brought in breach of an arbitration agreement, are governed by a different regime in Part 62.  As already observed, one of the gateways for such jurisdiction is provided for in CPR 62.5(1)(c) where the seat of the arbitration is in England and Wales.  But by contrast with the requirement in CPR 6.37(3), there is no requirement that England and Wales must be the proper place in which to bring the claim.  This is because questions of forum conveniens do not arise when the court is exercising the curial jurisdiction which goes with the choice of England (or Wales) as the seat of the arbitration.  It is true, as Mr Bailey emphasises, that the power to grant permission to serve out of the jurisdiction in CPR 62.5(1) is expressed in discretionary terms (“<span style="font-style:italic">The Court may grant permission…</span>”), but in cases where the gateway is the seat of the arbitration, that does not import forum conveniens as a relevant discretionary factor for the reasons I have explained.  That is also the view of the editors of Merkin &amp; Flannery on <span style="font-style:italic">The Arbitration Act 1996</span> 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> ed, at paragraph 44.12.5.1.4, which I prefer to that of the editors of Dicey Morris &amp; Collins on <span style="font-style:italic">The Conflict of Laws</span> 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> ed at paragraph 16046 who treat the question of forum conveniens as arising within the discretion under CPR62.5(1) in every case, but say that the forum conveniens requirement is likely to be satisfied where the seat of the arbitration is in England.   </p>

However the approach suggested is just as flawed as the approach taken by the Judge.  The task of the English Court as the court of the seat was to determine whether the Moscow Claim was a breach of clause 50.1; and if that involved determining questions governed by Russian law, the Court was required to do so.   In this case the parties put before the Court the evidence necessary to enable it to decide those issues and the Commercial Court is well familiar with such an exercise of determining issues of foreign law and well equipped to do so.  Indeed that may be one of the perceived advantages of the parties’ choice of England as the seat of the arbitration, although it ought to arise comparatively rarely in the light of my conclusions below that the law governing the arbitration agreement will usually coincide with the curial law.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Once it is recognised that it is the primary function of the English Court as the court of the seat to determine whether an anti-suit injunction should be granted, it follows that the Court must address the two relevant questions, namely (1) whether the foreign proceedings are a breach of the arbitration agreement and (2) if so whether relief should be granted as a matter of discretion.  As Males J, as he then was, put it in <span style="font-style:italic">Nori Holding Ltd and others v PJSC Bank Otkritie Financial Corporation</span> [2018] 2 All E R (Comm) 1009 at [28] “when such an injunction is sought it is for the court to determine whether there is a binding arbitration agreement and whether the pursuit of the foreign proceedings constitutes a breach of the agreement”.  It is illogical and impermissible to embark upon the first question by determining the proper law of the arbitration agreement but then declining to finish the exercise by ceding part of the issue to a foreign court.  That is no less a failure to respect the parties’ bargain in choosing England as the seat of the arbitration than not embarking on the first question at all.    Only once this court has answered the first question, and answered it in the affirmative, can there be any consideration of the factors which weigh against the grant of relief as a matter of discretion.   Forum conveniens is not a consideration in whether the curial court should consider the exercise of its anti-suit injunction jurisdiction, a jurisdiction  which requires it to address the whole of the first question.   It is no more a legitimate consideration for part only of that question than it is for the whole.  </p>

In the course of argument the Court raised the question whether the course adopted by the judge was procedurally permissible in the light of the fact that Chubb Russia, unlike Chubb Switzerland, had not issued a Part 11 application, Carr J had ordered a trial, and Chubb Russia had agreed to the substantive issues in the Agreed List of Issues being determined at trial and participated in the preparation for and conduct of such trial.   This led to an application by Enka on the second morning of the hearing to amend its Appellant’s Notice to take the point that the judge’s course was indeed impermissible as a matter of statutory submission to the jurisdiction under CPR Part 11.   Mr Bailey objected to the application on grounds of lateness and because he had not had a proper opportunity to consider the new point.  We deferred the question whether to grant permission to allow the parties to make further written submissions after the hearing.  Those submissions involved Enka taking a new point, namely that there had also been a submission to the jurisdiction at common law by waiver; and Chubb Russia advancing a number of different legal arguments in response whilst maintaining that the lateness of the application unfairly prejudiced Chubb Russia and that permission to amend should be refused.   For my part I would refuse the application to amend on the basis that it is too late and as a result has not only prejudiced Chubb Russia but deprived the Court of an opportunity for proper consideration, with the benefit of oral argument, on what it now appears are several substantial new issues of both law and fact.  The refusal of the application makes no difference to the result in the light of my earlier conclusions.  </p>

Such arbitration clause would have been null and void if governed by Scottish law. The House of Lords unanimously held that the terms of the arbitration clause demonstrated a clear intention that the arbitration agreement was governed by English law.  Although the clause was in different terms from one which merely identifies a choice of seat, providing as it did for a particular trade tribunal and its usual procedures, the case provides an early example of a choice of seat being treated as a choice of the curial law as the AA law. </p>

All rejected an argument that the London arbitration clause was a sufficient factor pointing to English law.  The potential significance of the case lies in passages in the speeches of Lord Reid (at p. 584E), Lord Morris (at p. 590G), Lord Wilberforce at (pp. 596B-D  and 599C-D) and Lord Diplock (at pp. 604H-605A), all of whom expressed in slightly differing language the principle, that a choice of arbitration in England was an important factor, and in many cases might be the decisive factor, pointing to English law governing the main contract, although that was not always so and must sometimes yield to other factors as it did on the facts of that case.  It is important to note that the case was not concerned with the AA law.  It concerned the effect the curial law might have on the main contract law, and the argument that it had an effect was based on a direct connection between the two, which had nothing to do with the AA law:  the choice of London arbitration was argued to be a pointer to the main contract law on the grounds that it would involve English arbitrators who would be familiar only with English law, or at least most familiar with such law; and so by choosing such arbitrators the parties could be taken as having chosen that their national law would be applied to the contract of affreightment: see per Lord Wilberforce at p. 596B-D and per Lord Diplock at p. 605A.  Lord Wilberforce rejected the premise for the argument, and I doubt that it would now be accorded significant weight in the context of most international arbitration in England, in which English arbitrators are often asked to decide questions under a foreign governing law and are regarded as equipped to do so.  A fortiori it is inapplicable to a case such as the present involving arbitration under the ICC Rules which commonly involves appointment of foreign arbitrators from different legal traditions and disciplines notwithstanding that the seat of the arbitration is in London.  What matters for the purposes of the present debate is that this case is of no direct relevance on the effect the curial law may have on the AA law.   </p>

Whilst in the earlier part of this judgment, I have held that questions of challenge to the award and enforcement of the award are matters for the curial law, they plainly impact also upon the law of the agreement to arbitrate and the law of the Agreement to Refer, because those are matters which are inextricably caught up with the whole business of arbitrating and the effect of it. When the parties agreed to arbitrate in a particular place under particular laws, they plainly had in mind the effect of so doing and chose the law and seat of the arbitration with a view to achieving particular results in that respect. I cannot see that the law of the agreement to arbitrate and the law of the agreement to refer can here differ from the curial law.” </p>

If the court were concerned with a free-standing agreement to arbitrate in London containing no express choice of proper law, it is unlikely that there would be a sufficient basis for finding an implied choice of proper law and it would simply be necessary to seek to identify the system of law with which the agreement had the closest and most real connection. In those circumstances the significance of the choice of London as the seat of the arbitration would be overwhelming. However, where the arbitration agreement forms part of a substantive contract an express choice of proper law to govern that contract is an important factor to be taken into account. The difference in emphasis between the views expressed in the earlier authorities and those to be found in the more recent cases is, I think, mainly due to the different degrees of importance that has been attached to the parties' express choice of proper law to govern the substantive contract, reinforced by a more acute awareness of the separable nature of the arbitration agreement…… In the absence of any indication to the contrary, an express choice of law governing the substantive contract is a strong indication of the parties' intention in relation to the agreement to arbitrate. A search for an implied choice of proper law to govern the arbitration agreement is therefore likely (as the dicta in the earlier cases indicate) to lead to the conclusion that the parties intended the arbitration agreement to be governed by the same system of law as the substantive contract, unless there are other factors present which point to a different conclusion. These may include the terms of the arbitration agreement itself or the consequences for its effectiveness of choosing the proper law of the substantive contract: see <span style="font-style:italic">XL Insurance v Owens Corning</span>.” </p>

The express choice of Brazilian law to govern the policy was “a strong pointer” towards an implied choice of Brazilian law as the AA law [27] and “a powerful factor” in favour of such implied choice [29] but it was outweighed by two factors.

As the parties must have been aware, the choice of another country as the seat of the arbitration inevitably imports an acceptance that the law of that country relating to the conduct and supervision of arbitrations will apply to the proceedings. Accordingly, even though the arbitration agreement in this case does not specifically refer to the provisions of the Arbitration Act 1996, the parties must have foreseen and intended that its provisions should apply to any arbitration commenced pursuant to condition 12 (including all those provisions, such as sections 5, 7, 8, 12, and 13 which are more substantive than procedural in nature). This tends to suggest that the parties intended English law to govern all aspects of the arbitration agreement, including matters touching on the formal validity of the agreement and the jurisdiction of the arbitrators.” </p>

Since the parties must have intended to render the arbitration agreement effective they must impliedly have chosen a system of law which would make it so, and because there was at least a serious risk that a choice of Brazilian law would significantly undermine that agreement, that was an indication that the express choice of Brazilian law did not carry with it an implied choice of Brazilian law as the AA law.

Although Mr. Wolfson submitted that the agreement has a close and real connection with the law of Brazil, being the law governing the substantive contract in which the arbitration agreement itself is embedded, I think his argument fails adequately to distinguish between the substantive contract and the system of law by which it is governed. No doubt the arbitration agreement has a close and real connection with the contract of which it forms part, but its nature and purpose are very different. In my view an agreement to resolve disputes by arbitration in London, and therefore in accordance with English arbitral law, does not have a close juridical connection with the system of law governing the policy of insurance, whose purpose is unrelated to that of dispute resolution; rather, it has its closest and most real connection with the law of the place where the arbitration is to be held and which will exercise the supporting and supervisory jurisdiction necessary to ensure that the procedure is effective. Its closest and most real connection is with English law. I therefore agree with the judge that the arbitration agreement is governed by English law.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Where the AA law question can be answered at the first stage, namely whether there is an express choice of the AA law, no conceptual difficulty arises.  An express choice of AA law may exceptionally be found in the arbitration agreement itself.  If not, it may be found in the terms of an express choice of main contract law, or a combination of such express choice with the terms of the arbitration agreement.   That was the position in <span style="font-style:italic">Kabab-Ji</span>.  That will be a matter of construction of the whole contract, including the arbitration agreement, applying the principles of construction of the main contract law if different from English law.  This solution is likely to be confined to cases where there is an express choice of main contract law.  If the main contract law is not one by express choice it is difficult to conceive of circumstances in which it could support a finding of express choice of AA law.  It is not a conclusion which will follow in all cases, or indeed the majority of cases, in which there is an express choice of main contract law but only in the minority of such cases where the language and circumstances of the case demonstrate that the main contract choice is properly to be construed as being an express choice of AA law.   </p>

This follows from the doctrine of separability of the arbitration agreement recognised in section 7 of the Arbitration Act 1996 and re-emphasised by the House of Lords in <span style="font-style:italic">Fiona Trust v Privalov</span>.  This is so whether or not the main contract law arises by express or implied choice of the parties, or by any other conflicts rules applied by a court such as the closest and most real connection test or application of Article 4 of the Rome I Regulation.  If there is an express choice of law, it is a choice as to the law to be applied to the terms other than those in the separate arbitration agreement (<span style="font-style:italic">Kabab-Ji</span> type cases aside).  It therefore has little if anything to say about the AA law choice because it is directed to a different and separate agreement.  The same is true of an implied choice of main contract law, and a fortiori where the main contract law is imposed under conflicts rules on grounds other than a choice by the parties.  Of course if the main contract law does not recognise the doctrine of separability, and there has been an express choice of that law, that may be a reason for treating the main contract law choice as an express choice of the same AA law.  But that would take it outside the category of cases here being considered, which do not include those where there is an express choice of AA law.  In any event such cases will be rare if, as has been suggested, the doctrine of separability is “one of the conceptual and practical cornerstones of international arbitration” (Born on <span style="font-style:italic">International Commercial Arbitration</span> (2014) at p349). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">However without going so far as to suggest the doctrine insulates the arbitration agreement for all purposes (cf <span style="font-style:italic">JSC Zestafoni G Nikoladze Ferroalloy Plant v Ronly Holdings Ltd</span> [2004] EWHC 245 (Comm)), there are good reasons for treating it as doing so for the purposes of choice of AA law where there is a different curial law from that applicable to the main contract.  In such circumstances the parties have, ex hypothesi, chosen a separate system of law to govern one aspect of their relationship, namely the curial law of the arbitration agreement.  The arbitration agreement is treated as separate and severable for the purposes of this choice of curial law, about which the main contract law has nothing to say.  Why then should it have anything to say about the closely related aspect of the very same arbitration agreement, namely the AA law (absent express language to that effect so as to give rise to an express choice of AA law)?  Moreover questions of the validity, existence and effectiveness of an arbitration agreement are often governed by the AA law, under which they fall to be determined.  If the arbitration agreement is properly isolated from the main contract by the doctrine of separability for the purposes of one aspect governed by the AA law, namely its validity, existence and effectiveness, that is a powerful indication that it is to be isolated for the purpose of determining the AA law more generally.  In other words because parties are to be treated as having contracted on the basis that the main contract and the arbitration clause are separate and distinct agreements for the purposes of the latter’s validity, existence and effectiveness, so they should be taken as having contracted on the same basis in respect of the governing law of the arbitration agreement which determines its validity, existence and effectiveness. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The principal rationale articulated in the authorities for treating an express choice of main contract law as indicative of a choice of AA law is not some connection between the subject matter of the former and the latter, but rather that businessmen do not usually intend that their relationship should be governed by more than one system of law: see for example <span style="font-style:italic">Sulamerica</span> at [11].  This is a sensible starting point where there is no arbitration clause with a different seat; but it ceases to have any application where there is.   In such cases, whatever the AA law, the parties have necessarily chosen their relationship to be governed in some respects by two systems of law, namely the curial law and the main contract law.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Secondly, the overlap between the scope of the curial law and that of the AA law strongly suggests that they should usually be the same.  As Toulson  J observed at p. 543b in <span style="font-style:italic">XL Insurance v Owens Corning</span>, the scope of the curial law is not limited to the exercise of purely procedural powers.  It involves the curial court determining aspects of the substantive rights of the parties under their arbitration agreement by reference to the curial law.   This is well illustrated by provisions of the Arbitration Act 1996.  Section 5 requires the arbitration agreement to be in writing or evidenced in writing, reflecting Article 7 of the Model Law.  If it is not, the Act does not apply.  This is not strictly speaking a question of validity because an oral agreement may be valid at common law, which is preserved by s. 81 of the Act.  But section 5 directly affects the substantive rights of the parties because the ability to enforce performance contained in the myriad provisions of the Act is unavailable in the case of an oral agreement.  Section 6, also reflecting Article 7 of the Model Law, contains a definition of what amounts to an “arbitration agreement” to which the provisions of the Act are then applicable.  This affects the substantive rights of the parties in the same way as section 5.  Section 7 of the Act, reflecting Article 16(1) of the Model Law, provides for the separability of the arbitration agreement, again a matter of the substantive arbitral rights of the parties. Indeed it goes to the very heart of those rights by insulating them from matters which affect the validity or effectiveness of the main contract.  Section 8 of the Act provides that the arbitration agreement is not discharged by the death of a party and may be enforced by or against the personal representatives.  Section 12 enables the court to extend time for the commencement of proceedings in the face of a contractual time bar, which applies where the time bar is a substantive one which is expressed to extinguish the claim as well as those in which it bars the remedy.  An equivalent power for other time limits is contained in section 79.  Section 13 applies the Limitation Acts, which may therefore affect the substantive rights of the parties by barring a claim.   Section 14 defines when arbitration proceedings are commenced in the absence of agreement of the parties, again affecting the substantive rights of the parties under their arbitration agreement for the purposes of time limits imposed by contract or the Limitation Acts.

The same applies to the enforcement provisions in s.66-68 of the Act: they are in one sense procedural but they affect the scope of the substantive rights of the parties under the arbitration agreement. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In <span style="font-style:italic">Sulamerica</span> Moore-Bick LJ recognised the force of this point that the substantive nature of a number of the 1996 Act provisions suggested that the parties intended English law to govern all aspects of the arbitration agreement, including matters touching on the formal validity of the agreement and the jurisdiction of the arbitrators, at paragraph [29].  He treated it as one of two important factors pointing away from the main contract law being an implied choice of the AA law in that particular case.  However this is not a case specific factor, but one which will apply in every case in which English law is the curial law.   There will always be this substantial overlap between the scope of the curial law and the scope of the AA law.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Although I have expressed this point by reference to the content of English curial law, its validity does not depend upon any peculiar features of English law as the curial law.    It applies equally as a general rule to any curial law.  There can be no suggestion that English curial law is in this respect over expansive in its scope by international standards, given that many of the provisions identified reflect those in the Model Law.  Moreover the very function which the curial law performs means that one would expect it always to be capable of playing some part in affecting the scope of the substantive rights of the parties under their arbitration agreement.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Perhaps ironically, this analysis is to my mind supported by the rationale previously put forward to support the opposite view, namely that businessmen should not be taken to have intended that different systems of law should apply to their relationship; or perhaps more pertinently, that they should not be taken to have intended that different systems of law should apply to two closely related aspects of their relationship, even where a different system does apply to a third aspect.    Of the three potentially different systems of law, the connection between the AA law and the curial law is very much closer than that between the AA law and the main contract law.  If the curial law and AA law are different, the curial court will be bound to apply the foreign AA law when exercising its curial jurisdiction, and I accept that there is nothing conceptually problematic about this.   But that would be an unlikely choice for businessmen.  Their starting point might well be that the curial court would be expected to apply its own system of law to all issues which would arise when exercising its curial jurisdiction.  But however that may be, the significant point is that if the curial function which is being exercised by the curial court involves the determination of the scope of the arbitration agreement in order to protect its integrity, as it will when questions arise as to the substantive jurisdiction of the arbitrators in a challenge to the award, or when exercising its anti-suit relief curial jurisdiction as in the instant case, it is unlikely that businessmen would have chosen that the curial court should apply two different systems of law when exercising that single function.  So in the instant case, whilst there is nothing conceptually problematical about the English Court applying the English curial law on anti-suit relief and Russian law as the AA law, it is inherently unlikely that businessmen would have made that choice because it involves asking the court to determine rights whose scope so substantially overlaps by two different  systems of law.  Put another way, as a matter of commercial common sense, one would not expect businessmen to choose two different systems of law to apply to their arbitration package. </p>

The <span style="font-style:italic">Cie D’Armement</span>  case also indirectly supports this view because it treats the curial law as capable of determining the main contract law on the basis that a choice of seat may  constitute a choice of that country’s law as the law of the main contract; and it would be anomalous if a choice of curial law could amount to a choice of the main contract law but not the AA law.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">This seems to me to accord with principle.  The curial law is a matter of choice which comes with the express choice of seat.

Given the connection and overlap between the scope of the curial jurisdiction and the scope of the AA law, it seems natural to regard a choice of the former as a choice of the latter, rather than merely the latter being the system of law with which the arbitration agreement has its closest and most real connection. </p>

Such rules often circumscribe some of the powers which would otherwise be available under the curial law, for example a right of appeal from an award; and confer certain powers on the institutional bodies which would otherwise fall to the curial court, such as the appointment of arbitrators. This is all part of the party autonomy which applies to the choice of curial law as much as to any other aspect of the arbitration agreement.  But there always remains a substantial function for the curial court, not least in cases where there is a dispute as to the validity or effectiveness of the arbitration agreement or the substantive jurisdiction of the arbitrators. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Conceptual problems may arise where no seat has been chosen, because English conflicts rules do not recognise the concept of a floating proper law: the arbitration agreement must be governed by a system of law which is identifiable at the time the agreement is made.  Institutional arbitration rules sometimes provide for this eventuality.  Article 18.1 of the ICC Rules provides that if the parties have not agreed the place of arbitration it shall be fixed by the ICC Court.  The floating proper law problem stands in the way of an analysis that in such cases the delegated choice of seat operates as an implied choice of AA law.

Typical is Article 4.1(b) which provides that Enka shall ensure performance of the work in accordance with the Applicable Law.  This is a common technique in international construction contracts where quite apart from the governing law of the contract, which can be chosen by the parties, there are particular local laws and regulations which are mandatorily applicable, such as those governing planning, health and safety, labour laws, taxes and customs.  The technique is to define such applicable laws and impose an obligation to comply with them separately from any choice of governing law of the contract as a whole: see Baker Mellors Chalmers and Lavers on <span style="font-style:italic">FIDIC Contracts, Law and Practice</span> at 2.126, 2.140, 2.145.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Accordingly the presumption applies that the parties have impliedly chosen that the proper law of the arbitration agreement should coincide with the curial law and be English law.  There are no countervailing factors let alone powerful ones.  On the contrary there is a supportive factor to be found in the pre-arbitration procedures identified in the first part of clause 50.  The parties must have intended that the whole of clause 50 as a single dispute resolution procedure should be governed by the same system of law, a conclusion reinforced by the definition of Dispute which is adopted both for the mediation aspect and the arbitration aspect.   The senior management discussing the dispute for the purposes of resolving it under the mediation provisions would not as businessmen be expected to draw distinctions between the legal basis for the claims, whether contractual tortious or otherwise, and to discuss only some.  They would be expected to discuss all aspects of the dispute, whatever their legal basis, because the purpose of such discussions is the resolution of the entire dispute between the parties, not part only.   That is an indication of an intention to apply the wider approach to what amounts to a  dispute falling within the clause which is required by English law as explained in <span style="font-style:italic">Fiona Trust v Privalov</span>, rather than the narrower interpretation which it is suggested is required by Russian Law of distinguishing between legal bases of claim.  If this is true of disputes which are to form the subject matter of the mediation provisions, it is equally true of the arbitration agreement which adopts the same definition of “Dispute” in defining its scope. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The Judge’s exercise of his discretion was infected by errors of principle in a number of ways.   It is apparent from what I have already said that he failed to appreciate the primary role of the English Court as the court of the seat in granting anti-suit relief in the exercise of its curial jurisdiction.  He also inclined strongly to the view, without expressing a final conclusion, that the arbitration agreement was not governed by English law.  He therefore exercised his discretion from the wrong starting point.  His approach to what was necessary to provide a strong reason for not giving effect to the parties’ bargain was infected by his failure to treat Enka’s claim as a proper and straightforward invocation of the curial court’s primary role in granting an anti-suit injunction to restrain a breach of an English law arbitration agreement.  He also fell into error in treating Enka’s failure to commence arbitration as a “very significant factor” counting against it.  It is not a relevant factor at all.  It is clear from <span style="font-style:italic">AES UstKamenogorsk </span>that the anti-suit injunction jurisdiction arises irrespective of any actual or contemplated arbitration proceedings because an arbitration agreement contains the independent negative promise not to commence proceedings anywhere in the world.  The Judge was also mistaken in treating an arbitration tribunal as prima facie the a priori forum in which Enka should seek to resolve the scope of the arbitration agreement: that was the primary function of the English Court in exercise of its curial jurisdiction which Enka was entitled to invoke without commencing arbitration proceedings to seek a declaration of non-liability.  It therefore falls to this court to exercise the discretion afresh.   </p>

Mr Bailey suggested that it meant the service of several rounds of submissions, including expert opinions on English law from prominent English lawyers (Lord Neuberger and Professor Briggs).  If so, this is not a matter for legitimate criticism which should be held against Enka;  it was no more than its proper attempt to get the Moscow Arbitrazh Court to force Chubb Russia to respect its bargain not to litigate the claim there. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The only ground which might therefore justify a refusal to grant relief is delay by Enka and its effect on the Russian proceedings, bearing in mind the considerations identified by Christopher Clarke LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Ecobank Transnational Inc v Tanoh</span> [2016] 1 WLR 2231 at paragraphs [120]-[142] in the context of anti-enforcement injunctions.  The Judge treated that delay as starting at the latest by the end of June 2019, and was critical of Enka in the period from the letter before action on 24 April 2019.   In my view, Enka cannot properly be criticised for not seeking relief from this court prior to it becoming clear to Enka that the Moscow Claim would be accepted by the Moscow Arbitrazh Court as sufficiently particularised to go forward.  That occurred on 4 September 2019 when Enka was notified of the Moscow Arbitrazh Court’s ruling to that effect the previous day.   Until then, the Russian proceedings were being treated essentially as defective and the defect might never have been cured.  Chubb Russia only satisfied the Moscow Arbitrazh Court on that score at the third attempt.   Had Enka applied to the English Court for relief prior to this time it would have risked wasting time and expense in an unnecessary application and being told that the application was premature. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">So far as the English proceedings are concerned, there is clearly criticism to be levelled at Enka in the way the matter came before Carr J on 15 October 2019 when seeking interim relief.  However it is by no means clear that that resulted in any delay in obtaining injunctive relief.  Given the contentions being advanced by Chubb Russia at such interlocutory hearing that the arbitration agreement was governed by Russian law which did not treat the Moscow Claim as within the scope of the arbitration agreement, it may well be that the ordering of a speedy trial without interim relief would have been the solution adopted in any event, however well presented the material, in the light of the then state of the Russian proceedings and the prognosis of their progression.    Moreover even by 11 December 2019 when the trial took place, the Russian proceedings were  not so far advanced as to provide any good reason for failing to give effect to the parties’ bargain that Enka would not be sued in Russia.   </p>

I accept that we should address the situation in Russia as it currently presents itself in considering the utility of injunctive relief.  From that point of view granting an injunction to prevent Chubb Russia from pursuing an appeal from the dismissal of its claim on the merits still serves the necessary and useful purpose of giving effect to the bargain in the arbitration agreement that Enka should not be exposed to continued involvement in such proceedings.  It is not right, however, that we should look at the position today in analysing any delay or resulting state of advancement of the Russian proceedings.  If the Judge exercised his discretion on a flawed basis in December, and on the state of play at that date should have granted the anti-suit injunction sought, it would be wrong to penalise Enka by reason of the further inevitable delay, not of Enka’s making, in getting on an appeal to establish and correct the Judge’s error. </p>

Having secured an injunction to prevent Chubb Russia from exercising its Russian appeal rights to seek to overturn the current decision of the Moscow Court against it on the merits, Enka must undertake that it will not treat the decision as giving rise to an issue estoppel if its claim is now pursued in arbitration. </p>
