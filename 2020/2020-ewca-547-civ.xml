Although this is a combination likely to appear daunting, the issues of statutory construction that arise are not complex but they are important. The most important is whether, as counsel for the appellant taxpayers graphically submitted, Parliament has “surrendered to accountants” the determination of the taxable profits and allowable losses resulting from derivative contracts. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The issue is whether the “derecognition” in the accounts of the appellant companies of 95% in one case, and 100% in the other, of the value of derivative contracts held by them respectively gave rise to an allowable loss for the purposes of corporation tax. This issue turns on the proper construction and application of schedule 26 to the Finance Act 2002, which contains an exhaustive code for the taxation of profits arising from derivative contracts.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Union Castle is a wholly owned subsidiary of Caledonia Investments plc (Caledonia), a publicly quoted company with investment trust status. HMRC disallowed a deduction of £39,149,128 made by Union Castle in its corporation tax return for the year to 31 March 2009, claimed as a result of a derecognition of 95% of derivative contracts held by it. Its appeal against the closure notice issued by HMRC was dismissed by the First-tier Tribunal (the FTT) in a Decision dated 27 July 2016. Its appeal to the Upper Tribunal (the UT) was dismissed, albeit on different grounds. It appeals to this court with permission granted by the UT.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Union Castle’s appeal to the FTT was designated as a lead case for two other appeals, one being the appeal by Ladbrokes. HMRC had issued closure notices disallowing deductions in its 2008 and 2009 tax computations for losses<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>resulting from the derecognition of derivative contracts. There were common issues and, in addition, an issue that applied only to Ladbrokes (the Gateway issue). On the Gateway issue, the FTT held in favour of Ladbrokes, with the result that its appeal was allowed. The UT reversed that decision. Ladbrokes appeals, with permission granted by the UT. I deal with Ladbrokes’ appeal at the end of this judgment. </p>

The committee therefore considered the possible issue by Union Castle of a new kind of share capital to Caledonia with dividend rights, whereby the economic benefit of the Contracts would effectively be transferred to Caledonia. They noted that this would oblige Union Castle to write off the value of the Contracts, thereby crystallising a tax loss. </p>

Agreeing with the FTT, the UT held that, if (contrary to their decision on the “arise from” issue) the relevant loss did arise from the derivative contracts, the resulting debits would have fairly represented those losses.

In view of the decisions of both Tribunals in favour of HMRC under schedule 26, this issue was not determinative of the appeals. Nonetheless, both Tribunals quite properly decided this issue, in case it should be material on an appeal. Disagreeing with the FTT, the UT held that the issue of the shares was a “provision” within schedule 28AA which was therefore capable of applying in Union Castle’s case. In view of the conclusion to which I (and, as I understand it, the other members of the court) have come on the issues under schedule 26, it is not necessary to decide HMRC’s alternative case under schedule 28AA and we did not hear argument on it.</p>

It is not the use of the words “profits” and “losses” in paragraph 15 which requires a further assessment of their character but the “fairly represent” requirement.

The UT took those decisions as authority for the proposition that “fairly represent” enables HMRC to prevent a mismatch in accounting treatment between the accounts of a parent company and the accounts of a subsidiary in relation to the same transaction. While it was arguable that such mismatches may not be confined to cases of parent and subsidiary, there was no authority that “fairly represent” encompassed any other category of case. Accordingly, the UT considered that the question on the authorities was whether there was any kind of accounting mismatch in the case of Union Castle and it concluded there was none. </p>

In his judgment, with which Lord Kitchin and Asplin LJ agreed, Henderson LJ traced the genesis and development of the relevant provisions of the loan relationship code, which are precisely mirrored in the equivalent provisions of schedule 26. Section 84 of the Finance Act 1996 mirrors paragraph 15 of schedule 26. Both were amended by the Finance Act 2004 to remove the words “in accordance with an authorised accounting method”, and the provisions<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>dealing with authorised accounting methods were also deleted.

Nevertheless, I do not think that the objection is well-founded, although it was persuasively advanced by Mr Ghosh. The concept of fairness is central both to the development and application of accounting standards, and to any process of judicial appraisal by a court or tribunal. In itself, the concept needs no elucidation, but rather provides a touchstone which is well suited to application by accountants, lawyers and judges, bringing their professional experience and expertise to bear in widely differing factual contexts.” </p>

Although the Court in <span style="font-style:italic">GDF Suez </span>explained how the amendments to the loan relationships regime in 2004 and 2006 were prompted by the desire to close loopholes and prevent tax avoidance, the wording of the statute does not refer to tax avoidance as a yardstick. It is not correct to give the ‘fairly represent’ test a limited meaning by regarding tax avoidance as the paradigm situation where the test would not be met. The test may well be failed in a case where there is an avoidance motive but where the more specific provisions directed at preventing avoidance do not, for whatever reason, apply. However, the override is not limited to that situation since it is intended to operate in favour of the taxpayer as well as in favour of HMRC. It may lead, for example, to profits being left out of account for tax purposes even though they are included in the company’s accounts in accordance with GAAP. I also agree that the presence or absence of an ‘asymmetry’ of the tax treatment of a transaction when looked at from the perspective of the counterparties is not a factor that need be present in every case where the override is triggered. It so happens that asymmetry was a factor both in <span style="font-style:italic">GDF Suez </span>and in the earlier case of <span style="font-style:italic">DCC Holdings (UK) Ltd v Revenue and Customs Commissioners </span>[2010] UKSC 58, [2011] 1 WLR 44. That does not mean, in my view, that the absence of an asymmetry in any subsequent case militates against the override being triggered. Finally, I agree with Mr Gibbon [counsel for HMRC] that the hurdle of ‘manifest absurdity’ which the Upper Tribunal appears to have applied before triggering the ‘fairly represent’ override is too stringent test. The true analysis is that section 84(1) is engaged wherever fair representation would not otherwise be achieved.” </p>

In this connection, it should be noted that the purpose of accounting standards, which is in general terms to assist actual and potential investors, and others dealing or proposing to deal with companies, in their assessment of the financial position and performance of a company, may not always match the purpose of determining profits and losses for tax purposes.

They remained assets available to Union Castle to meet any and all of its obligations, not confined to its obligation to pay the dividend on the A Shares.

Given the cost of the derivative contracts, their close-out would be highly unlikely to result in distributable profits equal to 95% of the close-out proceeds.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">As regards the first ground for the UT’s decision, Mr Peacock accepted that “in respect of” denotes a broader connection than “arise from” but he submitted that it did not follow that “arise from” requires a direct causal link between losses or profits and the derivative contracts. The second ground relied on by the UT, the inclusion of “related transactions”, did not dictate this result. It was appropriate to include express reference to transactions involving the acquisition or disposal of rights or liabilities because the resulting losses or profits are rightly said to arise from the acquisition or disposal, rather than the derivative contracts themselves. Without express reference to them, these losses or profits would not come within the derivative tax code at all. By contrast, the loss resulting from the derecognition arose from the derivative contracts themselves. IAS 39 required that 95% of the value of those contracts be derecognised and that loss arose from the contracts. This was an adjustment to the value of the contracts, because in economic terms their value to Union Castle had declined as a result of the issue of the A Shares. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Peacock also challenged the third ground relied on by the UT. Its reasoning would exclude losses or profits arising from any turning to account of derivative contracts that fell short of an acquisition or disposal of the whole or part of the rights or liabilities under the contracts. He suggested that this would mean that profits and losses from a number of ordinary commercial transactions would not be within the charge to corporation tax, and he instanced sub-participation arrangements. As a separate point, Mr Peacock also drew attention to the meaning of “from” in other contexts, such as emoluments “from” employment, which show a much wider meaning than the direct causal link decided by the UT in this case. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">A fall in the market value of a derivative contract causes a loss which is properly described as arising from the contract itself. Its value has declined. Union Castle argues that, likewise, a derecognition mandated by IAS 39 reflects a decline in the value of the derivative contract to the company and also arises from the contract. This submission depends on showing that the relevant debit did not arise from the issue of A Shares, but arose from the derecognition. The difficulty for Union Castle is that the derecognition and the issue of the A Shares are inseparable. The issue of the A Shares had the effect, by reason of the derecognition mandated by IAS 39, of reducing the carrying value of the derivative contracts by 95%. In my judgment, it is not tenable to say that the derecognition arises from the derivative contract, as opposed to the issue of the A Shares. </p>

In my judgment, it is the definition of “related transaction” that, as a matter of construction, clearly demonstrates its intended scope. The first and third grounds relied on by the UT are consistent with the restricted ambit shown by the use and definition of “related transaction” and indeed gain much of their force from it. </p>

It held that paragraph 25A equates the position of credits and debits recognised in equity or shareholders’ funds with those credits and debits recognised in the profit and loss and other statements to which paragraph 17B applies. This was the effect of the words “in the same way” in paragraph 25A. Paragraph 15 sets the requirements for all credits and debits to be brought into account, namely that they should fairly represent for the accounting period in question profits and losses which arise from the company’s derivative contracts and related transactions. It sets out the credits and debits to be brought into account, while paragraph 14 is concerned with the computation of profits and losses using those credits and debits. The UT did not agree with the FTT’s acceptance that paragraph 15 had the limited roles for which Union Castle contended. Although the UT reached their conclusion as a matter of the natural and ordinary meaning of the relevant provisions, they considered that there could be no purpose in a more favourable and less stringent treatment for credits and debits that were recognised in equity or shareholders’ funds than those recognised in the statements to which paragraph 17B applies. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Ladbrokes challenges the UT’s decision and reasoning on several grounds. First, if it were correct, there is no discernible reason why recognition in equity or shareholders’ funds was not simply added to paragraph 17B, rather than being the subject of a different paragraph in a different part of the schedule. Second, unlike paragraph 17A, paragraph 25A was not amended to make it expressly subject to paragraph 15. Nor, if paragraph 15 in any event qualified the rest of the schedule, was there any need to amend paragraph 17A to make it subject to paragraph 15. The right conclusion is that Parliament intended to make paragraph 17A, but not paragraph 25A, subject to paragraph 15. Third, paragraph 14 specifically refers to the “the following provisions [plural] in this Schedule”, indicating that paragraph 15 is not the universal gateway. Paragraph 15 identifies credits and debits to be brought into account in certain circumstances, while it is the purpose of paragraph 14 to bring credits and debits (whether identified in paragraph 15 or elsewhere) into account. Paragraph 25A provides a separate mechanism for determining other credits and debits to be brought into account. It is therefore paragraph 15 (read with paragraphs 17A and 17B) and, separately, paragraph 25A which identify the credits and debits to be brought into account and paragraph 14 which determines how they are to be brought into account. The words “in the same way” in paragraph 25A refer to the “how” of paragraph 14, not to the “which” of paragraph 15. </p>
