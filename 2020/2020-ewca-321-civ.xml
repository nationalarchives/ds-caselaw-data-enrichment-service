LBA is a company incorporated in Australia. It was part of the worldwide Lehman Brothers group and carried on business in Australia, where it entered liquidation in October 2009.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.02in">LBA sought a direction that the administrators of LBIE increase its agreed proof of debt by some £1.67 million to a little over £25 million. The proof had been agreed in accordance with a claims determination deed (CDD)dated 12 March 2014 and made between LBIE acting by its administrators and LBA acting by its liquidators (the LBA CDD). It is common ground that the amount of the agreed proof was understated by some £1.67 million as a result of a mistake made by both the administrators and the liquidators (or those respectively acting on their behalf). Additionally, it is common ground, for the purposes of the application and this appeal, that rectification of the LBA CDD is not available to LBA as a remedy. </p>

On an earlier application, counsel for the administrators were able to say that the CDDs, and equivalent standard form agreements as regards claims to trust assets, had “made a significant contribution to the success of the Administration.

No application for rectification was brought; and, as previously noted, [counsel for LBA] confirmed that I should proceed on the basis that it was not available.  I say nothing, therefore, in that regard, whether generally or (more particularly) as to whether the remedy would be available after the satisfaction of the LBA CDD by distribution in accordance with its terms and the receipt in full of the monies payable under it; nor as to whether and in what circumstances it might be possible in a clear case to grant such relief in the context of an application such as this. </p>

The principle applies to a failure to act, as much as to positive acts: see <span style="font-style:italic">Re Hall </span>[1907] 1 KB 875, a decision of this court.<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>As a public authority and given its role in society, the court is expected to apply standards to its own conduct which may go beyond bare legal rights and duties. A specific example is a sale of property made by the court in accordance with its powers: <span style="font-style:italic">Else v Else </span>(1872) LR<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>13 Eq 196. Trustees in bankruptcy, liquidators in compulsory liquidations and administrators are all officers of the court. In the case of administrators, this is expressly provided by paragraph 5 of schedule B1. As such, they are acting on behalf of the court and they will accordingly be held to these standards by the court. </p>

This is not surprising, not only because the standard is not laid down by statute and may be best illuminated by a variety of terms but also because the standards expected by society may themselves evolve.

The court applies the standard on an objective basis. It is not concerned to ask whether the officeholder is consciously proposing to take a course which falls below the standard set by the court. It asks only whether the course proposed would or would not, on an objective basis, meet that standard. As a regulated profession, insolvency practitioners may feel aggrieved at a challenge to their conduct or proposed conduct on this basis and may be tempted to argue that the challenge is an attack on their personal integrity. This would be a misapprehension on their part. </p>

As to the principle itself, Vaughan Williams LJ cited the passage from Lord Esher’s judgment set out above and re-stated the words of James LJ. Farwell LJ stated the principle at 871 as being “that the officer of the Court is bound to be even more straightforward and honest than an ordinary person in the affairs of every-day life”. It would, he said, “be insufferable for this Court to have it said of it that it has been guilty by its officer of a dirty trick”. “No high-minded man, of course, would dream” of retaining money paid under a mistake of law. At 872, he said that it would not “be in accordance with fair dealing – that open, honest dealing to which reference has been made” to proceed as the trustee proposed in that case, adding that he was not suggesting that the trustee <span style="font-style:italic">intended</span> to act contrary to fair dealing or to “make an unfair claim”. Citing Fry J in <span style="font-style:italic">Re Banister </span>(1879) 12 Ch D 131 at 136, the court “will endeavour to insist upon that fair, straightforward, honest, open dealing which ought to characterise transactions between vendor and purchaser”. Buckley LJ at 874 said that “it would be grievously unfair, and contrary to natural justice” to proceed as the trustee proposed. It was “not consistent with justice, and no high-minded man would do it”.    </p>

Again, at 765, Atkin LJ said the principle would apply to require a trustee in bankruptcy to repay the consideration for a promise where it had been “unfair or unjust” for the debtor to have received it. Finally, at 764, Atkin LJ dismissed the argument that great difficulties would arise in the administration of bankruptcy if the court had to decide according to what it considered high-minded without regard to law or equity. He thought the argument was exaggerated and that the “advantages of maintaining a high standard of commercial morality in my judgment far outweigh the suggested inconveniences of administration”. </p>

Adopting the submission of Mr Douglas Hogg QC for the appellant, he said that the court has the power to say to the trustee “you must not enforce that legal or equitable right because you are an officer of the court; it would not be right to do it, and the Court will not act dishonourably”. An officer must not do something that is not honourable or high-minded (851). In citing at 852 previous decisions, he refers interchangeably to “unfair”, “dishonourable” and “unconscionable”.  He referred at 854 to “the principle of fairness and honesty and honourable dealing” and at 855 to “the doctrine of fair and right dealing”. The test he applied to the facts of the case at 857 was whether there was anything “contrary to fair dealing” in the trustee making the particular claim in issue. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.02in">Nor do I accept the other ground advanced by the judge, that a test of unfairness “with its ultimately subjective standard, would…become an unruly horse”. I am not certain what the judge meant by “its ultimately subjective standard”. Fairness is an objective standard, calling for judgment or evaluation in its application to particular facts. It is of course the case that different judges might reach different views, but that is true of any standard falling short of dishonesty, as indeed Scrutton LJ said in <span style="font-style:italic">Re Wigzell </span>of the many phrases (dishonourable and so on) used in earlier cases. As to becoming an unruly horse, the courts are very familiar with applying a standard of fairness in many different contexts, including in the context of administrations under paragraph 74 of schedule B1 to the Insolvency Act. Chief Registrar Baister, with his very considerable experience in insolvency matters, found no difficulty in applying a test of unfairness in <span style="font-style:italic">Re Young </span>[2017] BPIR 1116, describing it at [43] as “far from being vague or elusive” but as “straightforward”. There is nothing inconsistent in a test of unfairness with the need to restrict the application of the principle in <span style="font-style:italic">Ex parte James </span>and keep it within strict bounds. As Lord Hoffmann said in <span style="font-style:italic">O’Neill v Phillips </span>[1999] 1 WLR 1092 at [1098], as regards the statutory jurisdiction to give relief in respect of unfairly prejudicial conduct of the affairs of a company, it does not mean that “the court can do whatever the individual judge happens to think fair. The concept of fairness must be applied judicially and the content which it is given by the courts must be based upon rational principles”.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.02in">While the formulation of the test in the authorities, involving so many phrases with perhaps different shades of meaning, has something of the quality of dancing on pinheads, resolution of this issue lies in going back to the fundamental principle underlying the jurisdiction. The court will not permit its officers to act in a way that it would be clearly wrong for the court itself to act. That is to be judged by the standard of the right-thinking person, representing the current view of society. If one were to pose the question “would it be proper for the court to act unfairly?”, only one answer is possible. It is interesting to note that fairness was introduced by some judges in the cases dealing with <span style="font-style:italic">Ex parte James</span> at a comparatively early stage, but in general “fairness” as a test in substantive, as opposed to procedural, law has grown significantly since many of those cases were decided. Insofar as it involves a broader test than, say, dishonourable, it reflects a development in the standards of conduct to be expected of the court and its officers. </p>

Separately, and very soon after the issue of the application, the court gave directions to the administrators for identifying and dealing with assets held by or to the order of LBIE that might be subject to trust or proprietary claims. Because of the scale of LBIE’s business, this process was complex and considerable data was needed to establish an accurate position on a client by client basis. The administrators supplied the applicants with information readily available to them, with qualifications as to its accuracy and completeness. There were a large number of counterparties in a similar position to the applicants and the administrators’ evidence, accepted by Blackburne J, was that if they were to attempt at that early stage to provide for each counterparty the type of information being sought by the applicants, “the task of returning client assets would take far longer than if conducted in the methodical ordered manner” which the administrators were following in accordance with the court’s directions.

There, as here, the Administrators were, as it seems to me, seeking in good faith to carry out their functions in the interests of the creditors as a whole.  Accordingly, the judge was right here too to hold that any harm that might have been caused to FT by selling the mine without procuring Timis Mining to pay the Royalty could not have been caused “unfairly” within the meaning of paragraph 74.” </p>

Acceding to LBA’s application would erode these aims and, but for the effect of a scheme of arrangement made with creditors since LBA issued its application, would enable other counterparties to re-open their entitlements.

The mistake was to show one series of euro bonds as denominated in Australian dollars. It was a clerical error, initially made by the administrators and not noticed by LBA when it agreed and executed the final form of the LBA CDD.

Once the court has given administrators permission to make distributions to creditors, one of the principal duties of the administrators is to ascertain the creditors and the amounts of their debts. If, in the ordinary case of administrators adjudicating on proofs of debt submitted by creditors, it was discovered that a comparable mistake had been made, there can be no doubt that the amount of the admitted proof would be amended in accordance with rule 14.10 of the Insolvency Rules 2016 (formerly, as regards administrations, rule 2.79 of the Insolvency Rules 1986), subject to not disturbing any distributions already made. The CDDs were not ordinary commercial contracts between parties acting in their own respective economic interests.

This was beneficial to creditors, as were the provisions that enabled them to trade their debts without the consent of the administrators. Mr Bayfield drew attention to a number of provisions of the LBA CDD, which appeared in identical or similar terms in all or most of the CDDs, which emphasised the finality and certainty which the CDDs sought to achieve. I have earlier quoted or summarised the provisions of clause 2.1 of the LBA CDD. As Mr Bayfield submitted, they fixed the amount to be admitted to proof and they mutually released all other claims, whether known or unknown. Entering full and final settlements with mutual releases drafted in the widest terms was entirely consistent with the purposes of the administration. The administrators were experienced insolvency officeholders and the counterparties to all the CDDs, including LBA, were sophisticated commercial parties, and all took or were able to take legal advice. It would undermine the purpose and value of the CDDs if parties were allowed to reopen negotiations with a view to obtaining a better deal or if proofs were admitted for a different amount from that stated in the CDD when the purpose of the CDD was to fix that amount. </p>

In the ordinary course, they are entitled to enforce those rights but, as the administrators accept, the rule in <span style="font-style:italic">Ex parte James</span> and paragraph 74 are capable of applying to restrict the strict legal rights of administrators under a contract. It was suggested that other creditors might legitimately complain if the Agreed Claim Amount was increased, but I do not accept that. If the clerical error had not been made by both parties in the calculation of the Agreed Claim Amount, the LBA CDD would have been admitted to proof in the larger sum. There is no windfall to LBA and no true detriment to the estate if the error is corrected.   </p>
