That same year, he was refused indefinite leave to remain in the United Kingdom despite having lived here for very many years. He has since succeeded in an appeal to the First-tier Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum Chamber), but his immigration status is still subject to a degree of uncertainty because of a pending appeal to the Upper Tribunal by the Home Secretary. The result has been that MP has been viewed as an “overseas visitor” and so asked to pay large sums for treatment he has received from the National Health Service (“the NHS”). </p>

Provision for consultation is also to be found in section 25 (relating to the establishment of NHS Trusts) and section 28 (relating to the establishment of Special Health Authorities).

Furthermore, and additionally, it would be difficult to regard any previous practice as giving rise to an unequivocal assurance that the two particular changes in issue in this case would be subject to public consultation. The requirement to record the fact that a person is a non-resident liable to charging, for example, does not of itself involve making any changes to the liability to pay charges (which is set out in the 2015 Regulations). It simply means that a person who is liable to pay charges is readily identifiable. It is difficult to see how the consultation exercises that were carried out in 2003, 2004, 2010 and 2013 gave rise to an unequivocal assurance that changes governing the recording of information would be the subject of consultation. The legitimate expectation that the claimant asserts in his claim form is an expectation, based on past practice, of consultation ‘on any significant amendments made imposing charges under the section 175 power’. The recording of the fact that a person is liable to charges is not concerned with imposing charges. In his written submissions dated 14 September 2018, the claimant in effect reformulates the practice and expectation and describes it as ‘an established prior practice of consulting on significant changes to the charging scheme which operate to the disadvantage of affected patients’. He then seeks to treat a requirement that liability to charging be recorded as such a change. It would be difficult, in my judgment, to treat the previous consultations as giving rise to an unequivocal assurance that changes relating to the recording of liability to pay charges is something that the defendant would consult upon. That indicates, more generally, that no unequivocal assurance arises out of any previous instances of consultation as to what might be the subject of any future consultation.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.00in">86. Similarly, it is it is difficult to see that that changes to the timing of payment for treatment is an amendment imposing charges, the expectation alleged in the claim form. It is only by recasting the practice as a practice of consulting on disadvantageous changes, and then classifying the imposition of a legal requirement to make advance payment as a disadvantageous change, that the second change is brought within the alleged past practice giving rise to a legitimate expectation. That, again, indicates the earlier instances of consultation did not give rise to a clear, unequivocal assurance that certain types of changes to the regulations would be the subject of consultation. In truth, the claimant can only seek to rely upon an alleged past practice both by ignoring instances where the exercise of the power to make regulations were not preceded by public consultation and by defining the consultations that did take place as instances where there was consultation on changes disadvantageous to the individual, and then classifying changes to record-keeping and the timing of payment as similarly disadvantageous. That is not, however, the type of situation which the courts have recognised as of a settled and uniform practice, giving rise to an unequivocal assurance, which results in the imposition of an obligation to consult before exercising a statutory power to make regulations. In the circumstances, therefore, the first ground of challenge, fails.” </p>

Mr Coppel advanced two alternative arguments. He submitted first that, having chosen to consult on changes to the 2015 Regulations, it was incumbent on the Secretary of State to do so fairly and hence to include in the exercise the proposals on advance payment and recording of information. Secondly, Mr Coppel said that the Secretary of State was anyway under a duty to consult on those proposals because a legitimate expectation of consultation had arisen from previous practice. </p>

The concept of fairness should determine whether there is a need to re-consult if the decision−maker wishes to accept a fresh proposal but the courts should not be too liberal in the use of its power of judicial review to compel further consultation on any change. In determining whether there should be further re-consultation, a proper balance has to be struck between the strong obligation to consult on the part of the health authority and the need for decisions to be taken that affect the running of the Health Service. This means that there should only be re-consultation if there is a fundamental difference between the proposals consulted on and those which the consulting party subsequently wishes to adopt.” </p>

Mr Coppel challenged this description. The advance payment and recording of information requirements were and are, he submitted, intrinsically linked to the subject of the 2015 consultation and the adoption of those requirements significantly affects the impact of the proposals which were consulted upon. In particular, consultees considering the potential extension of charging to community services were unaware that the charges would have to be paid upfront. Moreover, consultation on the advance payment and recording of information requirements could have been expected to excite considerable interest and opposition. The Judge, Mr Coppel argued, ought to have used fairness as the touchstone, but he failed to do so.  </p>

Moreover, the advance payment requirement did not extend the circumstances in which an overseas visitor was to be liable to pay for services but dealt only with when payment was to be made, and even in that respect reflected previous guidance.

There is a paradigm case of procedural legitimate expectation, and this at least is in my opinion clear enough, whatever the problems lurking not far away. The paradigm case arises where a public authority has provided an unequivocal assurance, whether by means of an express promise or an established practice, that it will give notice or embark upon consultation before it changes an existing substantive policy ….  </p>

In the paradigm case the court will not allow the decision-maker to effect the proposed change without notice or consultation, unless the want of notice or consultation is justified by the force of an overriding legal duty owed by the decision-maker, or other countervailing public interest such as the imperative of national security (as in <span style="font-style:italic">CCSU</span>). There may be questions such as whether the claimant for relief must himself have known of the promise or practice, or relied on it. It is unnecessary for the purpose of these appeals to travel into those issues; I venture only to say that there are in my view significant difficulties in the way of imposing such qualifications. My reason is that in such a procedural case the unfairness or abuse of power which the court will check is not merely to do with how harshly the decision bears upon any individual. It arises because good administration (‘by which public bodies ought to deal straightforwardly and consistently with the public’: paragraph 68 of my judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Ex p Nadarajah </span>[2005] EWCA Civ 1363) generally requires that where a public authority has given a plain assurance, it should be held to it.

Mr Palmer argued that cases concerned with substantive legitimate expectation are also of relevance when considering procedural legitimate expectation, and I agree. The “clear, unambiguous and devoid of relevant qualification” formula first appeared when it was as yet still controversial whether legitimate expectation extended to substantive rather than merely procedural benefits and it and its analogues have not hitherto been held to apply only to substantive legitimate expectation. In fact, Flaux LJ referred to a practice needing to be “clear, unequivocal and unconditional” in <span style="font-style:italic">Brooke Energy</span>, a consultation case, and the Court of Appeal spoke of the “fundamental ingredients” of procedural and substantive legitimate expectation being the same in <span style="font-style:italic">Heathrow Hub</span>.

Having concluded in paragraph 84 that there had not been a “settled and uniform practice”, the Judge went on to say that “[f]urthermore, and additionally, it would be difficult to regard any previous practice as giving rise to an unequivocal assurance that the two particular changes in issue … would be subject to public consultation”.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The Judge considered in detail the extent to which the Secretary of State had consulted on regulations relating to the charging of overseas visitors. As he explained, there was public consultation on seven proposed changes to the regulations in 2003, on certain proposals in 2004, on five areas in 2010 and, in 2013, on matters leading to the 2015 Regulations. On the other hand, there was no consultation on the making of the 1982 regulations, on amendments to those regulations effected between 1982 and 1989, on the 1989 replacement regulations, on amendments made between 1989 and 2003, on two further proposals put forward in 2003 or on amendments made in 2006, 2008 and 2009. Moreover, although there was public consultation on five areas in 2010, the departmental response to the consultation indicated that two additional modifications, not consulted upon, would also be made. Thus, as the Judge noted in paragraph 82 of his judgment: </p>

On other occasions, there had not been public consultation. Even when there was consultation in 2003 and 2010, not all the changes made were ones that were consulted upon.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.00in">“It is not feasible to consider the 2015 consultation exercise itself as evidence of a practice of public consultation for two reasons. First, the question is whether there was a past practice of consultation established by December 2015 such that there was on obligation on the defendant to conduct a public consultation in 2015 on the advance repayment and record keeping requirements. Secondly, the 2015 consultation does not, on analysis, evidence a practice of consulting on any change to the regulations, or even any change such as the advance payment requirement which might be seen as disadvantageous to individuals. It does the opposite as the defendant did not consult upon those changes.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Coppel did not dispute that changes to the charging regime have been made without consultation, but he pointed out that since 1989 almost all the changes on which there was no consultation have been either technical or to the advantage of patients. He argued that the Secretary of State could be seen to have consulted consistently on changes to the rules which would operate to the disadvantage of patients. Mr Palmer, in contrast, submitted that there is no logical basis on which to have regard to amendments to the regulations relating to overseas charging since 1995, but to ignore all the previous amendments; nor to have regard only to amendments that might be seen as “disadvantageous” to the patients directly affected by them. </p>

While it is fair to say that the Secretary of State had in more recent years consulted on changes to the charging regime that were to the disadvantage of overseas visitors, it remained the case that the Secretary of State had not consulted on by any means all amendments to the regime and, more specifically, that “when there was consultation in 2003 and 2010, not all the changes made were ones that were consulted upon”. The Judge was, in the circumstances, amply entitled to see the overall picture as mixed and to consider that no legitimate expectation of consultation had arisen. </p>
