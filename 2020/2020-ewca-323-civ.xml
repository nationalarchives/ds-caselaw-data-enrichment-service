	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0.00in">The Respondent, Achilles Information Limited, (“Achilles”) is a provider of supplier assurance services in competition with RISQS. It challenged the requirement that vetting be conducted only by RISQS once its concession to run RISQS had come to an end in May 2019 and the core IT and audit services had been transferred to competing providers following a competitive tender process organised by the RSSB, from which Achilles withdrew in May 2017. Achilles provides supplier assurance services in a number of industries in the United Kingdom and overseas. From 1997 until 2014 it was the sole provider of a rail industry qualification scheme known as Achilles Link-Up which was the precursor to RISQS. From 2014 until 2018 it was the sole operator of RISQS. It now wishes to continue to provide a supplier assurance scheme to the rail industry in Great Britain but is, in part, prevented from doing so because of the exclusive status conferred on RISQS under the Schemes and Network Rail’s refusal to recognise supplier assurance schemes provided by any other undertaking. </p>

Sponsors are required to have in place a process for undertaking pre-sponsorship checks for all individuals. The rules of the Sentinel Scheme provide that in order to be approved by Network Rail as a “sponsor” an organisation must initially register with RISQS. It is said that the Sentinel Scheme applies to around 1,500 potential suppliers and approximately 175,000 sponsored individuals. </p>

Network Rail’s licensing and authorisation teams ensure that undertakings wishing to obtain a licence under one of the Schemes satisfy the requirements set out in the relevant level of assurance.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0.00in">Network Rail also uses RISQS as the supplier assurance provider in relation to suppliers with which it contracts directly. It uses it as a pre-qualification system for would-be suppliers of infrastructure, maintenance or construction services.  The scheme which applies in such circumstances is the Principal Contractor Licensing Scheme (“PCLS”). The PCLS also includes terms which require any organisation wishing to contract to be assessed and verified by RISQS in order to confirm compliance with various RISQS standards. The PCLS was included within the definition of “Key Schemes” in the CAT judgment and, initially, it was alleged that it too fell foul of Chapters I and II of the Competition Act 1998. It became clear, however, towards the end of the hearing before the CAT that Achilles accepts that Network Rail may choose to use RISQS exclusively for supplier assurance in relation to the contracts which it enters into itself.  Therefore, by implication, the RISQS-only rule in the PCLS does not constitute a breach of the Chapter I and Chapter II prohibitions: see paragraphs [6], [28] and [44] of the CAT judgment.  </p>

However, in summary, the CAT approached the matters relevant to this appeal in the following way. First, for the purposes of the claim under section 2(1) of the 1998 Act, it considered whether the Schemes constitute agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings or concerted practices. It concluded at paragraphs [99] – [102] of the judgment that the Schemes embody an agreement or concerted practice between Network Rail and the undertakings who wish to have </p>

That is sufficient to constitute an agreement, as established by the car dealership cases relied on by Achilles. </p>

In this context, the Tribunal attaches significant weight to the fact that Achilles, with its experience and detailed knowledge of the market, wishes to compete with RISQS and believes that it can do so. It has already incurred a substantial proportion of any costs of entry and has a recent presence in the market. The Tribunal accepts that there may well be real benefits to allowing that choice and allowing competition in the market to evolve. These benefits would include not just the general benefits which can be expected to flow from making the quality and pricing of the services currently provided subject to competitive constraints, but also the possibility of solutions better tailored to the needs of buyers and suppliers, whose activities are not limited to the GB rail sector. Whilst it might be argued that the impact of competition from Achilles (and other suppliers of assurance schemes) in other sectors would continue to be felt by members of the RSSB and the community of suppliers in the rail industry who are also active in other sectors even if Achilles was not active in the railway sector, that impact would be less direct. </p>

It concluded that: (a) there were anti-competitive effects on competition in the market for supplier assurance services in the railway sector in Great Britain (paragraphs [290] – [292] ); (b) the tender exercise that was carried out and the possibility of a further tender exercise for the market in the future did not affect, justify or compensate for the elimination of competition in the meantime (paragraph [297] ); (c) the RISQS-only rule was not consistent with the normal conditions of competition in a market of this kind (paragraphs [298] – [301]); and (d) Network Rail’s argument that there must be a commercial benefit to be gained by the dominant undertaking  from its conduct before that conduct can amount to abuse of a dominant position  is inconsistent with the law explained by the General Court in Case T-128/98 <span style="font-style:italic">Aéroports de Paris v Commission </span>EU:T:2000:290 and the High Court in<span style="font-style:italic"> Arriva the Shires Limited v London Luton Airport Operations Limited </span>[2014] EWHC 64 (Ch) (paragraphs [302] – [308], and [306] in particular.)  </p>

Secondly, it is said that the CAT misapplied the law in finding that each of the Schemes embodies an agreement or concerted practice within the meaning of section 2 of the 1998 Act.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It is convenient to take the third and fourth grounds together as they both relate to whether the CAT erred in finding that there was an appreciable effect on competition for the purposes of section 2 of the 1998 Act. The third ground is that the CAT relied upon evidence which manifestly did not support the conclusion which it reached as to the scope of the relevant market, which was a necessary measure by which to determine whether there had been an appreciable effect on competition. The fourth ground, which follows from the third, is that the CAT erred in law in finding that the RISQS-only rule in each of the Schemes has an appreciable effect on competition in the relevant market. In particular, it is said that the CAT:  (a) failed to consider evidence of the impact that removing the RISQS-only rule would have had on the tender carried out by the RSSB to appoint new service providers; (b) misapplied the <span style="font-style:italic">Socrates</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">OTOC</span> cases and did not carry out any market share analysis or properly assess the degree of foreclosure arising from the RISQS-only rule; (c) contrary to section 60 of the 1998 Act, failed to apply the European Commission’s Notice on agreements of minor importance which do not appreciably restrict competition under Article 101(1) TFEU  (the “De Minimis Notice”) 2014/C 291/01; and (d) was wrong in law in concluding that it is “fundamentally not for Network Rail to make the decision for other buyers and suppliers that they would prefer RISQS to other supplier assurance services.” See paragraph [152] of the judgment.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Lastly, the sixth ground of appeal is that the CAT erred in law in finding that there was an abuse of a dominant position, in particular, because: (a) the CAT’s anticompetitive effects analysis was flawed; (b) the evidence was contrary to its conclusion in relation to the effects of the periodical tender process; (c) it erred in law in finding that a dominant company need not benefit commercially from the conduct complained of for it to be found to be abusive; and (d) it erred in law in finding that the conduct was an abuse without finding that Network Rail’s taking supplier assurance from Achilles was indispensable or essential to enable Achilles to be active in supplier assurance in the GB rail sector or safety critical industries in the United Kingdom.

The CAT was entitled to consider Network Rail’s activities as a whole and to determine that the control of access to railway infrastructure was essential to its economic activity.

It is, itself, subject to regulations in the way in which it carries out its economic activities in running the railway infrastructure and, no doubt, seeks to impose the RISQS-only rule in an endeavour to comply with the regulations imposed on it in the conduct of its economic activities. It is different, therefore, from the circumstances in the <span style="font-style:italic">MOTOE</span> case in which the body in question was vested with public powers to grant applications and its activities when doing so were considered to be separate from its economic and sponsorship activities in relation to which it was considered to act as an undertaking.

He says that suppliers did not sign up to the Sentinel Scheme, that the Schemes do not form part of agreements between suppliers and Network Rail, that the suppliers cannot choose whether or not to apply the Schemes and, therefore, there was neither an agreement with Network Rail nor acquiescence by the suppliers in relation to the RISQS-only </p>

In those cases, an apparently unilateral measure was imposed by car manufacturers on their distributors with whom they already had a distributorship agreement.

There were differences in the way that the two economic experts defined the scope of the relevant market for supplier assurance services, applying the SSNIP or “small but significant non-transitory increase in price” test. This test seeks to identify the smallest relevant market within which a hypothetical monopolist could impose a profitable significant increase in price. Mr Parker, Achilles’ economic expert, considered that the relevant market was the market for Key Scheme compliant supplier assurance schemes on the footing that it would not be possible for a provider operating a different supplier assurance scheme to start providing Key Scheme compliant supplier assurance services because only Network Rail can give the necessary recognition. Mr Holt, Network Rail’s economic expert, disagreed and considered that the relevant market should be more broadly defined as the market for supplier assurance schemes in the GB rail industry on the basis that there would be significant competitive restraints on a hypothetical monopolist from collective intervention from buyers and suppliers. If a hypothetical monopolist sought to increase prices or decrease qualities, buyers and suppliers could intervene collectively as happened in 2016 when the previous RISQS scheme was put out to tender by the RSSB. </p>

The argument that by restricting competition between providers of supplier assurance through the RISQS-only rule (competition in the market) it is possible to promote competition to win the RSSB’s tender process (competition for the market) is not relevant to whether the RISQS-only rule has an appreciable effect on competition. The process of weighing pro- and anti-competitive effects (in this case, the stifling of competition between providers of supplier assurance in the market versus competition for the market through the tendering process) only becomes relevant once the question of whether there are appreciable effects upon competition has been determined.

The second step, under Article 101(3), which only becomes relevant when an agreement is found to be restrictive of competition within the meaning of Article 101(1), is to determine the pro-competitive benefits produced by that agreement and to assess whether those procompetitive effects outweigh the restrictive effects on competition.  The balancing of restrictive and procompetitive effects is conducted exclusively within the framework laid down by Article 101(3).  If the procompetitive effects do not outweigh a restriction of competition, Article 101(2) stipulates that the agreement shall be automatically void.” </p>

It then went on to decide on the facts that there was a significant foreclosure of demand and that there is an appreciable anti-competitive effect. It did so on the basis of the detailed economic and factual evidence before it. That reasoning is at paragraphs [121] – [154] and [141] – [154] of the judgment, in particular.  </p>

Further, at paragraph 10 the Notice states that “a cumulative foreclosure effect is unlikely to exist if less than 30% of the relevant market is covered by parallel (networks of) agreements having similar effects”. Mr Went points out that Network Rail is not in the relevant market at all, and the CAT had found that only 29% of supplier assurance requirements in the GB rail industry were met by the Sentinel scheme (paragraph [106(3)]).

It serves to establish the framework within which competition policy is applied by the Commission. The main purpose of market definition is to identify in a systematic way the competitive constraints that the undertakings involve face. The objective of defining a market in both its product and geographic dimension is to identify those actual competitors of the undertakings involved that are capable of constraining those undertakings’ behaviour and of preventing them from behaving independently of effective competitive pressure.”  </p>

As Mr Went frankly conceded, this is a new argument which had not been pleaded or argued before the CAT. He submitted, however, that it raises a pure question of law, so Network Rail should be permitted to argue it on the appeal. This is opposed by Achilles, which says that reliance on the VBER at trial would have required certain facts to be determined which were not otherwise necessary, particularly in relation to market shares, and the leading of appropriate witness and expert evidence. In the absence of any pleaded defence based on the VBER, none of these steps were taken, and it is now far too late to raise the issue for the first time on appeal. </p>

According to the definition, the agreement in question must be one which relates to “the conditions under which the parties may purchase, sell or resell certain goods or services”; but the rule instead relates to the terms on which undertakings are licensed to have access to Network Rail’s infrastructure. We agree with Mr Woolfe that support for this interpretation of Article 1(1)(a) is found in the Commission’s Guidelines on Vertical Restraints, at paragraphs 25 and 26. It is there stated that the purpose of the VBER is to cover “agreements which concern the conditions for the purchase, sale or resale of the goods or services supplied by the supplier and/or which concern the conditions for the sale by the buyer of the goods or services which incorporate these goods or services”. The Regulation “does not cover restrictions or obligations that do not relate to the conditions of purchase, sale and resale such as an obligation preventing parties from carrying out independent research and development which the parties may have included in an otherwise vertical agreement.” With the benefit of that guidance, it seems reasonably clear to us that the RISQS-only rule, concerned as it is with the terms of access to Network Rail’s infrastructure, falls outside the scope of the VBER.  </p>

Mr Woolfe may well be right about this, but the RISQS-only rule does not fit easily into the definition of a “non-compete obligation” and we therefore prefer to leave the point open. </p>

We conclude that, if Network Rail is required to recognise alternative providers of supplier assurance services, some additional costs of oversight will be required and that these would not be limited to occasional meeting attendance as contended by Achilles.

Network Rail currently relies on internal RSSB oversight for monitoring of quality within the RISQS processes. Our assessment is that Network Rail will need to employ at least one full-time employee for the purposes of monitoring and coordinating safety processes.  That suggests an upper limit for incremental HR costs of £65,000 to £85,000 (based on a <span style="font-style:italic">pro rata</span> adjustment to the estimates by Network Rail for a team of three employees), together with some additional technology costs which would not be significant.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.00in">275. In our view, these incremental costs are insufficient to outweigh the benefits of competition, either in terms of price or other benefits. Although the contestable market may only have a total estimated value of £1.8 million and the scope for price reductions is limited, the incremental costs are such that it would only take a slight reduction in margin, which would probably result from competition, to outweigh them. Moreover, any cost benefits are outweighed by the potential non-price benefits of competition such as the potential for offering supplier assurance crossing between different industry sectors.” </p>

In our judgment, however, there is no real substance to either of these complaints. With regard to the first point, Mr Woolfe was able to satisfy us, by reference to the decision of the Court of Justice in the <span style="font-style:italic">MasterCard</span> case (Case C382/12 P <span style="font-style:italic">MasterCard v Commission</span> [2014] 5 C.M.L.R. 23; EU:C:2014:2201) that, where it has been determined that a restrictive term is not objectively necessary to the impugned agreement as a whole, it is necessary to examine any benefits which flow from the specific restriction in question, and it is not possible for that purpose to rely upon benefits flowing from the wider agreement of which it forms part. In the <span style="font-style:italic">MasterCard</span> case, the question arose in relation to a specific part of the overall MasterCard scheme called the Multilateral Interchange Fee (“the MIF”).

In any event, however, Mr Woolfe was again able to satisfy us that the question may properly be considered in the context of Condition 1 as well as Condition 3. In a case brought by a German association of property insurers to quash a decision of the Commission which had found a recommendation for increases in fire risk premiums to breach EU competition law, and (materially for our purposes) had also refused an exemption under what is now Article 101(3), the Commission had, under the first exemption criterion (i.e. the equivalent of Condition 1), weighed the dangers for competition flowing from the measure against the improvements it brought.

Apart from anything else, that was a case under Article 101 TFEU, and not a decision in relation to abuse of a dominant position under Article 102. Furthermore, the factual situation under consideration in that case (a joint venture created by the packaging industry in Austria for the purposes of fulfilling regulatory obligations in respect of recycling) was far removed from the facts of the present case, and although there was some consideration of tendering on a recurrent basis, it was in the different context of the fourth condition for exemption from Article 101 (no elimination of competition). The failure of the CAT to deal with this decision cannot therefore be characterised as an error of law. Nor, indeed, is the point included in the grounds of appeal.

As the CAT explained in the present case at [304], the General Court rejected the argument advanced by ADP, as the operator of Orly Airport, that its conduct in charging different fees to different ground-handling concessionaires was not abusive because it had presence in the market for ground-handling services and no interest in distorting competition on that market.  </p>

That was enough to dispose of ADP’s argument, and as Mr Woolfe submits there is also a close analogy to the present case. Network Rail is (assumed to be) dominant in a market for the provision of rail infrastructure. As part of that activity, it allows access to its infrastructure and has imposed certain terms, including the RISQS-only rule.

That would be to ignore the whole history of the case, including the provision of supplier assurance services by Achilles to Network Rail from 1997 onwards, culminating in the withdrawal of Achilles in May 2017 from the competitive tender process organised by the RSSB. What Achilles now wishes to do, in substance, is to resume its long-standing position as a substantial supplier of such services to companies requiring access to Network Rail’s infrastructure, which it is currently prevented from doing by the existence of the RISQS-only rule. There is no meaningful parallel between such a situation and the position if Network Rail were to seek supplier assurance services from an entirely new provider. Nor, in our judgment, </p>

Would it be impossible to achieve those safety objectives if Network Rail were required to recognise other suitably qualified and competent providers of supplier assurance schemes?” </p>

It started by acknowledging the need for a uniform and clear set of safety requirements.  It was not, however, persuaded that the consistency or clarity of standards would be compromised by allowing more than one provider of supplier assurance audit services. Consistency could be achieved by requiring that any provider of supplier assurance is effectively monitored against the relevant auditing standards.  Network Rail could impose a monitoring and supervisory regime to ensure quality, so that any differences between suppliers would then be at least above the relevant safety levels. It also considered that, contrary to Network Rail’s case, it is far from clear that suppliers would be more incentivised to maintain high standards if there were only one provider of supplier assurance services in the market than if there were more than one. Competing providers of supplier assurance services might well be incentivised to improve their services with a beneficial effect on safety, as argued by Achilles. </p>

In summary, for the reasons set out above, the Tribunal is not persuaded that the RISQS-only rule is objectively justified as being ancillary to the safety purposes of the Key Schemes. Network Rail has not established that those purposes would be impossible to achieve without the RISQS-only rule. The Tribunal considers that those safety purposes could be achieved by alternative providers of supplier assurance services working to the same standards as RISQS and subject to effective monitoring, with their IT platforms linked to RISQS’s and/or their data freely accessible to Network Rail and with the RISQS forum open to participation by other providers of supplier assurance services.  </p>

The Tribunal appreciates that if a change to Network Rail’s HSMS so as to permit multiple assurance providers was considered to be a significant change it would have to be reviewed by the ORR [<span style="font-style:italic">Office of Rail and Road – the railway regulator</span>]. The Tribunal expects that this review process would be handled appropriately.” </p>

Where the railway is concerned, nothing is more important than safety, but it should be clearly understood that this appeal has been about competition, not about safety. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The second point I would acknowledge is that there may be some irony, perhaps felt most keenly by Network Rail and by those who succeeded in the tender process from which Achilles withdrew, in the fact that Achilles, after enjoying a monopoly position as assurance provider for the UK rail industry for over 20 years should now be able to compete in a market that it previously had to itself. But that is neither here nor there in the light of the CAT’s expert findings. </p>
