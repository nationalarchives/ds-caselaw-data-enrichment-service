The bracelets consist of a number of individual links that can be fastened together in different combinations. The links may be either plain “base” links bearing the trade mark on the one hand or decorated links or links with charms attached on the other hand. Nomination have achieved some success in the UK, increasing their turnover from £6.3 million to 2013 to £10.4 million in 2016.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In these proceedings Nomination contend that JSC thereby infringed three registered trade marks and committed passing off. His Honour Judge Hacon held, for the reasons given in a judgment dated 13 March 2019 ([2019] EWHC 599 (IPEC)), that JSC had infringed Nomination’s trade marks in two distinct ways. First, by supplying the Nomination base links in inferior packaging, which gave rise to a legitimate reason for Nomination to oppose further commercialisation of the goods even though they had been put on the market in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) with (as the judge found) Nomination’s consent. Secondly, by advertising the Bundles in a manner that amounted to use of the NOMINATION trade mark in relation to the JSC links contained in the Bundles. He also held that the latter constituted passing off. JSC appeals against these conclusions with permission granted by Floyd LJ. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Nomination’s case is that its products are positioned as luxury jewellery which is nevertheless affordable by everyone. Some of Nomination’s decorated and charm links are made of precious stones, set in 18k or 9k gold or silver, and are priced accordingly. Others are less expensive. By contrast, the base links are made of stainless steel. Although it was Nomination’s position that base links should not be sold individually, the judge found that they did not impose any contractual restriction on their retail customers preventing this at the relevant time, that the retailers reasonably assumed they could do so and that they were not sanctioned for doing so. We were shown evidence that individual Nomination base links retailed for as little as 70 pence. </p>

The retailer puts the bracelet into the packaging for supply to consumers. I was shown an example of a sturdy and elegantly designed cardboard box with Nomination’s name and logo prominently on the front and back. Inside the box there is a foam support in which the bracelet is contained. The evidence indicated that the bracelet and support are wrapped in yellow tissue paper. The box contains a leaflet which includes a guarantee. The box is presented in a similarly elegant cardboard bag, closed by a ribbon. I agree with [counsel for Nomination] that the impression given by Nomination’s packaging is that its contents are of high quality.” </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The judge made no finding that retailers were contractually obliged to use this packaging. Counsel for JSC submitted to us that there was no evidence that retailers were even instructed to use the packaging by Nomination. Be that as it may, the judge clearly accepted that the retailers did use the packaging. It is convenient to note at this point that, during the course of argument, counsel for JSC took us to a photograph showing what Floyd LJ aptly described as a “kit” of bracelets and flat-packed packaging in the form in which it was received by JSC from one of Nomination’s authorised retailers. Contrary to counsel’s suggestion, this photograph (and the evidence of Mr Brealey in his first witness statement at paragraphs 14 and 26) is perfectly consistent with the judge’s findings, although it also shows that the bracelets were sent to JSC wrapped in plain white tissue paper rather than in the (Nominationbranded) yellow tissue paper. Moreover, there is no reason why retailers supplied with such kits should not use the packaging provided, and every reason why they would be likely to do so. I shall return to the topic of Nomination’s packaging below.     </p>

The judge quoted part of the text of the Listing at [66]. Since counsel for JSC complained that the judge’s quotation omitted material parts of the Listing, I shall set it out more fully. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Before turning to the principal criticisms which JSC makes of the judge’s assessment, it is convenient first to deal with two more minor points. Counsel for JSC pointed out that the CJEU had gone on in <span style="font-style:italic">Copad</span> to hold at [59] that the trade mark proprietor could oppose the resale of goods “only if it can be <span style="font-style:italic">established</span> that, taking into the particular circumstances of the case, such resale damages the reputation of the trade mark [emphasis added]”. He submitted that, first, the burden of proof lay on the trade mark proprietor in this respect, and secondly, damage to reputation must be established. I am content to assume that both submissions are correct, but this does not assist JSC. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">So far as the first point is concerned, there was debate before the judge as to whether there was an initial burden on JSC to show that the packaging was not liable to damage the reputation of the Trade Marks (as suggested by Case C-348/04 <span style="font-style:italic">Boehringer Ingelheim KG v Swingward Ltd</span> [EU:C:2007:249]), but as can be seen the judge simply asked himself whether it was likely that the packaging would damage their reputation. Turning to the second point, as counsel accepted, English procedural law takes facts as established if they are more likely than not, and the judge concluded that damage to the reputation of the Trade Marks was likely. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I turn therefore to consider JSC’s principal criticisms of the judge’s assessment. The first of these is that the judge failed to take into account evidence showing that Nomination bracelets were not always sold in the “luxury” packaging described above. Mr Brealey gave evidence in paragraphs 30-31 of his first witness statement that on 16 November 2018 JSC’s solicitor had purchased a Nomination base bracelet costing £11.90 from the online retailer Amazon SARL which had arrived wrapped in a clear plastic sleeve inside a clear grip-seal plastic bag and without any “luxury” packaging. Both the sleeve and the bag bore the Nomination brand name in black print. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It is correct that the judge did not refer to this evidence in his judgment. In my judgment, however, it does not undermine his assessment. In the first place, it postdates the relevant period. Secondly, the evidence does not reveal where Amazon SARL sourced the bracelet from. Thus it does not show that the source was either Nomination or an authorised retailer. Mr Brealey assumed that it came from Nomination or an authorised retailer because the sleeve and bag were branded Nomination, but this does not necessarily follow. Thirdly, there is no evidence as to the frequency of such sales. Fourthly, as discussed above, Nomination primarily sell their products through bricks-and-mortar retailers. This evidence does not detract from the judge’s finding that consumers who had bought bracelets from such retailers, or received as gifts bracelets purchased by others from such retailers, would have been exposed to the “luxury” packaging. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">JSC’s second main criticism is based on the judge’s findings in [46]. The judge found that Nomination’s authorised retailers “sometimes” sold individual Nomination links in transparent plastic bags. Counsel for JSC took us to the sole example of this in evidence, which is a photograph showing a single charm link purchased by JSC in 2016 from an authorised retailer called Argento that arrived in what appears to be a clear grip-seal plastic bag. Counsel for JSC submitted there was no evidential foundation for the finding that this only happened “sometimes”, but that is an impossible submission to accept when counsel was unable to cite any evidence as to the frequency of such sales. The mere fact that Nomination’s case was that it did not consent to the sale of individual base links is not enough to show that such links were commonly sold in plastic bags.  </p>

(The same would be true of the base bracelet sold by Amazon SARL, but the other caveats noted in paragraph 28 above apply to that. In any event, it could be argued that the same reasoning would apply, namely that it would not justify JSC inflicting further damage on the reputation of the Trade Marks.)  </p>

Part of the point of this test is that, if the sign is used for the purpose of distinguishing non-genuine goods, then a likelihood of confusion may safely be (rebuttably) presumed (in accordance with Article 16(1) of TRIPS). (It is not necessary for these purposes to consider the position if the goods are genuine.)

But I wonder if it necessarily follows, and in particular whether a likelihood of confusion means that the sign has been used “in relation to” all the relevant goods.

In those circumstances the judge was entitled to conclude that it would not be read with great care and attention.
