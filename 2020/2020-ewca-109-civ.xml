	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In a judgment dated 7 February 2019, Teare J (â€˜the Judgeâ€™) found that one of the respondents to these appeals, Mr Vladimir Chernukhin, was the disclosed and identified principal although he was not named as a party to the contract and that, as such, he was entitled to rely on its terms. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The Judge identified a disclosed principal by reference to article 2(1) in <span style="font-style:italic">Bowstead and Reynolds on Agency</span> (21st ed, 2018) at Â§1-039: as â€˜a principal, whether identified or unidentified, whose interest in the transaction as principal is known to the third party at the time of the transaction in questionâ€™; and proceeded on the basis that the person claiming to be a disclosed principal had the burden (legal, if the claimant, and evidential if the defendant) of showing that, notwithstanding that he was not named as the party to the contract, he was in fact the principal of one of the named parties (Ms Lolita Danilina) and that the other party (Mr Oleg Deripaska) knew this, see judgment at [63].  However, as the Judge also recognised, the fact that a party was a disclosed principal of a named party and the other party to the contract knew this, did not entitle the disclosed principal to enforce the contract if its terms, expressly or impliedly, confined the contractual rights to the named parties, see judgment at [64]. Having considered this issue, the Judge concluded that neither the terms of the contract nor its surrounding circumstances showed that Mr Deripaska was <span style="text-decoration:underline">only</span> prepared to accept Ms Danilina as the counterparty; and that the terms of the contact did not â€˜unequivocally and exhaustivelyâ€™ define the parties to it, see judgment at [317].  </p>

However, since it is common ground that the SHA contains no reference to Mr Chernukhin, it will be sensible to start by considering why this was so. Ultimately, the order in which a court approaches such issues may not matter, providing it considers both aspects of construction. Lord Hodge (with whom the other members of the Supreme Court agreed) expressed an analogous point in <span style="font-style:italic">Wood v.

The attraction of the acquisition was the development potential of its large site in central Moscow. Mr Chernukhin approached Mr Deripaska as a potential partner in the venture because he wanted a prominent businessman to be the public face of the project; and it was agreed between Mr Chernukhin and Mr Deripaska that each would contribute equally towards the purchase.

Mr Chernukhinâ€™s explanation for this, which the Judge accepted, was that he needed to be discreet in relation to an investment of this sort at a time when he was Deputy Minister of Finance and Chairman of VEB. It was in these circumstances that he relied on Mr Deripaskaâ€™s â€˜word of honourâ€™ in relation to his investment in TGM.

The preamble recorded that their views on the parties to the SHA were the same: namely that Ms Danilina was a party to the agreement and that Mr Chernukhin was not. Under the provisions of the Option Agreement, Ms Danilina agreed, among other obligations, to provide â€˜oral and/or written testimonyâ€™ in the arbitration, (Â§5.2(a)); and to commence â€˜such other litigation as might relate to or affect the Arbitration as Filatona might reasonably request in any court of competent jurisdiction,â€™ (Â§5.2(d)). The Option Agreement also stipulated that Ms Danilina should â€˜not communicate with â€¦ or provide any information or documents to any person â€¦ including, inter alia, Chernukhin, Navigator and/or their solicitorsâ€™ (Â§5.6). In consideration of these contractual promises, Filatona agreed to pay Ms Danilina the sum of US$2 million, with a further payment of US$10 million if she were able to obtain â€˜confirmationâ€™ of her â€˜titleâ€™. Unsurprisingly the terms of the Option Agreement figured in the course of the trial; and it will be necessary to consider the agreement later in this judgment.   </p>

But I do not consider that that renders his suggested motive in nominating Mrs Danilina as the beneficial owner improbable.

Secondly, he submitted that there were good reasons in the present case why Mr Chernukhin wanted the contract unequivocally and exhaustively to be seen to exclude him: while he held high political office and was Chairman of VEB, it was expedient to keep any commercial interests entirely out of sight; and that, once he had left Russia, he did not wish to advertise his interest in TGM. </p>

She was the one with the particular skills to make the business of a textile company succeed, and there were sound political reasons why Mr Chernukhin would not want to be identified as a party. </p>

It was submitted on behalf of Mr Deripaska that the fact that the term sheets contemplated Party 2 as having exclusive management of the textile business was â€˜strong evidenceâ€™ that Mrs. Danilina was the joint venture partner. I do not view it in that light. It is consistent with Mrs. Danilina having knowledge and experience of the textile business and with there being a need for such knowledge and experience when the business of TGM had to be carried on for â€˜socialâ€™ reasons (albeit that it might be moved out of the centre of Moscow). TGM could not simply be closed down overnight and the site redeveloped. But the requirement for Party 2 to share the finance of the project is not consistent with Mrs. Danilina being the joint venture party. </p>

However, the Judge also found that this was a risk that Mr Deripaska would have been prepared to take in order to bind Mr Chernukhin so to ensure his financial contribution to the enterprise.  </p>

It is the expressed means by which Mr Chernukhin could intervene in, and assert rights under, the SHA. Mr Fenwick submitted that this provision showed that the SHA is to be regarded as unequivocally and exhaustively identifying the parties to the SHA to the exclusion of Mr Chernukhin. If he were a party to the SHA, Ms Danilina would have nothing to transfer to him. It demonstrated that he was not â€˜the real and only principalâ€™ or â€˜the only personâ€™ who had the rights and obligations under the contract, see <span style="font-style:italic">Fred.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The difficulty with Mr Railtonâ€™s argument is that, although references were made at the trial to the impropriety of the transaction being a â€˜self-standing basis for striking out Ms Danilinaâ€™s claimâ€™, no point was made in relation to Mr Deripaskaâ€™s s.67 claim, no application notice was issued and no oral application was made that the appellantsâ€™ claims should be struck out on the basis of the Option and Loan Agreement. The best that Mr Railton could say was that the application to strike out was â€˜in playâ€™, in the sense that the possibility was mentioned in argument. In complex and protracted Commercial Court litigation this is not sufficient to justify, what was described in <span style="font-style:italic">Summers v. Fairclough </span>at [49] as, â€˜a draconian stepâ€™. No doubt many issues came into play in the course of the hearing, but if a party wishes the court to take the exceptional course of striking out a claim during or post trial, there must be a degree of formality to the process, so that the Judge can consider the competing arguments.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">While the cases concerned with undisclosed principals provide a convenient starting point, the situation with which they deal is very different from the present case of a disclosed and identified principal. When an agent acts for an undisclosed principal, the counterparty has no knowledge at the time of making the contract that there is an undisclosed principal who is entitled to intervene to enforce the contract purportedly made between the counterparty and the agent. However, the law will assume (the â€˜beneficial assumptionâ€™ as Lord Lloyd described it) that the counterparty â€˜is willing to treat as a party to the contract anyone on whose behalf the agent may have been authorised to contractâ€™ unless the terms of the contract or background circumstances expressly or impliedly exclude that possibility (see the <span style="font-style:italic">Teheran-Europe </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">Siu Yin Kwan cases </span>(above)). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It was common ground between the parties that, in such a case, it would in theory be possible for the contract to provide that, notwithstanding the existence of the disclosed and identified principal, the contract should after all take effect as a contract between the counterparty and the agent. But that would be an odd agreement to make, at any rate on facts such as those found by the judge here. I do not find it surprising that the parties were unable to cite any case where a contract was concluded by an agent known to be acting on behalf of an identified principal, but where the contract contained language making it clear that it was the agent and not the principal who was to be bound. </p>
