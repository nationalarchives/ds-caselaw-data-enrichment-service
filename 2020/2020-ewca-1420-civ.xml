Although it was suggested in the written argument provided in support of the appeal that the appeal raises issues of general application, as far as I can see it does nothing of the kind. The outcome is necessarily specific to the particular circumstances of this case. </p>

Various industrial units adjoin the site. However at its northern and eastern boundary is a large area of open land designated as green belt. The appellant is seeking to promote that land for mixed development. That would accord with the emerging local plan. There is envisaged a potential for up to 95 residential homes, as well as an employment mix. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The scrap yard site covers around 0.86 hectares. The eastern boundary itself is some 113 metres in length. For many years it appears that the southern and eastern boundary fencing was of a rather rough and ready assortment, including in places a chain link fence, not always well maintained, 2 metres in height.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Planning permission for use of the site as a scrap yard had been granted on 8 March 2002. Various conditions were imposed. Those conditions extended to use not being carried out in a manner causing nuisance to local occupiers by reason of noise, dust or fumes; restrictions on vehicle delivery and collection times; and a prohibition on incineration. No planning condition as to the height of permitted storage of waste was included. </p>

That also contained numerous conditions with regard to operations at the site. A change of use application made in 2010 for the adjoining unit 10, which became part of the overall site, indicated that up to 5,000 tonnes per year for ferrous and non-ferrous metals would be allowed by the relevant Environmental Permit. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It seems clear that over the years there had been instances of spillage of substances and intrusion of waste objects at and over the boundary, in particular at the eastern boundary. At all events, on 18 September 2018 a planning application was lodged by Benfleet seeking planning permission for a boundary wall on the southern and eastern boundary of the site. In fact such a wall (to a height of 5 metres) had already been constructed on the southern boundary and part of the eastern boundary: the application was therefore in part retrospective. In Box Number 6 of the application form, the answers to the questions whether there was involved “land which is known to be contaminated” and “land where contamination is suspected for all or part of the site” were each expressed as “No.” </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The application was accompanied by a Planning Statement prepared by Chartered Town Planners in September 2018. Among other things, it was explained that the proposed wall would be a 5 metre high concrete panel wall to replace the various “mixed structures” on the boundary. It was explained also that there would be a buffer zone (with access) between the new wall and the actual boundaries. It was said:  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.01in;text-indent:0.00in">“The dual purpose of the wall is to provide an effective screen (being the same height as the open storage on the site) and to reinforce the security for the yard.” </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">The proposals were fully described. It was indicated that the proposed wall would be 3 metres in front of the boundary, with the buffer zone for which landscaping could be agreed. It was stated that the application proposed a “longer term robust and permanent structure” compared to the piecemeal nature of the previous fencing. The wall would be 150 metres from the nearest residential properties and, as well as acting as a screen, would also help to reduce noise from the yard, as it was said, as well as constituting a “significant improvement to the appearance” of the boundary and also strengthening security of the yard.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">One possibly might have thought that such a proposal would be welcomed by adjoining owners. But so far as the appellant was concerned it attracted a very lengthy Planning Objection prepared by consultants, Smart Planning, dated 30 October 2018. Amongst the very many other points raised (extending also to visual impact and Green Belt issues) were the following: </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.00in;text-indent:0.00in">“(6) There is no indication anywhere within the application of the relationship between this proposal and the approved plan (CPT/16/02). This shows a concrete panel fence (2m in height) along the southern and part eastern boundary; and a sheet metal fence (3-4m in height) on the part eastern boundary. The proposal is for a 5m high concrete panel fence throughout, but without any reference to how the yard is used, or is intended to be used. The increase in height will implicitly allow a material intensification of the use which is not factored in to the application.  </p>

This is far from conclusive on what height of storage is allowed (under planning or EA licensing) and how this justifies the proposal to <span style="font-weight:bold">increase </span>the boundary enclosure by some <span style="font-weight:bold">3m </span>in height? The application should clarify exactly what the permitted height is, or if not, then what the intended height of storage, and how this is enabled by a 3m height increase in the wall. </p>

The samples were taken from land immediately beside the proposed boundary wall. The contamination is due to the operation of Benfleet Scrap. The extent of the contamination is now known. It is likely to have leached into and beneath the application site, however we do not need to speculate on this matter. The application involves building operations that will be in and on the contaminated land. Hence as a matter of law, the application must be supported by targeted contamination reports (Phase 1 Desk Top and Phase 2 Intrusive as a minimum) so that appropriate remediation can be considered within the context of the application. In the absence of such assessment, the planning application is fatally flawed and should not be determined.” </p>

There is a direct proportional relationship between the height of the boundary and the height of the metal stored/processed. We know from observation of recent history that Benfleet Scrap does not have the management protocols in place to handle these piles without literally spilling out. To allow more height would be to the detriment of the environment in a number of ways, visually, aurally, through the propagation and failure to remediate site generated contamination in the ground. </p>

Excessive scrap storage also prevents the safe, efficient and amenable functioning of a boundary buffer strip. This situation is not sustainable, and the remedy is not to increase the height of the walls, but to reduce the height of the storage of scrap behind a properly engineered wall of more modest height. At the same time, a proper functioning and accessible bunded buffer strip (say 5m), from which escaped scrap can be retrieved would provide a fail-safe for the applicant’s errant scrap management regime.” </p>

The power is not at large, however: the condition imposed must be related to the development being permitted (ibid, and see also NPPF para 55). So the first question posed by Mr Beglan’s submission is this: in what way could a condition restricting the height of open storage be related to the construction of a wall? The answer provided by Mr Beglan is, he says, to be found in the claimant’s letter of objection: the wall was intended to enable intensification, and a suitable condition might prevent intensification occurring. But the assertion that the purpose of the wall was to enable intensification is merely a feature of the claimant’s rhetoric: there is no evidence at all to support it. Indeed, to an extent it is undermined by the claimant’s own evidence that even without the wall there has been storage over 5 m high. Nothing anywhere else in the material before the defendant is capable of raising this issue. This is wholly different from <span style="text-decoration:underline">Penwith</span>, where the avowed purpose of the development sought was to intensify use of the site and enable the existing development to be used more efficiently and for longer hours. </p>

First, it must be for a planning purpose and not for an ulterior purpose. Second, it must fairly and reasonably relate to the development permitted. Third, it must not be so unreasonable that no reasonable planning authority could have imposed it: see the discussion, and citation of authority, by Lord Sales at paragraphs 31 to 36 of his judgment (with which the other members of the Supreme Court agreed) in <span style="font-style:italic">R (Wright) v Forest of Dean DC </span>[2019] UKSC 53, [2019] 1 WLR 6562.

The planning permission was unconditional. After a number of years, the company applied for permission to extend the factory by a further 512 square metres. It was accepted that the purpose of the extension was to enable the machines in the existing factory to be operated 24 hours a day. Planning permission was granted, but subject to conditions, applicable both to the original site and the extended site, as to the use of machinery between certain hours, as to limitations on noise levels at certain hours and as to the provision of remedial works to prevent emissions. The Secretary of State, on appeal, discharged two of the conditions and varied the third. On application to the High Court, that decision of the Secretary of State was quashed. </p>

The key question in that case thus became whether the conditions in question reasonably related to the development. Since the proposed development (the extension) was positively intended and designed to enable the machinery in the existing site to operate continuously, the proposed conditions, which extended to the existing site, did on the facts relate to the development. The Secretary of State’s concern, that the planning authority were in effect taking the opportunity of imposing conditions which they regretted not having imposed in the original permission, was rejected. </p>

It is said that the risk of contamination (by intensification) had been identified in the Planning Objection. However, the writer of the Report had erroneously failed to appreciate that (in accordance with the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Penwith</span>) there was power to impose a condition restricting the existing operation of the entire scrap yard site, in particular as to the height and storage of scrap, notwithstanding that the original planning permission had contained no such restriction: and, to the contrary, had erroneously taken it that there was no such power. Thus the potential for restriction on the operation of the scrap yard, it was said, was a potentially material consideration which, by reason of the erroneous understanding of the legal position, had been left entirely out of account. The decision was accordingly flawed and was to be quashed. </p>

He submitted that it was completely wrong to say that the writer of the Report, on behalf of the respondent, had thought that there was no available power to consider intensification and whether there could be imposed a condition limiting the use of the scrap yard site. The appellant’s case in fact rested on a flawed and unevidenced assumption that the building of the proposed boundary wall would somehow facilitate intensification of the use of the site or otherwise contribute to potential contamination. Mr Stedman Jones accepted that intensification and contamination were, in law, capable of being material considerations. But it did not follow that they were material in every case: and here the Report, as a matter of planning judgment, had (reasonably) attached no weight to the assertions of intensification made in this particular case. </p>

One must not forget that here the proposed development was to be a boundary wall (with buffer zone) – no more, no less. As is evident from their terms, the various guidance documents relied on were essentially (even if not exclusively) directed at a proposed user of land – for example, residential development – where contamination could pose a material risk to the proposed development. They are not really directed at a situation such as the present. The judge’s approach on this aspect was justified. Thus no further assessment, by way of desk-top study or otherwise, was needed, either. The guidance has, in my opinion, no other material part to play in this case to bolster the appellant’s case. </p>

Although that is asserted in the Planning Objection, quite how such “implication” arises is never actually really explained. It was said that in the past there have, for example, been occasions where scrap has been stacked more than 5 metres high (and photographs illustrating that were provided). Even if that is so, then there is no obvious reason why the boundary wall (5 metres high) of itself would facilitate further such use at the site. More recent photographs, taken since the date of the Report, do show materials in places leaning against or overtopping the wall above of a height of 5 metres. But that, though a regrettable breach of the Environmental Permit, does not begin to justify an assertion that there would be occasioned, by reason of the boundary wall, similar such use or other intensification over this 0.86 hectare site. Mr Beglan was entirely unable to give any kind of convincing answer when the point was put to him in argument and none can be gleaned, apart from bare assertion, from the Planning Objection.  </p>
