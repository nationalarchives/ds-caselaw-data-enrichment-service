I set out the relevant findings more fully below, but significantly the FtT did not find that the Appellant had been dishonest.

On 18 September 2015, the Appellant applied for Indefinite Leave to Remain on the ground of long residence.  By letter dated 23 January 2016, his application was refused.  The Respondent’s official in giving the reasons for refusal stated that the application had been considered under paragraph 276B of the Immigration Rules.  It was accepted that the Appellant could establish ten years continuous lawful residence.  However, with regard to the Appellant’s “personal history, including character, conduct, associations and employment record” the decision-maker had considered information provided with earlier applications for leave in 2011 and 2013.  Those earlier applications were based on evidence of income from employment as a security guard and evidence of self-employed earnings.  The figures advanced by the Appellant at that stage were necessary for him to be granted the leave to remain then given him. </p>

I find that there was no good reason for the delay in their submission until after he had been requested to attend the interview which took place on 23 December 2015.  I find that this is not a case where there has been an isolated failure, for example a tax return being submitted late or perhaps even not at all, as a result of carelessness or an oversight.  Rather it is a persistent failure to submit any tax returns at all from when the Appellant became self-employed in December 2010 until December 2015.  I find that such a persistent failure in all the circumstances provides grounds for substantial criticism of the Appellant’s character and conduct.  The Appellant is clearly an intelligent and welleducated man who was capable of giving instructions which resulted in prompt action by his accountants (see the letters supporting his 2011 and 2013 applications).  I find that, if he had attached any important (<span style="font-style:italic">sic</span>) to filing his tax returns on time and paying the tax that he owed in a timely fashion, he would have had no difficulty in having the relevant tax returns prepared and submitted.  They were very straight forward tax returns when they were eventually filed in December 2015.  Further, I find that he must himself have been aware that they had not been filed, given that he had not paid the tax due under them. </p>

As for the third limb of the first stage of the analysis, Mr Biggs submitted that the assessment of undesirability requires the decision-maker to conduct a balancing exercise informed by weighing all relevant factors.  That would include such matters as any substantial positive contribution to the UK made by the applicant and also circumstances relating to the (mis)conduct in question, e.g. that it occurred a long time ago.

He had (sufficiently) long residence, and had lived in a self-supporting and law-abiding way.  He had behaved properly in relation to his tax liabilities since the index events.  He had a good work record, high educational achievement and good references.  These were significant matters to weight in the balance.  However, there was no sign that they had been:  there was no discernible balancing exercise.

The absence of other offending or bad character is a neutral factor:  see <span style="font-style:italic">ZH (Bangladesh) v SSHD</span> [2009] EWCA Civ 8.  In that case the Court considered an application for ILR under an earlier rule, based on 14 years <span style="font-weight:bold">unlawful</span> residence.

There was simply an absence of additional negative factors.  Moreover, this complaint was not advanced in the appeal from the FtT to the UT.  The more serious the misconduct affecting the “character” issue, the more significant must be any positive factors before a realistic balancing exercise can be conducted.  The issue on Ground 2, said Mr Staker, came down to this:  even if the FtT had gone through the motions of a balancing exercise, the outcome would inevitably have been the same. </p>

It is plain that the Respondent’s decision letter referred to both Rules (paragraph 276B(ii) and paragraph 322(5)) in an undifferentiated way.  Moreover, the decision letter referred to tax discrepancies which are simply not present.  But in my view, deputy UTJ Birrell was correct (see paragraph 17 of his judgment quoted above) in finding that the FtT decision was based on paragraph 276B, and not on paragraph 322(5).  He was also correct therefore, that the “incorrect version of paragraph 322(5)” recited by the FtT was an error of law, but was not material to the conclusion reached. </p>

In my view it is unarguable that they are to be equated, and that any declared policy in relation to the interpretation of paragraph 322(5) must necessarily apply equally and with the same effect to paragraph 276B.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The declaration of policy as to the interpretation of paragraph 322(5) is, in any event, more nuanced than Mr Malik suggests.  The relevant text is quoted in paragraph 29 above, and I need not repeat it.  Where there is “deliberately false information”, the Respondent will generally seek to refuse ILR.  However, even there an opportunity will be given for explanation.  The Ministerial Statement makes clear that the scale of misstatement is relevant, that all information will be taken into account, each case being considered on its own merits.  No such statement can prescribe outcomes across the whole range of cases.  There is a world of difference between “deliberately false information” to avoid paying significant amounts of income tax and “minor tax errors”.  The statement does not, and cannot pretend to, address every case along that spectrum. </p>

The Court proceeded on the basis that declared policy in relation to paragraph 322(5) meant that dishonesty was required in “earnings discrepancy” cases.  Even then, as the court said in paragraph 34 of the judgment quoted above, a balancing exercise was proper practice.  No doubt where dishonesty is proven in an earnings discrepancy case, very strong positive factors will be necessary before the balance will be thought to tilt back in favour of the applicant for ILR.  Discrepant tax returns are strong evidence of crime.  Either leave to remain was sought using inflated figures, or the tax returns represent an attempt to defraud the Revenue, and thus to cheat the public finances of the country where the applicant seeks indefinite leave to remain.  But even then, a balancing exercise is “good practice” and its absence may be an error of law:  see paragraph 38 of <span style="font-style:italic">Balajigari</span> set out above. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Nor is that conclusion altered, in my judgment, by the conclusions of this Court in relation to the appellants <span style="font-style:italic">Majumder</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Albert</span>.  In the case of <span style="font-style:italic">Majumder</span>, a “failure to submit tax returns at all”, was equated by the respondent with the appellant being “deceitful and dishonest in your dealings with HMRC”.  Majumder was given no opportunity to explain what had happened, and that was a clear procedural failure (paragraph 177); it was wrong to proceed from a lack of timeously filed tax returns to the conclusion of dishonesty (paragraph 179) and there was no balancing exercise (paragraph 180).  The case of <span style="font-style:italic">Albert</span> presents more complex facts, which it is not necessary to analyse.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In each of these cases there is nothing in the decision of this Court which could preclude the view that an individual who has, by failing to make returns, sought to postpone (and potentially avoid) paying income tax, deliberately and not out of mere carelessness, can be regarded as having shown conduct justifying refusal of ILR.  But the individual must have the opportunity to explain.  There must be procedural fairness.  The facts must be established and the case viewed on its merits.  There should be a balancing exercise, taking into account any positive factors.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Resort to the phrase “lack of integrity” may well confuse rather than illuminate decision-making in this field.  Although the phrase is good English, and apt as a matter of common sense, it can be hard to distinguish from dishonesty.  It has also acquired something of a special meaning, as analysed by Rupert Jackson LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Wingate</span>, implying a breach of obligations derived from a professional or other special status, rather than poor conduct or character in an ordinary citizen. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In my judgment this appeal should succeed on a simple but important ground.  In all but the most extreme cases, where the conduct complained of is such that on any view the balance must fall against an applicant, even where a sufficient character or conduct issue is proved, a balancing exercise is required.  In this instance there was at least some positive material.  I would remit the matter for a re-hearing to permit such an exercise.  I see no reason why the factual findings by the FtT should not be preserved.  However, the extent and impact of any favourable evidence should be analysed and the balancing exercise performed.  I intend no comment as to the outcome. </p>
