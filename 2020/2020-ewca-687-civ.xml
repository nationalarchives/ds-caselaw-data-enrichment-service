The Properties are houses, some or all of which are in multiple occupation.  They were acquired by Mr Ezair between 1973 and 1984 as investments and were let and managed as part of a business which he carried on as a sole trader under the name of Northern Estates. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In 1999 Mr Ezair decided to incorporate his business using a newly-formed company called Northern Estates Limited (“NEL”).  This is a private company which had an authorised share capital of £100 divided into 100 shares of £1 each.  On 5 April 1999 Mr Ezair entered into an agreement in writing (“the 1999 Agreement”) to sell to NEL the goodwill and assets of the business including the Properties in consideration for the allotment to him of 98 of the shares.  Clause 2.1 of the 1999 Agreement stated that NEL was to purchase the “Business” as a going concern “with effect from the Transfer Date” which was defined as 5 March 1999.  But the clause then contains a list of the assets comprised and used “in the conduct of the Business” which include (at clause 2.1.2) “the freehold and leasehold property as detailed in the Third Schedule”.  This is a schedule of all the properties owned and let by Mr Ezair as part of his business and includes, as I have said, the Properties which feature in this case.   </p>

But it is, I think, common ground that completion of the sale of the Properties would at least involve the execution by Mr Ezair of appropriate forms of transfer so as to enable the transferee to become the registered proprietor of the Properties and their legal owner. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It is also common ground that the reason for delaying completion and allowing the Properties to “rest in contract” (as it is put) in the name of Mr Ezair was simply to avoid payment of stamp duty on the transfers of title.  The result therefore of the 1999 Agreement was that although NEL undoubtedly acquired legal title to most of the assets of the Business, it did not become the registered proprietor and therefore the legal owner of the Properties.  The legal estate remained vested in Mr Ezair on the terms of the 1999 Agreement.  The case for the respondent administrators (“the Administrators”) is that the effect of the 1999 Agreement, at least following the allotment of the shares, was to make Mr  Ezair a bare trustee of the Properties for NEL so as to give NEL a right to an immediate transfer of the Properties unrestricted by the requirement to serve a notice under clause 6.2.  But before I come to examine what were the consequences in equity of these matters and how any rights under the 1999 Agreement are said now to be enforceable by the Administrators, it is necessary to complete the transactional history.   </p>

One of the objectives was to avoid capital gains tax on the disposal of the assets which were to include the Properties.  As part of these arrangements, Charlotte Street Properties Limited (“CSP”) was incorporated as a private company in Jersey.  Its shares were registered in the name of two Jersey nominee companies (G &amp; S Nominees and G &amp; S Nominees No 2 Limited) which were owned and controlled by Rathbone Nominees Jersey Limited (later Hawksford Trustees Jersey Limited) who acted as the trustees of the Jersey settlement.

In his first witness statement in reply (made on 3 January 2018), Mr Ezair refers to the Properties being “transferred” to CSP following the creation of the family trust in 2002 but on terms that they continued to “rest in contract” in his name.

The phrase “resting in contract” meant that I would continue to retain legal title but the Company would have a contractual right to require me to complete the sale.  In the meantime I therefore retained legal title to the Chorlton Properties and continued to hold them on trust for the Company.  The 2011 Agreement accordingly had no impact whatsoever upon the ownership of the Chorlton Properties and does not evidence the Company’s ownership of the Chorlton Properties as the Applicants contend it does.  At paragraphs 12 to 14 of my witness statement dated 3 January 2018 I said that I had the beneficial interest in and beneficial ownership of the Chorlton Properties as at 25 May 2011 as well as the legal ownership.

I should say at this stage that this allegation is strongly denied by the Administrators both as a matter of fact and as to whether what would have been an unenforceable agreement for lack of writing could nonetheless be given effect to on the basis of proprietary estoppel or a constructive trust.  But, for the moment, it is only necessary to recognise that it was deployed as an argument to counter the Administrators’ claim that the Properties continued to be beneficially owned by CSP.  Mr Ezair’s position, doubtless on advice, was that the effect of the two sale agreements had been to transfer beneficial ownership to CSP but on terms that required the service of a notice before Mr Ezair was obliged to complete the transfer of the legal estate.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">As provided in s.234(2), the Court is given power to direct the transfer to the office holder of any property, books or records to which the company “appears to be entitled”.  “Property” can include real property as the reference to “convey” and “transfer” makes clear.  But the provisions of subsections (3) and (4) also confirm that an application under s.234 may not (and probably is not intended to) provide a definitive ruling about title nor is the possibility of such a ruling a pre-condition to the exercise of the power.  Sections 234 and 236 are designed to assist an office holder in the carrying out of the relevant insolvency process by placing under his control the property and records to which the company appears to be entitled.  Although, as Warner J recognised in <span style="font-style:italic">Re London Iron and Steel Co Ltd</span> [1990] BCLC 372, a determination of whether the company appears to be entitled to the property does not preclude the resolution at the hearing of the grounds upon which the application is resisted, it may not provide an appropriate procedure for determining complex issues about title involving, in particular, claims by third parties.  Section 234 creates a summary procedure whereby the office holder in his own name may seek the transfer of company property to him.  Although the entitlement to such an order will depend upon the company’s apparent rights to the property in question and the judge will have to resolve any dispute about entitlement raised by the respondent in the proceedings, the purpose of the power conferred on the Court is and remains as Lord Hoffmann explained in <span style="font-style:italic">Smith (Administrator of Cosslett (Contractors) Ltd) v Bridgend County Borough Council</span> [2001] UKHL 58 at [26]-[28] that of enabling the office holder to carry out his statutory functions by placing the apparent property of the company under his control.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In the present case, however, Judge Eyre QC has decided that the Administrators’ claim based on there being a trust of the Properties in favour of CSP as a result of which the company may call for an immediate transfer of the legal estate is one which can be determined within the scope of s.234 and there has been no appeal from this order.  But it is important to note that the judge did not rule on the exercise of the Court’s discretion whether to make an order under s.234 nor was he asked to consider the applicability or suitability of the s.234 procedure to a claim for specific performance of either the 1999 or the 2003 Agreements.  The Administrators did not choose to pursue a contractual remedy by serving the requisite notices and seeking an order for specific performance in proceedings brought in the name of CSP.  Their position, as I have explained, was and remains on this appeal that the effect of the two contracts was to vest in CSP beneficial ownership of the Properties which entitles the company to an immediate transfer of the legal estates free of any requirement for the service of any contractual notice.  This is a pure point of law based upon an analysis of the legal effect of the transactions between Mr Ezair, NEL and CSP and is, I accept, suitable for determination under the s.234 procedure.  But although the point did not arise as part of the argument on the preliminary issue (and arises only obliquely on this appeal), my own view is that s.234 was not intended to cover the prosecution of a claim for specific performance or for damages in lieu.  The summary nature of the power to order an immediate transfer of the property in question to the office holder suggests that it is concerned with property to which the company appears to have title that could be asserted without the need for some kind of contractual enforcement and the possible resolution of a contractual dispute.  The remedy in such cases is for the office holders to commence proceedings for specific performance in the name of the company which is what they could have done but which they contend was unnecessary in the present case.    </p>

Mr Lander says that there had been problems involving late or inadequate disclosure by the Administrators and that a tactical decision was made to take a stand on the issue about the effect of the contracts and the failure by CSP to serve a valid notice.  There is, however, no evidence about this nor could there be without a waiver of privilege on the part of Mr Ezair.  The result was that the judge was faced only with the narrower legal issue of whether CSP had a beneficial interest which entitled it to an immediate transfer of the Properties.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The judge then turned to consider the substantive arguments relied on by the Administrators in support of their application.  He accepted, correctly, that s.234 is procedural only and does not enlarge the company’s rights over the property claimed.  The Administrators therefore had to establish an equitable or other interest in the Properties on the part of CSP which entitled them to the order sought.  The judge accepted that CSP was not a party and therefore privy to the 1999 Agreement and that there had been no assignment to it of NEL’s rights under the agreement which complied with either ss.52(1) or s.53(1) of the Law of Property Act 1925.  He also accepted (at [46]) that on the authority of the decision of the Supreme Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Southern Pacific Mortgages Ltd v Scott</span> [2015] AC 385 (“<span style="font-style:italic">Southern Pacific</span>”) a contractual purchaser (in this case, NEL) could not create rights of a proprietary character which would take priority over other interests in the land until it had acquired the legal estate.  This was a reference to Mr Lander’s argument that in a case where the contractual purchaser of property sub-contracts to sell the property on to another party before completing his own purchase the effect of the sub-contract is not to confer on the sub-purchaser any beneficial or proprietary interest in the property which is binding on the vendor or otherwise enforceable against third parties.  The vendor in such circumstances does not hold the property on trust for the sub-purchaser or owe any fiduciary duty in respect of it to him.  For this Mr Lander relies on the judgment of Stamp LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Berkley v Poulett</span> [1977] 1 EGLR 86 which was approved by Lord Collins of Mapesbury in <span style="font-style:italic">Southern Pacific</span>. </p>

Consistently with the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Southern Pacific</span>, he has accepted that no beneficial interest under a bare trust can have passed to CSP simply by it becoming a sub-purchaser under the 2003 Agreement but CSP’s assumption of liability for the loans and the payment of the £800,000 to NEL together with its treatment of the Properties as its assets are relied on as founding an estoppel which prevents Mr Ezair from denying that the benefit of the 1999 Agreement has passed to CSP and, with it, beneficial ownership of the Properties under that contract.  CSP has, to use Mr Ezair’s words, stepped into the shoes of NEL as the contracting party under the 1999 Agreement and holds the Properties under a bare trust as NEL did under that agreement.   </p>

When CSP obtained the loans from Northern Rock and NEL in order to fund its purchase of the Properties it did so on the basis that it had entered or was about to enter into a contractual obligation to pay the sum of £1.3m for the Properties in return for the obligation on the part of NEL to transfer the legal estate.  It agreed under the contract that completion should not take place until 28 days after the service of a written notice but it could have served such a notice at any time and required NEL to make title by enforcing its own rights under the 1999 Agreement.  </p>

CSP was never promised or relied upon the prospect of being assigned the benefit of the 1999 Agreement.

It has never been the Administrators’ case that the benefit of the 1999 Agreement has been assigned to CSP.  One of the disadvantages of an application made under s.234 is that there are no pleadings.  But in his witness statement in support of the application Mr Avery-Gee stated that he believed that CSP was the beneficial owner of the Properties based on their treatment as assets in the company’s accounts and the 2003 Agreement which “sells the CSP Properties and other properties from [NEL] to CSP, even though they were (and remain) in the name of [Mr Ezair]”.  This is the case which Mr Cawson pursues on this appeal to the effect that the result of the two contracts was that CSP obtained a beneficial interest in the Properties enforceable against Mr Ezair without service of any notice.  The statements in his third witness statement on which the judge relied are Mr Ezair’s response to that case.  In [25] of the witness statement he accepted that CSP had acquired the beneficial ownership of the Properties by operation of the 2003 Agreement but said that he retained the legal title.

The provisional assumptions may be falsified by events, such as rescission of the contract (either under a contractual term or on breach).

The purchaser has corresponding rights. These duties and rights arise from the contract of sale and it is because of their existence that the vendor is said to be a constructive trustee, or a trustee <span style="font-style:italic">sub modo</span>, of the estate for the purchaser from the time when the contract is constituted. But to say that it is the duty of the vendor as <span style="font-style:italic">trustee for the purchaser</span> to care for the property is to put the cart before the horse and may lead you into error. He is said to be a trustee because of the duties which he has, and the duties do not arise because he is a trustee but because he has agreed to sell the land to the purchaser and the purchaser on tendering the price is entitled to have the contract specifically performed according to its terms. Nor does the relationship in the meantime have all the incidents of the relationship of trustee and cestui que trust. That this is so is sufficiently illustrated by the fact that <span style="font-style:italic">prima facie</span> the vendor is until the date fixed for the completion entitled to receive and retain the rents and profits and that as from that date the purchaser is bound to pay interest. And you may search the Trustee Act 1925 without obtaining much that is relevant to the relationship of vendor and purchaser. Thus, although the vendor because of his duties to the purchaser is called a trustee, it is wrong to argue that because he is so called he has all the duties of or holds the land on a trust which has all the incidents associated with the relationship of a trustee and his cestui que trust. With these considerations in mind I pass on to consider the submission which is foreshadowed in the statement of claim that because, as is the fact, Lord Poulett had on August 2 notice of the subcontract he thereafter had a duty <span style="font-style:italic">as trustee for the plaintiff</span> pending completion of the estate contract to use reasonable care to preserve lot 1, including Hinton House and the disputed items, in a reasonable state of preservation. In my judgment that submission is not well founded. The plaintiff was not, and I emphasise this, an assignee of Effold's rights and interest under the estate contract and was no party to that contract. Lord Poulett could not have required the plaintiff to pay a single penny for Hinton House and could not in the events which happened have compelled the plaintiff to accept a conveyance of Hinton House. It follows in my judgment that as between Lord Poulett and the plaintiff there did not come into being those mutual rights and obligations of a vendor and purchaser of land the existence of which enables one to describe the vendor as a constructive trustee or a trustee <span style="font-style:italic">sub modo</span> for the purchaser. Putting it more concisely, because there was not between Lord Poulett and the plaintiff the relationship of vendor and purchaser the incidents of such a relationship were absent. Lord Poulett did not hold Hinton House as a trustee for the plaintiff and was under no fiduciary or contractual obligation to him to take reasonable care of Hinton House. The plaintiff's remedy in respect of any failure by Lord Poulett in his duty to Effold was against Effold in respect of the consequences of Effold's failure to enforce that duty. I am fortified in my conclusion by the speeches in the House of Lords in <span style="font-style:italic">Shaw v Foster</span> (1872) LR 5 HL 321.” </p>

But even if this difficulty can be overcome by reliance on Mr Ezair’s admissions to the contrary in his witness statement, the question remains whether any right which CSP could enforce to obtain a transfer of the legal estate was conditional on compliance with the contractual requirement for the service of a notice to complete.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Cawson’s immediate response to this point is that there was in fact no contractual requirement for the service of a notice.  For this he relies first on clause 2.1 of the 1999 Agreement which refers to Mr Ezair and NEL agreeing to sell and purchase the Business “with effect from the Transfer Date” of 5 March 1999.  This, he says, indicates an immediate transfer of the business and its assets including the Properties so as to create a bare trust in favour of NEL and a corresponding right to the immediate transfer of the legal estate free of any other restrictions.  In relation to the 2003 Agreement, he submits that special condition 6 on its true construction overrides the requirement for a notice in the definition of the completion date and permits CSP to call for completion at any time without giving 28 days or any other specific period of notice.  </p>

It is clear from clause 6 of the 1999 Agreement that the parties have expressly agreed a difference of treatment between the Properties and the other assets of the Business.  Whilst completion of the sale of the assets other than the Properties was to take place on or at least with effect from 5 March 1999, it is clear from clause 6.2 that completion of the sale of the Properties was to depend on the service of a notice.  There is nothing in clause 2.1 to contradict that and the terms of the Agreement must be read consistently with each other.  In relation to special condition 6 of the 2003 Agreement, I think that Mr Lander is right in his submission that this does no more than to allow CSP or NEL to request completion of the sale of various of the Properties as it chooses rather than being bound to complete the sale and purchase of all of the Properties at one time.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">On the premise therefore that CSP was required to serve a notice under the 2003 Agreement in order to require completion, one needs to consider what it is in the trust relationship created by the contract that has the effect of overriding the notice provisions.  In the light of my view about there being no trust of the Properties in favour of CSP which is binding on Mr Ezair, this question has something of an air of unreality about it.  But if Mr Ezair is bound by his admissions, one can test Mr Cawson’s argument by considering what the position would be under the 1999 Agreement had matters stopped there.  NEL would have the benefit of the trust described in <span style="font-style:italic">Lysaght v Edwards</span> and the other cases I have referred to.  But it is clear both from those authorities and from what Lord Walker has said in <span style="font-style:italic">Jerome v Kelly</span> that the trust which arises is one to give effect to the contract and, it must follow, is governed by its terms.  The contract continues to subsist between the parties so that in the case of the 1999 Agreement clause 6.2 would remain operative.  A demand by NEL for a transfer of the legal estate would constitute a demand for completion of the contract and I can see no basis for saying that the fiduciary duties which the contract places upon the vendor prior to completion can override what the parties have agreed.  If confirmation was needed of this it can be found in clause 5 of the 2011 Agreement. </p>

This stated in paragraph 1 that the Administrators were “entitled to judgment in accordance with the judgment handed down” and then in paragraph 2 adjourned to another date Mr Ezair’s application for permission to appeal “together with issues as to costs and any other outstanding issues between the parties appropriate to be dealt with by the court under the handed down judgment including the terms of the relief to be granted”.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.01in">“Civil trials are conducted on the basis that the court decides the factual and legal issues which the parties bring before the court. Normally each party should bring before the court the whole relevant case that he wishes to advance. He may choose to confine his claim or defence to some only of the theoretical ways in which the case might be put. If he does so, the court will decide the issues which are raised and normally will not decide issues which are not raised. Normally a party cannot raise in subsequent proceedings claims or issues which could and should have been raised in the first proceedings. Equally, a party cannot, in my judgment, normally seek to appeal a trial judge's decision on the basis that a claim, which could have been brought before the trial judge, but was not, would have succeeded if it had been so brought. The justice of this as a general principle is, in my view, obvious. It is not merely a matter of efficiency, expediency and cost, but of substantial justice. Parties to litigation are entitled to know where they stand. The parties are entitled, and the court requires, to know what the issues are. Upon this depends a variety of decisions, including, by the parties, what evidence to call, how much effort and money it is appropriate to invest in the case, and generally how to conduct the case; and, by the court, what case management and administrative decisions and directions to make and give, and the substantive decisions in the case itself. Litigation should be resolved once and for all, and it is not, generally speaking, just if a party who successfully contested a case advanced on one basis should be expected to face on appeal, not a challenge to the original decision, but a new case advanced on a different basis. There may be exceptional cases in which the court would not apply the general principle which I have expressed. But in my view this is not such a case.” </p>

It depends upon an analysis of all the relevant factors.  But in the present case we are placed in the obvious difficulty of determining what arguments Mr Ezair could have deployed had a later assignment and notice been served in time and deciding issues of prejudice which can only properly be examined if privilege is waived.  The fact is that the Administrators chose to proceed under s.234 on what in my view was a false legal basis.  They could, at the very start before commencing proceedings and certainly once Mr Ezair had made it clear in his witness statement that he was relying on the notice provisions, have executed an assignment of the 1999 Agreement in favour of CSP and served a clause 6.2 notice.  Had they done so, all relevant defences would have been before the judge and most of the complicated arguments about title which he and now this Court have had to deal with would have been avoided.  Taking those matters into account, there would, I think, be a risk of injustice if we were simply to allow the Administrators to rely on the July 2019 assignment and notice but hold Mr Ezair to his arguments at the trial.  I would therefore decline to allow those matters to be introduced into these proceedings by way of the Respondents’ Notice.  The remedy for the Administrators is to commence new proceedings based on the recent assignment and notice, to which Mr Ezair can raise any defence which may be available to him. </p>
