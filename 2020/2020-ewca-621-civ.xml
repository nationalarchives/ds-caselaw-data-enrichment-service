	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Under regulation 36 of the EEA Regulations, in respect of a decision to deport an EU/EEA national, there is a right of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) (“the FtT”); but, under regulation 33, the Secretary of State may nevertheless give directions for removal pending the appeal if she certifies that, despite the appeal process (or the period for an in-time appeal) not having run its course, such removal would not be in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights (“the ECHR”).  Regulation 41 provides that a person who has been removed pending an appeal may apply to the Secretary of State for permission to return to the United Kingdom for the purpose of making submissions in his appeal, and that such permission must be granted unless his return might have a serious adverse impact on public policy or security. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Where an appeal against a decision to deport an EEA national is made and the applicant’s case is certified under regulation 33, the FtT has no power to grant interim relief pending the determination of the appeal.  Therefore, any applicant who wishes to obtain such relief has to apply to the Administrative Court for judicial review of the regulation 33 certification, and he can then apply for interim relief in those proceedings.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">That is what happened in each of cases; and, in each, interim relief was refused.  In Mr Garrec’s case, the interim relief sought was a prohibition on removal pending the determination of his appeal.  In Mr Mendes’s case, he was in fact removed to Portugal, so the interim relief ultimately sought was for a mandatory order for his return.  They now each seek to appeal against the refusal of interim relief. </p>

BID were not representing the Appellant in the appeal – the Appellant was formally representing himself – but, the Appellant says, they lodged the appeal on his behalf.  In support of his assertion that an appeal was lodged then, the Appellant has produced part of a fax front sheet of that date, showing part of the first page of the Appellant’s covering letter.

As I have explained (paragraph 4 above), the right to appeal to FtT against a deportation order in the EEA Regulations does not carry with it a right to apply to the FtT for an interim order to suspend enforcement pending the appeal; and an appellant who wishes to have interim relief is required to commence separate judicial review proceedings of the regulation 33 certificate and then seek such relief from the Administrative Court in that claim (as the Appellant did in this case).   </p>

On 22 April 2020, through different solicitors (Turpin Miller), the Appellant lodged with the FtT an application for permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal on the primary basis that Judge McClure was wrong not take into account the evidence that an appeal to the FtT had been made in June 2019, i.e. the fax front sheet to which I have referred.

That Order addressed neither the challenged decision of Murray J to refuse interim relief nor the grounds of appeal upon which that decision was challenged.  In the circumstances, and without prejudice to any other route by which the judicial review may be retained in this court, in my view the Order of 17 January 2020 (insofar as it relates to the Appellant) should be revoked.

In particular, I am entirely unconvinced that it would be a sensible, cost-efficient or indeed just thing to do.  As the discussion at the hearing confirmed, there are substantial procedural and legal issues in the judicial review claim that need to be resolved, including the amendments to the claim proposed only last week to which the Secretary of State has not yet had time to respond; and the legal proposition that the FtT cannot entertain an appeal on the basis that a decision is <span style="font-style:italic">ultra vires</span> and therefore a nullity, so that that issue can and must be determined by the courts.  There are also some potential factual issues such as when the Appellant arrived in the UK and the precise circumstances in which he was served with the notice of liability to deportation.  I am also unpersuaded, as Mr Bedford contended, that the issues in the appeal now before the court (which concerns interim relief) will wholly or substantially overlap with the issues that might, after any amendments allowed, feature in the judicial review.  I accept that some of the new evidence upon which the Appellant wishes to rely in the substantive judicial review may also be relevant in the interim relief appeal; but that does not mean that it is necessary for the two to be merged into one hearing.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In respect of the application to intervene, the AIRE Centre is a charity and specialist law centre dedicated to promoting awareness of, and compliance with, European and international law.  It has extensive experience in litigation before the domestic and international courts, including as an intervener, and (as Mr Cox made clear) it is very conscious of its obligations not to duplicate submissions made by the parties.  I have read the application: the Appellant is supportive, and the Secretary of State neutral.  In my view, the AIRE Centre may be able to provide a useful contribution to the appeal.  Consequently, at the hearing I gave it permission to intervene, limited to 15 pages written submissions and oral submissions limited to responding to any questions which the court may have at the hearing itself. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In my view, it should be possible to hear the oral arguments in less than a day; but, as Mr Bedford considered there might be some doubt (particularly if conducted remotely), I agree that there should be a second day in reserve.  For listing purposes, I formally gave the hearing a one and a half day estimate.  Skeleton arguments should filed and served sequentially.  Mr Bedford has already served a skeleton for the main hearing: but I gave him seven days to consider whether he wishes to make any changes to that.  Thereafter, I directed the Intervener to file and serve its written submissions within 7 days thereafter, and the Secretary of State to serve a skeleton by 4pm on 27 May 2020.  I directed that the appeal shall be listed, if possible, in the period 2 June to 31 July 2020, with the parties giving dates of availability for that period by 4pm on 6 May 2020. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In my view, those directions should ensure that the appeal is fully and properly prepared by the time of the hearing.  However, to ensure that it is, I grant permission to apply.  Given the procedural history, any further application should be referred to me, or of course to the presiding judge of the constitution of the court when known.  </p>
