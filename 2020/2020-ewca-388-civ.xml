The issue arises in the local authority’s claim for possession against the appellant of Jessup Close, pursuant to Ground 5 of Schedule 2 of the Housing Act 1985.  By a decision dated 13 April 2018 Deputy District Judge John Calver (“the DDJ”) held that the respondent had been induced to grant the tenancy by the appellant’s false statement and granted an order for possession.

On 24 May 2000 the application was refused, but that refusal decision was withdrawn on 5 June 2001.  The decision was reviewed in May 2004 and asylum again refused.   On 14 July 2004 she applied for indefinite leave to remain on the grounds of family life. On 17 March 2006 her application for leave to remain in the UK was rejected as she had not provided evidence which had been requested by the Home Office.  A request for reconsideration was made on 4 May 2006, but that was rejected on 15 May.  Another application for indefinite leave to remain was made and refused in 2009, with no right of appeal.  Following further representations by her solicitors, on 22 September 2010 the appellant was granted indefinite leave to remain due to her length of residence and family life in the United Kingdom, and on 8 March 2012 she became a British citizen pursuant to a naturalisation application made in 2011.  It follows that the appellant had no valid right to remain in the United Kingdom until her grant of indefinite leave to remain on 26 September 2010.  The DDJ found that until that date she was not, by reason of her immigration status, eligible for social housing. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0.00in">The DDJ accepted this case, at least so far as it related to the statement on the 2001 form, in response to Question 10, that the applicant had not lived outside the UK in the last five years. He found the answer to that question to be highly material, and that it was a fair inference that it had induced the respondent to grant the tenancies.  The 2001 form was the “gateway to [the appellant’s] entitlement to social housing”.  He did not regard the information on the 2005 form as material, as the children were not becoming parties to the tenancy, were both minors, and it seemed that all the appellant was doing was advising the respondent of the extended household. He therefore found that ground 5 was made out, and that it was in consequence reasonable to make a possession order.  No issue arises on this appeal as to the requirement of reasonableness. </p>

Ground 2 is that the false statements did not induce the grant of either tenancy, because the respondent was unaware of the appellant’s immigration status. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0.00in">On behalf of the appellant, Mr Granby submitted in relation to ground 1 that once the tenancy of Robert Street had been granted, the appellant was no longer an applicant for housing.  The statutory scheme prevented local authorities from allocating properties except in accordance with a scheme. Once the appellant had been allocated Robert Street, her application was at an end, because she had been allocated the tenancy.  The allocation of the tenancy had the consequence that the appellant’s slate was wiped clean of any false statements previously made when it came to any future application for a tenancy.  It was therefore only false statements in the 2005 form itself which could be considered under Ground 5.  There was nothing false in the 2005 form which induced the grant of the Jessup Close tenancy.  Although (subject to ground 2) the false statement in the 2001 form induced the grant of the Robert Street tenancy, it did not induce the grant of the Jessup Close tenancy, which was the only tenancy that was relevant.  </p>

Whatever may have been the status of the application based on the 2001 form in the period between the grant of the Robert Street tenancy and the completion of the 2005 form (when there was no need for the local authority to consult it), once the 2005 form was completed, seeking accommodation more appropriate to the larger family, there was a live application which the local authority had to consider.  What did that application consist of?  It obviously included the 2005 form.  The 2005 form is, however, an amendment.  It makes no sense at all to look at the amendment in isolation from the form which it amends.  It only makes sense to look at the two forms together, not least because they share a common reference number, and the 2005 form does not repeat the questions asked of the applicant in the 2001 form, in particular questions 10 and 15.  The two forms together formed the factual basis on which the local authority was asked to grant a new tenancy, as Mr Payne had explained in his evidence.   </p>

There is, however, nothing in the scheme of allocation of social housing, or in authority, which leads to such a surprising result.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0.00in">As to the statutory scheme, section 159 of the Housing Act 1996 explains that, subject to exceptions, a local authority allocates housing accommodation when it selects a person to be a secure or introductory tenant of housing accommodation held by them, or nominates a person to be such a tenant of housing accommodation held by another person, or nominates a person to be a an assured tenant of housing accommodation held by a registered social landlord.  Under section 166, certain duties are imposed on local authorities as regards supplying information and assistance about applications for housing.  By section 166(3), the local authority is bound to consider any application for housing made in accordance with the procedural requirements of its allocation scheme.  The requirement for an allocation scheme is to be found in section 166A.  Such a scheme must “determine priorities” and provide for “the procedure to be followed”. Section 166A(14) provides that the local authority is not to allocate housing except in accordance with its scheme. </p>

The proper approach to such questions was explained in the judgment of Newman J, sitting as a judge of this court, with which Peter Gibson and Sedley LJJ agreed, in <span style="font-style:italic">Waltham Forest LBC v Roberts</span> [2005] EWCA Civ 940; [2005] H.L.R. 2 at [41] to [43].  The court does not have to decide “what really would have happened”, but whether the false statement had played “… a real and substantial part, though not by itself a decisive part, in inducing the Authority to act”.  It had to be “one of the inducing causes”.  In considering inducement “it is helpful to start by considering the materiality of the statement”.   “A false statement of a material matter is likely to have induced the misrepresentee”.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0.00in">In support of ground 2, Mr Granby submitted that the applicant’s false statement was not material to the grant of the tenancy because it failed to ask the right question.  To recapitulate, the appellant was asked whether she had lived outside the UK in the last five years.  The answer to that question was not capable of demonstrating whether an applicant was entitled to social housing.  An applicant might be eligible for social housing despite having lived in the UK for less than five years, or might not be entitled even if she had lived in the UK for more than five years.  What the local authority should have asked is a question designed to establish precisely what the appellant’s immigration status was.  It was not open to the local authority to contend that the answer to Question 10 was material, because it did not go directly to any matter that would cause or prevent a grant of social housing.  The fact that the local authority was unaware of the appellant’s immigration status was a consequence of their failure to ask the right question. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0.00in">In my judgment, Mr Granby’s submissions overlook the context in which the false statements were made.  Question 10 is headed “Immigration Status”, so it is immediately made abundantly clear what purpose the local authority has in mind in asking it, namely to determine whether the applicant has the necessary status to be eligible for social housing.  That purpose is reinforced by the specific attention that is drawn, immediately below the boxes, to the fact that answering the question in the affirmative will lead to the need to fill out an Asylum/Immigration Form. It is therefore clear to any applicant that the answer to the question operates to trigger an investigation into immigration status.  Answering the question in the negative avoids the need to fill in the further form which would obviously be concerned with eliciting further immigration details.  There was thus ample basis to allow the DDJ to find that a correct answer to the question would have revealed that the applicant was not eligible for social housing, and that the answer to the question was highly material. </p>
