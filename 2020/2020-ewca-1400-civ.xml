	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.00in">It is common ground that the appellant failed to comply with an Unless Order relating to the service of his Reply. On 21 August 2018, Deputy District Judge Goodman (“the DJ”), sitting at Willesden County Court, refused the appellant relief from sanctions, which meant that he was debarred from relying on an assertion of impecuniosity to support a claim for credit hire charges. At the Central London County Court, on 2 October 2019, His Honour Judge Lethem (“the judge”) upheld the DJ’s conclusions. This is therefore a second appeal. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.00in">The narrow point of principle on appeal is whether the Royal Mail service known as “Signed For 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> Class”, which requires a signature before the item is delivered, is covered by the description “First class post (or other service which provides for delivery on the next business day)” which forms part of the deemed service provisions of CPR 6.26. However, that question only goes to the extent of the non-compliance: whatever the answer, the Reply was still late and the appellant still requires relief from sanctions. So this court must decide whether the DJ was entitled to exercise her discretion against granting relief from sanctions under CPR 3.9, in accordance with the three stage test set out in <span style="font-style:italic">Denton and Others v T H White Limited </span>[2014] EWCA Civ 906, [2014] 1 WLR 3926.  </p>

The first respondent is the other driver; the second respondent is her insurer. The claim form was issued right at the end of the limitation period in 2017. The Particulars of Claim were served on 20 October 2017. The claim for damages included a relatively modest amount for whiplash injury, together with a claim for special damages in the sum of £15,728.28, of which the largest single item was a claim for the credit hire costs of a replacement vehicle in the sum of £12,048.29.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.00in">It is well-established that a claimant in an RTA claim is entitled to recover the reasonable cost of hiring a replacement vehicle: see <span style="font-style:italic">Lagden v O’Connor</span> [2014] 1 AC 1067. Reasonableness will be assessed by reference to need, rate and duration: see <span style="font-style:italic">Zurich Insurance PLC v Umerji</span> [2014] EWCA Civ 357. A claim to recover the significantly higher credit hire rates (as opposed to basic hire rates) will usually depend on the claimant demonstrating that he or she was not in a position to pay the ordinary rates upfront; that the claimant was, in the jargon used in the cases, “impecunious” (see <span style="font-style:italic">Lagden</span>, and <span style="font-style:italic">Zurich</span> at paragraph 9(3)). Although there had been some debate as to the whereabouts of the burden of proof in such a situation, Underhill LJ was clear at paragraph 37 of <span style="font-style:italic">Zurich</span> that “in this kind of case it is clearly right that a claimant who needs to rely on his impecuniousness in order to justify the amount of his claim should plead and prove it”. If a claim for credit hire charges fails, a claimant can still recover basic hire rates (what are sometimes referred to in the authorities as ‘spot rates’). </p>

Subsequently, in the Defence, the respondents averred (amongst other things) that the claim was excessive and that the appellant’s decision “to choose an expensive credit hire option over the other available options represents a failure to mitigate loss.” In terms of value, therefore, the impecuniosity of the appellant was the most important issue between the parties from the outset of these proceedings.   </p>

In my view, the appellant ought to have provided the necessary pleading in respect of impecuniosity at the outset of the proceedings so that, in the absence of that information, the Unless Order was entirely proper. If, as Mr Peter indicated, such orders are not uncommon, then that can only be because claimants in these sorts of cases are taking too lax an approach to the obligation to plead and prove impecuniosity so clearly spelt out in <span style="font-style:italic">Zurich</span>.

It is a useful concept in the context of the first stage because it requires the judge to focus on the question whether a breach is serious or significant. In <span style="font-style:italic">Mitchell </span>itself, the court also used the words "minor" (para 59) and "insignificant" (para 40). It seems that the word "trivial" has given rise to some difficulty. For example, it has given rise to arguments as to whether a substantial delay in complying with the terms of a rule or order which has no effect on the efficient running of the litigation is or is not to be regarded as trivial. Such semantic disputes do not promote the conduct of litigation efficiently and at proportionate cost. In these circumstances, we think it would be preferable if in future the focus of the enquiry at the first stage should not be on whether the breach has been trivial. Rather, it should be on whether the breach has been serious or significant. It was submitted on behalf of the Law Society and Bar Council that the test of triviality should be replaced by the test of immateriality and that an immaterial breach should be defined as one which "neither imperils future hearing dates nor otherwise disrupts the conduct of the litigation". Provided that this is understood as including the effect on litigation generally (and not only on the litigation in which the application is made), there are many circumstances in which materiality in this sense will be the most useful measure of whether a breach has been serious or significant. But it leaves out of account those breaches which are incapable of affecting the efficient progress of the litigation, although they are serious. The most obvious example of such a breach is a failure to pay court fees. We therefore prefer simply to say that, in evaluating a breach, judges should assess its seriousness and significance. We recognise that the concepts of seriousness and significance are not hard-edged and that there are degrees of seriousness and significance, but we hope that, assisted by the guidance given in this decision and its application in individual cases over time, courts will deal with these applications in a consistent manner.</p>

At the first stage, the court should concentrate on an assessment of the seriousness and significance of the very breach in respect of which relief from sanctions is sought. We accept that the court may wish to take into account, as one of the relevant circumstances of the case, the defaulter's previous conduct in the litigation (for example, if the breach is the latest in a series of failures to comply with orders concerning, say, the service of witness statements). We consider that this is better done at the third stage (see para 36 below) rather than as part of the assessment of seriousness or significance of the breach.  </p>

Secondly, the submission seemed to be based on the incorrect notion that a claimant was entitled to advance a rubbishy case in stages, from pleading to witness statement to trial, presumably in the hope that, by the time the trial came on, there was a commercial imperative on the part of the respondents to settle the case.  </p>

More generally, seriousness and significance can never be a simple function of the period of default. It would be wrong in principle to suggest a sort of sliding scale that automatically allowed defaults of, say, 2 or 3 days, but not defaults of, say, a month.

They expressly rejected the submission that seriousness and significance could only be measured by whether the breach had imperilled the timetable or affected the course of the litigation.

If a claimant delays in providing critical information, particularly where he has been ordered to provide it by way of an Unless Order, that delay adversely affects the other side’s ability to a take a view about the strength or weaknesses of the claim they face.

That was wrong on two counts: first, because the rule applies only to the service of claim forms; and secondly because service is not effected on the date the step is taken but on the second business day after the step is taken).  The other explanation was a reference to the difficulties of getting the appellant to come into their office to finalise the necessary instructions.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:-0.01in">The most significant element of the stage 3 review in this case comes back to the appellant’s consistent failure to grapple with the issue of impecuniosity, which was a critical part of his case. District Judge Walder made the Unless Order to avoid the appellant simply coming to court at trial and saying: “I didn’t have any money”. For the reasons I have set out at paragraphs 48 - 54 above, the Reply merely perpetuated that stance. This was the point being made by the DJ at paragraphs 13-16 of her judgment, set out at paragraph 14 above. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:-0.01in">Therefore, in considering all the circumstances of this case, I conclude that the appellant and his solicitors have never engaged with the need properly to plead and prove his impecuniosity in support of the claim for credit hire charges. They did not do that at the outset of the claim; they did not do so when the subject of an Unless Order; and they have not done so subsequently. In those circumstances, there was no basis on which the court could grant the appellant relief from sanctions. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:-0.01in">Finally, for completeness, I should deal with Mr Peter’s submission that, in reliance on the passages in <span style="font-style:italic">Denton</span> set out at paragraph 28 above, the delay was the responsibility of the respondents, because of their unreasonable refusal to allow an extension of time in respect of the Unless Order. It follows from the preceding paragraphs that I do not consider that the respondents acted in any way unreasonably in this case; on the contrary, they were entitled to require the appellant to make the necessary application and then to oppose it.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:-0.01in">However, I should also say that, in my view, Mr Peter considerably over-stated what the court said in <span style="font-style:italic">Denton</span> about the need for restraint on the part of the innocent party. Lord Dyson MR and Vos LJ were careful to say at [41] that mistakes should not be taken advantage of in circumstances where the failure was neither serious nor significant, where a good reason was demonstrated, or where it is otherwise “obvious that relief from sanctions is appropriate”. That is a relatively high bar. It was emphatically not designed to give <span style="font-style:italic">carte blanche </span>to a defaulting party to blame the other side for the delays caused by its own breach. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.00in">Although I consider that the DJ and the judge were wrong about the status of “Signed For 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> Class”, it makes no difference to the outcome of this appeal. In my view, for the reasons I have given, they were right to refuse the appellant relief from sanctions. If My Ladies agree, this appeal will therefore be dismissed. </p>
