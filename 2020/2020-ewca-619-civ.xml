	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">The appellant (“Mrs Dhillon”) seeks to appeal against the order of His Honour Judge Pelling QC, sitting as a judge of the High Court (“the judge”), in which he dismissed her claim that the Land Register be rectified by the removal of a charge made in favour of the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> respondent (“BB”) dated 20 November 2002. Both BB and the 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> respondent, the Chief Land Registrar (“CLR”) seek to uphold the judge’s order, although both have filed Respondent’s Notices which raise a variety of other issues, some directly relevant to Mrs Dhillon’s claim, and others relevant to what I regard as a wholly subsidiary dispute as to whether, if the Register was rectified, BB would be entitled to an indemnity from the CLR as a result.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">All parties strove to make good their submissions by demonstrating the potentially harsh consequences for them if their arguments were not accepted. Thus, Mrs Dhillon complained that, if the Register was not rectified, she could be forced out of the property where she has lived for the best part of thirty years. By contrast, BB pointed out that it would be quite unjust if their charge on the property, now worth in excess of £600,000 (including legal fees), could be expunged in circumstances where they had unquestionably been the victims of fraud.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">Like many cases concerned with rectification of the Register, this is a case concerned with mortgage fraud. There is no suggestion that Mrs Dhillon was involved in the fraud which was perpetrated by her husband: indeed, the judge found that both the relevant transfers had been effected using her forged signature. In addition, although the particular facts of the case have given rise to a number of disputes about the precise mistake that was required to be rectified and what, ultimately, is the proper resolution of the difficulties created by the fraud, the underlying issue on appeal remains straightforward. Under paragraph 3(3) of Schedule 4 of the Land Registration Act 2002 (“the 2002 Act”), the court must alter/rectify the Register “unless there are exceptional circumstances which justify its not doing so.” The judge found that there were such exceptional circumstances in the present case which justified not rectifying the Register. The sole question for this court is whether he was wrong so to find.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">The structure of this Judgment is as follows. In Section 2, I set out the relevant factual background and the material parts of the judgment below. In Sections 3 and 4, I note – but decline to decide - two jurisdictional points taken by BB. In Section 5, I deal with the nature and scope of Mrs Dhillon’s title in the property. In Section 6, I address the central issue raised by this appeal, namely whether this is a case of ‘exceptional circumstances’ under paragraph 3(3) of Schedule 4 of the 2002 Act and, if so, whether the non-rectification of the Register is justified. At Section 7, I address the dispute (originally arising between the CLR and BB but belatedly taken up by Mrs Dhillon) about the relevance of the potential indemnity from the CLR if the Register were to be rectified. There is a short summary of my conclusions at Section 8.  </p>

It has two reception rooms and five bedrooms. Mrs Dhillon has lived there since August 1993. At that time, she was a secure tenant. The property was owned by the London Borough of Hackney (“Hackney”) who was the registered freehold proprietor.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">By 1999, Mrs Dhillon had acquired a right to buy the property under the Right to Buy legislation. She had commenced the process of exercising that right, but this had stalled because, as the judge found, Mrs Dhillon did not have the means of making the necessary payment of £167,000 to Hackney. At [23] and [71] the judge found expressly that Mrs Dhillon could not have afforded to purchase the property from Hackney and that, at the relevant time, she was in arrears with her rent. As the judge found: </p>

Before the judge, the evidence was that the property was now worth in the region of £1 million. It was noted that the value of the BB charge (excluding legal costs) was £508,142.52. That figure had grown significantly since the date of the original charge because neither Mrs Dhillon, nor anybody else, has ever paid BB anything either by way of interest or in respect of the capital sum. Including legal costs, but excluding the cost of the appeal, the full debt is £651,195.42. As Mr Polli QC submitted on behalf of BB, the figures mean that, if the property was sold at value and the full debt paid off, Mrs Dhillon would be left with equity of around £350,000. </p>

That was in order that the parties could properly marshal their arguments to address that submission and so that, in due course, the court would know what issues it was being asked to decide. It is too often the case in civil litigation that the pleadings become forgotten as time goes on, and the trial can become something of a free-for-all. That is not appropriate. I can only echo and agree with the recent warning by David Richards LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">UK Learning Academy Ltd v Secretary of State for Education </span>[2020] EWCA Civ 370 when he said:  </p>

I would add here that I endorse the view expressed by the judge to the parties at the trial and repeated in his judgment at [11] that the statements of case ought, at the very least, to identify the issues to be determined. In that way, the parties know the issues to which they should direct their evidence and their challenges to the evidence of the other party or parties and the issues to which they should direct their submissions on the law and the evidence. Equally importantly, it enables the judge to keep the trial within manageable bounds, so that public resources as well as the parties' own resources are not wasted, and so that the judge knows the issues on which the proceedings, and the judgment, must concentrate. If, as he said, there was "a prevailing view that parties should not be held to their pleaded cases", it is wrong. That is not to say that technical points may be used to prevent the just disposal of a case or that a trial judge may not permit a departure from a pleaded case where it is just to do so (although in such a case it is good practice to amend the pleading, even at trial), but the statements of case play a critical role in civil litigation which should not be diminished.” </p>

I consider some of these passages of the judgment in greater detail when considering the grounds of appeal. But the heart of the judgment is concerned with ‘exceptional circumstances’, in accordance with paragraph 3(3) of Schedule 4 of the 2002 Act. The judge’s conclusions were as follows: “68. In my judgment the defendants are correct in the submissions they make. If and to the extent that the claimant relies on the Moncaster Order then she ought to be in no better position than CEL would have been in had it still been the registered proprietor. It had borrowed money in order to finance the acquisition of the Property and had charged the Property as security for its borrowings from BB. As between it and BB, either there was no mistake that required alteration or it would be obviously not unjust for the register not to be altered as long as CEL was the registered proprietor, or those facts would constitute exceptional circumstances that would justify a court not making the order sought. As I have said earlier in this judgment, the effect of the Moncaster Order was to place the claimant in no better position than CEL would have been in. Thus, if and to the extent that the claimant relies on her position as registered proprietor by virtue of the Moncaster Order, any alteration that had the effect of placing her in a better position than CEL would have been in would not be just and would provide an exceptional reason why the register should not be altered.  </p>

However, that is a void disposition that has never been registered. In seeking to rely on Transfer 1, the claimant is seeking to rely on a document that she maintains she did not see at the time, did not sign and which she maintains was the first stage of the fraud of which she had no knowledge and to which she was not party, by which her right to purchase the Property was hijacked by Mr. Hussain… </p>

As I have explained, she did not have any capital of her own. She rented the property from Hackney but was in substantial arrears with her rent. Although she asserts that the money needed to exercise her right to buy would have come from her children there is no evidence that this is so other than her assertion and I have concluded that it is improbable that she could have afforded to purchase the Property from Hackney otherwise than by selling it on at a profit and retaining the difference between the purchase price (including repayment to Hackney of any right to buy discount) and the price at which it could be sold on. This would have meant that the best she could have hoped to achieve by exercising her right to buy would have been to purchase and then sell on thereby profiting from the margin between the purchase and the sale price and, possibly entering into a lease back arrangement with the purchaser.  </p>

She will be left with the Property (which is now valued at in excess of £1 million) but subject to a charge that can be discharged only by selling the Property or, which seems highly unlikely, obtaining replacement borrowing to discharge the BB secured loan. This outcome also gives effect to the Moncaster Order because it placed her in the shoes of CEL and CEL would have had no case for seeking alteration as long as it remained the registered proprietor of the Property.”  </p>

Master Moncaster's vesting order already gives her more than she was ever entitled to" – see para. 25 of Mr Polli's opening submissions. Mr Trompeter takes a more circumspect line in his opening submissions, stating merely that "… it is worth reflecting on … first if [the claimant's] evidence is accepted then the registration of [Transfer 1] was just as much a mistake as the registration of [Transfer 2]. [The claimant] nowhere explains why she ought to be entitled to retain the benefit of the former, whilst avoiding the consequence of the latter …" In my judgment these are issues which if they are relevant at all are relevant only to the question whether there are exceptional circumstances that justify not making the order sought. I do not consider that Mr. Polli is right when he suggests that the facts that he relies on prevent the alteration sought by the claimant being the correction of a mistake. The mistake arises from the registration of the BB Charge when it is derived from a void disposition. The implied assertion that the Moncaster Order is wrongly made is not one that is open to BB because it amounts to a collateral attack on a final order made by a court with the jurisdiction to make it.”  </p>

The essential rationale of the illegality doctrine is that it would be contrary to the public interest to enforce a claim if to do so would be harmful to the integrity of the legal system (or, possibly, certain aspects of public morality, the boundaries of which have never been made entirely clear and which do not arise for consideration in this case). In assessing whether the public interest would be harmed in that way, it is necessary a) to consider the underlying purpose of the prohibition which has been transgressed and whether that purpose will be enhanced by denial of the claim, b) to consider any other relevant public policy on which the denial of the claim may have an impact and c) to consider whether denial of the claim would be a proportionate response to the illegality, bearing in mind that punishment is a matter for the criminal courts. Within that framework, various factors may be relevant, but it would be a mistake to suggest that the court is free to decide a case in an undisciplined way. The public interest is best served by a principled and transparent assessment of the considerations identified, rather by than the application of a formal approach capable of producing results which may appear arbitrary, unjust or disproportionate.” </p>

Whilst the statement in the Law Commission report can be taken as accurate for most purposes, it may in some cases be necessary to analyse the position a little more closely. There is no doubt that section 82(1) of the 1925 Act conferred on the court a residual discretion as to rectification. That position is indeed repeated in para. 5 of schedule 4 to the 2002 Act where, in a case of alteration which is not rectification, the registrar has a discretion to alter the register; the statutory wording is: "the registrar <span style="font-style:italic">may</span> alter the register" (my emphasis). However, in a case of rectification which falls within para. 6(3) of schedule 4 to the 2002 Act, the court must adopt a more structured approach. First of all, the paragraph imposes a duty to rectify the register. Secondly, that duty does not apply in a case where there are exceptional circumstances which justify not rectifying the register. Thus, in a case within para. 6(3), the court must ask itself two questions: (1) are there exceptional circumstances in this case? and (2) do those exceptional circumstances justify not making the alteration? The first of these questions requires one to know what is meant by "exceptional circumstances" and then to establish whether such circumstances exist as a matter of fact. Thus the process involved in the application of para. 6(3) of schedule 4 to the 2002 Act is not identical to the exercise of the discretion involved in section 82(1) of the 1925 Act.  </p>

But the facts of this case show that that might be thought to be something of a one-eyed view. Moreover, I consider that the suggestion at paragraph 13.105 of the Report, that a party in the position of BB </p>

It assumes that the right to an indemnity in these circumstances is undisputed, which seems optimistic and is not the case here. More significantly, when applied to the facts of this case, it would mean that the Law Commission would endorse Mrs Dhillon’s right to acquire the freehold of the property unencumbered (without ever having paid a penny piece for it), and that BB should not worry themselves about that result, because they will be indemnified for their loss by the tax-paying public. Such a conclusion might be said to raise eyebrows, not least amongst that same tax-paying public. </p>

It would give her the unencumbered freehold of a million-pound property she had never owned and could never have afforded. She would be put in a much better position than she ever would have been in if the fraud had not taken place. In addition, I would repeat the point made in Section 5 above that, regardless of whether or not the claim should fail for illegality, Mrs Dhillon’s indirect attempt to rely on fraudulent Transfer 1 must at least be a relevant factor when considering whether the non-rectification of the Register is justified. </p>

In 2002, she would have had to have bought the property with a mortgage and then sold it, leaving her with an equity of redemption. That is the position now, with the additional factor (in her favour) that the equity of redemption in 2002 would have been worth nothing like the £350,000 odd which it is now estimated to be. Nonrectification therefore is amply justified: it is a just and proportionate outcome. </p>

In his subsequent written submissions, he argued that the availability of an indemnity was a “critical alternatively a key factor” in this respect.

Moreover, although pages 2-9 of Mr Warwick QC’s written submissions in reply argue that it is necessary for the court to consider BB’s alternative remedies, and set out detailed submissions on this subject, I note that these points were not argued before the judge and, more significantly, form no part of the grounds of appeal.

That must be the case: otherwise, the detailed provisions in Schedule 4 would be self-defeating because, instead of the two-stage test outlined in <span style="font-style:italic">Paton v Todd</span>, all that would matter would be whether or not the person suffering the loss was entitled to an indemnity from the CLR.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">Conversely, although Mr Warwick QC’s written submissions in reply referred to a number of other authorities, such as <span style="font-style:italic">Knights Construction (March) Ltd v Roberto Mac Ltd</span> [2011] 2 E.G.L.R. 123, as well as <span style="font-style:italic">MacLeod</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Antoine</span>, none of them supported the proposition that the existence of an indemnity was (in his words) “a critical or alternatively a key factor” in any consideration of paragraph 3(3) of Schedule 4. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">Accordingly, having regard to those authorities, it seems to me that the very highest that it can be put is that the possibility of an indemnity is a factor which may, in certain cases, be relevant to the two-stage process in <span style="font-style:italic">Paton v Todd</span>.  Beyond that, it is unnecessary to go. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">I have already said at paragraphs 18-20 above that Mr Trompeter’s submissions, to the effect that what Mrs Dhillon really wanted was an alteration to, rather than rectification of, the Register, fell outside the pleadings in this case and did not therefore arise for determination. But as his detailed oral submissions continued, it also became apparent that the issue as to whether in fact an indemnity was due involved an excursion into potentially complex areas of land law going back over a century, together with a number of authorities, such as <span style="font-style:italic">Malory Enterprises Ltd v Cheshire Homes (UK) Ltd </span>[2002] Ch 216<span style="font-style:italic">, </span>which are regarded in some quarters as controversial. It would plainly be inappropriate for this court to embark on a detailed analysis of that case law when the underlying issue is unpleaded and immaterial to the result of the appeal.  </p>

I am content to assume that the court has the necessary jurisdiction to rectify the Register in the circumstances of this case, and that the points as to illegality are relevant, not to jurisdiction, but to a consideration of the test under paragraph 3(3) of Schedule 4 of the 2002 Act. </p>

The individual criticisms set out in the grounds of appeal are unsustainable. </p>
