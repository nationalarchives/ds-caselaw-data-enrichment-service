Cockerill J held that she did, for the reasons set out in her judgment handed down on 8 November 2019: [2019] EWHC 3291 (Admin).   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The Appellant, SSP Health Ltd [“SSP”] provided primary care services to Primary Care Trusts by taking over 22 failing GP practices and health centres.  It did so pursuant to separate arrangements in materially identical terms that were “NHS contracts” within the meaning of s. 9 of the National Health Service Act 2006 [“the Act”].  One of the features of NHS contracts is that, whether or not the arrangements would otherwise be a contract in law, s. 9(5) of the Act provides that they must not be regarded for any purpose as giving rise to contractual rights or liabilities.  S. 9(6) of the Act provides that, if disputes arise with respect to such an arrangement, the dispute may be referred to the Secretary of State for determination.  The Secretary of State has devised and implemented an adjudication scheme whereby he has appointed the First Respondent [“the NHSLA”] to determine disputes that are referred to him.  An authorised officer of the NHSLA will then conduct and determine the adjudication. </p>

I also agree that the 1998 Act is not directly applicable, because an NHS contract is not a contract at law, and that the provisions of the Senior Courts Act and the County Courts Act are inapplicable because the adjudicator is not a court.  I do not agree that it is open to an Adjudicator acting under the NHS Dispute Resolution Scheme to resort directly to principles of equitable compensation as the Adjudicator is limited to the powers that have been confirmed upon her or him and does not have inherent jurisdiction to dispense equity or grant equitable remedies.  The source of the power, in my judgment is to be found in s. 9(11) of the Act read in conjunction with s. 9(12).  By s. 9(11) the Adjudicator is empowered to give such directions as she thinks appropriate to resolve the matter in dispute; and this power is to be exercised in the context of her wide-ranging power to vary the agreement. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0.00in">Whatever the pre-existing practice, I can see no justification for a blanket policy or decision not to include an award of interest as a constituent part of the appropriate resolution of a dispute where a party has been kept out of sums of money to which it was rightfully entitled.  Put another way, if a party to a dispute has been kept out of their money, it is prima facie appropriate that the resolution of that dispute should include provision to reflect and compensate the party for that fact.  There may of course be reasons why that may not apply in a given case; but that should be for the decision of the adjudicator on the facts of the particular case.  I would hold that the general powers available to the Adjudicator under ss. 9(11) and 9(12) confer a power to award interest where it is appropriate to do so.  When considering whether or not such an award is appropriate it is open to the Adjudicator to take into account the considerations that would apply and weigh with a decision maker if the arrangement were a contract at law and the Adjudicator were a court.  To that extent the 1998 Act and general equitable principles may be relevant by analogy; but, ultimately, the decision as to what is appropriate is a matter for the Adjudicator to decide on the facts of a given case taking all relevant matters into account.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0.00in">Having reached this conclusion, the next question is whether the Adjudicator acted on the basis that she had a power to award interest.  The reasons given by the Adjudicator for not making an award of interest are opaque.  Paragraph 5.41 asserts a failure to provide a calculation or the sum for interest claimed under the individual contract being determined.  This suggests acceptance by the Adjudicator that she had a power to award interest but that the absence of a calculation or a sum specified for the individual contract provided a reason supporting not making an award.  Paragraph 5.42 asserts that SSP has not submitted the basis for its entitlement, which suggests that the power to make an award has not been established.  Paragraph 5.43 (a) refers to the silence of the arrangements in relation to “entitlement” to interest in the event of late payment and (b) states that there is no contractual right for the Contractor to claim interest, both of which suggest an absence of entitlement and that the power to make an award of interest has not been established.  Paragraph 5.44 rejects the submission that the arrangement is a contract at law.  Had her conclusion been to the contrary, the fact of it being a contract at law would give rise to an entitlement to interest under the 1998 Act.  Thus, of the four reasons given, the first is consistent with the existence of a power to award interest while the latter three suggest the opposite. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0.00in">While it may in some limited circumstances be acceptable for a Court to take into account further reasons for a decision that are provided at a later date, that typically occurs in the circumstances of a challenge to the rationality of previously stated reasons, which is not this case.   In the present case I do not derive assistance about the Adjudicator’s reasons from the terms of the NHSLA’s Summary Grounds for Contesting the Claim.  First, the Summary Grounds do not state that they are providing further reasons or clarifying the existing ones; nor do they purport to do so.  Second, as with the Adjudicator’s stated reasons, there is no clear statement that she considered that she either had or did not have the power to make an award of damages; nor, for that matter, is there a clear statement that the NHSLA considers that it does or does not have such a power.  As I have summarised at [14] above, the Summary Grounds concentrated on the grounds being advanced by SSP as the basis of a power to award interest and contested them.  That said, the reasons advanced by the Summary Grounds for contesting them, which were said to entitle the Adjudicator </p>

While I would accept that the Summary Grounds reflect the Adjudicator’s reasons as stated in her decisions, they do not advance the position beyond those stated reasons.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0.00in">Accordingly, in my judgment, the Summary Grounds should be seen as stating the NHSLA’s position in the Judicial Review proceedings rather than as amplification or restatement of the Adjudicator’s stated reasons.  As with the stated reasons, what is said in the Summary Grounds suggests that the effective reason for declining to award interest should be that the existence of a power to do so has not been established.  More particularly, by identifying the issue as it did in paragraph 4.2 and proposing the remedy in the terms it adopted in paragraph 5.2, the NHSLA defined its position in the Judicial Review proceedings as being that it did not accept that there was a general power to award interest.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0.00in">I therefore return to the terms of the Adjudicator’s decision.  I have come to the clear conclusion that the Adjudicator acted on the basis that she did not have a power to award interest: that is the natural meaning and implication of paragraphs 5.42-5.44, each of which goes to the existence of a power to award interest.   Ms Morris QC submitted that, if the Adjudicator had considered that she had no power to award interest, she could have said so more clearly.  I agree; but that applies equally to the Adjudicator’s failure to state that she considered that she <span style="font-style:italic">did </span>have a power.  The failure to state the position clearly in either direction contributes to the opaque nature of the reasons as a whole.  If, however, the Adjudicator was acting on the basis that she had a power to award interest, SSP’s failure to identify the basis of that power, the absence of express provision for interest in the contractual arrangements, and the fact that the NHS contracts were not contracts at law do not, either singly or cumulatively, provide a reason for the Adjudicator not to exercise the acknowledged power.  In other words, if the Adjudicator believed she had a power to award interest, paragraphs 5.42-5.44 are irrelevant. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0.00in">As I have indicated above, it is plain that SSP’s claim for interest was expressed as a claim on the aggregate sum awarded and that the period for which interest was awarded was the period from the end of the period in respect of which the Adjudicator has held that interim payments should have been made to the date of the Response document that articulated the claim.  This Court does not have the information to determine whether that is an appropriate approach for SSP to have taken or whether there are features of any of the individual arrangements that might require further calibration or refinement of SSP’s approach.  Equally, this Court is not in a position to express any informed view on the rate of interest claimed by SSP.  I therefore express no view on these matters, which are for the Adjudicator to determine after seeking any further information or explanation that she feels necessary to enable her to make an appropriate decision. </p>
