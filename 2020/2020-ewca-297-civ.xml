	    <p style="margin-left:0.74in;margin-right:0.00in">Until his death on 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2015 Roger and Sally Kingsley (who were brother and sister) farmed land at Lodge Farm, Cottered, Nr Buntingford, Hertfordshire in partnership.  The principal land on which they farmed (which is the land in relation to which this appeal arises) was owned by them beneficially in equal shares, but it was not held as a partnership asset.  The partnership was allowed to trade from this land.  The profits were shared two-thirds to Roger and one-third to Sally.  No rent was treated as payable by the partnership to the landowners, whether in the partnership accounts or otherwise.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.74in;margin-right:0.00in">Members of the family had farmed this land since the 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> century and Roger and Sally succeeded other members of the family in farming it.  When Roger died in June 2015 his wife Karim and the second claimant (Mr Playle) became executors of his will.  Sally remained in occupation of the land, continuing a farming business (there is a dispute as to whose business it was – hers or the partnership’s).  They commenced this action against Sally claiming the dissolution of the partnership and an order for sale of the land under the Trusts of Land and Appointment of Trustees Act 1996 (“TOLATA”).   The trial of that matter was heard by Mr Lance Ashworth QC, sitting as a Deputy High Court judge and he delivered judgment on 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> May 2019 ([2019] EWHC 1073 (Ch)).  He determined that there should be a sale (the basic principle of a sale was not in dispute) and that Sally should have the opportunity of purchasing it at what he determined to be the value of the estate’s share based on a market value of the land which he fixed, without the land being exposed to an open market sale.  The executors appealed that decision, and the principal point raised in this appeal is whether he was right to do that or whether, as the executors/appellants contend, he should have made an order for a sale in the open market, in order to get a price for the land determined by the market, while giving Sally the right to bid with others.  There is also a question as to whether Sally should pay an occupation rent in respect of her occupation since the death. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.74in;margin-right:0.00in">There is one conveyancing oddity in all this.  The findings of the judge suggest that Roger and Sally were the joint legal owners of the farm.  If that is right then on Roger’s death Sally would have become the sole legal owner, holding the farm on trust for herself and her brother.  However, the order made in this case, and probably the reasoning of the judge, seems to suggest that the claimants were also trustees.  That may be because Sally admitted that that was the case in her Defence (see paragraph 26, admitting an alternative averment to that effect).   Whether or not that is the case, the matter seems to have proceeded on the assumption that they were all trustees, and this court has done the same. </p>

Sally and Karim fared less well in his assessments and he found Sally to be “far from convincing” as to her intentions (or otherwise) as to the redevelopment of part of the land (para 92).   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.74in;margin-right:0.00in">So far as principles are concerned, the judge referred to the relevant provisions of TOLATA and to the authority which lies at the heart of the main matter on this appeal, namely <span style="font-style:italic">Bagum v Hafiz</span> [2016] Ch 241 and the submission that the matter before him should be dealt with as if it were a partnership matter arising under section 39 of the Partnership Act 1890 which meant that a sale on the open market should be preferred to a sale to Sally at a market price, which is what Sally proposed.  When it came to how he should address the risk of a court valuation being less than might be realised on an open market sale he expressed the following conclusions: </p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:1.26in;margin-right:1.00in">“50.   In my judgment, in deciding what order to make under section 14 TOLATA in this case, one of the key matters to take into account is the degree of certainty I can have as to the price I might set for the Farm Land to be bought by Sally being the "true" value of the land. That is to say I must consider how great the risk is that any price I set might turn out to be too low with the result that Karim will receive less than she would do on an open market sale. If I set the price too high, there is no risk to Karim: either Sally will purchase at that price and Karim will have received more than she would on an open market sale or Sally will decline to purchase and the open market sale price will be achieved. As I say this is a key matter, however, I accept the submission of Ms Taskis that it is not a threshold matter that is to say I do not have to be satisfied that there is no risk to Karim that she will not receive full value before I could make an order permitting Sally to purchase at a particular price. That would be to impose on myself an obligation to make an order to obtain the best price for the beneficiaries as a whole, which is a constraint that I am not under in contrast to the position of the trustees.  </p>

	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:1.26in;margin-right:1.00in">51.  One way to reduce the risk would be simply to adopt the higher of the 2 valuations for the Farm Land, being that given by Mr Gooderham on behalf of Karim, and provide that Sally could purchase at that price. However, in my judgment that is not appropriate. It is necessary to consider the reason for the differences in valuation between Mr Gooderham and Mr Alexander. If, as is the case in respect of some items, the experts each hold entirely justifiable but different views on certain elements of the valuation, in particular those items which are a matter of professional judgment but which are not clearly capable of mathematical or scientific support, in my judgment I should err on the side which results in higher figures for the value as that reduces the risks involved.” </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.74in;margin-right:0.00in">He then considered the expert evidence as to valuation and resolved such differences as there were between the two experts.  Mr Gooderham (for the executors) valued the farm at £3,453,000, and Mr Alexander (for Sally) valued it at £3,118,000), a roughly 10% difference.  On the main points in dispute he preferred Mr Alexander’s figure for one particular block of land on the footing that Mr Gooderham had not allowed for access difficulties (which Mr Gooderham accepted would have a depressing effect on his figure) and had not explained why a given comparable, in respect of which the valuers had agreed a figure, was not the best comparable for those purposes.  This was the sort of assessment of value that courts carry out on a daily basis.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.74in;margin-right:0.00in">He then turned to the other area of dispute, namely hope value attributable to certain buildings on the land.  The experts accepted that some hope value should be attributed to the land to reflect the possibility of future development.  Both experts had provided figures for that value.  Neither had said that the only way to sell the land was to sell at a base value plus some overage to recoup any further development benefits.  The desirability of such a sale is a material aspect of Mr Darton’s case.  The judge went through the various disputed elements and decided them variously in favour of one or other of the parties.  In relation to some he expressly carried out his previously expressed intention to err in favour of the sellers in the case of differences.  In others he preferred Mr Alexander’s approach on the basis of the sort of assessment with which the courts are well familiar.  Having then considered other discretionary factors he summarised his conclusions as follows: </p>

Paragraph 1 of the order makes it quite clear that the Properties as a whole are to be sold to the first defendant (Sally).  That is an order for sale of the whole legal and beneficial interest, which is certainly within the court’s powers to order under TOLATA.  What then follows is a mechanism under which Sally discharges the price by paying only half of it to the executors.  That does not make it any less a sale of the legal estate carrying the beneficial interest.  As a matter of conveyancing, the order technically, and in substance, is an order for the sale of the properties and not for a sale of the executors’ beneficial interest in the properties.  The economic effect of the order does not affect that conclusion.   </p>

One of three coowners (A, B and C) sought an order from the court that C (who had moved out) should sell his interest to B.  At first instance it was held that such an order could not be made under TOLATA, but the court indicated that B could have the opportunity to purchase the whole property at a price to be determined by the court, in default of which there should be sale of the property on the open market.  The Court of Appeal upheld both determinations.   </p>

One of those things was to effect a transaction which might not necessarily get the best price, because he repudiated the notion that such a duty always prevailed.  At paragraph 19 he records the submissions of counsel to the effect that the court had “no power” to direct a sale to a beneficiary which would be contrary to what counsel said was a well-established rule of equity that the trustees had to get the best price for the land, and that the interests of one beneficiary should not be advanced over another.

As for the second and third submissions, I shall assume for the purposes of argument rather than by way of decision that the two principles relied upon by Mr. Woodhouse may constitute what are referred to in section 6(6) as rules of equity although, with respect to the parliamentary draftsman, I would regard equity as laying down principles rather than rigid rules. But the purpose of section 6(6) is not to define the extent of the trustees' powers or even functions, but rather to prohibit the trustees from exercising them in certain ways. It is in marked contrast with the effect of section 14(2), by which the court is given the widest discretion to make orders relating to the exercise by the trustees of any of their functions, having regard in particular to the non-exclusive list of the matters to which the court is to have regard, set out in section 15(1) and (3). If, for example, it was intended that the court should be constrained by an overriding requirement that the trustees obtain the best price for the land, it might be thought surprising that this requirement was not included in section 15(1) or (3), even as a relevant rather than decisive matter.” </p>

More generally, I consider that the clear object and effect of sections 14 and 15 is to confer upon the court a substantially wider discretion, exercised upon the basis of wider considerations, than might be enjoyed by the trustees themselves, acting without either the consent of their beneficiaries or an order of the court. For example, section 15(1)(c) requires the court to consider the welfare of a minor in occupation of the trust property as his home, whether or not that minor is a beneficiary of the trust. Section 15(1)(d) requires the court to have regard to the interests of secured creditors (rather than merely to respect their strict legal rights). As I have illustrated, section 15(1)(a) may bring into play the intention of the person who created the trust that benefits be conferred upon particular beneficiaries. All this departs from the general rule of equity which requires the trustees singlemindedly to advance the interests of the beneficiaries as a class, without preferring some of them over others.  </p>

It simply demonstrates that, in exercising its powers in circumstances where, necessarily, the beneficiaries will be in dispute with each other about what should be done with the trust property, the court is not rigidly constrained by those rules of equity which may, pursuant to section 6(6), constrain the trustees themselves.” </p>

Those words do not connote an absolutist approach to questions of value which would require testing the market in all cases of sale.  They are consistent with a proportionate approach to valuation which entitles states to put in place a system for providing proper value short of full market testing.  There is nothing in A1P1 which drives the court to require full market testing in cases where the discretion under section 15 is being exercised, or requires that any exercise of discretion has indisputably to preserve full value, which is what Mr Darton’s submissions would require.  If he were right then (to take another example) the trustees would not be permitted to allow a minor beneficiary (or indeed a minor nonbeneficiary such as a child of a beneficiary) to continue to reside in the property (something apparently contemplated by section 15)  if there was a risk that the property would be worth less on an ultimate sale than it is worth at the time of the exercise of the discretion.  I do not consider that such an exercise of discretion would be inconsistent with A1P1, which demonstrates that there is no such absolute requirement of the kind which underpins Mr Darton’s threshold point. </p>

For my part I do not see how this point helps him.  It is true that if one introduces an absolute requirement before a discretion can be exercised then some trials will be shorter where the requirement is not fulfilled, but that truism is no justification for imposing the absolute requirement in the first place.   </p>

As part of the hope value the valuers provided for sums that a developer would be likely to allow for as the cost of providing a water supply to the limited buildings which might be made available for development.  Mr Gooderham, the executors’ valuer, provided a figure of £20,000 on the basis that a borehole would suffice.  Mr Alexander for Sally allowed for £75,000 for a mains supply.

In my view that is not necessarily the case.  There was no dispute as to the estimated cost of the works (whichever set was to be undertaken).  The dispute is as to what a developer would be likely to require.  That is in not quite the same category as the actual valuation element of the calculation.  It requires a factual assessment of what a builder is likely to require, albeit no doubt influenced by the opinions of the valuers.  If the judge came to the conclusion that he simply did not think a developer would be content with a borehole and would want to pay as little as possible (which the judge found) then even within his own guidelines he was entitled to make that finding and calculate value accordingly.

The judge rejected this proposition, saying that while the section 39 position might be analogous, it was no more than that and its provisions were very different from those of TOLATA.  In my view the judge was quite right not to apply the partnership provisions by analogy.

Further written submissions were then invited, in the course of which Sally’s counsel (Miss Taskis) relied on <span style="font-style:italic">Lie v Mohile </span>[2014] EWHC 3709 as establishing that after a dissolution a partnership had an implied licence to continue to occupy the land under the implied licence which it had had pre-dissolution until it was wound up or a receiver was appointed.

The root error is a failure to consider the real question, which was a question of fact – in what right was Sally occupying the farm?  Whether or not she was occupying in order to wind up the partnership, or whether she was occupying in her own right is a question of fact.  <span style="font-style:italic">Lie v Mohile</span> is authority for the proposition that an implied licence is available to one co-owner as against another when the former is winding up the affairs of the partnership.  It does not follow from this authority that the availability of a licence means that Sally was inevitably occupying under such a licence contrary to the apparent finding of the judge.  It would be surprising if winding up the partnership took several years.  There is no indication that the judge considered that question of fact, and indeed no indication that any particular evidence was directed to it.   Mr Darton told us that there was no cross-examination on the point.  This may well be explicable on the basis of the pleaded case, to which I shall come.   Paragraph 130 of his judgment, coupled with paragraph 137,  suggests that he over-emphasised the significance of <span style="font-style:italic">Lie v Mohile</span> and therefore did not investigate the facts.    </p>

In fact, since there seems to have been little dispute on the occupation rent question it is highly unlikely that the Deputy Master delivered any meaningful judgment on the point anyway.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.74in;margin-right:0.00in">Sally had made an open offer (which was in our papers, though we were not taken to it) dated 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2018.  The offer made in it was to settle the whole dispute, but parts were said to be open to separate acceptance.  One of the stated predicates of the offer was that the rent of Lodge Farm was £55,000 per annum, and another was: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.74in;margin-right:0.00in">All that material seems to me to make it quite clear that Sally was not disputing her occupation for her own benefit since the death of Roger.  It may explain why there was apparently no particular evidence on the matter and makes it inappropriate and unnecessary to consider <span style="font-style:italic">Lie v Mohile</span>.  There is in my view no possibility of viewing her admissions as being admissions that an occupation rent was payable as a partnership debt. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.74in;margin-right:0.00in">It follows from all this that in my view the Deputy Judge’s determination in relation to an occupation rent cannot stand, though to be fair to him it seems unlikely that he had all the material drawn to his attention.   On the material available to us it seems plain enough that Sally was occupying the land in her own right in circumstances under which she was obliged to pay an occupation rent as she herself admitted and pleaded.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.74in;margin-right:0.00in">It therefore becomes necessary to consider what order should be substituted.  In other circumstances it might have been necessary to consider whether and from what period Sally was excluding the co-owners, and whether and to what extent she was actually winding up the affairs of the partnership so as to be entitled not to have to pay for that period.  However, in this matter we have the pleaded case.  Sally has accepted a liability to pay an occupation rent, and she should be held to that admission. It would seem to be a concession covering the period since Roger’s death.   Not only is it in the pleadings, it is reinforced by the open offer and the material deployed on the hearing before the Deputy Master.  The appropriate rate should be the rate underpinning the judge’s findings, which is not explicit but I suspect it is the rate proposed by Sally in her offer.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.74in;margin-right:0.00in">I accept that this decision means that theoretically some of the accounts which have been prepared may have to be re-drawn, because they seem to be drawn on the footing that the partnership was continuing for the purpose of winding it up for the entire period up to the autumn of 2019, whereas Sally was not conducting partnership business for that period.  If there is a dispute as to that then that will be referred back to a Master. </p>
