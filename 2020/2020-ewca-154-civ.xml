Although they were not directly relevant to the issue arising on the appeal, they rightly stressed the importance to local communities of allotments; and their contribution to the general health, mental well-being and social cohesion of communities. There is no doubt that the provision of allotments is in the public interest.   </p>

It is used in part as allotments by Mr Adamson and others. The council wants to use the land to develop new facilities for a primary school; and, in particular for use as a playing field and car parking. In order to do that it needs to appropriate the land for use for educational purposes. The council has a general power of appropriation of land under section 122 (1) of the Local Government Act 1972. That power is exercisable where the land is “no longer required for the purpose for which it is held immediately before the appropriation”. But in the case of land which the authority has “purchased or appropriated for use as allotments” the council may not use the land for any other purpose without the consent of the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food: Allotments Act 1925 s 8. The Minister is now the Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government. It is common ground that the Minister’s consent has not been obtained; although the council has recently applied for such consent.  </p>

Section 23 of the 1908 Act imposed a duty on certain borough, urban district and parish councils, if they formed the view that there was a demand for allotments, to provide a sufficient number to let to persons in their area. In 1922 section 14 of the Allotments Act 1922 imposed on the council a statutory duty to establish an allotments committee. In 1925 Parliament passed two relevant Acts. The first was the Town Planning Act 1925. This gave local authorities power to make a town planning scheme (s. 2); and imposed a duty to make such a scheme on councils of every borough or urban district with a population of more than 20,000 (s. 3). The second was the Allotments Act 1925. Section 3 of that Act provided: </p>

Documents from the late 1950s (some 20 years after the “zoning” for the purposes of the Huddersfield Town Planning Scheme) contained a request from a sub-committee of the Allotments Sub-Committee resolving to recommend the Estates and Property Management Committee to agree to the “appropriation” of a number of sites for allotment purposes, including the Cemetery Road site. Over the next few years the question of appropriation of the Cemetery Road site came up from time to time. The most significant of these was a minute of the meeting of the Allotments Sub-committee on 15 November 1957. The minute of that meeting records that the Estate and Property Management Committee were to be asked to agree to the appropriation of a number of sites, all of which were “at present used for allotments”. The sites included the allotments at Barcroft Road and Clayton Fields, even though the Agricultural Committee had resolved on 7 December 1931 that those sites be made “permanent allotments”. They also included two sites that had been “zoned” for allotments in 1935.

It requires, he said, a process by which land held by a local authority for one purpose is considered and formally decided by way of a conscious deliberative process to be held for a different purpose. That conscious deliberative process must identify and address the substance of the power. The fact that the site has in fact been used as allotments (and has been so used for at least 80 years) is not enough. The best evidence is to be found, not in the minute of 9 December 1935 on which the judge relied, but on the subsequent documents from the 1950s and 1960s, all of which showed that no formal decision to appropriate had been taken. If the land had already been appropriated for allotment purposes, that would surely have been recorded somewhere in the council’s records. It was much more likely that twenty years after the supposed appropriation there would have been a better “corporate memory” than it was possible to reconstruct at the hearing before the judge. Moreover, the minute of 9 December 1935 was not itself a decision. It was merely a request to the Highways Committee to amend the maps for the purposes of the Huddersfield Town Planning Scheme. There is no evidence that the Highways Committee acceded to that request; or that the maps were in fact changed. </p>

The decision-maker as to whether the land is no longer required for a particular purpose is the local authority itself, although its decision would be open to challenge on public law grounds: <span style="font-style:italic">Dowty Boulton Paul Ltd v Wolverhampton Corporation (No 2)</span> [1976] 1 Ch 13.

It follows that the proviso to section 4 (4) of the 1920 private Act did not preclude the council from appropriating the land for use as allotments. That power of appropriation was not conditional upon anything else. In that respect it was quite unlike any of the powers of appropriation conferred by public general Acts. The power of appropriation under section 22 of the 1919 Act was conditional on the consent of Board of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Local Government Board. In addition the power under the 1919 Act only applied “where no power of appropriation is otherwise provided”. Since the council had a general power of appropriation in relation to the Ramsden estate under the 1920 private Act, that power does not appear to have been exercisable over the land at Cemetery Road.  The council also had a power of appropriation under section 163 of the 1933 Act; but that power was also conditional first, on the council being satisfied that the land was no longer required for the purpose for which it was held; and second, on obtaining the consent of the Minister. </p>

More must surely be involved than a mere decision that land held for one purpose will henceforth be held for another. Otherwise, for example, if an authority decided to build houses on a small part of land it was holding for future light industrial development, the change of purpose would involve, indeed require, an “appropriation”, and, as a consequence of section 237, could materially effect the rights of any interested third parties. It seems to me that, at least in a case where third parties are known to have rights, an authority cannot properly embark on such a course unless it has good reason to believe that interference with such rights is necessary. I regard it as significant that a single provision in the 1990 Act, section 226, empowers an authority both to acquire land compulsorily and to “appropriate” its own land.

There was no evidence of a resolution by the Borough Council or Town Council that a portion of the Recreation Ground was no longer required for recreational purposes and should be appropriated for another use.

Mr Goodman's research revealed that the Defence (General) Regulations 1939 conferred on local authorities a temporary power to allocate its land for use as allotments, including land forming part of a park or open space, as part of the "Dig for Victory" project. The temporary power was revoked by section 5(1) of the Emergency Laws (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1953. Section 5(1) also made provision for local authorities to let land for the purpose of allotment gardens, "notwithstanding anything in any Act …. or any trust or covenant or restriction affecting the land". However, there was no evidence that the Borough Council ever resolved to exercise its powers under the 1953 Act to continue to let the land as allotments on a more permanent basis.” </p>

Moreover the premises were for nearly 70 years after 1898 used and enjoyed as property of the corps, and public money was expended upon their maintenance in that character.

Impressions formed by a judge approaching the matter for the first time may be more reliable than a concentration on the inevitable attack on the validity of conclusions that he or she has reached which is a feature of an appeal founded on a challenge to factual findings.

On the contrary, the general position was that a local authority had no power to change the use of land. One purpose of the 1920 Act was to free Huddersfield from that constraint. That freedom, however, was applicable only to the Ramsden estate. It did not apply more generally to land held by Huddersfield. It is no surprise, then, to find that the power of appropriation is drawn in extremely wide terms. In order to exercise the power of appropriation under the 1920 Act there is no requirement for prior consent; nor any requirement that the council be satisfied of anything in particular. The only limitation on the power of appropriation is that the purpose for which the land was appropriated was a purpose for which the council was entitled to hold land. The 1908 Act clearly gave the council such power. It is true that the 1920 Act required a transfer of the loan to be made in the council’s books. But that requirement was not a pre-condition of the power to appropriate. On the contrary, the transfer was to be made “when [the land was] so appropriated;” that is to say <span style="font-style:italic">after</span> the appropriation had taken place.  </p>

Mr Knight accepted that this was so. What had been delegated to the committee were all the powers of the council under the Allotments Acts (except the power to levy a rate).

So, in my judgment, if his decision was based on inferring an appropriation under the 1919 Act, a crucial step in the reasoning is missing. There is no Respondent’s Notice asking this court to draw the requisite inference.

The word “reservation” is an important one. It imports more than merely allowing land to be temporarily used as allotments. If land has been “reserved” for a particular purpose it could be said to have been devoted, set apart, or assigned to that purpose. That would coincide with the dictionary definition of “appropriate”.  The resolution is itself a record of a conscious deliberative decision having been made; and the altered map, taken in conjunction with the resolution, would have “put on formal record [the council’s] intention to behave henceforth in a particular way.” That is enough to amount to an appropriation. </p>

He did so on the basis that the sites to which he referred had already been appropriated to allotment purposes. But that was to beg the very question he had to decide. His task was to decide, having considered <span style="font-style:italic">all</span> the evidence, whether it was more likely than not that the council had appropriated the land for allotment purposes. In the face of the subsequent evidence the peg upon which the judge based his decision will not bear the weight attributed to it. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.00in">An appropriation under the private Act of 1920 would have required an adjustment to the council’s accounts. There was no evidence that such an adjustment had been made (in contrast to the later appropriations in the 1950s). Nor was it suggested that such an adjustment had been made. Although the accounting adjustment may not have been a condition precedent to an appropriation, the fact that no such adjustment had been made is at least evidence that no appropriation had taken place. </p>

It was that which tipped the balance in the <span style="font-style:italic">Lancashire</span> case. In the present case there was no need for the presumption, because the council already had wide powers of land management of the Ramsden estate under section 5 of the 1920 private Act. It was perfectly entitled to use the land for the purposes of allotments without appropriating it to that use.  </p>

As I have said, it is not necessary for an appropriation to be recorded in a resolution which uses that very word. But when all the various points are taken together, particularly the contrast between what happened in the 1930s and what happened in the 1950s, I come to the reluctant conclusion that the judge’s decision cannot stand.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Although I do not rest my decision on this point, I might also add that what had been delegated to the Agricultural Committee were the council’s powers and duties under the Allotments Acts. An appropriation under those Acts (and in particular section 22 of the 1919 Act) required central government consent. It is not suggested that such consent had been obtained. The resolution delegating the council’s powers to the Agricultural Committee was limited to its powers under the Allotments Acts. It did not include the council’s power of appropriation under the 1920 private Act. Accordingly, the Agricultural Committee had no power to exercise that power of appropriation. Nor have we seen any material which would suggest that the Highways Committee had such power. The judge was not asked to infer the existence of a lost resolution of the council under the private Act of 1920. Nor were we. Had this point been decisive, we would have invited submissions on it from both parties. As it is, however, I mention it only for completeness. </p>
