Although it is not entirely clear from that form, the disabilities on which Ms Morton relied are an eating disorder, depression, anxiety and agoraphobia. In their ET 3 form filed on 16 June 2017 the CAB put the question of her disability in issue. That form made extensive reference to an occupational health report prepared by Dr Shand. The first directions in the case were given by EJ Reed on 21 June 2017. He directed Ms Morton to forward to the CAB “copies of any medical evidence in her possession or power” relating to the conditions relied on, together with an impact statement. At a preliminary hearing on 14 July 2017, EJ Harper gave directions to lead up to a hearing one purpose of which was to determine whether or not Ms Morton was disabled. Because Ms Morton had not complied with EJ Reed’s directions, he directed her to produce by 28 July 2017 “the medical evidence” on which she relied together with a statement of the impact on her ability to carry out normal day to day activities. As Mr Self pointed out on behalf of the CAB, there were no limitations on the kind of evidence permitted by that direction. By 4 August the CAB were to notify Ms Morton and the tribunal whether they continued to dispute that Ms Morton was a disabled person and, if so, on what basis. The directions continued: </p>

The thrust of the comments was that although the binge eating disorder had been mentioned in various documents, there was no mention of work-related stress or anxiety associated with that. Ms Morton personally prepared a detailed 4-page point by point rebuttal of the CAB’s position, which was served by the solicitors then acting for her. She also disclosed further medical evidence by the end of that month. </p>

On the same day the CAB acknowledged that Ms Morton had a binge eating disorder and that it amounted to a disability. It therefore conceded that she was a disabled person. But the concession did not extend to the other conditions upon which she relied. On 20 September Ms Morton e-mailed to say that as the CAB had only conceded partly, the joint medical report still had to go ahead. The CAB disagreed. Since EJ Harper had directed a medical report if the CAB did not concede that Ms Morton was “a disabled person”, and they had so conceded, they took the view that a medical report was no longer needed. Ms Morton therefore applied to the ET for an order that the joint medical report should still go ahead. In response, on 2 October 2017 the ET wrote at the direction of EJ Harper: </p>

She said that even if the ET decided not to direct a joint medical report she wished to obtain her own. The CAB on the other hand, in its e-mail of 24 October agreed that the matter should proceed on the basis of the existing medical evidence. They also took issue with Ms Morton’s interpretation of EJ Harper’s original direction of 4 July. In the same letter the CAB set out at some length its detailed reasons for disputing that the other conditions on which Ms Morton relied amounted to a disability. </p>

She said that she had only just received the CAB’s reasons for disputing disability and the list of documents for the hearing. She also said that she suffered from mental health issues, including agoraphobia and anxiety; that she needed time to prepare not just her arguments but also mentally. She went on to say that she would not be able to attend the hearing on Monday. In response the CAB said that the bundle contained documents provided by Ms Morton herself and that she had seen all the documents in the past. They ended by saying that Ms Morton had “had months to prepare” and that the hearing should go ahead. </p>

Although the ultimate decision of the ET records the application and the refusal, it is very brief in its reasoning. But that is because EJ Kolanko gave a more extended extempore oral ruling on the application, of which we have a note. After the application was outlined EJ Kolanko retired for 10 minutes to read the documents. There were then submissions from both sides which occupied the best part of an hour; following which EJ Kolanko retired for 20 minutes to consider his decision. He noted that the application for the adjournment was put on the basis that Ms Morton had not had enough time to prepare; and the lack of a medical report. The essence of the reasoning was that EJ Pirani would have had sight of EJ Reed’s earlier view and that he (EJ Kolanko) had been faced with two conflicting views. There was no basis in EJ Harper’s e-mail that the hearing would ever be postponed. A further medical report would not assist at this stage. The documents flowed from Ms Morton and she was familiar with them. There was therefore no reason to depart from EJ Pirani’s decision.  </p>

The parties were invited to express their views on the matter.

Since the CAB was calling no evidence, the preparation required was the drawing of relevant material to the attention of the ET and the amplification (if need be) of her own witness statement. Two experienced employment judges, well used to dealing with unrepresented litigants, both reached the conclusion that she had had enough time to prepare. I do not feel able to characterise their decisions as perverse.  </p>

Nor, according to EJ Kolanko’s answers, did Ms Morton suggest that she wished to obtain a medical report of her own. The thrust of Ms Morton’s application was that the direction for a joint medical report ought not to have been changed. It was common ground between counsel that in cases of this kind (especially where mental health issues are involved) the tribunal will base its decision on medical materials, but that commissioning a formal report was not invariable. Mr Curtis accepted that the majority of cases of this kind are decided on the basis of contemporaneous medical material and the claimant’s own evidence. In this case the ET had available Ms Morton’s own health records and a contemporaneous report from Dr Shand whose field was occupational health. It follows from this that a decision that a formal medical report would not assist cannot, in my judgment, be characterised as perverse.  </p>

A different employment judge revoked that order on the ground that the preliminary hearing would resolve only a few of the issues that needed to be decided. The EAT (HH Judge Hand QC) held that the revocation of the first order was not necessary in the interests of justice; and hence was outside the scope of rule 29. It is particularly to be noted that the appeal was an appeal directly from the second of the two orders. Judge Hand reviewed a number of authorities before stating his conclusions.  First, he held that a challenge to an order is usually directed to a tribunal of superior jurisdiction and that seeking a judge of the same jurisdiction to look again at an order is discouraged, save in carefully defined circumstances. Second, he held that: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">But in any event, in my judgment this argument suffers from a fatal flaw. Although Ms Morton objected to EJ Reed’s order, she did not appeal against it. If (as Mr Curtis argues) EJ Reed ought not to have interfered with EJ Harper’s direction of 2 October 2017, by what right could EJ Kolanko interfere with EJ Reed’s order? This is the very thing that HHJ Hand QC warned against. In his answers EJ Kolanko said both that he saw no reason to interfere with EJ Reed’s decision; and also that he agreed with it. There is also some force in Mr Self’s argument that there was a significant change in circumstances following the CAB’s concession that Ms Morton was a disabled person. EJ Harper’s second direction of 2 October 2017 (after that change of circumstance) was made without having given the parties the opportunity to make full representations about the need for and scope of any medical report; and that the indication that there would be a joint report was incomplete because further directions (e.g. about timetabling and the issues to which any report would be directed) had yet to be considered and made. Thus EJ Reed’s decision was not the same as a departure from a fully considered and finalised case management decision. Fuller submissions on the need for (and utility of) a formal medical report were made to EJ Pirani who, given the two conflicting decisions, ruled in favour of EJ Reed. </p>

Yet that very application had already been made to the ET and refused by EJ Pirani. Ms Morton was thus doing exactly what HHJ Hand QC said should not be done: namely asking a second judge of the ET to reverse a previous decision of the same tribunal. It is not acceptable, having failed in an application before one employment judge, to make an identical application to a second employment judge in order to provide a peg on which to hang what is essentially an appeal against the decision of the first employment judge.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The starting-point must be that Ms Morton’s application to EJ Kolanko on 30 October 2017 faced two serious hurdles.  First, she was applying for the adjournment of a hearing which was about to begin that morning.  That is obviously very undesirable, for all the reasons given by Lewison LJ, and in any event by virtue of rule 30A (2) it could only be granted if there were exceptional circumstances.  Secondly, she was asking EJ Kolanko to (in effect) reverse the decisions already made by EJ Reed and EJ Pirani.  EJ Reed’s decision was avowedly provisional; but EJ Pirani had made a final decision only three days previously, having considered the very full representations made by Ms Morton in her e-mail of 23 October, and there had been no change in the circumstances since then.  It is very rare that it will be justified for a judge to go behind a case management decision made by a judge of the same tribunal on the basis of substantially the same material. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Of course, as Lewison LJ explains, Mr Curtis relies on that very principle, but as applied to the earlier decisions in the sequence: that was indeed the primary way in which he put the case in his oral submissions.  He says that neither EJ Reed nor (more importantly) EJ Pirani should have gone behind the decision of EJ Harper on 2 October that a joint expert report was still required; and that it follows that EJ Kolanko should have (in effect) reinstated that decision, which would in turn have necessitated an adjournment.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">As Lewison LJ observes, that particular way of relying on the procedural history does not appear to have been raised in the EAT or in the grounds of appeal on which Simler LJ gave permission.  I would not disallow it on that account, but I do not believe that it is well-founded.  I agree with Lewison LJ that it is unsafe for us to assume that there was no relevant change of circumstances as between the decision of EJ Harper on the one hand and those of EJ Reed and EJ Pirani on the other.  But in any event EJ Kolanko had to make his decision in the situation in which he found himself, where the two judges who had looked at the case most recently had decided that a joint expert report was no longer necessary and that the hearing should proceed.  Even if he had been persuaded that they had no sufficient basis for departing from EJ Harper’s earlier ruling, he could not himself sit as a court of appeal from EJ Pirani’s decision.  (And nor can we, because it was not the subject of any appeal to the EAT.)  The most that can be said is that EJ Kolanko was obliged to take into account the fact that different judges had reached different conclusions in the fairly recent past about whether a joint expert report remained necessary.  However, it is clear that he did take that into account.  He could in fact hardly have failed to do so, since it was central to Ms Morton’s submissions to him, but in any event he acknowledged in his oral reasons (as noted by the CAB’s solicitor) that he was “faced with two conflicting views”.  He did not simply disregard that fact or rely on the fact that EJ Pirani’s decision was the later.  Instead, he reached his own conclusion on the essential question and found that the remaining issues could indeed fairly be resolved without a joint expert report.  That is clear from his <span style="font-style:italic">Burns/Barke</span> response (given with the benefit of access to his contemporary notes), where he says in terms that he agrees with the view of EJ Reed and EJ Pirani.   I can see no error of law in that approach.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">I accept that that is not necessarily the end of the matter.  Even if EJ Kolanko was entitled, as I would hold, to proceed on the basis that a joint expert report was not necessary to resolve the remaining disability issues, Mr Curtis submits that he was nevertheless obliged to adjourn the hearing because the late departure from EJ Harper’s direction had put Ms Morton at a real disadvantage.  The essential points in that regard are partly that she would have wished to call expert evidence of her own and partly that she needed more time to prepare for issues which she had been entitled to expect would be determined, one way or the other, by the joint report.  But, as to the former point, EJ Kolanko’s <span style="font-style:italic">Burns/Barke</span> answer shows that Ms Morton did not in fact say to him that she wished to call her own expert evidence.  And, as to the latter, there is no basis on which we could second-guess his assessment that she had had sufficient time to prepare.  Lewison LJ has addressed the particular ways in which she claims to have been put at a disadvantage, and I agree with what he says.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">More generally, I would add that employment judges are very familiar with the kinds of issue that arise in disability claims of this kind, and are fully capable of deciding them on the basis of the kind of evidence that was available in this case – that is, the evidence of the claimant, the GP notes and the contemporary evidence of an occupational health doctor – including in cases where the claimant is unrepresented.  Ms Morton was familiar with all that evidence and was intelligent and articulate.  I can well understand why EJ Kolanko believed that the issues could be fairly resolved without an adjournment (which he was only, as I have said, entitled to grant if there were exceptional circumstances).  I do not believe that there was any injustice in the decision that he reached.       </p>
