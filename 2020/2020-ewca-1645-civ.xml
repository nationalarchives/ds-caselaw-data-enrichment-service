ABC has not completed the contract works in accordance with the contractual timetable. Network Rail has categorised costs amounting to some £13.43 million as Disallowed Cost on the basis that this sum was incurred due to ABC’s breaches in failing to complete with due expedition, without delay and by the time for completion. If Network Rail’s assessment is correct, the practical effect of the Order is therefore that Network Rail is not liable to pay ABC that sum. </p>

That construction is no longer relied upon. There is no challenge on appeal to the granting of declaratory relief consequent upon the ruling on construction in principle, although that was resisted by ABC below. </p>

"Default" in the context of Clause 1(1)(j)(iii) does not merely mean the same as breach. Otherwise the two-stage nature of the test would be collapsed into a single question.  Instead, "default" "connotes some measure of fault in the sense of blame or culpability on the part of the contractor".

As the authorities identify, any contractual clause, however clear, is not to be read in a vacuum. Its meaning has to be assessed in the light not only of its natural and ordinary meaning but also any other relevant provisions of the contract, the overall purpose of the clause and the contract, the facts and circumstances known or assumed by the parties at the time that the document was executed and commercial common sense (within the confines set out above). I therefore move, from the natural and ordinary meaning of the words “default on the part of the Contractor in his compliance with any of his obligations under the Contract” as discussed above, to consider the other provisions in Clause 1(1)(j) itself, and then in the Contract more generally.  </p>

As the authorities make clear, caution needs to be exercised in relying on such a line of reasoning, particularly in the context of extensive amendments to a lengthy standard form agreement.   A close reading of the Contract reveals multiple duplication and redundancy, perhaps to be expected. It is unsurprising that the NR 12 Amendments may have rendered certain terms of the ICE Conditions unnecessary, duplicative, or superfluous. (Thus, for example, “Disallowed Cost” in clause 49(3) will fall within the definition of “Disallowed Cost” in Clause 1(1)(j)(ii) and Clause 1(1)(j)(vi)).  By the NR 12 Amendments the drafters appear to have focussed on targeted changes, rather than a wholesale, line by line reconsideration of the Contract as a whole.  </p>

As for Clause 50 (introduced by the Deed of Variation), where there is reference to “default” and “failure on the part of the Contractor to observe and perform his obligation under the Contract”, the point is at best neutral, since on ABC’s construction there would be no need for any reference to the word “default”: any “default” would also be a failure to observe and perform the contractor’s contractual obligation.  </p>

Its most powerful argument, to my mind, is that such a meaning renders the immediately preceding paragraphs of clause 1(1)(j) redundant. As Carr LJ has explained at [42] above, paragraphs (i) and (ii) provide (in short) that the cost of remedying certain defects will be “Disallowed Cost”, which at least implies that the cost of remedying other defects will not be, unless specifically provided elsewhere in the contract. Paragraph (iii) in its unamended form provides that cost due to the Contractor’s negligence will be disallowed. Thus the cost of remedying defects which do not fall within paragraphs (i) or (ii) will be disallowed if they are due to the Contractor’s negligence, but not otherwise (subject of course to the remaining paragraphs of the clause). That leaves a category of cost caused by some breaches of contract by the Contractor which are not disallowed. However, if Network Rail’s construction of the amended version of paragraph (iii) is correct, all cost due to the Contractor’s breach of contract will be disallowed and the distinctions drawn in paragraphs (i) and (ii) between defects which fall within those paragraphs and those which do not become irrelevant. </p>

That is a powerful, and in my judgment overwhelming, reason to reject the submission that when they used the term “default”, the parties intended to depart from its natural meaning and to introduce vague concepts of blame and culpability.

It was in any event the purpose of the NR12 amendments to clause 1(1)(j) to change to Network Rail’s advantage the regime for Disallowed Cost for which the unamended version of the contract provided. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">On behalf of ABC, Mr Taverner QC argues that clause 1(1)(j)(iii), in its unamended form, requires a two-stage process: Has there been a failure to comply with the contract? If so, was that failure due to negligence on the part of the contractor? Only if both questions are answered in the affirmative would the cost incurred as a result be disallowed. He argues that the addition of the word “default” can make no or no discernible difference to that two-stage process, and the addition of the word cannot, as he put it, collapse the two-stage process into one, leaving the only relevant question being whether or not there has been a breach of contract. </p>

There are three principal reasons for that conclusion.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly, I consider that that is also the legal meaning of the word “default”. I accept that “default” has been given a variety of meanings in the authorities to which we were referred, and it has not always been equated with a breach of the underlying contract. But that is because, in most of those cases, the word “default” has been used in isolation. Unlike the present case, the standard against which any such “default” was to be measured had not been expressly identified.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">But the position was different in <span style="font-style:italic">Perar</span>, where the clause referred to “…any variation of or breach of or default in any of the terms and conditions referred to in the said contract…” This court held that “default in any of the terms and conditions” meant a breach of contract. <span style="font-style:italic">Perar</span> appears to be the only one of the authorities in which “default” was tied to a particular standard, namely the terms of the underlying contract.  The clause in <span style="font-style:italic">Perar</span> is similar to clause 1(1)(j)(iii) in the present case because that too expressly ties the notion of “default” to the contract terms. Accordingly, I consider that the judge’s conclusion was in accordance with the relevant caselaw.</p>

It creates certainty because it is the contract terms which form the basis of any assessment of default.

In its unamended form, the Disallowed Cost mechanism might be said to exclude the most egregious of the costs due to the contractor’s poor performance; under the amended version, that category of Disallowed Cost is extended to include all such costs. That was a modification to the allocation of risk between them which the parties were quite entitled to make. </p>

No clue is given as to how such conduct is to be measured or policed under the Target Cost contract.

This argument even affected sub-clause 1(1)(j)(i) and 1(1)(j)(ii), the two preceding sub-clauses before 1(1)(j)(iii). He argued with some force that there was no purpose in the fine gradations between different types of repair and rectification work in those two sub-clauses if clause 1(1)(j)(iii) meant that all costs incurred because of ABC’s breaches of contract were excluded. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In my view, the structure of clause 1(1)(j) makes a certain amount of redundancy inevitable, even under the unamended form. So an item of cost may survive the scrutiny of clauses 1(1)(j)(i) and (ii), and thus look to be an item of cost that would not be excluded, but if it was incurred due to the appellant’s negligence then (even if that clause had not been amended) it would fall to be excluded as an item of Disallowed Cost at the hurdle of sub-clause 1(1)(j)(iii). In that way, the fine gradations in sub-clauses 1(1)(j)(i) and (ii) would be rendered redundant. Thus the highest it can be put is that, when applied to a cost of repair or rectification work, under the unamended version, the preceding subclauses might be rendered redundant by sub-clause 1(1)(j)(iii), whilst under the amended version, they would be redundant. Given all the other difficulties with ABC’s construction of the clause, I do not consider that this difference, even when taken together with the other redundancies to which Mr Taverner referred and with which My Lady has dealt, could lead to a different construction to that which this court has already indicated. </p>

Accordingly, like the Judge, I am not persuaded that any of the redundancy points affected, or could affect, the straightforward construction which she adopted and which I consider to be correct. </p>
