	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Between October 2014 and February 2017 the Appellant, Mr Khalid Tabidi, worked for the BBC’s Arabic Service on a freelance basis as a broadcast journalist/producer.  In December 2016 he applied for employment in one of two roles as a Broadcast Journalist (“BJ”) in the Arabic Service as part of a new project called “World 2020”.  He was one of eight short-listed candidates and underwent a structured interview of the usual kind, in which each candidate was asked the same questions and the panelmembers noted their answers, and made comments and assigned scores, on an “interview grid”.  On 7 February 2017 he was told that he had been unsuccessful.  The successful candidates were both women.  He resigned and commenced proceedings against the BBC (to which I will refer as “the Respondent”) in the Employment Tribunal.  His original ET1 complained of unfair (constructive) dismissal and breach of contract.   </p>

I shall have to come back in due course to how that claim is put, but the essence of his case was that the two successful candidates for the World 2020 BJ role were preferred because they were women.  At a subsequent hearing on 13 November 2017 it was held that the Appellant was not an employee, and his unfair dismissal claim was accordingly dismissed.  We are only concerned with the sex discrimination claim.   </p>

The Appellant was represented by Mr Emmanuel Sheppard of counsel acting as a FRU representative (Mr Sheppard had also appeared for him at the two previous hearings) and the Respondent by Mr Nathaniel Caiden of counsel.  At the conclusion of the hearing the Tribunal dismissed the claim.  The Respondent made an application for costs, and the Tribunal ordered the Appellant to pay the sum of £4,550 </p>

The appeal was initially rejected by Choudhury J under rule 3 (7) of the Employment Appeal Tribunal Rules 1993 (as amended).  But at a hearing under rule 3 (10) on 14 November 2018, at which the Appellant was represented by Mr Thomas Kibling of counsel acting pro bono, HH Judge Eady QC allowed the appeal to proceed on two grounds which she set out in her order: one related to the liability decision and the other, comprising three sub-grounds, to the costs decision.   </p>

In order to validate that complaint, and also in order to obtain a break-down of the sum awarded by way of costs, it asked the EAT to address three questions to the ET under the so-called <span style="font-style:italic">Burns/Barke</span> procedure.   On 13 February 2019 Judge Eady made such an order.  EJ Grewal supplied answers two days later. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The definition in section 13 (1) on its face incorporates two elements – (a) whether A has treated B “less favourably than” he or she treats or would treat others, and (b) whether she or she has done so “because of the protected characteristic”.  Those two elements are generally referred to in the case-law as “the less favourable treatment question” and “the reason why question”.  The former element is inherently comparative in character, requiring a comparison between the treatment of the claimant and the treatment of “others”, who may be actual (“treats”) or hypothetical (“would treat”).  Two points about that definition which are particularly relevant for our purposes emerge from the leading case of <span style="font-style:italic">Shamoon v Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary</span> [2003] UKHL 11, [2003] ICR 337: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.89in;margin-right:0.00in">At paras. 7-12 of his speech Lord Nicholls makes the valuable point – regularly repeated since, but still sometimes insufficiently heeded – that in fact the two questions are intertwined and that it will often be simpler for a tribunal to approach the reason why question first: if it is able to decide the protected characteristic was not the reason (even in part) for the treatment complained of it will necessarily follow that a person whose circumstances are not materially different would have been treated the same, and there will be no need to embark on the task, which is not always easy, of constructing a hypothetical comparator. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.89in;margin-right:0.00in">Lord Scott and Lord Rodger in their speeches both make the point that even where there is no actual comparator, because there is no-one who was more favourably treated whose material circumstances are the same, the treatment of other people whose circumstances were sufficiently similar might still be relevant in establishing how a hypothetical comparator would have been treated.  I need not give the references since the point is succinctly summarised by Lord Hoffmann at paras. 36-37 of his speech in <span style="font-style:italic">Carter v Ahsan</span> [2007] UKHL 51, [2008] AC 696, where he describes such persons as “evidential comparators”. </p>

That seemed to give rise to two potential points, (1) whether the ET properly had regard to the specific cases of the higher scoring female candidates – it being the Appellant’s case that they did not have the relevant experience to meet the requirements of the job specification and that there were aspects of their performance at interview that were no different from that of the Appellant, which had been criticised in his case but not theirs (e.g. the news story used by the Appellant, referenced by the ET at para. 18); alternatively, (2) whether the ET considered how a hypothetical comparator in the Appellant’s position would have been treated, constructing that candidate from the other (female) candidates, whether or not they were ultimately successful.  The Appellant’s point is that if the ET only focused on his case, and his failings and weaknesses, it would not have taken into account any comparable failings and weaknesses of the higher scoring female candidates, which – if ignored by the selection panel – might well provide grounds for an inference of unlawful discrimination.” </p>

The Appellant’s point is that it was clear from the panel’s notes that one of the successful candidates gave the same answer but was not equivalently marked down, and that another candidate gave an even more irrelevant answer but received the same score as the Appellant: this is the particular example referred to by Judge Eady in her reasons for allowing the appeal to proceed.  </p>

Its conclusion that the reason why they were appointed, and he was not, was that they were genuinely regarded as having performed better than him in interview is, obviously, an exercise in comparative analysis.  The Tribunal fully appreciated that in principle it was concerned not only with the panel’s assessment of the Appellant but also with its assessment of the comparators – see in particular para. 30 of the Reasons, which finds that the reasons why the panel gave the scores that it did to <span style="text-decoration:underline">all</span> candidates had nothing to do with gender.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The real question, and that which Judge Eady regarded as arguable, is thus more limited and specific: did the Tribunal, in the course of conducting the necessary comparison. fail to consider whether there were disparities in the panel’s approach to the Appellant’s weaknesses and those of female candidates, and specifically the successful candidates?  In my view the answer to the first <span style="font-style:italic">Burns/Barke</span> question, so far from assisting the Appellant, affords a complete answer to his case.  The Tribunal was only obliged to consider whether there were disparities in the panel’s approach to the Appellant’s answers and those of the comparators if and to the extent that he relied on such disparities.  It is clear from EJ Grewal’s answer, and particularly from the italicised passage, that Mr Sheppard in his closing submissions did not do so.  It appears from what we were told that he had indeed asked some questions in crossexamination about the Appellant’s and other candidates’ answers to the Maghreb question; but it follows from EJ Grewal’s answer (consistently with para. 26 of the Reasons) that he did not in the end rely on this aspect.  In fact it seems that he expressly disavowed any point about it, since we were told that the comment recorded by EJ Grewal – see point (c) – that “the interview grids were not entirely comprehensible” and that “there was little to be gained by going through them” represented what Mr Sheppard himself said to the Tribunal.  In those circumstances no criticism can be made of it for not addressing in its Reasons either of the particular points advanced by Mr Ciumei in his skeleton argument (or indeed any other disparities).   </p>

As to that, his principal focus was, as I have said, on its treatment of the panel’s assessments in the interview.  That makes sense because it was clearly on the basis of those assessments that the decision not to appoint the Appellant was made: the Tribunal noted at para. 14, and apparently accepted, evidence that “once the candidates got to the interview stage the interview score was the only thing that counted”.  Nevertheless, I should address three other points made at para. 32 of his skeleton argument. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">First, he submitted (at para. 32.1) that the Tribunal failed to consider whether female candidates were treated more favourably than the Appellant by being “allowed to progress through the selection process” despite not having the experience which, he says, was identified in the published job designation as essential for the BJ role.  As I understand it, the reference to “progressing though the selection process” is to allege that the successful candidates should not have been shortlisted at all: if that were established (and the reason why they were shortlisted was discriminatory) then it would not matter even if they had performed better than the Appellant at interview, because they should not have got to the interview stage in the first place.  The short answer, again, is that this point was not relied on in the ET: it does not appear in the summary at para. 26 of the Reasons, quoted at para. 21 above.  I should say, however, that it was not in any event demonstrated to us that the successful candidates did not have the necessary experience.  They were apparently not working in radio at the time of their applications (and Mr Ciumei says in his skeleton argument that some of the unsuccessful female candidates did not have radio experience at all).  But the “skills, knowledge and experience required” heading in the published job designation referred only (as one of a large number of bullets”) to “significant recent experience as a journalist, with a good knowledge of production techniques”.  It is plainly not the case that that requirement could only be satisfied by their working in radio at the time of application, still less by recent experience as a BJ such as the Appellant had had.  We were not referred to any evidence that the successful candidates (or indeed the other successful female candidates) did not satisfy the criterion as formulated; and in fact the Tribunal made a finding (at para. 12 of the Reasons) that the shortlisted candidates were chosen “by reference to the skills, knowledge and experience required in the job description”.  </p>

I am not sure that this point is covered by the permitted ground of appeal, but even if it is there is nothing in it.  The real issue, which I have already considered, is whether the Tribunal failed to address whether differences in the way the panel assessed the cases of the Appellant and of the successful candidates, or their experience, were indicative of discrimination.  In that context it does not matter whether the successful candidates are treated as actual or evidential comparators: the important thing is simply whether there were differences in their treatment that should have been considered but were not. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Thirdly, he submitted (at para. 13.3) that the Tribunal “did not consider the characteristics of a suitable hypothetical compactor – namely, a female candidate with the same recent relevant experience as the Appellant and who gave the same answers at interview”.  But it was not necessary for it to do so: see para. 11 (1) above.  This is a clear case where the Tribunal considered directly whether the Appellant’s gender had played any part in the Respondent’s decision – that is, “the reason why question” – and decided that it did not.  That being so, it followed that a person whose material circumstances were identical would have been treated in the same way, and there was no need to construct a hypothetical comparator.  The skeleton argument anticipates that answer and complains that the Tribunal’s alternative decision was made without considering the cases of the comparators; but that brings us back to the Appellant’s primary criticism, which I have rejected. </p>

This point goes nowhere because there is no substantial difference between the two.  In any event, when it comes to the particular issues in the case it was fully entitled to focus its reasoning on the particular points that Mr Sheppard identified in his closing submissions as justifying the drawing of an inference of discrimination: see para. 26 of the Reasons and the first <span style="font-style:italic">Burns/Barke</span> answer. </p>

That is the kind of factual assessment which it is the responsibility of the tribunal to make, and its conclusion cannot be interfered with on appeal unless it is shown to be vitiated by an error of law.  I can see no such error in the Tribunal’s reasoning; indeed its decision is entirely understandable on the basis of the evidence to which it refers.  I would add, finally, that this is the precisely the kind of case in which permission to appeal would have been refused if a second appeals test of the kind which applies in most other fields were in place. </p>

I too am unable to see any error of law in the reasoning that the ET expressed or in their conclusions and accordingly there is no reason to interfere with them. I agree that if the customary “second appeals” criteria had applied to this jurisdiction, as they do to virtually all others, permission to appeal would have been refused. In my judgment, it is high time that that the legislation was amended to enable that test to be adopted for appeals from cases which have already had the attention, not only of the expert ET, but also of the expert EAT.

The only reasons given were that gender had not been a factor in the selection and that a female candidate had performed less well than the Appellant whereas a male candidate had done better: see para. 64 (4) of the judgment of Morgan J. That was merely a simplified statement of the issue in the case, without demonstrating that the Appellant’s case was without foundation. Reliance on the costs warning letter by the ET was ground 4F of the grounds of appeal and, for my part, I would not be inclined to say that that ground was insufficient to permit argument on this point. Certainly, I see no prejudice in permitting the Appellant to take the point, simply on a narrow view of grounds drafted by him when acting in person.  </p>

The reality was that this was a case permitted to go forward by the ET itself on the basis that it presented a reasonably arguable claim. Disclosure was very late and in part resisted by the Respondent. Statements were exchanged on 15 December 2017, with a hearing to follow immediately after the Christmas and New Year holidays. The threat of the costs application was made by the Respondent before these steps were complete. On any basis, the finding that there was no real prospect of success was a very harsh one in such circumstances. </p>

We considered the Respondent's application for costs and we are satisfied that the threshold is established and crossed in this case, in that the claim had no reasonable prospect of success.  That is evident from our conclusion that the Claimant failed to establish a prima facie case and the factors upon which he relied were incapable of establishing sex discrimination. Having decided that we nevertheless still have a discretion as to whether we make an award for costs, and if so, for how much? In deciding how to exercise that discretion, we took into account the fact that a costs warning letter was sent to the Claimant highlighting the weaknesses and the difficulties in his case. We accept that at the time that letter was sent witness statements had not been exchanged and some of the evidence which was relied upon in this Tribunal had not been disclosed to the Claimant. However, the witness statements were exchanged and all the evidence was disclosed before this hearing started. At that stage it ought to have been abundantly clear to anybody that the claim had no reasonable prospect of success. Although the deadline for withdrawing had expired, it was still open to the Claimant and/or his representatives to engage with the Respondent and to enquire from them as to whether they would still be willing not to pursue costs if the Claimant withdrew his case. In our experience it is very likely that if such an approach had been made at that stage the Respondent would have extended the deadline and agreed not to pursue costs. Had they failed to do so then the Claimant obviously would have been in a much stronger position today in front of us defending the application for costs but that was not what happened. We, therefore, think that it is appropriate to make an order for costs.  </p>
