It might be thought that the question of whether she has a valid legal claim against Wigan Metropolitan Borough Council (“Wigan” or “the Council”), the present owners and occupiers of the park, would be a straightforward one. Far from it. Although the material facts are scarcely in dispute the case has already resulted in two different decisions by judges in the county court and High Court; the authorities cited to us by counsel include five cases from the 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> century; and some of the issues raised have not been authoritatively decided at appellate level. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">At a case management conference on 17 July 2018 an order was made for liability to be tried as a preliminary issue. The trial of that issue came before His Honour Judge Platts at the Manchester County Court on 13 December 2018. In an extempore judgment given at the conclusion of the hearing he dismissed the claim but granted permission to appeal to the High Court. That appeal was heard by Waksman J on 10 June 2019. By his reserved judgment handed down on 19 June 2019 ([2020] 1 WLR 29; [2019] EWHC 1546 (QB)) he allowed the appeal on liability. The Council were given permission to appeal to this court by Males LJ on 25 November 2019.  </p>

There is no evidence of the park ever having been closed to the public since its creation in the 1930s. Judge Platts found at paragraph 8 that “…..there is no doubt that the public enjoyed access to it on an unrestricted basis. Whether the council or its predecessor intended that the public should have a legal right of unrestricted access to the park is not common ground.” </p>

However, shortly before the first appeal was heard by Waksman J it was admitted that Abram had been the highway authority, though denied that it was acting in that capacity when it constructed the paths in the park. That remained Wigan’s position before us. </p>

(The particulars of claim did include allegations of common law negligence, but these were not pursued at the trial). So we, like Judge Platts and Waksman J, have to deal with the case on the basis that Ms Barlow can only succeed in her claim by showing that the Path on which she fell was a highway maintainable at public expense, so that she has a cause of action for breach of statutory duty under s 41 of the Highways Act 1980. But in doing so we must not be taken to endorse the correctness of the Council’s contention. Since there may be other cases of this kind in the future, and since the proposition that a local authority can owe a greater duty to park users walking on the grass than to park users walking on a path is to my mind absurd, I should put on record why I consider that <span style="font-style:italic">McGeown v </span></p>

Part of the land of the estate, in the ownership of the defendant housing authority, was crossed by footpaths over which the public had acquired a right of way. The plaintiff was walking on one of the paths when she tripped on a hole in it and broke her leg. The hole was a danger to persons using the path and resulted from a failure to keep the path in good repair. Her claim against the housing authority for damages for breach of the Occupiers’ Liability Act (Northern Ireland) 1957 was dismissed.

But whether that is the case will have to await a decision in another claim. I only add that if I am wrong about this, and there really is no duty on anyone to maintain paths in municipal parks which have become rights of way, the traditional notices saying KEEP OFF THE GRASS ought in fairness to park users to be replaced by notices saying KEEP OFF THE PATHS. </p>

The latter argument had not been advanced at the trial because at that stage the Council were contending that Abram had not been the highway authority. Wigan further argued by way of cross-appeal that s 36(2)(a) of the 1980 Act can only operate prospectively in the sense that it can only apply to highways constructed after the 1980 Act came into force (the retrospectivity issue).  </p>

In this particular case, it is common ground that the Path had the attribute of a highway to the extent that the public had the right of passage and repassage along it, and not simply as invitees or licensees. However, in addition, and as explained above, it had also to be dedicated as such, either expressly or impliedly, in the sense of being presumed by long usage. The construction placed upon s36 (2) (a) by the Judge in effect was that the only kind of dedication which would be compliant with it was an express dedication at the time when the highway was first created. The problem with that is that if a highway authority created a relevant public way but did not dedicate it as a highway for, say, 6 months, it would fall outside of s36 (2) (a). The effect would be that because it was a highway, no duty would be owed to users under the OLA (see <span style="font-style:italic">McGeown</span>), nor would there be any duty to maintain pursuant to s41 of the Act. That would seem a very odd result, but the Council accepted that this is what the Judge's construction, which it supported, entailed. It was said that the problem might be mitigated if the highway authority decided formally to adopt the highway - but of course that would be a matter of choice for the authority. It was also said by the Council that the result was not odd anyway because a private landowner could always dedicate a way running through his land as a highway with the result that he no longer owed any duty under the OLA, nor any other duty. While that statement is correct I do not accept the parallel between the position of a private landowner and a public authority.  </p>

It could be argued that on any view, s36 (2) (a) would not apply where there was no express dedication at all but only one which is presumed after an interrupted public usage after time either pursuant to s31 of the Act or at common-law. But so far as the language of s36 (2) (a) is concerned, it is difficult to see why this limitation should be imposed. Once it is recognised that the relevant highway may have become such after its initial construction there is nothing in the wording to limit the way in which it later became a highway.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.00in;text-indent:0.5in">A different objection to this interpretation, so as to cover the Path in this case, might be that the relevant authority may be unaware that the way which had originally been constructed by it had become a highway so as now to attract the duty to maintain. That is true, but then that depends on the attention paid to paths on what is, after all, its own land which have been used by members of the public for long periods. After all, a highway authority is already fixed with the status of such a path so as to give the public a right to use it after long usage, whether it realised it or not. Moreover, prior to becoming a highway, the Council would have owed duties to visitors in respect of the Path (as with the rest of the park) under the OLA. Practically, therefore, there would not be much difference from the point of view of the Council's legal duties, between the position before the Path became a highway, and afterwards. And even if the emergence of a s41 duty to maintain the Path made some sort of practical difference, if the relevant authority already had to take reasonable steps to ensure that the park itself was in a safe condition it is difficult to see why it adds very much to maintain the paths owned by it and which run to and across the park. Finally, in the context of parks, and using this case as an example, it would seem an undesirable outcome if the park itself, including the Path, attracted duties to visitors under the 1957 Act, whereas the Path no longer attracted similar duties once it became a highway.”  </p>

The fact that the highway itself may have been constructed at an earlier stage does not amount to the imposition of a retrospective liability. Second, it should be noted immediately that in contrast to s38(2)(b) of the 1959 Act, which is in substance the same as s36(2)(a), there is no express limitation within s36(2)(a) to highways created after the commencement of the Act.

Since it was enacted primarily as a consolidating statute, Parliament cannot be said to have intended to change the law and render existing highways maintainable at public expense. While some of the provisions in the Act did change the existing law to give effect to Law Commission recommendations, none of those provisions is relevant for the present appeal. Mr Cawson submitted that Parliament’s intention is further evidenced by the operation of s 36(1) of the 1980 Act, which provides that highways that were maintainable at public expense immediately before the commencement of the Act continue to be maintainable. He submitted that if Parliament had intended s 36(2)(a) to apply retrospectively, it would not have enacted an additional provision designed to catch highways constructed prior to the commencement of the 1980 Act.  </p>

He relied on the decision of this court in  <span style="font-style:italic">Gulliksen</span> , in which Sedley LJ said at [18] that a local authority is a single body corporate, and that he “would not in any event have found it easy to adopt the view of Neuberger J that section 36(2)(a) of the 1980 Act contemplated a highway authority acting as such”. He also rejected the notion that his interpretation would render otiose s 38(2)(c) of the HA 1959 and s 36(2)(b) of the HA 1980. Those sub-sections, he argued, were designed for those local authorities which are not highway authorities and which construct housing pursuant their powers under the Housing Act 1957.  </p>

Mr White suggested that there was sufficient positive evidence to demonstrate that the Council did act in its capacity as a highway authority, but that even if no such evidence was available, the burden should fall on the Council to prove that it was not acting as a highway authority. Mr White submitted that in the light of the evidence, the Council could not discharge this burden and thus could not show that it was acting exclusively in any capacity other than as a highway authority. </p>

There is nothing in the language of the subsection to support such an interpretation and there are positive reasons for rejecting it. The common law process of dedication requires the public to accept a highway for it to be created; it cannot be constructed “as such” by a highway authority. Mr White also submitted that practical difficulties would be created by reading into the legislation a requirement that an authority must construct the highway with the intention of building a highway. It would mean, for example, that a highway authority which initially intends to create a path, but subsequently decides to upgrade the path to a bridleway, would not have created a highway maintainable at public expense. Mr White submitted that there are good policy arguments for rejecting a requirement of intention at the time of construction. Rejecting it would reduce the number of highways for which no one is liable to repair and would afford a remedy to individuals who are injured by neglect on the part of public authorities.  </p>

Mr White submitted that under s 47(1) of the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 all public paths became repairable by the inhabitants of the parish at large, so if the Path had been, or is deemed to have been, dedicated prior to the commencement of the 1949 Act (16 December 1949) it was repairable by the inhabitants of the parish at large. Since s 38(2)(a) of the HA 1959 provided that a highway maintainable at public expense included “a highway which immediately before the commencement of this Act was maintainable by the inhabitants at large of any area or maintainable by a highway authority”, the Path became a highway maintainable at public expense in 1959. It was therefore caught by s 36(1) of the HA 1980 which provided that highways maintainable at public expense included highways which were already maintainable at public expense before the 1980 Act came into force.   </p>

In terms of a statutory presumption of dedication under s 31 of the HA 1980, Mr White submitted that while the Path was not used for 20 years prior to 16 December 1949, the date on which the Path should be deemed to have been dedicated is the start date of the period of proven continuous use. In terms of a common law presumption of dedication, Mr White relied on <span style="font-style:italic">Turner v. Walsh</span> (1881) 6 HL 636 as authority for the proposition that when a period of time passes which enables a presumption of dedication, a court should infer that dedication occured at the beginning of that period. Accordingly, he invited us to infer that the Path was dedicated as (and therefore intended to be) a highway when the park was opened in the 1930s. He submitted that <span style="font-style:italic">Turner v Walsh</span> requires us to look at “the whole of the evidence” to determine “whether there has been such a continuous and connected user as to raise the presumption of dedication”, and argued that a presumption of dedication should be inferred from the public’s use of the Path for something like 17 years prior to 1949. </p>

The footpath had been constructed by Pembrokeshire County Council, who were both the local housing authority and the highway authority at the time of the path’s construction and at the time of the accident. The footpath was a highway, because it had become deemed to be dedicated as such by the time of the accident.

However, it seems to me that, as with any words in a statute or in a contract, one has to take the words in their context and by reference not to what each word means, but by reference to what the phrase naturally conveys to the reader. As has been pointed out in many cases, it is sometimes difficult to identify precisely why a word or set of words conveys a particular meaning either in general or in its or their particular context. To my mind, the notion of “a highway constructed by a highway authority” means “a highway constructed as a highway by a highway authority in its capacity as such”. I suspect that the two aspects are almost always going to lead to the same result. It must be rare that a council or other body which is a highway authority constructs a road which is a highway other than in its capacity as a highway authority. Equally, it must be rare for a council which is a highway authority to construct a highway other than in its capacity as a highway authority.

One can conceive of circumstances, such as the present, where a housing authority constructs a housing estate with private roads and subsequently sells off the estate to the residents or to a third party, and subsequently the residents or the third party allow the public to use the private roads so that they become impliedly dedicated as highways under section 31. To my mind, it would be surprising if, in those circumstances, some 20 years later after selling the estate, the local authority found itself being liable to maintain those roadways at public expense because much earlier it, in its capacity as the housing authority, had constructed the roads as private roadways on the estate. If the words of section 36(2)(a) were clear and conveyed the contrary view to that which I think they convey, then I cannot pretend that this somewhat odd consequence should deter the court from giving the words their natural meaning.

Again, it would be wrong to make too much of that point, but the terminology of section 24(2) in Part III of the 1980 Act is similar to, and therefore of some relevance when considering, section 36(2)(a) in Part IV of the 1980 Act. </p>

Similarly, it is noteworthy that under section 1(1) of the 1980 Act it is the minister which is the highway authority for certain main roads, including trunk roads. Technically, the minister does not exist, he is an emanation of the Crown. Yet it is clear from that very first subsection of the Act, and other provisions of the Act, that the draftsman of the Act identifies for the purposes of the Act the minister as a separate entity. By the same token, it seems to me, that at any rate in section 36(2)(a) the highway authority is being referred to in its capacity as such and not in its capacity as the council or other entity which happens to be the highway authority. </p>

By s.2(1) and (3) of the Local Government Act 1972 a county council, like every other local authority, is a single body corporate. A local authority may well have to take care from time to time (for example when considering whether to grant itself planning permission) to keep its various capacities distinct, but it is one body in law. Agreements between its departments may be necessary for budgetary purposes, but they are not contracts because a legal person cannot contract with itself. For this reason I would not in any event have found it easy to adopt the view of Neuberger J that s.36(2)(a) contemplated a highway authority acting as such.” </p>

With respect to Sedley LJ and his colleagues who agreed with him, I cannot accept them. It may well be true that for the purposes of the law of contract a local authority is a single body corporate. But it does not follow that it is indivisible for all purposes. To take only one example, a council which is both housing authority and planning authority is not exempt from the need to obtain planning permission if it wishes to construct new housing.

The first was those which were in 1959 maintainable by the inhabitants at large; that meant those responsible by virtue of s 47 of the 1949 Act; and that in turn depended on whether the highway was dedicated or deemed to have been dedicated before 16 December 1949. The second category is those which in 1959 were “maintainable by the highway authority”. The fact that the highway authority (in this case Abram) had <span style="font-style:italic">constructed</span> a path before 1949, whatever the capacity in which they did so, would not help Ms Barlow because under the 1949 Act regime that did not make the highway maintainable unless it had been dedicated or was deemed to have been dedicated as a highway before 16 December 1949 (or there was a later public path agreement). Section 38(3) of the 1959 Act applies to this second category. Section 36 of the 1980 Act, in particular s 36(2)(a), was not intended to, and did not, alter that position. </p>

However, in further submissions made on receipt of draft judgments the Council argued that we had misunderstood these submissions; that the social housing opened in early 1947 was on the west side of the park; and that there is no evidence of the north east entrance to the park having been opened before 1949. They rely on the witness statement of the Claimant in the county court that the housing which now exists outside the north east entrance had been developed since she was a child (she was born in 1963), and a witness statement of her brother-in-law David Jones, born in 1947, that when he was a child the relevant area was farmland.  The Council points to  the absence of evidence that in the 1930s and early to mid-1940s, when the only two entrances to the park were on its west side, the Path was used as a through route.  </p>

The appellant in that case owned land in New South Wales, acquired from the Crown in 1879, over which there was a track. The respondent was sued for trespass when he went upon the track and removed fences running across it installed by the appellant. The respondent argued that he had a right to do so because the track had in fact become a highway by long usage and so there was a right to pass and repass without obstacle. The appellant said that there was no such long usage and in addition, said that by reason of the New South Wales Crown Lands Alienation Act 1861, the Crown had lost the legal power to dedicate highways save under certain conditions which did not apply here: thus there could be no presumed dedication. The court below directed the jury that it could find that there was presumed dedication by reason of the period of user beginning prior to the commencement of that Act as well as subsequent to it. The Privy Council agreed. At page 642, Sir Montague Smith stated as follows:  </p>

For example, planning legislation refers to a “planning authority”; housing legislation refers to a “housing authority”; education legislation refers to an “education authority” and so on.  Often the body that exercises the relevant functions will be the same entity: for example, a district council will often have planning functions and housing functions; a county council will often have highways functions and education functions.  But Parliament is not referring to that entity as such.  It is referring to that entity only in so far as it exercises the functions referred to in that particular statutory provision.  This is why I disagree with the analysis of Sedley LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Gulliksen</span>.  His analysis turned simply on the fact that a local authority is a single body corporate.  So it is but that does not lead to the conclusion that it does not matter in what capacity it was acting in a particular context, that is what statutory functions it was exercising. </p>

What matters for present purposes is that, when the Path was first constructed, Abram was not acting as a highway authority.    </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I also agree that the appeal should be dismissed, on the ground predicated upon ss. 47 and 49 of the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 and consequent impact of s. 38(1) and (2)(a) of the 1959, and s. 36(1) of the 1980 Highways Acts, for the reasons given by my Lord, Bean LJ.  I join with my Lords, Bean and Singh LJJ in their respectful dissent from the obiter dicta remarks of Sedley LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Gulliksen</span>, and prefer the construction placed upon s. 36(2)(a) of the 1980 Act by Neuberger J (as he then was), for the reasons they both give, feeling it unnecessary to add to the discussion above. In summary, although I am persuaded by the Appellant’s arguments  that the Path was not constructed as a highway by a highway authority and does not thereby establish Ms Barlow’s claim by reference to s. 36(2)(a) of the 1980 Act, the undisputed evidence does establish that a thoroughfare had been created before 1949, and continued and unfettered public use thereafter and to date created a common law dedication of the Path which, upon retrospective dating prior to 16 December 1949 in accordance with dicta in <span style="font-style:italic">Turner v Walsh,</span> means the Path was maintainable by the inhabitants at large, and subsequently at public expense, consequent upon the 1949 and 1959 and 1980 Acts  respectively. </p>
