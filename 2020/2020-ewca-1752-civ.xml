	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">This appeal raises a short but important point of construction not previously considered at the level of this court, in relation to the rules relating to awards of costs in Employment Tribunal proceedings. The essential question is whether an Employment Tribunal has jurisdiction under the relevant rules to place a cap on the potential award of costs that might be made when it makes an order for  costs which are likely to exceed Â£20,000 and should therefore be sent for detailed assessment. Both the Employment Tribunal and the Employment Appeal Tribunal said yes but Mr Duggan QC for the appellant contends they erred in law and there is no jurisdiction under the rules to do this. He invites this court (as he unsuccessfully invited the Employment Appeal Tribunal to do) to remove the cap but to leave the order otherwise undisturbed. Dr  Al-Tarkait has played no part in the appeal. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The question arises in this way. Following lengthy proceedings, Dr Al-Tarkait's claims for disability discrimination and wrongful dismissal failed, but his unfair dismissal claim succeeded. Following a Remedy Hearing, by a judgment with reasons promulgated on 9 November 2018, the Employment Tribunal (Employment Judge Tayler, Mrs Cameron and Mr McLaughlin, âthe Tayler Tribunalâ) made reductions to both the compensatory and basic awards to reflect <span style="font-style:italic">Polkey</span> and contributory fault respectively, and then awarded compensation totalling Â£79,724.20 to Dr Al-Tarkait, with payment stayed because of the costs decisions made at the same time. </p>

In relation to those matters Dr Al-Tarkait was found to have acted unreasonably and his conduct was found to have put the appellant to significant expense, justifying an order for costs. The Tayler Tribunal accepted that costs were incurred in seeking the exclusion of historic material and that it was reasonable to expend some costs on considering rebuttal evidence but expressed itself to be â<span style="font-style:italic">askance at the costs incurred in dealing with this matter</span>â (paragraph 31). It noted that, excluding sums claimed solely in respect of the postponement of the full merits hearing, the amount claimed by the appellant was Â£228,500 and said, â<span style="font-style:italic">We do not accept that it was reasonable for the respondent to incur anything like that level of costs in dealing with those historical allegations</span>.â </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Accordingly, there were two freestanding grounds identified by the Tayler Tribunal for limiting the costs capable of being awarded in favour of the appellant under rule 78(1)(b). The first flowed from the conclusion that the respondent had not acted reasonably in incurring costs in excess of Â£84,000 in dealing with the historic allegations. The second reason related to the claimantâs ability to pay. Pursuant to rule 84, the tribunal took this into account in setting a cap on the costs that could be awarded. Although the appellant is dissatisfied with the conclusion reached by the Tayler Tribunal that the total of costs incurred in defending the historic allegations was not reasonably incurred, Mr Duggan accepts that he cannot challenge that conclusion on this appeal having failed to obtain permission to do so. The appeal is limited to the question whether the tribunal had jurisdiction to set the cap it did under rule 78(1)(b). </p>

The Employment Appeal Tribunal (Kerr J) rejected Mr Dugganâs submissions that the Tayler Tribunal had wrongly assumed the jurisdiction that would be exercised on a detailed assessment, whether by an employment judge or by a county court costs judge, and usurped the costs assessment jurisdiction by placing a ceiling on costs awarded when there was no power to do so in the rules and in particular under rule 78(1)(b). Kerr J held that an employment tribunal may have regard to ability to pay under rule 84 when making a non-fixed sum award under rule 78(1)(b), as well as when making a fixed sum award of Â£20,000 or less under rule 78(1)(a).  In his view, there was nothing in the wording of rule 78(1)(b) to compel the contrary conclusion, which would be very undesirable since ability to pay may be important in either case, and perhaps even more important if Mr Duggan was correct (a point the Employment Appeal Tribunal did not need to decide) that a costs judge in the county court is not allowed to step into the shoes of an employment judge and apply rule 84 when conducting a detailed assessment.

If the tribunal took that view it was in our judgment wrong. Even if a tribunal orders detailed assessment it is entitled, in the exercise of its discretion, to make an order for costs which takes account of ability to pay.

There is no power under rule 78(1)(b) to assess costs in a specific amount. But a power to cap costs is not precluded because that is not what a cap on costs does. A cap sets a ceiling on the amount to be awarded by reference to what a tribunal considers reasonable for the losing party to pay, but does not determine a specific amount to be paid. That is for the assessor to do in a different and separate exercise that requires detailed scrutiny of the actual costs incurred by reference to a range of factors set out in the Civil Procedure Rules, which are well known but do not include ability to pay. Moreover, this approach has the advantage that, having dealt with the substantive issues in the case, the costs order under rule 78(1)(b) is made by the tribunal itself, which, having lived with the case is likely to be in the best position to assess what is reasonable in the circumstances. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Nor do I accept Mr Dugganâs contention that the costs assessorâs jurisdiction is ousted or usurped where a ceiling or cap on the specified part of the costs is imposed. A cap establishes the outer limit within which costs are to be assessed, but ultimately the amount to be awarded is determined by the assessor subject to that limit. While the limit acts as a constraint set by the tribunal, it does not determine the actual amount payable. The assessor has the function of and remains empowered to determine âthe amount to be paidâ. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Moreover, this construction of the rule 78(1)(b) gives proper effect to the discretion available pursuant to rule 84. This is particularly important in the âno costs jurisdictionâ represented by the employment tribunal system, where impecunious claimants come before tribunals seeking to vindicate their rights, but having in most cases, lost their employment and therefore their main source of income. As Mr Duggan acknowledged in his acceptance that his construction brought with it odd results, there is no good reason why an employment tribunal should be able to take account of a paying partyâs ability to pay in a case where costs do not exceed Â£20,000 </p>

The position is even more stark on Mr Dugganâs construction, in cases where detailed assessment is conducted by a county court costs judge (rather than an employment judge) who cannot have regard to ability to pay at all. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In light of these conclusions, I see no error in the approach of the Employment Appeal Tribunal in either <span style="font-style:italic">Jilley</span> or <span style="font-style:italic">Swisspor</span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">t</span>. These decisions provide further persuasive support for the conclusion I have reached that rules 78(1)(b) and 84 are wide enough to permit a tribunal to order a detailed assessment of costs exceeding Â£20,000 while at the same time restricting the maximum sum of any such award by placing a cap on the final award by reference to the paying partyâs ability to pay.  Further, as Kerr J observed, in <span style="font-style:italic">Swissport</span> a cap on costs imposed at the pre-assessment stage was not considered objectionable by anyone involved because the cap was necessary to avoid any risk of breach of the indemnity principle. If a cap can be imposed for that purpose, there is no sensible reason why it should not be imposed for other purposes including those relied on by the Tayler Tribunal in this case, namely to reflect the Tayler Tribunalâs assessment of the maximum reasonable level of costs incurred and the paying party's ability to pay them. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">For completeness, and again in agreement with Kerr J, I would add that even if the court had accepted that the costs order was unlawfully made, I would not have acceded to Mr Dugganâs suggestion that this court simply remove the cap leaving the order otherwise intact. The correct approach would have been to set aside the costs order in favour of the appellant and remit that part of the costs application to the same employment tribunal for reconsideration. </p>
