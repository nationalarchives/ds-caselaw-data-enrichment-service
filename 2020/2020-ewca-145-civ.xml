	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">This appeal concerns the liability of the respondent, International Military Services Limited (“IMS”), for interest on sums which an arbitral panel has found to be due to the appellant, Ministry of Defence &amp; Support for Armed Forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran (“MODSAF”). MODSAF has since 2008 been subject to the European Union (“EU”) sanctions regime now embodied in Council Regulation (EU) </p>

In a judgment dated 24 July 2019, Phillips J concluded that MODSAF is precluded from enforcing the interest component of the relevant arbitration award as regards the period since it became subject to the sanctions regime. MODSAF appeals against that decision. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It is worth stressing the limited ambit of what we are deciding. In the first place, there is no issue before us as to whether IMS can make any payment to MODSAF. MODSAF is frustrated that, four decades on from the events giving rise to arbitration awards in its favour and 18 years after those awards were made, it has still received nothing. However, it is common ground between the parties that, as things stand, the 2012 Regulation means that IMS cannot lawfully pay MODSAF anything. The question we have to determine relates to liability, not payment.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">A second point is that the appeal does not concern either the principal sum awarded to MODSAF or interest up to 2008. The appeal is limited to liability for interest in respect of the period since 2008 and so relates to a relatively small proportion of the sums which MODSAF claims pursuant to the arbitration awards. We were told that the amount at stake on the appeal is in excess of £20 million. That is a significant sum, but it represents only a fraction of the £127,651,823 plus interest from 1984 to which MODSAF has been found to be entitled. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In essence, the issue raised by the appeal is whether the 2012 Regulation operates to deprive MODSAF of any right to interest as regards the period during which it has been subject to the EU’s sanctions regime. </p>

Disputes subsequently arose as to the balance of accounts between the parties in consequence of which MODSAF (in 1990) and IMS (in 1996) both initiated arbitrations. On 2 May 2001, the arbitral tribunal rendered a final award in each arbitration. As regards the MODSAF claim, the tribunal determined that IMS was liable to pay MODSAF £140,599,570 in respect of the termination of the contracts, that interest on that sum should be paid “from 28 July 1984 to the date of payment at the LIBOR rate + 0.5%”, that IMS should pay MODSAF US $6,255,404 in respect of the latter’s costs of the arbitration and that IMS was responsible to the ICC for US $1,143,750 for arbitration costs and expenses (“the 7071 Award”).

Morison J acceded to the applications on 31 July 2001, but IMS applied to set his orders aside. On 5 December 2002, the proceedings were stayed by consent pending the resolution of challenges to the Awards that IMS had brought in the Dutch Courts. The consent order provided, however, for IMS to pay into Court £382,500,000 by way of security in respect of any sums that might ultimately be determined to be due to MODSAF. The requisite payment into Court was made on 18 December 2002 and, with interest, the sum in Court had risen to more than £500 million by the time of the hearing before Phillips J. </p>

As I have already indicated, it is common ground that, in consequence, IMS has been (and remains) unable to make any payment to MODSAF under the Awards. MODSAF, however, maintains that there is no bar to the Court entering judgment in its favour and declaring the funds in Court to be held for its benefit. On that basis, it issued an application seeking such relief in 2012. On 1 May 2019, Moulder J gave directions for certain issues to be determined in advance of the full hearing of MODSAF’s application. One of these was what has been called “the interest during the sanctions period issue”, namely: </p>

He held that article 38 of the 2012 Regulation precluded MODSAF from enforcing the interest component of the 7071 Award as regards the sanctions period and, hence, that the amount due pursuant to the Awards should be recalculated on that basis. MODSAF, however, challenges that conclusion in this Court. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">So far as article 38’s language is concerned, the judge considered that MODSAF’s application for judgment to be entered in terms of the Awards is plainly one “for the recognition or enforcement … of … an arbitration award” within article 1(c)(v) of the 2012 Regulation (see paragraph 44 of the judgment) and is “in connection with any contract or transaction” on the basis that “[t]he relevant ‘transaction’ is the arbitration award that MODSAF seeks to enforce” (paragraph 49). In that regard, the judge observed that the 2012 Regulation “defines the term ‘transaction’ fairly broadly” and that the definition of “claim” in article 1(c) “appears to presuppose that, for the purposes of [the 2012 Regulation], judgments, arbitration awards and equivalent decisions do fall within the expression ‘contract or transaction’” (paragraph 49). The judge further agreed with a submission that “even though the existence of the claim may not have been based on the sanctions, its content (insofar as it concerns interest) did result from the sanctions” (paragraph 51).

	</paragraph>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.00in">“I consider that the purpose of Article 38 is to prevent civil claims being brought against a party as a result of the fact that their performance of a contract or transaction was impeded by the operation of the sanctions. I am satisfied that the application of Article 38 to prevent MODSAF from enforcing the interest component of the 7071 Award in respect of the sanctions period falls well within that purpose. As noted previously, the relevant transaction for these purposes is the 7071 Award. During the sanctions period, the existence of the sanctions prevented IMS from discharging its liability to pay the sums due under the Award. That is the reason why, during the sanctions period, IMS came under a liability to pay interest on the principal sum due under the Award. By seeking leave to enforce the interest component of the 7071 Award in respect of the sanctions period, MODSAF is now bringing a claim to hold IMS liable as a result of the fact that IMS’s performance of the relevant transaction, i.e. discharge of the debt due under the Award, was affected by the existence of the sanctions. In my view, that runs counter to the object of Article 38.” In a similar vein, the judge said in paragraph 64: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.00in">“regardless of the objective that [the 2012 Regulation] as a whole seeks to achieve, I consider that Article 38 serves a specific purpose. As explained above, that is to protect parties against claims being brought against them by virtue of their non-performance of a contract or transaction that was caused by the sanctions. Put differently, the objective of Article 38 is to ameliorate the impact of the sanctions regime on private relationships.” </p>

The judge’s construction of the Regulation, Lord Anderson submitted, runs contrary to both the language and the purpose of the legislation. Further, the judge’s interpretation of article 38 would render the provision disproportionate to the objectives of the Regulation and also mean that it represents a disproportionate interference with MODSAF’s right to property.

Article 23 does not purport to confiscate funds or economic resources of a person designated under the sanctions regime but merely to prevent access to them for the time being, and article 29 specifically authorises a designated person to be credited with interest if it is paid into a frozen account. As it happens, MODSAF does not hold a relevant account, but article 29 shows that there is no objection in principle to a designated person receiving interest and article 38 should be interpreted consistently with such a payment being permissible. </p>

Such a provision thus ensures the effectiveness of the restrictive measures at issue, by reflecting in private law the effects of measures that have been properly adopted by the European Union, for so long as those measures are applicable.

Paragraph 29 [of the Security Council resolution] thus provides for protection of economic operators against unjustified claims by Iraqi individuals, companies or organisations. In doing so, it prevents Iraq from obtaining compensation retroactively for the negative effects of the embargo. Regarding exposure to claims from Iraq, the banking sector as well as European international contractors, have pointed to the fact that a lifting of the embargo could give rise to an avalanche of requests for payment of performance bonds, guarantees, stand-by credits or similar instruments under existing contracts and transactions for reasons of nonperformance. The estimated amount of money involved exceeds 500m ECU. Already now exposure of such a dimension seriously reduces the financial room for manoeuvre of contractors. If the corresponding claims would effectively have to be honoured, the consequences on companies would be dramatic.

As can be seen from paragraph 14 above, the recital recorded that “economic operators are exposed to the risk of claims and it is therefore necessary to protect such operators permanently against claims in connection with any contract or other transaction the performance of which was affected by reason of the measures imposed by that Regulation”. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">A further point is that Lord Anderson did not advance a purpose for article 38 of the 2012 Regulation which could explain why the availability of protection for counterparties should depend on whether an arbitration award had already been made when the sanctions regime took effect. I did not understand Lord Anderson to argue that article 38 could not have afforded IMS protection if the Awards had not been rendered by 24 June 2008, when MODSAF became a designated entity. It would seem that, on that hypothesis, MODSAF’s as yet undetermined claims in respect of the contracts for the supply of military equipment would clearly have been “claims in connection with any contract” and IMS could have invoked article 38 in answer to a claim by MODSAF to be compensated for being kept out of the money due to it during the period of the sanctions regime. On Lord Anderson’s case, the existence of the Awards makes all the difference. It is that, it would appear, that prevents article 38 from applying. Lord Anderson did not seem to me, however, to provide any real explanation for why the purpose of article 38 should produce such a distinction. </p>

Secondly, the inclusion of the words “of any form” after “transaction” in article 1(d) further indicates an intention to be all-encompassing. Thirdly, the phrase “whether comprising one or more contracts or similar obligations made between the same or different parties” is also broadening, breaking the bounds of needing a contract, a point reinforced by the final words of the article 1(d), “as well as any related provision arising under, or in connection with, the transaction”. Fourthly, no straining is necessary to characterise an arbitration award as a “transaction” because such an award is typically, albeit not exclusively, a product of contract. Fifthly, the concept of “contract or transaction” has only one function within the 2012 Regulation, namely, to identify obligations whose performance might be affected by sanctions and give rise to claims. </p>

After all, one of the reasons Phillips J gave for holding the 7071 Award to be a “transaction” was that the definition of “claim” “appears to presuppose that, for the purposes of [the 2012 Regulation], <span style="font-style:italic">judgments</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">arbitration awards</span> and equivalent decisions do fall within the expression ‘contract or transaction’” (emphasis added). Yet it would be very odd if a judgment were itself a “transaction”. Suppose, say, that a designated person were pursuing a claim for personal injuries he had sustained in a road traffic accident.

Nor, as Mr Smouha accepted, could the fact that the designated person had obtained judgment change the position: article 38 would still be inapplicable. It seems to me that article 1(c)(v) refers to claims for the recognition or enforcement of judgments and arbitration awards, not because a judgment or arbitration award can itself be a “transaction”, but because such a claim may be an aspect of the pursuit of a claim “under or in connection with” a <span style="font-style:italic">separate </span>contract or transaction. Article 1(c)(v) will be applicable in particular where a designated person has obtained a judgment or arbitration award on a contractual claim.

The application is plainly “for the … enforcement … of … an arbitration award” within article 1(c)(v) and, since the Awards concerned the original contracts, the application for relief in respect of the Awards is fairly to be described as “in connection with” those contracts. </p>

Lord Anderson’s contentions would seem to imply either that the designated person’s claim is entirely lost or that the counterparty is wholly unprotected. Neither outcome would make sense. The true position has to be, I think, that article 38 can apply to <span style="font-style:italic">part</span> of a claim. More specifically, where, as in the present case, sanctions have served to increase the interest component of a claim, it must be the case that article 38 bars satisfaction of the claim to that extent and only to that extent. </p>

Lord Anderson suggested that “affected” falls to be construed more restrictively in the light of the references elsewhere to performance having been “prevented”. However, the Regulation which first introduced a “no claims” provision into the Iranian sanctions regime (viz. the 2008 Regulation) used the word “affected” in its recitals (see recital (4)) as well as in the new article 12a of the 2007 Regulation for which it provided.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Lord Anderson submitted that construing the 2012 Regulation in such a way as to deprive MODSAF of interest in respect of the period since it became a designated entity would both be disproportionate to the Regulation’s aims and involve a disproportionate interference with the fundamental right to property recognised in article 17 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and article 1 of the First Protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights. The sole purpose of the asset-freezing measures in the Regulation, Lord Anderson said, was to freeze, not to confiscate or punish. Moreover, it would be arbitrary for a designated person’s entitlement to interest to turn on whether he happened to have an account with a financial institution within the EU and so could avail himself of article 29 of the Regulation. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">As, however, I have already said, article 38 of the 2012 Regulation evidently <span style="font-style:italic">was </span>intended to have confiscatory consequences. Nor is that surprising. The imposition of sanctions had implications for both designated persons and their counterparties. Article 38 was designed to ensure that, as regards contracts and similar obligations, the burden was borne by the designated persons rather than the counterparties. As was recognised in the explanatory memorandum quoted in paragraph 35 above, absent a “no claims” provision such as article 38, sanctions can have “dramatic” consequences for counterparties. To echo the words of Lord Bingham set out in paragraph 36 above, the “ultimate losers” would be the counterparties and not the designated persons whose behaviour the regime was seeking to influence. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It is true, as Lord Anderson stressed, that a designated person with an appropriate EU account can be credited with interest pursuant to article 29 of the 2012 Regulation. This has a rational basis in the fact that the money can be frozen once in the account. Further, where such an account exists, a counterparty can avoid liability for future interest by paying what he owes into the account. He therefore needs no protection. If, on the other hand, the designated person holds no qualifying account, the counterparty will be unable to pay and, in the absence of a provision such as article 38, could not escape accruing interest liabilities. It is therefore comprehensible that a counterparty should enjoy protection where the designated person has no relevant account but not where he does. </p>

To the contrary, such a construction seems to me entirely consistent with the overall scheme of the Regulation. </p>

The issue was whether the action based on the award was for the enforcement of a contract made within the jurisdiction. The Court of Appeal held that it was.

The provisions of section 26 of the 1950 Act and section 66 of the 1996 Act must be seen in that context. They are simply procedural provisions enabling the award made in consensual arbitral proceedings to be enforced.

If the argument produces an odd result which the EU legislature cannot sensibly have intended, that would be a powerful reason to reject it. In my judgment that is the position.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">For the purpose of IMS’s argument on this aspect of the case, the critical feature which bars recovery of interest during the sanctions period is that the parties’ original contract contained an arbitration clause and therefore a contractual obligation to perform an award. There is no equivalent contractual obligation in the case of a judgment. But if the parties’ original contract in this case had not contained an arbitration clause, it would have been open to MODSAF to sue IMS in this country and obtain a judgment, on which statutory interest would have run until payment. It can hardly be supposed that in imposing sanctions under EU law, the EU legislature intended to draw a sharp distinction between the effect of an award and a judgment. There is no good reason why it should have intended that interest during the sanctions period would be payable in the case of a judgment but not in the case of an award. The fact that enforcement of a judgment and an award are referred to together and without distinction in the definition of “claim” in Article 1(c)(v) suggests strongly that it did not.  </p>
