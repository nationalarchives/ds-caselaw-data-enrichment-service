The claim arises out of a proposal by the Department’s predecessor (the Department of Energy and Climate Change), published on 31 October 2011, to bring forward the qualifying date for the Feed-In Tariff Scheme from 31 March 2012 to 12 December 2011, and to reduce the subsidies payable thereunder.  </p>

Subsequently, in <span style="font-style:italic">Breyer Group Plc and Others v Department of Energy and Climate Change </span>[2014] EWHC 2257 (QB), affirmed by the Court of Appeal at [2015] EWCA Civ 408, in an action brought against the Department by manufacturers and suppliers of solar panels, it was held that, in principle, the unlawful proposal could amount to a wrongful interference with or deprivation of the claimants’ possessions, namely existing contracts, contrary to A1P1. </p>

The primary ground for this submission was that, unlike the assumed facts in <span style="font-style:italic">Breyer</span>, the sub-contract was not capable of assignment and therefore, by reference to the authorities, could not in law amount to a possession.  </p>

The claim was therefore struck out. On 20 February 2020, Solaria was granted permission to appeal against the decision to strike out. It follows that Solaria need to succeed in their attack on both limbs of the judgment in order for this appeal to be allowed and the proceedings reinstated.</p>

The sub-contract also envisaged that additional panels might be ordered by GBBS and stipulated that the sub-contract rates would apply to any such additional materials. It is Solaria’s case that, in October 2011, it was agreed in principle that they would provide panels for another 300 residential dwellings, but it is accepted that no sub-contract instruction to that effect was ever issued by GBBS. </p>

The tariff is the fixed price paid by electricity supply companies for the power fed into the grid from small-scale solar panel installations. The consultation document proposed a reduction in fixed rates from 12 December 2011, which was prior to the end of the proposed consultation period.

The claim should therefore have been brought by the end of October 2012, within the period of one year set out in section 7(5)(a) of the HRA. Instead, even giving Solaria the benefit of the standstill agreement, approximately five years and eleven months elapsed between the unlawful proposal of 31 October 2011 and the commencement of these proceedings. That is the aggregate of the period of five years and two months between 31 October 2011 and 21 December 2016 (which was the retrospective date of the standstill agreement), and the further period of nine months between 1 March 2018 (when the agreed standstill period came to an end) and the commencement of these proceedings on 21 December 2018.

In the light of the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Murungaru</span>, which was followed by Coulson J in <span style="font-style:italic">Breyer</span>, I regard the key question to be whether or not the contractual rights which Solaria enjoyed under the contract had a monetary value which could be marketed for consideration. Although Solaria had negotiated with GBBS a contract which had an economic value to it at the date of the Proposal (and in that respect this business contract was clearly in a different category from Dr Murungaru’s ongoing medical treatment) the weight of authority indicates that, as with goodwill, whether or not that value is marketable is the central consideration. I have already noted that Lewison J said that transmissibility was not necessarily the touchstone but he said it is “a highly relevant factor” and went on to note the significance which the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Malik</span> had attached to rights which were not transferable and therefore lacked economic value. The bundle of rights could not be viewed as an “asset”.

The Department contends that the absence of a right in Solaria to assign the contract without GBBS’s consent means that its economic value was not a marketable one.

The facts show that instead of promptly bringing its A1P1 claim against the DECC, before October 2012, Solaria continued to deliver PV panels to GBBS until July 2012. It did so in return for being paid at the rate of £1.10 per watt, rather than £1.35 per watt, but on its own case upon the post-Proposal agreement reached with GBBS it did so in circumstances where (the Proposal having subsequently foundered) it should have been entitled to payment at the full rate. Indeed, in July 2013 Solaria issued an invoice to GBBS for the greater part of what it now seeks to recover from the Department under the categories (1) and (2) heads of loss; and on 26 August 2014 it issued proceedings against GBBS for recovery of the difference.

Within weeks of the Proposal being published Solaria knew of the legal challenge to its proposed implementation. If Solaria had acted promptly by looking to the DECC for the loss that had in fact resulted from it receiving from GBBS the lower rate of £1.10 per watt for PV panels (even if that should not have been the legal consequence of its agreement with GBBS) its claim could have been managed alongside the ones in Breyer.  </p>

As things now stand, however, the Department would be faced with the prospect of the evidential and financial implications of a claim commenced only at the conclusion of the Breyer litigation. I accept Mr Weisselberg’s submission, which is supported by the evidence from Mr Olsen of the GLD, that the evidential difficulties would not only reflect the inevitable consequences of further fading memories on the part of those behind the publication of the Proposal but also the difficulties likely to be encountered in disentangling the effect of the Proposal from a falling market in PV installations caused by the revised one which took effect, without challenge, whilst Solaria continued to supply GBBS. As to that, I have already referred to the apparent strength of the Department’s likely defence based upon GBBS’s novus actus. Yet the Department would be expected to attempt to adduce evidence from the officers or representatives of GBBS, to explore the reasons why Solaria were not paid the full £1.35 per watt, when that company went into administration over 4 years ago. Mr Olsen also makes the incontrovertible point (which chimes with what Rix LJ said in M) that bringing this very late claim is at odds with the public policy objective of encouraging the efficient use of public resources which I believe I am entitled to assume was in the Department’s mind when reaching its settlement with the Breyer claimants.” </p>

It was held that it was not: the inclusion of Dr. Malik’s name on the list was in effect a licence to render services to the public and, being non-transferable and non-marketable, was not a possession for the purposes of A1P1. In his judgment at [40], Auld LJ said: </p>

The claimant’s immigration status was altered without notice, which prevented him from coming to the UK for continuing medical treatment. He said that the interference with the contract between himself and his medical provider amounted to a breach of A1P1. The Court of Appeal said that “the fact that possessions can include contracts does not mean that all contracts are possessions” [30].

First, the benefit of the contract is incapable of assignment. Dr Murungaru could not confer the right to medical treatment on anyone else. Second, as a contract for personal services it cannot be vicariously performed. No other doctor could perform the treatment. Third, if, for example, Dr Murungaru were to become bankrupt under English law, the contract would not vest in his trustee. If he died, his personal representatives would not be able to take advantage of the contract. Fourth, it is incapable of being enforced by injunction or specific performance. Fifth, there is no suggestion that Dr Murungaru has paid for any medical treatment in advance. If, having received medical treatment, Dr Murungaru refused to pay for it, the doctors would be entitled to recover the agreed payment by action. The debt would be a chose in action which the doctors would be entitled to assign to someone else. Likewise, if the doctors refused to treat Dr Murungaru, he would be entitled, at least in theory, to recover damages for breach of contract, and his right to damages would itself be a chose in action capable of being assigned to someone else. But although breach of the contract may give rise to claims capable of being choses in action, I doubt whether the underlying contract itself is a chose in action. To take an analogy: a claim for damages for personal injury (say, a broken leg) is undoubtedly a chose in action. But one would hardly say that the fracture itself is property… </p>

That is the touchstone of whether something counts as a possession for the purposes of A1 P1. In my judgment Dr Murungaru's contractual rights do not.” </p>

The argument at first instance, as is apparent from Lord Dyson’s analysis at [22] – [27] of the judgment in the Court of Appeal, focussed on the certainty that could be ascribed to the alleged contracts. Thus, at one end of the scale, there were draft contracts (known as “leases”) which had been sent to customers but to which they had not even responded by 31 October 2011. Such leases, which had not been converted into concluded contracts, and were simply offers, were found to fall outside the A1P1 definition of possession, because they were no more than possible future contracts which, at most, might give rise to a claim for loss of future income and would not therefore amount to a possession under A1P1. On the other hand, leases which had been signed and/or partially performed were found to be possessions within the meaning of A1P1. </p>

If Lord Bingham was prepared to admit that he “did not find the jurisprudence on this subject very clear” (see [21] of his speech in <span style="font-style:italic">Countryside Alliance</span>) then it can safely be assumed to be difficult.

One, but only one, of the indicia of a possession which the contract failed to meet was that of assignability. In any event, to the extent that it is material, there could never have been a claim for loss of marketable goodwill in that case, because the claimant was an individual suing in a personal capacity, not a business capacity.  </p>

It was a commercial arrangement which was of value to Solaria. It had a value in monetary terms without the need for it having first been converted into money.

That qualification might affect the value of the contract, but it did not mean that the contract was incapable of assignment in law and could not therefore mean that it was not a possession. In addition, the sub-contract was capable of being sub-let, subject only to the limited qualification that GBBS’ consent to any sub-letting should not be unreasonably withheld.

In my view, it is desirable to follow a similar approach in relation to the HRA and not to list the factors or to indicate which factor may be more important than another. It is for the court to examine in the circumstances of each case all the relevant factors and then decide whether it is equitable to provide for a longer period. It may be necessary in the circumstances of a particular case to look at objective and subjective factors; proportionality will generally be taken into account. It is not in my view appropriate to say that one particular factor has as a matter of general approach a greater weight than others. The court should look at the matter broadly and attach such weight as is appropriate in each given case.  </p>

Section 7 of the HRA prescribes a limitation period of one year from the date of the occurrence giving rise to, and the initiation of, the proceedings except that, if the court considers it equitable to extend the period, it may do so. The word 'equitable' in this statutory context has an obvious resonance with its use in the Limitation Act 1980. Section 33(1) of that Act permits the court to direct that the primary period of limitation shall not apply if it appears to the court that it would be 'equitable' to allow an action to proceed, having regard to the extent to which prejudice would be caused to the claimant or the defendant as the case might be. While it would not be right to incorporate all the circumstances to which the court is enjoined to have regard as set out in subsection (3) of section 33, which are inclusive and not exclusive of "all the circumstances", it would not make any sense to disregard them as having no relevance to the circumstances which the court should consider in exercising its discretion whether or not to extend time under these provisions of the HRA.’ </p>

As a matter of the proper construction of the section, the presumption has to be that the need to prove that it would be 'equitable' not to apply the limitation provisions rests on those who seek that result. In other words, the burden must be on the claimant to prove that there are circumstances which make it 'equitable' why the defendant should not be able to take advantage of the limitation provisions. There are, in my judgment, no circumstances present in this case where it would be appropriate to rule that they should not apply. Quite clearly, a huge administrative burden would fall on the defendant if it was forced to meet the claim on its strict merits.

Thus section 7(5) of the HRA itself recognises by that language that it is dealing with a time limit just like any Limitation Act time limit and recognises also that a Limitation Act time limit may be stricter than a time limit imposed by section 7(5) itself. That, it seems to me, is a critical and decisive answer to Mr Simblet's submission. But I would go on to observe, although it is not necessary to my decision, that if Mr Simblet's submission were correct, then the argument for saying that the need for a claimant to be a victim of the unlawful act referred to at the end of section 7(1) would itself be a matter going to jurisdiction. Mr Simblet himself seemed to accept that such a conclusion would be counterintuitive even though, given the language of the Act, there would be a stronger case for saying that the need for the claimant to be a victim went to jurisdiction than to say that a time limit which is so much akin to an ordinary Limitation Act time limit went to jurisdiction. However subsections (3) and (4) of section 7 indicate that the need for the claimant to be a victim related, in effect, to what, in the context at any rate of judicial review, would be considered to be a sufficient interest in England or a title and interest to sue in Scotland. It seems to me that these considerations support the view that section 7(5) is not dealing with a jurisdictional matter. It would be very surprising if every Human Rights Act claim by an alleged victim which was opposed on the ground that the claimant was not a victim was a matter which had to be dealt with under Rule 11 of the CPR.  </p>

The burden is that of the ordinary civil burden of proof where matters of fact are in issue and otherwise it is a burden of persuasion.

The judge placed at the forefront of his account of the relevant legal principles that “there is a significant public interest in public law claims against public bodies being brought expeditiously” (para 119). That is of course true in judicial review, when remedies are sought to quash administrative decisions which may affect large numbers of people or upon which other decisions have depended and action been taken. It is normally a prospective remedy, aiming not only to quash the past but also to put right the future. Expedition is less obviously necessary in a claim for a declaration in vindication of the claimant’s human rights, upon which nothing else depends, or of a claim for damages. These are retrospective remedies, aimed at marking or compensating what has happened in the past.

The alternative provision at 7(5)(b) permits a claim to be brought “before the end of… such longer period as the court or tribunal considers equitable having regard to all the circumstances.”  The ‘longer period’ is therefore a period longer than the one year referred to in section 7(5)(a).

Those are the sorts of questions which civil judges regularly ask themselves in all manner of interlocutory applications, most regularly in applications for relief from sanctions. They are therefore part of an analysis which civil judges are well-used to undertaking.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">Mr Adams argued that “all the circumstances” must include the merits of the underlying claim. Whilst there is perhaps no reason in principle why the merits of the underlying claim should not form part of the court’s consideration where that may be relevant, I note that the underlying merits are not one of the mandatory factors listed in section 33(3) of the Limitation Act. Moreover, there is a very good reason why the merits of the claim can make little or no difference to an investigation into ‘all the circumstances’ for the purposes of section 7(5)(b). On an application to strike out, the court should always assume that a claimant’s pleaded case is correct: a claimant cannot do better than that at trial. So the merits of the claim (perceived or actual) are unlikely to be a decisive factor in any investigation under section 7(5)(b) because they have already been assumed in the claimant’s favour. In the present case, the judge correctly dealt with the application to strike out on limitation grounds on the express assumption that Solaria had a good claim on the merits: see paragraph 19 above.  </p>

It is an important part of the court’s case management powers to ensure that hopeless claims (hopeless because they are plainly and obviously statute-barred) do not use up valuable court time and resources by being allowed to proceed to a trial where they are inevitably doomed to fail. </p>

First, because section 7(5)(b) presupposes that a claim is being brought outside the primary one year period, it requires the party seeking to bring the claim in the ‘longer period’, namely the claimant, to make good its entitlement under section 7(5)(b). That has long been the law: see <span style="font-style:italic">Cameron, </span>endorsed with approval by Thomas LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Dunn </span>and Rix LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">M.</span> As noted in paragraph 47 above, I consider that this is consistent with what Lord Kerr said in <span style="font-style:italic">A v Essex County Council. </span>Of course, very few disputes of this sort fall to be decided by an application of the burden of proof: in my experience, such a case is exceptionally rare. But the fact that cases are not ultimately decided by reference to the burden of proof does not make the burden of proof irrelevant: on the contrary, for the reasons that I have explained, the fact that the onus is on the party who wishes to show that the longer period is equitable will inform the court’s approach to the investigation under section 7(5)(b).  </p>

As his skeleton argument made clear at paragraph 49, Mr Adams was endeavouring to rewrite the section, placing the burden on the defendant to show why it would be inequitable for the claim to continue, and/or why a fair trial is not possible. That is not what section 7(5)(b) says. The section is clear that it is for the claimant, in this case Solaria, to demonstrate that, notwithstanding the delay of four years and eleven months in the commencement of the proceedings, an examination of all the circumstances demonstrates that it is equitable to allow the claim to continue.  </p>

As he summarised it in his oral submissions, it was “for a defendant to show that it would be inequitable to enforce the claim”. Again, I do not accept that as a matter of principle. Prejudice to the defendant because of the delay may well be one of the circumstances which the court will take into account when undertaking the exercise under section 7(5)(b). But it is only one such circumstance. It would be wholly wrong to elevate it into being the most important factor, let alone the only relevant factor, in the open-ended examination required by section 7(5)(b). Such an approach would not, in Lady Hale’s expression, amount to being fair to both sides. </p>

This would mean that, whatever the delay, no matter how long it might have been, if no prejudice could be shown by the defendant, then the claim could not be struck out. I do not accept that submission either. As I have said, the length of the delay is a matter which the court is obliged to take into account under section 7(5)(b). Depending on the circumstances, I am satisfied that the length of any delay can, in the right case, be sufficient, without more, for the court to strike out a claim as having been commenced outside section 7(5)(b).  </p>
