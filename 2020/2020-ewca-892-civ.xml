She considered in detail the appellant’s account of wearing the tag but forgetting to charge it, but she found it to be deliberate.  She noted his explanation for associating with Douherty at this particular time, as described below.  She noted that the breach relating to the mobile phone consisted of hiding it from the police and then throwing it out of a window.  She recorded the appellant’s evidence that his girlfriend was pregnant and that he would not breach the injunction in future. </p>

He directed himself appropriately in relation to the purpose and principle of sentencing.  He distinguished the first count, which was not gang-related and for which a separate sentence had been passed, from the making of a video, which was more serious in the light of the history, and from the association with another gang member far from home.  The possession of cannabis and use of a hood (again a repeat breach) were deliberate.  The main aggravating factor was the history of disobedience and deliberate flouting of court orders, including during the period of a suspended sentence.  In mitigation, account was taken of the evidence of the appellant’s mother, his continuing to wear the tag, his efforts to go to university, and his age.  Consideration was also given to the heavier impact of a custodial sentence during the pandemic.  </p>

By CPR 81.29(1) the execution of a committal order may be suspended for such period or on such terms or conditions as the court may specify.  This does not provide the court with a power to impose an immediate sentence followed by a suspended sentence, either when sentencing or reviewing a sentence on an application to purge.

Whilst arguably the power to create, sometime after the imposition of the original custodial sentence, a sentence partly immediate and partly suspended would be a useful refinement, in my opinion the gain would be outweighed by the introduction of complications which would certainly complicate a contemnor's judgement as to whether or not to apply to purge and which would arguably risk an increase of litigation in this already over-burdened field.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Nor do I accept the submission that the first appellant was entitled to receive concurrent sentences for breaches 1 and 2 in the same manner as the second appellant.  These breaches were committed at separate public places in the course of a road trip occurring on more than one day.   It was a matter for the judge as to whether she sentenced for two breaches (which they were from the point of view of the public) or treated them as one continuous breach (which they were from the point of view of the appellants).  One judge chose one approach, the other chose another; neither was wrong.  Nor was there any disparity.  The difference in the sentences can be said to reflect the difference in the breaches; in particular, the breach of the first appellant’s undertaking to wear a tag. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">As to mitigation, substantial and adequate discount was given for the admissions.  When sentencing for contempt of court, there is no hard and fast rule as to the extent of the reduction, and the fact that in the case of the first appellant it fell marginally short of a full one-third is not wrong in principle, even assuming he can be said to have admitted the breaches at the first opportunity.  In fact, his admissions were very far from complete, as seen by his untruthfulness in evidence about the phone and the tag.  Had the judge given a lesser reduction for the admissions that were made, she could not have been criticised. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Next, both judges gave consideration to the impact of Covid-19 on any custodial sentence.  The significance of the pandemic, as was made clear in <span style="font-style:italic">Manning</span>, is that the impact of a sentence is likely to be heavier because of conditions in detention, lack of visits and anxiety.  There is no entitlement to a ‘Covid discount’ – it all depends on the circumstances.  In this case, there were no individual features of either appellant’s situation that suggested a reduction was called for.   The emergency had not prevented them from travelling the country during lockdown and the additional burden of the pandemic on them and their families during a relatively short period of detention was not significant.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The personal mitigation offered was considered and rightly found to be of little weight in each case.  There was nothing to prevent the appellants meeting in private.  The sad death of the second appellant’s brother strongly underscores the harm that gang activities can bring and can no longer provide an excuse for breaches of the injunctions.   </p>
