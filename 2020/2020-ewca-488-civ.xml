Their investment was geared so that, for every £1,000 contributed by the taxpayer, a further £3,000 was added by way of a limited recourse bank loan funded by circular movements of money and repayable (if at all) only from future profits (if any) of the LLP’s initially loss-making trade. The arrangements formed part of a marketed tax avoidance scheme, for which each taxpayer presumably paid a substantial fee. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The LLP was called Tower MCashback 3 LLP. It was incorporated on 30 March 2004, and carried on a trade of software licensing. Dr Amrolia joined the LLP in September 2004, contributing £400,000, of which £300,000 (or 75%) was borrowed. Dr Ranjit-Singh had already joined the LLP in June 2004, contributing £232,000, of which £174,000 was borrowed. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">As intended, the LLP purportedly made a substantial loss in the 2004/05 tax year. The shares of that loss allocated to the taxpayers amounted to just less than their total contributions: £399,953 in the case of Dr Amrolia, and £231,973 in the case of Dr Ranjit-Singh. In their personal tax returns for that year, they duly claimed to make use of the losses. Dr Amrolia claimed to carry back the whole of his loss and to set it against his general income from the previous year, pursuant to section 380(1)(b) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 (“ICTA 1988”). Dr Ranjit-Singh claimed to set £99,984 of her loss “sideways” against her income for the current year, pursuant to section 380(1)(a) of ICTA 1988, and to carry back the remaining £131,989 to 2001/02 and 2002/03 pursuant to the further relief for individuals for losses in the early years of a trade contained in section 381 of ICTA 1988. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In September 2006, the respondent Commissioners for HM Revenue &amp; Customs (“HMRC”) gave notice to the LLP that they were opening an enquiry into its partnership return for 2004/05, which had been submitted pursuant to section 12AA of the Taxes Management Act 1970 (“TMA 1970”). The notice of enquiry was given under section 12AC(1) of TMA 1970. By virtue of section 12AC(6), the giving of notice of enquiry to the LLP was deemed to include the giving of notice of enquiry under section 9A(1) to each individual partner who had made a personal return under section 8 of the Act, including therefore Dr Amrolia and Dr Ranjit-Singh. I record at this point that, although an LLP is a corporate entity, it is relevantly treated for income tax purposes in the same way as an ordinary English partnership: see section 863 of the Income Tax (Trading and Other Income) Act 2005, and <span style="text-decoration:underline">Revenue and</span></p>

For present purposes, it is enough to say that the Supreme Court upheld only 25% of the first-year allowances claimed by the predecessor LLPs, because the borrowed money did not in any meaningful sense involve an incurring of expenditure in the acquisition of software rights: see, in particular, the judgment of Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe JSC at [75]. It was soon realised that this reasoning would be equally fatal to 75% of the first-year allowances claimed in the third iteration of the scheme, and on 28 June 2011 HMRC served a closure notice pursuant to section 28B(1) of TMA 1970 disallowing 75% of the losses claimed by the LLP for 2004/05. Although the LLP initially appealed against the closure notice, the appeal was withdrawn in January 2012 and a later application to reinstate it was rejected by the First-tier Tribunal (“the FTT”) on 5 December 2014: <span style="text-decoration:underline">Tower MCashback 3 LLP v HMRC</span> [2014] UKFTT 1081 (TC). </p>

The basic contention, set out in the detailed statement of grounds settled for each taxpayer by Mr Chacko, was that HMRC had no legal power to recover the wrongly repaid or credited tax save through exercise of the powers of assessment conferred on them by sections 29 and 30 of TMA 1970, and HMRC were now out of time to avail themselves of the powers conferred by either section. In other words, it was now too late for HMRC to recover the tax which they had wrongly repaid or credited to the taxpayers in response to the original claims for loss relief which they had made in their 2004/05 tax returns. </p>

There has been an amendment or correction of the self-assessment in the return – the amount of the allowable losses that may be set against income has been amended. As a result, an amount of tax is repayable – because tax had been repaid on the basis that the amount of the loss could be set against income in earlier years and tax liability reduced, and now that the amount of the losses have been amended or corrected, the amount of the tax that should have been repaid is less.

Each notice stated that the scheme relied on for that year was not effective and that the revenue was amending the return to reflect that fact, but failed to state the amount of tax which was due. Subsequently the revenue amended the online version of the taxpayer’s returns, which were visible on the revenue’s website. When the taxpayer’s advisers challenged the closure notices, the revenue responded with a letter setting out a statement of account of the taxpayer’s alleged indebtedness pursuant to section 59B(5) of the Act, as inserted, and threatening bankruptcy if payment were not received within seven days. The taxpayer sought judicial review of the decisions contained in that letter, contending that since the closure notices did not set out the amount of tax which the revenue claimed was due they had failed to amend the taxpayer’s returns, as required by section 28A(2)(b), with the consequence that the taxpayer owed no debt to the revenue pursuant to section 59B(5).” </p>

The formal requirements for the validity of a closure notice must be the same irrespective of the sophistication of the particular taxpayer and the skill of his professional advisers, if indeed he has any.

Section 28B(1) sets out how an enquiry is completed. It describes a “closure notice” as a notice from an officer of HMRC that “informs the taxpayer that he has completed his enquiries and states his conclusions”. It is apparent that a document that does not do these things will not be a closure notice, since it will not meet the definition. Section 28B(2) contains an additional mandatory requirement for the content of a closure notice: it must either state that no amendment of the return is required or it must “make the amendments of the return required to give effect to his conclusions”… </p>

In our view it is clear that a closure notice that meets the requirements of both subsections (1) and (2) is a “closure notice” that takes effect when it is issued in accordance with subsection (3). Section 28B(3) is clear and unqualified, and the only provisions that govern what a closure notice is and what its contents should be are those in subsections (1) and (2). There is nothing in section 28B that provides any indication that the effectiveness of a closure notice is subject to compliance with section 28B(4). On the contrary, in our view there is a very strong indication that there must be a valid closure notice in order for amendments to individual returns to be made under subsection (4). Section 28B(4) can only apply on its terms when a partnership return “is amended” under subsection (2). This can only occur via the issue of the closure notice, since it is a closure notice itself that makes the amendments of the return under that section… </p>

Only thus can the closure notice “make the amendments of the return” required to give effect to the officer’s conclusions within the meaning of section 28A(2)(b).

After all, this is the document which notifies the partner of the amendments to his or her return needed to give effect to the amendments of the partnership return, and if this leads to an amendment of the partner’s self-assessment, it may be thought that the <span style="text-decoration:underline">Hallamshire</span> principle should require the consequential figure of tax alleged to be due from the partner to be explicitly stated, in the same way as upon completion of an enquiry into the partner’s personal tax return. Furthermore, the parallel may seem to be reinforced by the fact that the enquiry into the partnership return gives rise to a deemed enquiry into the personal return of each partner, by virtue of section 12AC(6)(a). How, it may be asked, is that deemed enquiry to be brought to an end otherwise than by a notice equivalent to a closure notice under section 28A? </p>

The first, and obvious, point is that a notice under section 28B(4) is not itself a closure notice. On the contrary, the statutory purpose of the notice is merely to amend each partner’s section 8 return “so as to give effect to the amendments of the partnership return”. This language strongly suggests that the purpose of the notice is consequential, and dependent on the making of valid amendments of the partnership return by a closure notice issued in accordance with section 28B(1) to (3). As the FTT said, rightly in my view, in the <span style="text-decoration:underline">Wau Lam</span> case at [26], quoted by Lewison LJ in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Archer</span> at [23], section 28B(4) can only apply when a partnership return is “amended” under subsection (2), and “[t]his can only occur via the issue of the closure notice, since it is the closure notice itself that makes the amendments of the return under that subsection.” </p>

Furthermore, since every partnership return must include a “partnership statement” of the amounts specified in section 12AB, which include the amount of each partner’s share of the partnership’s trading loss for the relevant period, it follows that the precise amount of the revised loss allocated to each partner’s share must have been validly stated by way of amendment in the closure notice itself.  </p>

For example, the notice to Dr Amrolia informed him that the losses allocated to him by the partnership had been reduced from £399,953 to £127,516. As a bare minimum, this is in my view all the notice had to do in order to comply with section 28B(4). </p>

He illustrated this point by reference to the personal circumstances of Dr Amrolia, whose tax return for 2004/05 shows that he had invested in four different partnerships during the year (three of which related to the acquisition, production or distribution of films), and claimed to have made total losses of approximately £2.8 million from his participation in them. In addition, Dr Amrolia appears to have been non-UK domiciled, which would have added an extra layer of complication to his taxation affairs. I can see no good reason why section 28B(4) should be construed in such a way as to require all these complications to be taken into account, and Dr Amrolia’s self-assessment to be amended to show a single overall figure of tax payable, when the only express requirement of the subsection is that his return should be amended so as to give effect to the amendments of the LLP’s partnership return. </p>

Mr Chacko understandably relies on section 59B(5) as an indication that a notice under section 28B(4)(a) must amend the self-assessment which forms part of the partner’s return under section 8 if it is to ground a valid obligation to pay an amount of tax to HMRC. I agree with him that the notice must amend the taxpayer’s self-assessment if it is to have that result, and that is indeed what each of the notices in this case purported to do. Each notice was headed “Amendment to your personal Self Assessment Tax return – year ending 5 April 2005”. Furthermore, although the notices could in some respects have been more clearly set out and explained, there is no real difficulty in understanding the amendments to the self-assessment that the relevant officer intended to make. Neither taxpayer has suggested that they or their advisers had any problem in understanding the amendments made.  </p>

For the reasons I have given, I consider this further step in the argument to be mistaken. The amendments which have to be made to the partner’s return are confined to those needed to give effect to the amendments of the partnership return. If the officer giving the notice chooses to go further, and amend the partner’s self-assessment, there is nothing to prevent the officer from taking that course, and collection proceedings then may be based on the relevant amendments pursuant to 59B(5). But that does not turn the notice into the equivalent of a closure notice, or import a requirement for the notice itself to state the amount of tax payable as a condition of its validity. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I have said that the enquiry into the individual partner’s return will remain open “if need be”, because in many cases the officer giving the mandatory notice under section 28B(4) will make purely consequential amendments to the partner’s self-assessment which are sufficient to deal with all remaining points in issue and leave no scope for any possible further enquiry. In cases of that nature, the notice under section 28B(4) will have the same practical effect as a closure notice relating to the deemed enquiry into the partner’s personal return. But precisely because of the consequential nature of the notice, in a context where a valid closure notice has already been given terminating the enquiry into the partnership’s return, I do not think there is any formal requirement for the resulting figure of tax due from the partner to be stated in accordance with the <span style="text-decoration:underline">Hallamshire</span> principle. It is enough if the notice, on a fair reading, makes clear to the partner what the relevant amendments are to his self-assessment and how his liability to tax for the relevant year is affected. The notice given in the present case to Dr Amrolia provides an example of these principles in operation. The section 28B(4) notice given to him was in my opinion effective to amend his selfassessment in accordance with its terms, by reducing the amount of his carried back loss claim and making the appropriate consequential adjustments to his (nonstatutory) statement of account with HMRC. </p>

Mr Chacko points out, correctly, that a sideways claim for loss relief does not engage the provisions of schedule 1B to TMA 1970, because the claim does not involve two or more years of assessment: see <span style="text-decoration:underline">de Silva</span> at [27].

The same is also true, as Lord Hodge went on to explain at [28], if the taxpayer (like Dr Ranjit-Singh) wished to carry back part of the losses incurred in Year 2 to set off against his or her income of Year 1. In either case, HMRC may give effect to the claim in full, and it may later transpire, after the opening of an enquiry into the Year 2 return, that the relief given was excessive. In that situation, if the claim was an exclusively sideways claim, all that is necessary is for the closure notice given on termination of the enquiry to make the necessary adjustments to the tax chargeable for the year. If (as in the present case) the original claim was for a combination of sideways and carry-back relief, then in giving effect to the claim in Year 2 HMRC can rely on the words “or otherwise” in paragraph 2(6) of Schedule 1B in order to recoup any relief previously given in error.

The only requirement for HMRC to be able to make amendments reflecting the sideways claim is that there should be an open enquiry into the taxpayer’s Year 2 return. In Dr Ranjit-Singh’s case, that condition is unquestionably satisfied, because of the deemed notice of enquiry into her return under section 12AC(6)(a). The deemed enquiry was given “under section 9A(1)”, and therefore extended to “anything contained in the return, or required to be contained in the return, including any claim or election included in the return”: see section 9A(4)(a). Accordingly, it was open to HMRC, in the context of the deemed enquiry into Dr Ranjit-Singh’s return, to enquire into her claim for sideways relief. </p>

The defects in the notice given to her could not be described as a want of form or omission, because HMRC did not yet have sufficient information to issue a valid closure notice to her, and the notice therefore fell outside what I consider to be the proper scope of section 28B(4)(a).
