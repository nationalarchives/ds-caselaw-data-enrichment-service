A few weeks after K arrived in this country, the father took the child to hospital because he had become so concerned about his behaviour and had started to notice symptoms of emerging psychosis. The local authority in England became involved with the family and in November 2018 issued care proceedings.

On this occasion, the court found the threshold criteria under s.31 to be satisfied on the basis of an agreed threshold document but the court concluded that it was not possible to make a final order and the hearing was adjourned part heard. Directions were given facilitating an assessment of the option of placing K with a maternal uncle in France (which turned out to be negative). Further directions were given for the translation and disclosure to the French authorities of certain documents from the proceedings, “pursuant to Article 56 Brussels IIA”. The order also recorded by way of recital that the local authority intended to seek legal advice from a French qualified lawyer on the issue of placement of the child in France. It seems, however, that no such advice was obtained. The hearing was relisted in June but in the event adjourned.  </p>

On 9 August, the local authority submitted to ICACU a “Request for Co-Operation Form” (described in the index to the supplementary bundle filed for this appeal as “Article 56 transfer request”) in which it stated that “the local authority seeks information as to suitable placements for K in France, and for assistance in planning a move for K to a suitable unit or resource in France, pursuant to Article 56”.  </p>

In emails to the local authority, ICACU reiterated the observation of the French Central Authority that, if the English judge was contemplating the placement of the child in institutional care or with a foster family in France, the procedure to be followed was laid down in Article 56 but that, if the English judge was considering the placement of the child with a family member in France, the appropriate procedure was to issue a certificate under Article 39.  Importantly, ICACU also informed the local authority, in response to their requests for information from the French authorities, that additional information was required, namely “a referral detailing who you are looking to place the child with …, as this isn’t stated and, if it is, it isn’t clear”. </p>

In the course of the hearing, the judge decided, of her own motion, to make an order authorising a request under Article 15 BIIa for the French Court to assume jurisdiction. This was accepted by children’s guardian but opposed by the mother. The local authority remained neutral on the issue. No judgment was delivered, but in the course of the hearing, the judge identified the reasons why the request was being made, by reference to the provisions of Article 15 itself, and subsequently summarised those reasons in the court order. Subsequently, following the grant of permission to appeal, the judge drafted a document dated 8 July setting out her reasons for her decision.

The following day, my Lord Moylan LJ refused the application for a stay, observing that there would be no prejudice to the mother to justify the stay because, if the Article 15 request were ultimately set aside on appeal, jurisdiction would remain with the courts of this country even if the French court had, in the meantime, accepted the jurisdiction. Conversely, if the Article 15 request were not set aside on appeal, the imposition of a stay would have caused an additional delay to the detriment of the child.

The writer recorded that, following the discussion in December 2019, the French professionals who were consulted about the case had expressed concern about the proposal to place K in France. It was pointed out that he already benefits from his placement in England where he has become more stable, a factor described as an important element in his treatment. It was further pointed out that in France there were no structures similar to those available for K in England – “the organisation of the homes does not allow for a professional to oversee the child, as is the case in England.” It also seems that the French professionals have concluded that the relationship between K and his mother is not as positive as it seems to those in England. The Paris social services were unable to guarantee that a placement would be available or a specific timeframe. It was possible that, upon arrival in France, K would be placed in emergency housing in Paris while his needs were assessed. Overall, the report raised a number of potential difficulties about the proposal to place K in France. </p>

So, I’m not -- it’s not an easy position to be in, to say, “Well, the case should go ahead at the end of August and those are the options”. The local authority’s care plan, care order, K is in the UK, but at some point he might go to France; secondly, if I adjourn it, which I don’t think anyone wants given that K’s been in the UK for so long; or thirdly, I make no order. Obviously that would mean that [the mother] would be free to take K back to France, but there’s no support plan there. There’s nothing. That’s -- those are the three options I have.” </p>

It was submitted that it was essential for the court to have this information before deciding whether or not to ask the French court to assume jurisdiction. Having agreed to put further questions through ICACU, the court ought to have refrained from making the Article 15 request until those questions were answered. It was possible that the French authorities were in the process of deciding whether or not to offer K a placement. There was therefore a risk that, were the French court to assume jurisdiction, the case might be delayed unnecessarily. The court needed the further information before deciding which course would involve the minimum delay. </p>

Ms Courtney went so far as to describe the French authorities as having been dilatory and obfuscating in their response to requests for information and assistance. She accused them of an intractable lack of cooperation. She submitted that the arguments raised by the appellant based on difficulties caused by the Covid pandemic were flawed because the difficulties arose in both jurisdictions. She contended that the points relied on by the appellant in support of her case that the English court was better placed to hear the remainder of the proceedings and that a transfer was not in K’s best interests were of no real substance given the ongoing delays in the English proceedings which could not be concluded satisfactorily, given the failure of the French authorities to cooperate. </p>

The local authority is to be commended for the support it has provided to K and his mother. It is clear, however, that the course adopted by the local authority so far has not yet achieved its stated aim. It does not seem to me to be necessary to apportion blame for this failure. But having read carefully through the email correspondence which has passed between the local authority, ICACU and the French authorities, I emphatically reject Ms Courtney’s characterisation of the French authorities’ response. It seems to me that the French authorities have responded fairly and reasonably to the request for information. They have tried to help locate a suitable placement for K. They have held meetings with their English counterparts and with K and his mother. The fact that some professionals in France have expressed concern about the proposal to place K in that country is, to my mind, a legitimate exercise of professional judgement and not an example of obfuscation. </p>

It is true that, given the unfortunate disengagement of the father, K’s connections with this country have been diminished, but he is at present in a secure placement where his complex needs are being well cared for.

It seems to have been assumed by the parties, and perhaps the court, that Articles 55 and 56 represent a means by which information about possible placements can be obtained. But as a study of the terms of the two articles demonstrates, this is not the case. It is not the role of the French authorities, through a request for information under Article 55, to identify possible placements which could be adopted by the English court. The French authorities have responded as much as they fairly can to the requests made of them to date but, put bluntly, it is not their role </p>

The right course, in my view, would be for the local authority to instruct a French professional – either a child psychiatrist or a specialist social worker – to advise as to the type of placement which might be suitable and to identify a specific placement option which would meet K’s needs. Armed with this expert opinion, the English court could evaluate that option and, as part of that evaluation, consult the French authorities under Article 56. The approach adopted by the parties and the court hitherto, though well-intentioned, is to my mind flawed. The fact that this approach has not worked is not, therefore, a good reason for seeking the transfer of proceedings under Article 15. </p>

To my mind, the reasons given by the judge on that occasion remain apposite. The family court in this country has already heard a considerable amount of evidence and made findings. All the evidence and information about the child’s mental health is in this country. A transfer under Article 15 would create additional delays. With appropriate directions, the English court ought to be able to obtain all the information necessary to make a decision about K’s long-term future, notwithstanding that the best placement for him may be in France. Applying the test proposed by the CJEU in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Child and Family Agency v D</span> to identify whether the French court would be better placed to hear the case, a transfer of jurisdiction would manifestly not “provide genuine and specific added value”. Asking the questions posed by Baroness Hale in the Supreme Court in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Re N</span> to identify whether a transfer would be in the child’s best interests, the short-term consequences would be an extended delay. As to the longterm consequences, the options for a French court deciding the eventual order would certainly not be greater and might in fact be reduced. </p>

It is not a general provision which caters for every type of request. In saying this, I recognise that there is an element of uncertainty because the authorities in different states can take a different view as to whether a request is or is not within the scope of Article 55. This is why, if there is doubt as to whether a proposed request is within the scope of the Article, ICACU may be able to provide assistance based on their considerable experience of its operation. However, because ICACU’s limited resources need to be used carefully, I would first expect that, as far as possible, careful consideration should be given to the terms of Article 55 before this is undertaken.  </p>

There is no time limit for the provision of information pursuant to either Article 55 or Article 56 (which I deal with further below) and I would doubt whether a Central Authority is able to require any other domestic agency to provide information or undertake any assessment by any specific date.  The ability to ensure that the information which was provided was sufficient for the purposes of the proceedings was also more limited.  The more complex the request, as in this case, the more scope for the information not to be sufficient.  Secondly, the greater the potential reliance placed, indirectly, on an agency in another state to find a placement, the greater the scope for miscommunications or misunderstandings or, even, differences of professional opinion to occur especially, again, in a complex case such as this case. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The next point I address is timing. By way of example, the French Central Authority was<span style="font-size:11.5pt"> “respectfully </span>requested” to provide answers to the information sought as set out in the order of 12 April 2019 by 26 April 2019. As referred to above this was, at best, an optimistic expectation. I would, in fact, say that it was unrealistic. As the ICACU Guide makes clear allowance has to be made, first, for it to process the request. The Guide gives the standard response time as 5 working days for initial analysis and a further 10 working days to process the request. In this case ICACU did not receive the request until 16 April 2019.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In addition, as referred to above, neither Article 55 nor Article 56 currently stipulate any time by which a response must be provided (the Recast Regulation includes a time limit of, save in exceptional circumstances, 3 months). This is why both the Guide and the President’s Guidance emphasise that requests must be made as soon as possible. To quote from the Guide: “It is important that any request for co-operation is made <span style="font-weight:bold">as soon as</span> you identify a need for information or assistance from the other country”.  The President’s Guidance similarly states that: “Requests for co-operation should be made as early as practicably possible”. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Finally, I would simply comment that it is rarely, if ever, appropriate for the <span style="font-style:italic">same</span> request for information to be made through more than one route. I mention this because the order of 2 October 2019 proposed that the same request be made both through the Central Authorities and through the IFJO. This is rarely appropriate because it serves to confuse the process and is an unnecessary duplication.</p>
