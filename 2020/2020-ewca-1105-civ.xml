She contends, principally, that the judge was: (a) wrong to decide that the children were habitually resident in Germany at the date of their wrongful retention by the mother in England at the end of July 2019 and should have decided that they were habitually resident in England at that date; and (b) wrong to decide that the mother had not established the exception under Article 13(b). </p>

The father has always lived and continues to live in Germany.  For ease of reference I will call the place in which he lives, Stadt.  The mother and the children remained living in Germany until July 2018 when they moved to live in England.

The mother had obtained a contract “to work on a particular project” in the same town where her partner lived.  They have since married and have a child born in 2020.   </p>

The children were to spend “nearly equal” time with each parent.  In addition, the letter said, baldly, that the “children’s home will remain in [Stadt]”. </p>

The mother produced a table which suggested that, over the same period, they had spent 96/97 days with the father.  The judge was not in a position to resolve this difference but, in either event, it is clear that the children were predominantly living in England between July 2018 and July 2019. </p>

He decided that the children had not “lost” their habitual residence in Germany by July 2019 so remained habitually resident there.  He also decided that it would not be intolerable for the children to return to Germany.  Accordingly, he made an order that the children should be returned to Germany on a date in April 2020.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The judge’s focus, in that part of his judgment in which he dealt with the issue of habitual residence, was significantly on the children’s continuing connections with Germany.  This was because, as referred to below, he considered that the question he had to answer, when determining where the children were habitually resident, was “have they lost their German habitual residence”.  He identified that they “were spending regular periods of time in Germany with” the father and went through the dates on which they were in Germany.  They had attended kindergarten in Germany for “part of the time they were there”.  This was part of the “overall network” which included staying with their paternal grandparents and which “one has to consider when considering the position of the children and the extent to which they may or may not be integrated in a particular society”.</p>

If habitual residence is gained in one location, it will be lost in another, and the question in this particular case, which is of considerable relevance - and it is perhaps unusual and not something that one sees in many cases - is that it is undoubtedly the case that the children were developing relationships in this country, they were learning the language, they were having a life here, but had those factors displaced the fact that they had the connection with Germany, the relationship with their family there, the life that they had in that jurisdiction, and so on? </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.00in;text-indent:0.50in">What one sometimes sees is there is a complete severance of the relationship that a child has in one location and an adoption of a completely new life. To take a rather extreme example: if a child is removed, for example, from here to Australia, then there is rarely the opportunity to keep alive the life that one had at such a distance. In this case, what we have is a situation where the children have one life, the life that they had always had in Germany, and a new life which is developing elsewhere, and the difficult task for this court is to evaluate whether they had lost that connection with Germany as they gained the position in the United Kingdom, and as I say, if it is a question of intention, the application before this court came hard on the heels of the email from the mother in which she said at that point that she did not intend to abide by the original agreement. In short, until the end of July – if I accept the mother's evidence - it was the position that she was adhering to the agreement but that at the end of July, that position had changed.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.00in;text-indent:0.00in">“[43] The degree of connection, as I have indicated, is another matter for the court to consider, but the degree of connection with Germany was ongoing and whilst the shared arrangement between the parents - one speaks of qualitative and quantitative differences - the quantity is not as significant as the quality, and if there was a good quality time spent with their father in Germany then <span style="font-style:italic">the question of whether they had lost their habitual residence with the father arises</span>. It is the stability of a child's residence, as opposed to its permanence, which is relevant, and as I have just said, it is qualitative, not quantitative, in the sense that it is the integration of the child into the environment rather than a mere measurement of the time the child spends there. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.00in;text-indent:0.00in">[44] It is said that the relevant question is whether a child has achieved some degree of integration in social and family life. It is not necessary for the child to be fully integrated before becoming habitually resident. This has been a particularly difficult case for this court to determine. There is little doubt that the boys have clearly developed a new aspect to their life, that they seem to have become very popular in their school, and I accept what I have read in the mother's statement that they were popular within the school, they were having sleepovers. She feels that [T] was accepted in the school, which was one that is particularly suited to his needs, and which had not been the case previously, and that the boys were clearly very happy there. They are living in an environment where there is perhaps more fresh air than in [Stadt], that they go out, they go birdwatching, they love the beach. In many ways the description of their life here is one that is most attractive and one where I am satisfied that what the mother has to say is that they are happy, but, as I have indicated, although there is a degree of integration, certainly something that is happening for them, <span style="font-style:italic">the question is have they lost their German habitual residence</span>? That is where one has to consider the see-saw with which Lord Wilson so graphically illustrated the question which the court has to determine. As the children lose their connection with the place of origin and their initial habitual residence, that will happen as they gain habitual residence elsewhere, and so the see-saw tips, the balance tips in one direction and as it tips towards their new location, they lose the connection with the other location.” (my emphasis) </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The judge concluded, “with some degree of sadness”, that the children’s habitual residence had “not shifted to England” but remained in Germany.  He referred to that fact that “in June, that intention [that the children would return to Germany] was still being expressed as the intention of both parents”.  He then, at [46], summarised his conclusion as follows: “given that those intentions were still alive in June 2019, given that [the children] were still spending time with family in Germany in July [and] that they still had a life there … I have concluded that the habitual residence has not shifted to England”; “The position in Germany having kept alive throughout that period, they have therefore not lost that, and in those circumstances they had not gained habitual residence in this country”. </p>

He returned to the latter point later in his judgment when he said, at [52], that he “was impressed with what the mother had to say about the way in which [the children] related to friends at school; [and] the matters that have been raised in terms of their life here”.   </p>

The judge’s approach to this issue can also be seen from his subsequent observation that, if the children “had had no contact with their father during the intervening period, then it may be that a change in terms of their integration and their habitual residence would have been found by this court, I cannot say”. </p>

This led him, in turn, to focus on the extent to which the children had lost or maintained their connections with Germany and whether those connections had been “displaced”.  The judge’s perspective was clearly driven by, or based on, his understanding of the need to apply Lord Wilson’s “see-saw” analogy from the case of <span style="font-style:italic">In re B (A Child) (Reunite International Child Abduction Centre and others intervening)</span> [2016] AC 606, at [45].</p>

He accepted that returning to Germany would “create very considerable difficulties for the mother” especially as she was about to give birth and also because she had no accommodation there.  He also had “no doubt that there will be considerable disruption for the” children.  He concluded as follows: “In terms of the position, however, as to whether it would be intolerable for the boys, I bear in mind that the boys spend regular periods in Germany with their father and that although the position may be that they will be there for longer than is usual, nonetheless, going to their father is not something that is strange or unusual for them, and so I cannot see<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>that that in itself is something that would be intolerable”.  </p>

The judge was also, Mr Setright submitted, entitled to treat as a significant factor the joint parental intention that the children would return to Germany in July/August 2019.  The judge had taken into account the children’s integration in England and, he submitted, had not “underplayed” their lives in England.  Based on this assessment, the judge had reached the decision that the seesaw had not tipped and that, as a result, the children remained habitually resident in Germany.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.00in;text-indent:0.00in">“[45] I conclude that the modern concept of a child's habitual residence operates in such a way as to make it highly unlikely, albeit conceivable, that a child will be in the limbo in which the courts below have placed B. The concept operates in the expectation that, when a child gains a new habitual residence, he loses his old one. Simple analogies are best: consider a seesaw. As, probably quite quickly, he puts down those first roots which represent the requisite degree of integration in the environment of the new state, up will probably come the child's roots in that of the old state to the point at which he achieves the requisite de-integration (or, better, disengagement) from it. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.00in;text-indent:0.00in">[46] One of the well-judged submissions of Mr Tyler QC on behalf of the respondent is that, were it minded to remove any gloss from the domestic concept of habitual residence (such as, I interpolate, Lord Brandon's third preliminary point in the <span style="font-style:italic">J </span>case [1990] 2 AC 562), the court should strive not to introduce others. A gloss is a purported sub-rule which distorts application of the rule. The identification of a child's habitual residence is overarchingly a question of fact. In making the following three suggestions about the point at which habitual residence might be lost and gained, I offer not sub-rules but expectations which the fact-finder may well find to be unfulfilled in the case before him: (a) the deeper the child's integration in the old state, probably the less fast his achievement of the requisite degree of integration in the new state; (b) the greater the amount of adult pre-planning of the move, including pre-arrangements for the child's day-to-day life in the new state, probably the faster his achievement of that requisite degree; and (c) were all the central members of the child's life in the old state to have moved with him, probably the faster his achievement of it and, conversely, were any of them to have remained behind and thus to represent for him a continuing link with the old state, probably the less fast his achievement of it.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In conclusion on this issue, while Lord Wilson’s see-saw analogy can assist the court when deciding the question of habitual residence, it does not replace the core guidance given in <span style="font-style:italic">A v A</span> and other cases to the approach which should be taken to the determination of the habitual residence.  This requires an analysis of the child’s situation in and connections with the state or states in which he or she is said to be habitually resident for the purpose of determining in which state he or she has the requisite degree of integration to mean that their residence there is habitual.  </p>

This is not to say continuing or historical connections are not relevant but they are part of, not the primary focus of, the court’s analysis when deciding the critical question which is <span style="font-style:italic">where</span> is the child habitually resident and not, simply, <span style="font-style:italic">when</span> was a previous habitual residence lost. </p>

What is important is whether the way in which the question has been phrased leads to the judge failing to apply the proper approach and, again to adopt what Lord Wilson said, applying a “gloss”, namely an approach which “distorts [the] application of” the proper approach to the determination of a child’s habitual residence. </p>

In my view, the judge reached a different decision to that which a factual enquiry would have produced as a result of asking, not where the children were habitually resident as at the end of July 2019 but whether they had by then lost their German habitual residence.  This resulted in the judge’s analysis having the wrong focus. </p>

However, although the judge did then briefly address some aspects of the children’s lives in England, he went back to the same key question: “as I have indicated, although there is a degree of integration, certainly something that is happening for them, the question is have they lost their German habitual residence”.  </p>

The factors relied on by the judge were, in summary, the parents’ intentions and the time the children were spending with their father and other family members in Germany thereby maintaining their connections with Germany.  These are important factors but, in my view, they do not counterbalance the degree of integration that the children had established in England.  I would want to emphasise that this is not to diminish the importance for the children of their continuing connections with Germany.  Rather, it is that they are not sufficient to mean that the children were not habitually resident in England because of the powerful factors demonstrating the extent of their integration and the stability of their life with their mother in England. </p>
