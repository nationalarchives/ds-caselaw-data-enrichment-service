	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The defendant (“NICE”) is responsible for deciding whether to recommend “health technologies”, including drugs, for NHS use in England, and NHS bodies are obliged to fund treatments which it has recommended. In July 2018 NICE was asked by the Secretary of State for Health &amp; Social Care to appraise a drug known as Kuvan and to make a recommendation whether it should be provided by the NHS. Kuvan is used to treat PKU, a rare metabolic condition which inhibits the body’s ability to metabolise protein. Left untreated, and unless controlled by an extremely exacting diet, it causes irreversible brain damage. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In order to carry out an appraisal, NICE had to decide which of two procedures should be used. One of these is its standard procedure, the Health Technology Appraisal or </p>

This is reserved for highly specialised technologies which meet seven criteria set out in a document entitled “Interim Process and Methods of the Highly Specialised Technologies Programme” issued by NICE in April 2017 (“the 2017 Guidance”). </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">By a decision recorded in a Topic Selection Outcome Report (“the TSOR”) dated 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2019, NICE determined that Kuvan did not satisfy three of the seven criteria for use of the HST procedure and, accordingly, that the standard HTA procedure should be used for its evaluation. It is that decision which is challenged in these proceedings. The claimant, an 11-year-old girl who suffers from PKU, does not challenge the lawfulness of the criteria which NICE has set for the use of the HST procedure. Rather, her case is that, on the facts, all of those criteria were satisfied in the case of Kuvan and, accordingly, that the decision to use the HTA procedure for its evaluation was unlawful. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It follows that this case is not about whether Kuvan should be recommended for use on the NHS. No decision has yet been made, either that it should be or that it should not. The case is solely concerned with the procedure by which Kuvan should be appraised so that a decision one way or the other can be made. Moreover, it is not possible to say at this stage, either that Kuvan will be recommended if it is appraised under the HST process, or that it will not be if it is appraised under the  HTA process. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Nevertheless it is reasonable to proceed on the basis that appraisal under the HST process would significantly enhance the prospect of a favourable recommendation. That is essentially for financial reasons. Because a positive recommendation for any treatment will have consequences for the NHS’s budget, NICE needs to have some way of measuring the value for money of the treatments it is required to appraise, so as to ensure that the treatment in question represents an effective use of finite NHS resources and that there is a “level playing field” for the appraisal of widely differing treatments, all of which are of major importance to those whose lives may be transformed if the treatment is made available on the NHS.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">For this purpose NICE makes use of two concepts, the “Quality Adjusted Life Year” (“QALY”) and the “Incremental Cost Effectiveness Ratio” (“ICER”). A QALY is a measure of the health benefits provided by a treatment in which a patient’s expected increase in length of life is adjusted to reflect their expected quality of life. One QALY is equal to one extra year of life in perfect health. The ICER is a measure of the cost effectiveness of a health technology which is expressed as the cost of each QALY gained. There is no challenge to the use of these concepts or the way in which NICE uses them. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Under the standard HTA procedure, NICE will not generally recommend a health technology for use in the NHS if it will cost more than £30,000 for each QALY gained. Under the HST procedure, however, NICE will recommend a drug with an ICER of up to £100,000 per QALY gained. (A higher figure also applies to end of life treatments, but these are not relevant here). Thus, so far as cost effectiveness is concerned, the test for a favourable recommendation is considerably easier to satisfy under the HST procedure: a drug must be more cost-effective to be recommended under the HTA procedure than it need be under the HST procedure.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">As the 2017 Guidance explains, this is a deliberate departure from the principle of a “level playing field” for the evaluation of all treatments. It is considered to be necessary because a simple utilitarian approach in which the greatest gain for the greatest number of patients was decisive would mean that expensive treatments which would benefit only a very small number of patients suffering from very rare conditions would be unlikely to be approved. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In practice the supplier of a drug with a high list price will often be prepared to negotiate a discount, sometimes a very substantial discount, from the list price in order to obtain a positive NICE recommendation. That is because the NHS is itself a major customer and also because a NICE recommendation carries weight in other markets. But, as is apparent from the scheme described above, a greater discount will be necessary to obtain NICE approval for a drug appraised under the HTA procedure than will be the case if the HST procedure is adopted. What level of discount the supplier of Kuvan may be prepared to offer is as yet unknown, but may be decisive in determining whether it will be recommended. It will be a matter for confidential commercial negotiations in due course. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Accordingly, while Mr Daniel Stilitz QC for NICE was right to describe the decision whether Kuvan should be appraised under the HTA or HST procedure as a “routeing decision”, that decision is of considerable and potentially critical importance to the claimant and other sufferers from PKU. While NICE has a duty to ensure value for money in the treatments which it recommends, so that health care resources are used to deliver the greatest overall health benefit to NHS patients, it is obvious that any decision on financial grounds not to recommend (or which makes it less likely that NICE will recommend) a drug with life changing benefits will cause intense disappointment and frustration to sufferers from the condition in question and their families. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">PKU (an abbreviation of phenylketonuria) is a rare metabolic condition which inhibits the body’s ability to metabolise protein. Left untreated, it causes brain damage leading to profound and irreversible intellectual disability, delayed speech, seizures and behavioural abnormalities. It can, in theory at any rate, be treated by sticking rigorously to an extremely limited low-protein, effectively synthetic, diet. Sufferers from PKU cannot eat 80% of all normal food and are limited to foods such as corn starch, tapioca starch and gums. That means eating unappetising meals which are difficult and time-consuming to prepare. They must in addition take protein substitutes three or four times a day, which have a poor smell and taste. This combination of a very low protein diet together with the administration of protein substitutes makes adherence to the diet extremely arduous for sufferers and, in the case of children, for their carers. Most adults with PKU do not succeed in adhering to the diet and suffer the resulting consequences. Long term outcomes are poor. </p>

It is a synthetic form of tetrahydrobiopterin (“BH4”), which is naturally absent in sufferers from PKU. Not all individuals with PKU are responsive to Kuvan, but it is highly beneficial for those who are. It minimises (but does not eliminate completely) the need for the extreme dietary regime, reduces the risk of brain damage and enables them to live a more normal life. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In July 2018 NICE was asked by the Secretary of State for Health &amp; Social Care to appraise Kuvan and make a recommendation whether it should be provided by the NHS. In order to do so, NICE had to decide whether to use the HTA or HST procedure. As already indicated, NICE decided that Kuvan did not satisfy three of the seven criteria for use of the HST procedure and, accordingly that the HTA procedure should be used. Its decision and reasoning are set out in the TSOR dated 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2019. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Following this decision the supplier, BioMarin, withdrew Kuvan from the appraisal process. As the participation of the supplier is essential, this meant that the appraisal could not proceed. We were told, however, that since the decision of the judge dismissing the claim for judicial review of the decision to use the HTA procedure, BioMarin has re-engaged with the procedure. There is a dispute between the parties, which we need not resolve, as to the likelihood of a favourable recommendation being made if the HTA procedure continues to be used. As I have explained, this is likely to depend to a considerable extent on whether BioMarin is prepared to discount its list price for Kuvan to an extent sufficient to achieve an ICER of no more than £30,000 per QALY gained from use of the drug. The claimant’s witnesses say that this is, at best, highly unlikely, while NICE says that it would not devote resources to an appraisal unless it believed that there was a realistic prospect of a successful commercial negotiation with the supplier. Evidently, however, a lesser discount would be required if the HST procedure were to be used. </p>

These are the services referred to in the definition of “highly specialised health technology” in Regulation 2 of the 2013 Regulations. The list includes (at paragraph 63) “highly specialist metabolic disorder services” which, as is common ground, includes a service for the treatment of PKU. Some of the services in the list, of which paragraph 63 is an example, are expressly described as “highly specialist”, while others are not. It is a puzzling feature of the list that, while some of the services listed are indeed services for rare or very rare conditions, many of them (despite the headings of Regulation 11 and Schedule 4) plainly are not.  </p>

Somewhat unhelpfully, the 2017 Guidance does not itself define ‘highly specialised services’. However, in my judgment the Defendant is right that this is a term of art and is used within the NHS to refer to services that are commissioned as highly specialised services. In other words, it is the way that the services are commissioned that make them highly specialised, rather than the degree of expertise of those who provide the services. Just because something is recognised in Schedule 4 of the 2012 Regulations as being highly specialist, or because it is, in the common usage of the phrase, a highly specialist service, does not mean that it is a highly specialised service for the purposes of this criterion.” </p>

In my view, the relevant context, for present purposes, is that the treatment must usually be concentrated in broadly the same number of centres as highly specialised services are normally provided in. This gives some content to the words ‘very few’, which are otherwise almost entirely a matter of opinion.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Wise submitted that in construing the criteria in the 2017 Guidance, the judge failed to have proper regard to the statutory context. In particular, he ought to have approached the meaning of the Guidance on the basis that treatments for rare or very rare conditions such as PKU should be appraised under the HST procedure unless there are very good reasons for not doing so. This was because the “highly specialised health technologies” to which Regulation 8 refers are defined in Regulation 2 by reference to the “rare and very rare conditions” listed in Schedule 4 to the 2012 Regulations. Since Kuvan is a highly specialised health technology which is aimed at treating a rare or very rare condition, the presumption should be that it should be appraised under the HST procedure. This statutory context ought to have informed the judge’s approach in relation to each of the three criteria.  </p>

No such argument was advanced, however, either in this court or to the judge. It is in any event most unlikely that this was Parliament’s intention in approving the 2013 Regulations.

The reason for having two separate processes for evaluating health technologies was different. As is apparent from a comparison of Regulations 7 and 8 of the 2013 Regulations (see [26] above), the important distinction was between technologies which the Board itself would have a duty to provide (and thus an interest in being consulted in the course of an appraisal) and those which would be provided at local level. </p>

It is accepted that the seven criteria in fact established by NICE were lawful, but many of the conditions listed in Schedule 4 are not “chronic and severely disabling” (criterion 3), and technologies for treating them would not necessarily have “a very high acquisition cost” or “the potential for lifelong use” (criteria 5 and 6). No doubt judgment must be exercised in determining such matters as whether any particular condition is “chronic and severely disabling” or whether an acquisition cost is “very high”, but these criteria themselves are unambiguous, it is accepted that they are lawful, and the presumption for which Mr Wise contends has no part to play in their interpretation. I see no reason why the position should be different in interpreting the criteria with which we are concerned.  </p>

That is a necessary condition for evaluation under the HST procedure as a technology will not otherwise fall within the definition of “highly specialised technology”, but is not a sufficient condition and does not give rise to any presumption. The meaning of each of the criteria must be determined in accordance with the natural meaning of the words used, read in the light of the relevant context. This is not a surprising conclusion. As the existence of two distinct evaluation procedures presupposes a departure from the “level playing field” approach of evaluating health technologies, it is to be expected that the circumstances in which a technology will be evaluated under the HST procedure will be narrowly confined. </p>

As to this, it is true that the judge said at [129] (set out at [47] above) that “NICE was entitled to interpret this criterion in the way that it did”, but he went on immediately in the same paragraph to remind himself of the cases cited earlier in his judgment to the effect that the meaning of a passage in a policy document should be interpreted objectively by the court. Reading the judge’s treatment of criterion 1 as a whole, it is clear that he did not lose sight of this principle. On the contrary, it is clear that his conclusion (“Applying this approach, ‘very few’ means, normally, four or fewer”) was his own objective interpretation of the criterion read in what he found to be its proper context. Nowhere in the TSOR does the NICE decision-making group say that this is what “very few” means in the context of criterion 1. The group said no more than that “more than 10 specialist metabolic centres” or “the currently commissioned 10 specialist metabolic centres” could not be regarded as “very few”. </p>

Obviously, however, the Guidance must be considered in its context. As Mr Wise accepted, the judge was right to say that the primary readership for which the document was designed consisted of the expert decision-making group together with medical professionals and persons engaged in the pharmaceutical industry.

The first stage is a screening test undertaken by way of gene mutation analysis. This will determine whether the patient has a form of PKU which is responsive to BH4. If not, Kuvan will not be a successful form of treatment for that patient and may be deleterious. However, for patients who are responsive to BH4, Kuvan will potentially be beneficial. Whether it will in fact benefit any individual patient can only be determined by the patient undertaking a trial of Kuvan for a short period which will require careful monitoring and assessment by the treating physician. The standard criterion for a satisfactory response is stated in Kuvan’s European Medical Agency Summary of Product Characteristics. It consists of “a ≥30 percent reduction in blood phenylalanine levels”, although the summary goes on to give as an alternative the “attainment of the therapeutic blood phenylalanine goals defined for an individual patient by the treating physician”.

The “licensed indication” refers to the use for which a drug receives an EMA licence which, in the case of Kuvan, consisted of “patients of all ages with phenylketonuria (PKU) who have been shown to be responsive to such treatment”. (We were told, but I do not think it is in evidence, that it is unusual for a licence to define the patients for whom a drug should be prescribed by reference to those who are responsive to it: however, it seems obvious that a drug should only be prescribed for such patients).  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The next question is whether this target group can be regarded as “distinct for clinical reasons”. There is, it seems to me, a danger of over-complicating this issue by insisting on a requirement that a group is only distinct for clinical reasons if it can be identified without a trial of the drug in question, at all events where what amounts to a satisfactory response is a clinically recognised measure, as is the case here (i.e. the ≥30 percent reduction referred to in the EMA Summary of Product Characteristics). I see no reason to doubt, in accordance with the evidence of Professor Anita Macdonald who was described by the judge as “probably the country’s leading expert on PKU”, that “individuals with some enzyme activity, i.e. Kuvan responders, are a clinically accepted subgroup”.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Breaking the issue down, the group of PKU sufferers who are responsive to Kuvan are certainly distinct, as it seems to me, from PKU sufferers who are not responsive (as well as from those who do not suffer from PKU at all). It is hard to see why the reason for their distinctiveness should not be regarded as clinical. It is after all ascertained by clinical treatment and observation. I note that the NICE decisionmaking group had no difficulty in ascertaining the size of this group: the “potentially eligible population” was stated to consist of approximately 500 individuals, with between 300 and 330 patients who would access treatment over time, and about 28 new patients each year. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In my judgment this view is not affected by the possibility that in some cases the treating physician may decide that the ≥30 percent reduction is an inappropriate measure of a particular patient’s responsiveness to Kuvan. It will generally be necessary for a physician prescribing a new drug to monitor the patient’s reaction to it and if necessary to modify the treatment in the light of the individual patient’s particular characteristics. Not all patients will respond to treatment in a way that is expected. Patients who were expected to benefit may not do so or may even react adversely so that treatment has to be stopped. The fact that in the case of Kuvan the licensing application recognises (apparently unusually) this kind of possibility, allowing a degree of judgment to the treating physician, so that the drug should only be prescribed for patients who are responsive to it, does not seem to me to detract from the conclusion that patients who are responsive can be regarded as a group which is distinct for clinical reasons. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I acknowledge the need to ensure, in the case of an expensive drug, that the patients to whom it will be prescribed are well-defined, so that costs can be controlled. I accept that there is a risk (although not one which applies in this case) either that a target group may be loosely defined with the consequence that a drug is used more liberally than expected, or that a drug which has a narrowly defined licensed indication may prove to have other and much wider uses, and that in either case this may make it hard to contain costs in the event that it is recommended for use in the NHS after an appraisal under the HST procedure. However, it seems to me that criterion 1 (the target group in its licensed indication is so small that treatment will usually be concentrated in very few centres) and criterion 4 (expected to be used <span style="font-style:italic">exclusively</span> in a highly specialised service) should be sufficient to address these concerns. In any event, the concerns do not justify departing from the natural meaning of criterion 2. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It is unnecessary to express any view about this submission and I would prefer not to do so. It is apparent that the conclusion of the NICE decision-making group, and indeed of the judge, depended upon their interpretation of the term “highly specialised service” in criterion 4. Because I have held that this interpretation was correct, and because all the criteria must be satisfied, criterion 1 need not be considered further. However, if some different meaning were to be given to criterion 4, the reasoning of the decision-making group and the judge would fall away. If that had been the case, and if criterion 1 had been decisive, it would probably have been necessary to remit this issue to NICE so that a decision could be made on the correct legal basis. </p>

Nevertheless it remains to be seen whether NICE will be able to recommend Kuvan following an appraisal under the standard HTA procedure.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I would add one suggestion, which is that all of the criteria for appraisal of a “highly specialised health technology” under the HST procedure should be set out in plain language. In essence I have decided that the appeal must be dismissed because the term “highly specialised” in criterion 4 must be given what is on any view a technical meaning. While that may come as no surprise to those familiar with NHS concepts and terminology, it would be preferable, in my view, for all the criteria to be expressed in language which could readily be understood by patients and those caring for them. </p>
