The third issue is whether the panel which conducted the inquiry is a ‘public authority’ for the purposes of section 6(3) of the Human Rights Act 1998 (“the HRA”). </p>

The need to seek the approval of the House for the indemnity arose because the FCO recognised that the indemnity created a contingent liability in excess of £300,000 for which there was no statutory authority (Hansard 25 June 2015, vol 597). </p>

Those witnesses included the two claimants in these proceedings, Martin Warsama and Claire Gannon.  They had been employed as social workers on St Helena between February 2013 and July 2014 in the case of Ms Gannon and between September 2013 and April 2014 in the case of Mr Warsama.  They were the source, as whistle-blowers, of many of the most serious allegations that it was the Inquiry’s task to investigate. In the course of the Inquiry, the Panel interviewed 145 witnesses and read over 2,677 documents including all police files dealing with sexual offences dating back to 2009. A detailed review of social services files relating to child welfare was also undertaken dating back to at least 2009.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">When the Panel had completed its investigation, Ms Wass provided a copy of the report of the Panel to the FCO on 3 December 2015 (“the Report”). The Report concluded that the Inquiry had found no evidence that child abuse was either endemic or routine on St Helena. There was no evidence of corruption in the St Helena police force, the St Helena Government, the FCO or DFID. There was no evidence of a cover up. The Report contained criticism of Mr Warsama and Ms Gannon both professionally and personally. The Report described them as professionally incompetent and unable to fulfil the terms of their employment.  Other people and organisations were also strongly criticised in the Report. Whilst exonerating the St Helena authorities of the child sex abuse allegations, the Report did find evidence of systemic failings by social services, particularly regarding the treatment of disabled adults. There had been serious failings in respect of vulnerable people on St Helena.  The Panel described the treatment and neglect of one severely disabled person as “a matter of lasting shame to the St Helena Government”. The Panel concluded that St Helena suffered from bad management and a lack of strategic organisation. The ultimate responsibility for those failings lay with the Governor. In the past, the Report said, when the FCO or DFID was called upon by the Governor to deal with a problem, the “only available response from a distance of 4,000 miles has been to commission another report”.  The Report made a series of recommendations including a better handover process from a retiring Governor to an incoming Governor, better induction for police recruits and proper training in safeguarding for all St Helenian Government employees likely to come into contact with children in the course of their work.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">On 8 December 2016 the claimants each issued a claim against the FCO and Ms Wass. The Wass Inquiry was also originally named as a Defendant, but it is now accepted that the Inquiry is not a separate entity capable of being sued.  Its members are collectively responsible for the Report. The claimants served Particulars of Claim in materially the same terms in April 2017. In their pleadings they allege that the Report is full of factual inaccuracies and that the criticisms of them personally and professionally are untrue.  They allege that the criticisms were expressed in unnecessarily severe terms and did not need to be included in the Report. They also complain about serious irregularities that they say arose from the procedures adopted by the Inquiry during the evidence gathering stage and at the final stages of preparation of the Report. In particular, they assert that they were not given advance warning of the likely terms of the Report when it was in draft form and were not therefore given a proper opportunity to make representations on whether the criticisms of them should be included. Further, they had been assured that the response that they did provide to the complaints made against them would be included in the Report in full, but this had not happened. The claimants allege that the Report has damaged their reputations and had a serious effect on their private and professional lives including their ability to continue employment in their chosen profession. This has given rise to a breach of their right to a private life for the purposes of article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (“ECHR”).  They rely on a number of authorities to establish that article 8 is engaged including most recently <span style="font-style:italic">Axel Springer AG v Germany </span>(App. No.  39954/08 judgment of 7 February 2012). They claim loss and damage under section 6 of the HRA.  The damages claimed include past and future loss of earnings.  </p>

Prior to the hearing, the master gave directions including that the Rt Hon the Speaker of the House of Commons be invited to make submissions.

The first was whether and to what extent the claims were defeated by the defence of Parliamentary privilege. On this issue the Master held that the expression “proceedings in Parliament” did include the Unopposed Return procedure with the result that article 9 of the Bill of Rights barred the claims to the extent that they sought to challenge the accuracy of content of the Report: see para. 110 of the Main Judgment.  However, Parliamentary privilege did not extend to claims relating to matters which occurred outside Parliament, such as the FCO’s initial decision to undertake the Inquiry and the procedures adopted by the Panel in conducting the Inquiry, including the steps taken in the drafting of the Report: para. 113.   </p>

The master held that Ms Wass was acting as a person some of whose functions were of a public nature. She did therefore owe duties under section 6 HRA to participants and others in the discharge of those functions, namely the conduct of the Inquiry and the production of the Report: para. 153.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The third issue considered by the master was whether the article 8 claims that she had held were not barred by privilege were ones that should nonetheless be struck out as having no real prospect of success. She held that it was a matter for evidence whether the decision of the Secretary of State to appoint a non-statutory inquiry and the procedures followed by Ms Wass caused sufficiently grave harm to the claimants’ professional reputations to justify an article 8 claim independently of the content of the Report.  She said that she did not know at the strike out stage whether there was evidence that the process itself caused harm “along the way”.  She therefore declined to strike the claims out as against either the FCO or Ms Wass. She granted permission to appeal on the Parliamentary privilege issue and on the issue of Ms Wass’ status.  She also directed that any appeal should lie directly to the Court of Appeal pursuant to CPR 52.23 in view of the constitutional significance of the questions arising and the senior level of many of the judicial authorities she cited.  </p>

This was necessary because the parties could not agree about what parts of the claims could still be pursued and what parts were barred. The FCO and Ms Wass argued that the effect of the Main Judgment was in reality that there were no claims left: the whole basis of the claims depended on the content of the Report.  The master held that that was wrong. There were clearly some complaints made, such as about the way the interview sessions were conducted during the Inquiry, that related to matters arising before the publication of the Report. As to whether there was any pleading of loss that could be said not to arise from the publication of the Report, she said that there was. There was a pleaded case that the breach of article 8 had led to the loss of a chance to change the content of the Report so that it avoided the harm to the Claimants’ professional standing, a chance they would have had if the Inquiry had been properly conducted.    </p>

The Strasbourg Court has considered the compatibility of Parliamentary privilege with article 6 on a number of occasions. In <span style="font-style:italic">Zollmann v United Kingdom</span> App. No. 62902/00 [2003] ECHR 731 the applicants were diamond merchants who were accused of having broken sanctions prohibiting the importation into the United Kingdom of diamonds from Angola. The accusation came in the form of a statement made in the House of Commons by the then Minister of State at the FCO responsible for Africa. The accusation was published in Hansard and was available on Parliament’s website. The press reported the matter including the applicants’ names. They complained of a breach of their rights under article 6 ECHR because they were unable to sue the minister for defamation. They also complained under article 8 ECHR that the accusation attacked their reputation and was defamatory and a breach of their right to respect for their private life.  The Zollmanns’ action was declared inadmissible.  The Strasbourg Court referred to the earlier case of <span style="font-style:italic">A v United Kingdom </span>App. No. 35373/97 [2002] ECHR 811 in which the Court had said it was satisfied that the immunity given to statements made by members of Parliament in the House of Commons pursued the legitimate aims of protecting free speech in Parliament and maintaining the separation of powers between the legislature and the judiciary. Most if not all Contracting States had in place some form of immunity for members of their national legislatures. The constitutions of the Council of Europe and the European Parliament also conferred privileges and immunities on their members. This could not therefore be regarded as imposing a disproportionate restriction on the right of access to courts. In <span style="font-style:italic">Zollmann </span>the Strasbourg Court quoted from the Parliamentary Select Committee on Procedure describing the wide range of avenues which can be pursued by an aggrieved person who wishes to correct or rebut remarks made about him in the House. The applicants complained that because they were not British citizens they were unable to seek redress through these avenues.  The Court said:  </p>

However, they remain relevant to the overall proportionality of the system and the balance between the competing interests.” </p>

That case arose from the prosecution of an Italian senator for insulting a prosecutor at the Palmi public prosecutor’s office by sending him sarcastic letters and gifts of children’s toys. The Italian Senate approved a resolution that declared that the acts of which the senator was accused were covered by the immunity provided for in article 68 para 1 of the Italian Constitution. Article 68 provided that “Members of Parliament shall not be required to account for the opinions they express or the votes they cast in the exercise of their functions”. The Italian District Court dismissed the action saying that the senator had no case to answer.  It observed that it was for the Senate, whose resolutions were not subject to review by the courts, to determine whether the conditions set out in article 68 were met.  The Strasbourg Court had little difficulty in deciding that there had been an interference with the applicant’s right of access to a court under article 6 ECHR. The Court went on:  </p>

That case concerned the publication of the report of two inspectors appointed to investigate the circumstances surrounding the acquisition by the Fayed brothers of the House of Fraser group in 1985. The appointment was made under the Companies Act 1985.  The report was highly critical of the Fayed brothers who claimed that it had seriously damaged their personal and commercial reputations.  It was common ground that as a matter of domestic law, any proceedings in defamation against the inspectors or the Secretary of State would be defeated by a claim of absolute or qualified privilege. The Strasbourg Court held that article 6 was not engaged because the report did not make a legal determination of the applicants’ criminal or civil liability. It went on to consider whether the limitation on the applicants’ ability to initiate legal proceedings to challenge the findings and conclusions of the report struck a fair balance between the general interests of the community and the protection of the applicants’ fundamental rights. At [69] the court described the underlying aim of the system of investigation and reporting under the Companies Act 1985 as clearly in the furtherance of the public interest. They cited the statement of Lord Denning MR in <span style="font-style:italic">Re Pergamon Press Ltd </span>[1971] 1 Ch 388, 400C that “Inspectors should make their report with courage and frankness, keeping nothing back.

It is in the first place for the national authorities to determine the extent to which the individual’s interest in full protection of his or her reputation should yield to the requirements of the community’s interest in the independent investigation of the affairs of large public companies. The applicants’ argument would amount to reading into Article 6(1) an entitlement to have a report such as the one in the present case not published until after a full judicial hearing repeating, doubtless over a longer time-scale, the same fact-finding exercise as that already carried out by the Inspectors. Such an entitlement could effectively destroy the utility of informing the public of the results of the administrative investigations provided for under section 434(2) of the Companies Act 1985. Having found the aim of not only making but also publishing the Inspectors’ reports to be legitimate, the Court cannot apply the test of proportionality in such a way as to render publication impracticable.”  </p>

This is an historic method used by Parliament for obtaining papers, reports or information from departments and other non-parliamentary bodies. The papers sought must be of a public and official character and not private or confidential. The paper or information sought is therefore “returned” to Parliament by the individual or body concerned. This means that although the Minister initiates the process by which the House resolves to call for the papers, he or she is also on the receiving end of that resolution as the person who is required to return the papers to the House.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The practice of using Returns to call for information from (in particular) departmental committees was frequently used until about the mid-nineteenth century. In the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries Returns could be put in the hands of members only by printing, and it became virtually automatic for the Houses to order the printing of any Return made to them. This culminated in a resolution of the House of Commons in 1836 that an order to print normally meant an order to publish. The purpose of this resolution was to make any papers and reports which were printed for the use of members also accessible to the public. The Returns procedure is used routinely as the means whereby certain annual information is provided to the House. However, it is also used non-routinely as a means whereby a minister can move for the production of a document, for example, a report of an inquiry into some matter of public concern.  In the <span style="font-style:italic">Public Law </span>article, Prof Leopold describes the increased use of the Returns procedure for controversial reports which contain criticism of individuals: (footnotes omitted): </p>

However, many of the reports published in this way have contained criticisms of individuals. In the 1950s and 1960s, there is very little evidence of the use of the Return procedure for the production of controversial documents. In the next two decades there was an increase in the number of occasions upon which the Return procedure was used for the production of documents. In the 1970s, in respect of about 10 of the reports published by the Return procedure, it would appear that there was some potential risk of legal action had they not been published in a way that ensured the protection of the 1840 Act. In the 1980s, probably six fell into this category. In both decades the greatest use of the procedure was by the Home Secretary, in two broad areas, namely prisons and the police. The reports on these areas were invariably critical of individuals and their work methods. Other examples were reports into a mental hospital, a fatal accident on the falsework for a new bridge, the Crown Agents affair, the smallpox outbreak in Birmingham, and the departmental handling of matters relating to Barlow Clowes. In several of these reports alterations had been made to minimise the risk of an individual thinking himself defamed without legal redress.” </p>

It is the Journal Office’s responsibility to check the authority relied on when someone seeks to lay a document before the House. Each paper must be accompanied by a covering letter which states, amongst other things, the name of the minister formally laying the document. The guidance issued by the Journal Office states that the purpose of laying a paper before the House is to make the information contained in the document available to the House and its members.  A paper is considered to be formally laid before the House when a copy of it is accepted by the Journal Office at which point members may come to the Journal Office to look at the document. Once a paper has been laid before the House, it will appear in the Appendix to the Votes and Proceedings published overnight at the end of each sitting day and available online. “Votes and Proceedings” is the formal legal record of what happens in the House of Commons. According to a ruling of the Speaker, hard copies of the document are then made available to members in the Vote Office. The guidance of the Journal Office states that there should not be a long delay between laying and making the document publicly available. A paper cannot be laid when the House is not sitting.  </p>

Under section 24 of that Act the chairman of an inquiry must deliver a report to the relevant minister setting out the facts determined by the panel and their recommendations.  The minister is under a duty pursuant to section 25 to arrange for the report to be published unless he has arranged for the chairman to be responsible for publication.  Whether it is the minister or the chairman who is under a duty to publish, the report must be laid by the minister before Parliament: section 26.  Section 27 deals with immunity from suit of, amongst others, members of the inquiry panel but it is expressly limited by subsection (2) to acts done or omissions made during the course of the inquiry.  The purpose of the immunity is to protect the inquiry in the public interest from legal action.   </p>

Ms Salimi submits that a motion for an Unopposed Return for the publication of a report is a proceeding in Parliament because it should be regarded as a time-saving substitute for speaking. If the minister were to stand up and read out the Report, or the parts of it that he or she wished to put in the public domain, that would unquestionably be a proceeding protected by article 9. The moving of the motion for the Report to be laid before Parliament is an alternative means of achieving the same aim.  The fact that the motion is by convention unopposed does not affect this. It is one of many instances of proceedings recorded in the Votes and Proceedings of the House where in fact no discussion or debate has taken place, such as the first readings of bills received from the House of Lords. In many cases these are also instances where the House has adopted procedures which save time on the floor of the House either because the matter is uncontroversial or because the opportunity for scrutiny and endorsement is provided elsewhere, such as in committees. Those matters form part of proceedings in Parliament even though they are not part of speech or debate in the Chamber.  </p>

Here, that person is the minister.  The information that the House resolved that it wanted to know was the outcome of the Inquiry which had been announced to the House in 2014. The subject matter of the Report, setting out the conclusion of an investigation into allegations that the FCO and DFID had colluded with the police and Government of St Helena to cover up widespread child sex abuse, was of great public concern.  </p>

The provision of the Report to Parliament was an essential part of that process.  That accountability continued after the publication of the Report. On 7 July 2016 the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the FCO reported to the House that a UK Government special representative had been appointed and was working with the St Helena and Ascension Island Government to implement the recommendations of the Report.  The special representative’s report would also be published on the Government’s website.  The Minister told the House:  </p>

The Report might well in those circumstances have contained allegations of criminal conduct against a number of people and would have prompted criminal investigations.  Members of both Houses would have been fully involved in considering what needed to be done to put things right and in monitoring the actions taken by the FCO and DFID to implement any recommendations of the Report.   </p>

It is the business of keeping Members informed of the important work being carried out within Government departments so that they can hold those departments to account. We cannot accept the claimants’ characterisation of the procedure as a “device” or a “magic trick”.  Although it is not a legislative action, it is a collective action of the House and not an action of the executive. Further, we do not read the concerns expressed in the 1999 report of the Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege as recommending a different answer in this case.  The conclusions recognise (para. 349) the useful purpose of the Unopposed Return procedure and accepted that some of the papers laid, such as the annual reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General “should not be inhibited by the risk of actions for defamation”. Its criticism was reserved for papers where it was hard to see any such risk.  The touchstone suggested by the Joint Committee (but not enacted) was that absolute protection should be confined to those areas which need this immunity if Parliament is to be effective. In our judgment, the publication of the Report falls well within that area. </p>

In our view, the contrary is true; it is by the mechanism of the Unopposed Return that the House ensures that the contents of the Report can become visible to Members and to anyone who wishes to read them.  The ability of Parliament to publish information it has called for and which is of interest to members, and hence also to the public, without the risk of exposing the authors of that information to litigation is an important freedom and part of what Lord Phillips referred to in <span style="font-style:italic">Chaytor </span>as the House’s ‘deliberative business’.  </p>

We do not accept the claimants’ submission that the Strasbourg Court regarded Parliamentary privilege as legitimate only in so far as it protected free speech in the context of the debate on the floor of the House.  That was the context in which the disputes in <span style="font-style:italic">Zollmann </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">A v UK </span>arose, but the court in <span style="font-style:italic">Cordova </span>did not find an infringement simply on the basis that the senator’s conduct was something other than speaking in a debate in the Senate.  The primary legitimate aim pursued by the invocation of privilege in this case is the same aim as the court identified in the <span style="font-style:italic">Fayed </span>case: an ability to produce a report on an investigation that provides a frank and detailed assessment of the actual or alleged failings of institutions or people acting in the public sphere.  The Claimants are by no means the only people criticised by the Report; it makes uncomfortable reading for many others including a former Governor of the Island and the authors of a report on child safeguarding commissioned in 2012, described by the Inquiry as “heavily biased”.  Again, one can imagine that if the allegations the Inquiry was investigating had turned out to be true there would have been many more people adversely affected by the outcome.  Inquiries of this kind are an important means by which matters of public concern can be investigated and the results made public.  That process would be hindered if those criticised were able to bring proceedings for defamation or for breach of their ECHR rights and seek to reargue aspects of the investigation in the courts.  It would also make it more difficult to persuade suitably qualified people to accept appointment to conduct such inquiries.  Although, as in this case, the panel members may be given a financial indemnity by the appointing department against any liability, the possibility of many years of litigation following the inquiry would be a powerful disincentive for undertaking this form of public service. On this point too, the analysis of the Strasbourg Court in the <span style="font-style:italic">Fayed </span>case supports our conclusion because any entitlement of the Fayed brothers to bring legal proceedings “could effectively destroy the utility of informing the public of the results of the administrative investigations”.  </p>

In the present case, the Report was published in redacted form with substantial passages provided by the Inquiry to the FCO blanked out. Of course, the Report itself anonymised the children and vulnerable adults involved but the redactions from the published version went further.

We do not agree. If procedural concerns arise during an inquiry such as this, then the right course is for those concerns to be the subject of an application for judicial review. Such an application should be made promptly, so as to ensure that, if an inquiry is going off the rails procedurally, it can be righted by the timely intervention of the court. That has the additional advantage of resolving the problem before the conclusion of the inquiry itself. This recognises the reality that, absent such a judicial review application, once an inquiry of this kind has been concluded, it may realistically be too late to mount an effective challenge to its conclusions.  </p>

As it observed in <span style="font-style:italic">Denizci v Cyprus </span>2, Reports of Judgments and Decisions, 2001V, p. 225, para 315, "the court is acutely aware of its own shortcomings as a first instance tribunal of fact". The court referred in that connection to problems of language, to an inevitable lack of detailed and direct familiarity with the local conditions, and to its inability to compel the attendance of witnesses (or, it might have added, to secure the production of evidence). In consequence, it is often dependent upon the information and arguments put before it by the parties. If they conflict, rather than resolving the conflict it may say that it declines to speculate, or it may award damages for a loss of opportunity rather than undertaking a more definite assessment of the harm suffered. If, on the other hand, the material placed before it by the parties enables it to proceed upon a more detailed basis, it will do so. That will be the case, in particular, where the relevant facts have been found by the national court. To the extent that domestic courts, applying their ordinary rules of evidence and procedure, are able to resolve disputed issues of fact in circumstances in which the European court would not, and are therefore able to proceed upon the basis of proven facts in situations in which the European court could not, their decisions in relation to the award of damages under section 8 of the 1998 Act may consequently have a different factual basis from that which the European court would have adopted.” </p>

First, and in contradistinction to a statutory inquiry, she had no statutory powers.  Secondly, she was paid her day rate as a barrister and undertook other professional work whilst conducting the Inquiry.

It is in respect of organisations of this nature that the government is answerable under the European Convention on Human Rights. Hence, under the Human Rights Act a body of this nature is required to act compatibly with Convention rights in everything it does. The most obvious examples are government departments, local authorities, the police and the armed forces. Behind the instinctive classification of these organisations as bodies whose nature is governmental lie factors such as the possession of special powers, democratic accountability, public funding in whole or in part, an obligation to act only in the public interest, and a statutory constitution: see the valuable article by Professor Dawn Oliver, 'The Frontiers of the State: Public Authorities and Public Functions under the Human Rights Act', [2000] PL 476.” </p>

It might have been established under the Inquiries Act 2005 but, as has been the case with other inquiries, was not clothed with statutory powers  (another example of a non-statutory inquiry into matters of serious public concern was that established to investigate the convictions of the Guildford Four and the Maguire Family chaired by Sir John May (1990 Cmd 556 and 1994 Cmd 449)).  The announcement of the Inquiry included an assurance from the Minister that all relevant papers would be made available to the Inquiry.  Ms Wass’s inquiry was funded by the FCO and was provided with a secretariat (solicitor and administrative support).  Its establishment was announced in Parliament and its very detailed terms of reference were made available in the library of the House of Commons.

Ms Wass and her team were performing a function on behalf of the Government in the public interest to establish the truth about worrying allegations and make a public report.
